          <p>Okay. Thank you, Vijay, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to discuss our 2009 fourth quarter results. Before I start, I just would like to remind you that as usual, the percentage change discussed during this call are both organic and normalized in nature.</p>
          <p>Normalized figures refers to performance measures before special items. Special items are either income or expense, which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the company. As normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, we disclose our consolidated net income, EPS, EBIT and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>I'll start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter and then Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with further review of the results in Brazil, HILA-Ex, Quinsa, and Canada. I'll close by providing some more specifics regarding the fourth quarter financials.</p>
          <p>Turning to the results. During the fourth quarter, our consolidated EBITDA was close to R$3 billion, which represents a 9.1% organic increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Our EBITDA for the full year reached close to R$10.4 billion, which represents an organic increase of 12.3% versus last year, while our margin expanded 50 basis points to 44.7%.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of variable compensation accruals during the year, EBITDA grew 16.5% and margins by 220 basis points year-over-year. Our Brazil EBITDA increased by 11% in the quarter, supported by a 11.6 volume growth and by a 5.9% revenue per hectoliter growth, with EBITDA margin decreasing by 310 basis points to 47.6%, driven by greater marketing investments to support our brands and our innovations, as well as by higher accruals for variable compensation in the periods as we had mentioned in our previous calls. Our 2009 Brazil EBITDA increased by 12.2% in organic terms and our EBITDA margin remained flat at 48.8%. Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with more details of the key drivers in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>In HILA-Ex, we delivered a negative EBITDA of R$21.6 million in the quarter and registered organic growth of R$17.8 million versus last year.</p>
          <p>For the full year, HILA-Ex EBITDA was negative R$58.4 million, reported an organic increase of 44.3 million as a result of improvement in our top-line and cost structure, despite the weak industry in most of the country where we operate.</p>
          <p>Our Quinsa operations have once again delivered strong results, with EBITDA growing 13.3% during the quarter, despite volume decline across the region in the period. For the full year, Quinsa grew EBITDA by 21.4% in spite of continued weak industry and negative volumes for the year.</p>
          <p>In Canada, volumes declined by 5.6% for the quarter and by 1.2% in the year. Our EBITDA declined by 11.1% in the quarter and remained almost flat for the full year, with margins declining 350 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively. Canada had a tough year due to domestic industry decline, market share loss, higher variable cost, and higher sales and admin expenses due to one-time expense.</p>
          <p>Normalized net income reached R$1.8 billion in the quarter, which was 2.6% higher than last year and was close to R$5.8 billion for the full year with a 11.8% growth. Normalized EPS increased by 2.2% in the quarter and by 11.4% for the full year. I'll comment further on net income at the end of this call.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand it over to Jo&#xE3;o, as we start to look a little deeper into the results of each of our operations. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nelson. Good morning. Good afternoon to everyone. Let me start by discussing our consolidated performance for the quarter and the whole year. During the fourth quarter, our normalized consolidated EBITDA totaled three billion, which represents a 9.1 organic increase.</p>
          <p>Industry performance across the market remained unchanged from last quarter trends, and consolidated volumes delivered solid growth of 6.1% in the period, and this was mainly driven once again by our Brazilian operation. We were able to deliver on our goals of growing both EBITDA and operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>Our 2009 EBITDA reached 10.4 billion, which represent an organic of 12.3% year-over-year while we delivered cash flow operations of 8.7 billion, which is a 23.7 increase versus 2008. These results were driven by innovation and productivity, which I have said since the beginning of the year would be our areas of focus in a very challenging year for our industry in several markets.</p>
          <p>Now, talking a little bit more about Brazil. The positive macroeconomic environment continues to support the good performance of our industry here, and our focus on innovations continued to deliver very good results in terms of market share. Our normalized Brazil EBITDA for 2009 increased organically by 12.2%, with flat margins despite higher accruals for variable compensation, as we mentioned in all our previous calls, negatively impacting our year-over-year growth.</p>
          <p>Excluding our accruals for variable compensation, our Brazil cash SG&amp;A would have increased 27.7 and 16.5 in the fourth quarter and the full year respectively, while our Brazil EBITDA for the same period would have increased 16.4% and 17%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Moving to Brazil, the positive trend in the market continues as a result of two main factors: the first is a better-than-expected macroeconomic scenario, where disposable income and employment levels continue to improve. The second factor is weather, which despite a lot of rain in the fourth quarter, we were a few points of degrees hotter in general, about close to one point, and in cities like Rio and S&#xE3;o Paulo, we had above two points and above one point of Celsius degrees hotter in those two cities.</p>
          <p>We have taken advantage of this improvement scenario as we continue to seriously invest behind our brands and behind innovations we introduce in the marketplace to satisfy our consumer needs. Having said that, Brazil beer volumes grew 12.1% in the quarter and by 9.9% for the full-year 2009. As of December, our market share reached 69.6% and for the quarter, it stood at 70%, which is 206 basis points, 2.6 percentage points higher than last year.</p>
          <p>2009 was an important year for us in terms of market share in Brazil, as we achieved strong results and we did it in the right way, by improving every single brand's health performance indicators.</p>
          <p>Our ability to understand and connect with our consumers in order to satisfy their needs continues to be a fundamental reason in driving the investments behind our brands and to guarantee our medium and long-term growth. Talking about some of the innovations, Antarctica Sub-Zero rollout to other states in Brazil continues to deliver important results, as well as the rollout of our one liter returnable glass bottle to new regions in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In addition, our 269 slim can, Brahma Fresh in the Northeast, our renewed image of Bohemia and Bohemia Oaken, and to a lesser extent, our 300 returnable glass bottle continued to be very important contributors to our results. Our beer net revenues per hectoliter in Brazil increased this quarter 6.1% as a result of a earlier increase in prices before the summer season, when compared to last year.</p>
          <p>For the full-year 2009, we were able to increase our beer net revenues per hectoliter by 2.4 as our price increases during the period were partially offset by tax increases, which were ahead of inflation and to a lesser extent, packaging mix.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about our COGS, Brazil beer COGS per hectoliter was up by 4.8% in the quarter, as we were negatively impacted by higher packaging costs this quarter. However, our COGS per hectoliter for the full year decreased by almost 3% &#x2013; 2.9% as we were able to more than offset general inflation due to better currency and commodities hedge, as well as our productivity initiatives, which were performed throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Beer SG&amp;A excluding D&amp;A &#x2013; depreciation and amortization grew by 40.2% in the period and 26.2 for the whole year as a result of volume growth, general inflation, incremental investments to support our innovations, the impacts of channel mix, as well as the mentioned higher accruals for variable compensation.</p>
          <p>Higher SG&amp;A in the quarter versus the annual average is a specific &#x2013; is explained by a specific marketing and sales investment as we prepared for the summer season.</p>
          <p>Normalized beer business finished the quarter with a growth of 11.5% versus last year and EBITDA margin had declined close to 300 points, 320 points. For the full year, we managed to grow our beer business by 10.9% organically and reached a margin of 48.8%.</p>
          <p>Our soft drinks business in Brazil also performed very well in the period, delivering a 10.3 volume growth in the quarter. For the full year, volumes increased by 8.1 as a result of improved macroeconomic and industry conditions on top of an increase in market share of 70 basis points standing at 17.8 in December '09. Net revenues per hectoliter grew 3.8 organically in the quarter and 3.5 in the year, as we continued to be impacted by price increases in certain regions and as in beer partially offset by higher taxes.</p>
          <p>COGS per hectoliter, contrary to past quarters, increased organically by 3.7 as a result of currency and sugar hedges. For the full year, we managed to reduce our COGS by 3.1 on a per hectoliter basis by means of productivity initiatives, better dollar rates, hedge gains and lower price for non-hedged commodities such as corn and PET.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization increased by 36.1% in the period and 19.8 in the year as a result of general inflation, volume growth, higher accruals for variable compensation and marketing investments.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA continued to grow, increasing by 8.4% in the quarter and reaching 383 million in this quarter, with full-year 2009 organic growth reaching double-digits at 18.6, with a margin expansion of 280 basis points.</p>
          <p>Turning now to HILA-Ex, our volumes this quarter increased by 11%, as a result of very good performance in Peru, Venezuela and Republic of Dominica &#x2013; Dominican Republic.</p>
          <p>For the full year though, volumes decreased by 0.4% as a result of the weak industry performance in most of the country we operate. Despite these conditions, we've reached our highest market share in the Dominican Republic; meanwhile in Venezuela, the re-launch of Zulia was an important step to improve our market share and our profitability in the country. And finally in Peru, we continued to grow as a result of our focus on brand initiatives and production efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Despite still negative, HILA-Ex EBITDA improved by 17, almost 18 million in this quarter and by 44.3 million for the full year, as our teams in HILA-Ex continued to make important progress toward our long-term growth in each country across the region.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to Quinsa, in our operations in the south of Latin America, we've been able to maintain a double-digit EBITDA growth in the quarter in spite of the industry contractions observed throughout the region. Our volumes also suffered due to poor weather conditions and tough comparables with 2008. We overcame our volume's difficult comps with revenue management initiatives, cost discipline, and strong support to our mainstream brands.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we strengthened our Quilmes brand leadership through strong communication and innovation. We have also refreshed Pace&#xF1;a's image in Bolivia and Pilsen's in Paraguay. Bringing brands in Paraguay to our portfolio has also proven to be a very important source of revenue as we reposition the brand to the premium segment.</p>
          <p>We achieved an EBITDA growth of 13.3% and a margin expansion of 110 basis points. Both our quarter and year-to-date figures represent all-time records in terms of EBITDA and EBITDA margin.</p>
          <p>That said, we faced an industry decline all over the region. This quarter, our volumes were down 6.5%, with Argentina soft drinks operation suffering most of the industry contraction. We also implemented some revenue initiatives by the end of the year aimed at improving our margins in the future that virtually affected our December volumes.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter grew organically both in beer and soft drinks, as a result of price increase introduced in line with inflation and focused initiatives in terms of trade spend and revenue management. We are also successful exploiting the premium moment within the Quinsa countries. Stella Artois keeps gaining share and preference in the region, positively affecting our overall margins and helping to develop the category.</p>
          <p>Further, our efforts to reduce costs and expenses compensated the negative impact of higher labor and transportation costs. We are benefiting from lower prices in some commodities such as PET preform, plastic caps, and aluminum cans; also effective currency hedges and the continued search for savings through CBB and other best practices implemented.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are already achieving important synergies in Bolivia with the Pepsi franchise acquisition. Finally, even though the recession within the region continues to affect our volumes during the quarter, our team is successfully protecting our business through top line maximization and cost rationalization. The challenge for the next year remains tough; however, we are confident on the strength of our team and our grants in order to continue growing in a profitable way.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Canada, as we anticipated in our last call, the fourth quarter was a tough quarter for Labatt, as a result of a more difficult competitive environment in higher market share COGS versus the fourth quarter in 2008. Accordingly, the fourth quarter was characterized by, one, a decline in beer industry volume; two, a significant compare activity across Canada; and third, higher investments behind our brands, which resulted in a 11.1 decline in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Labatt lost 1.2% of market share in the quarter, driven by the decline of our core segment brands, Labatt Blue and Kokanee, which have continued to suffer as a result of the continued growth of the super premium in the core light segments, along with decreased promotional activity in the mainstream brands.</p>
          <p>Market share loss combined with a 1.9 industry decline result in a volume drop of 5.6 in the quarter versus the previous years &#x2013; over the previous year. Total volume in 2009 declined by 1.2 as the industry also contracted by 0.3 and our market share was 40 basis points lower year-over-year. Despite difficult market share conditions and following the growth seen in the core light segment, we still managed to meet our consumer needs as we continued to grow Bud Light faster than any other major brand in the country; also Bud Light Lime was our most successful launch since the introduction of the twist off-cap 20 years ago. Also, our local premium brand, Alexander Keith, was re-launched to compete more effectively against the growing craft segment.</p>
          <p>The import segment declined due to the recession, but Stella Artois's share of the segment remains stable and holding prices, which is not true for our competitors and continues to improve its brand health indicators. We were able to maintain our net revenues per hectoliter growth ahead of inflation, boosting an increase of 3.1 in the quarter and of 3.5 for the year. This result was supported by volume growth in the super-premium segment, resulting from the launch of Bud Light Lime and the price increases taken in the course of 2009.</p>
          <p>COGS per hectoliter in the quarter increased by 4.6% versus last year, decelerating from prior periods' growth rate. Most of this increase is explained by a higher depreciation resulting from a one-time fixed asset adjustment. Our cash COGS per hectoliter remained nearly flat to last year, as a result of internal production efficiencies. COGS per hectoliter for the full year increased by 7.6 as a result of higher import cost, higher aluminum and dollar hedge rates as well as the high industrial depreciation.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A excluding depreciation was up by 11.5% in the quarter and stayed almost flat for the full-year 2009. The increase in the quarter is explained by the phasing of some sales and marketing investment and some one-time expenses, while for the full year we were able to fund these investments with internal production and administrative efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Overall, EBITDA declined, as I said, 11.1% in the quarter and remained almost flat for the full year. Excluding gains from a one-time sale of assets in 2008, Labatt organic EBITDA grew &#x2013; growth was 2.4 versus last year.</p>
          <p>Despite the adverse market conditions, we are definitely not satisfied with the share loss experienced in the second half of the year. As we look into 2010, we are determined to resume our growth back in a profitable way. We have confidence in the strength of our Canadian team, in the commercial plans as well as the cost management initiatives we have in place for achieving our two priorities of regaining some market share and maintaining the profitability.</p>
          <p>Going back to the overall in that business, I wanted to wrap up by saying, I'm pleased with our performance this year. Our normalized EBITDA continues to grow in double-digits at 12.3 in a year of a significant increase in taxes in Brazil and during which most of our countries face industry decline versus last year.</p>
          <p>We have achieved these results following and according to our cost-connect-win approach, which is the language we speak and practice. We focus on maintaining world-class efficiency, which drives every part of our production, supply, planning, sales cycle, and which helps in turn non-working money into working money. By realizing these savings, we have been able to invest more in connecting with consumers and winning the preference among the marketplace in a profitable way. All these achievements are the result of the commitment and the quality of our people, who are our main assets and who have constant drive to overperform the industry with outstanding execution, despite challenge conditions in many of the markets where we operate.</p>
          <p>Our results in 2009 show we are on the right direction. So looking towards 2010, our priorities do not differ much from 2009. Productivity and innovation will remain on top of the list as we strongly believe both are key to guarantee our growth and our profitability in the medium and in the long-term.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to go back to Nelson.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o. In this final session, I would like to guide you through the main lines between the normalized EBIT of R$2.658 billion and the net income of R$4.8 billion as disclosed on page three of our press release.</p>
          <p>Our net financial expense reached R$165 million, which is 50.2% lower than last year. This is explained by lower net interest expense, as a result mainly of the retirement of certain debt that matured during the year and was not renewed, which were offset by losses on derivative instruments which relate to the results of our ongoing hedging policy.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate in the period was 29.1% compared to 19.9% last year. The main reason for this increase are some hedge expense that are non-deductible, higher deferred tax liabilities, plus a higher earning before tax, which is taxable at the full nominal rate. Our full-year 2009 effective tax rate was 26.9 compared to 21.8% last year.</p>
          <p>Our operating cash flow generation in the fourth quarter reached R$3.3 billion, which is around 14.2% better than fourth quarter of 2008. For 2009, we generated R$8.7 billion in cash from operations, a 23.6% increase versus 2008. And we were able to achieve all that while growing our profitability to invest in our brands and innovations, as evidenced by our market share and brand health indicators in our key markets.</p>
          <p>Our net debt decreased to R$3.2 billion at the end of December compared to R$7.4 billion at the end of December 2008, as we decided not to refinance that given market conditions early in the year. During the fourth quarter, we paid R$1.8 billion in dividends and R$0.5 billion in interest on own capital. That said, our total payout for 2009 reached a total of R$3.6 billion, which is about 20% higher than the 2008 levels.</p>
          <p>Finally, we'll continue to pursue opportunities to improve our working capital while investing to increase capacity and meet demands. Per the announcement we made this month, CapEx for Brazil should reach between 1.3 to R$1.5 billion and in the absence of any additional tax burden to respond to potential further industry growth during 2010, these investments may reach up to R$2 billion.</p>
          <p>I will now hand back to the operator and open up for questions. Please, Vijay.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Lauren Torres from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, everyone. Actually I have two questions, first question is on CapEx guidance. I know you've mentioned that increased investment is basically focused on increases in production capacity, just curious if that is solely where the increase is coming from, are there &#x2013; were there something else behind that number? And then secondly, just a further clarification on how we should think about your cost and expenses this year. I know last year, COGS per hectoliter were below inflation and you had some unusual items impacting your operating expenses. So basically for this year, should we expect a reverse where some of your cost pressures will be a bit higher, but some of the unusual operating expense items will go away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Hi Laura, this is Nelson. Well, let me pick up your question. First, with regards to the CapEx guidance, I mean what we have been basically saying is that the good momentum that we see here, especially in Brazil, in terms of our industry volume growth, which is primarily due to positive macroeconomics, particularly disposable income growth in real terms. We see this as a positive continued strength.</p>
          <p>So when we started to prepare for 2010 in terms of our CapEx budget, we started with a number that was around R$1.3 billion and as we moved in the whole process, right now, considering that the industry may grow even further in the absence of another &#x2013; or any tax burden increase, let's say, if excise for instance stay at the level where they are and also all the other elements that drive the industry growth, we do believe that we may need to invest up to R$2 billion to meet demand.</p>
          <p>This investment is &#x2013; of course, the two billion is not only on &#x2013; is a CapEx is not only on a CapEx increase. So we'll be investing in lines, we'll build new plants, but also hedge investing new bottles, coolers, all that come together is the consequence of the volume increase. But the bulk of the incremental investment is on capacity, and we're really planning to have at least three new plants up and running by the second half of this year that we can definitely prepare for the volume expectation for next summer, and this investment will be done across the country, so in different regions. <mark type="inaudible" /> was driving this &#x2013; was behind the guidance that we are giving so far.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cost of goods sold and that expense, indeed we have different trends for 2010. So I would split in terms of our COGS but actually it's right in 2009 were really possibly impacted by both forward currency hedge and also the commodities hedges for the ones we can hedge. And also for the non-hedgeable commodities, like PET and corn that we saw a positive trend, a deceleration, a decrease versus 2008, which &#x2013; especially for the first three quarters of the year, led us to even a negative. So a decline on our COGS, perhaps a little year-over-year for 2010, primarily because of the hedge rate that's already fixed for this year. We should have an impact which is going to make &#x2013; is going to lead to an increase in our COGS per hectoliter. So we had fixed our dollar rate for 2010 around 1.99 versus the implied 1.88 we had in 2009. So this is going to put a little bit of a pressure in our COGS, perhaps a little in 2010.</p>
          <p>Commodities should continue to help us in the sense we're going to have better rates or better prices than what we had in 2009, with the exception of sugar. Sugar is going to really put pressure on our CSD COGS, and we even indicated &#x2013; anticipated this stage that it would put pressure on our &#x2013; on the business margin &#x2013; or could lead to some margin contraction. So let's say, the net impact of higher dollar rates, net of the positive commodities hedge except for sugar, and also the continued search for better &#x2013; higher productivity, better efficiency and so on, also with the positive impact of our volume growth diluting the future costs, and we do expect COGS to grow, mainly because of the dollar rate, as I said. But grow at the rate that is close to our, let's say, long-term goal of growing at or below inflation. That's what we can expect for 2010 at this stage.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, at the SG&amp;A level, we will have easier comps, if you will, in terms of our variable compensation, which was a very tough comps this year, and in the cost of 2009 versus the previous year. And we should kind of go back to that average that we used to talk, about that equation about our SG&amp;A growing in line with inflation, plus some increased linkage with their volume growth or the turnover growth, plus one or two points &#x2013; additional points that can depend on the evolution of our direct distribution mix, channel mix, and so on.</p>
          <p>But again, as we have already insisted in previous calls, we'll not be bound by any limitation related to these algorithms. So the point is, if you have &#x2013; if we have and we see good ideas that have important, innovation approach that you want to invest behind, we'll do it, of course, always looking at the bottom line.</p>
          <p>So the top-line growth more than pay off the additional investment, and I think it's important to emphasize, given the World Cup and other activities planned for 2010, we should face a little bit of a tough comp, especially in the first semester. So SG&amp;A, especially with regard to marketing and sales investments, we should have a little bit of a tough comp, but overall, I can &#x2013; we can also anticipate opposite from the COGS, perhaps a better outlook, can anticipate the SG&amp;A growing at a lower level in 2010, mainly because of the situation we had in 2009, in terms of variable compensation.</p>

          <p>And if I can just quickly follow-up on your comment with respect to consumer demand, and how volume trends have worked well for you over the last year, and how we think about that for this year, do you think we'll see comparable growth rates, be it for the industry or for you in Brazil, particularly in beer this year?</p>

          <p>Hi, Lauren, this is Jo&#xE3;o. I think &#x2013; if I compare the mood of beginning 2010 against 2009, I mean I think we said we started casually pessimistic, moderate pessimistic, and we moved from a moderate optimistic, and that's where we stay. I think if we look at the macroeconomic environment that is in place, it's a better one in terms, of course, GDP growth than it was last year. And in terms of consumption per capita, that is affected by the growth in, let's say, revenue per capita. It's pretty much the same, okay; it's not much higher than what it was last year when we take, for example, the minimal wage increases as well as the food inflation.</p>
          <p>So if there is no new news in terms of food inflation, there is no run on commodity price or something like that, because the revenue on a per capita basis is already there, the minimal wage was already increased in line with last year. So if we take those two macroeconomic indicators, or those three macroeconomic indictors, I would say that their macro is a positive one, along the same lines of 2009, with maybe of course better outlook for the GDP, which not necessarily affect our business. So I would say we continue with this moderate optimistic view, given those macroeconomic indictors.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good day, everybody, and congratulations, Jo&#xE3;o, on the tremendous performance in Brazil. My question has to do with Canada. Could you expand a little bit with respect to the dynamics that you saw in the fourth quarter competitively in Canada, perhaps a little bit on what you're seeing to date? And as you look at trying to take this business back to its prior shares profitably, can you give us a sense of how to do that, and whether or not you see this industry returning over the very short term back to a more rational dynamic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Bob, well, thank you for the comments. Of course, we are not pleased with volumes and the profit declining in the fourth quarter. So we will take the necessary actions to revert this trend. You know that there is some volatility in this marketplace. This year was the worst year in terms of industry that we can remember. This decline was the first decline in a very long time. Therefore, we have to face that. We don't think the sort of decline that we faced in '09 will continue in 2010.</p>
          <p>So we are seeing &#x2013; we have a view that the macro for 2010 should be better than '09, but we haven't seen, let's say, this trend that you saw in the fourth quarter turning around, okay, in terms of either macro or share. So we have a tough job ahead, which is to recover our share on a profitable way, to return to the levels that we were operating in 2008.</p>
          <p>How are we going to do that? I mean it's a little bit of more of the same that maybe we haven't done fully in 2009, which is to use our knowledge in good execution, which is to use our research that is now in place for a couple of years, which is the Thomas Research of continuing to put money behind innovation, such as the Bud Light Lime, such as &#x2013; also as I mentioned in the initial speech about Alexander Keith working in the craft segment, not to forget the potential of also Bud Light.</p>
          <p>So we are going to have to find the means internally which were actually not there. I mean the cost of goods sold were really not good or poor, given different situations. So we didn't really have a lot of place to fund an initiative, which I don't think will be the case in 2010. So we are going to have to fund the initiatives from within, and I think we do have the combination of a good execution in the sales area, as well as a good pipeline of innovations to put in the marketplace. So that combination of innovation execution, as well as bringing some more money from within, that I cannot go into a lot of details, will help us having the means to invest behind the good ideas that I do &#x2013; I know we do have in the pipeline to revert the situation of especially the last couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And if I could just one other question, and that is, in the fourth quarter, it appeared to us anyway that one of the reasons why you had stepped up the marketing spend was to support the price increases going into year-end. And given the volume and share dynamics, my sense is that you've got to be fairly pleased with that outcome. And I was curious, as you look at pricing in the market right now, what is the outlook for additional adjustments to reference prices, and do you think you're going to have to maintain this level of CapEx irrespective of &#x2013; not CapEx, of marketing support, irrespective of the World Cup to maintain healthier volume performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I assume you shifted gears to Brazil, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm sorry, that was all about Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just checking. It's really a combination, Bob, when you look at the SG&amp;A, I mean, first of all, of course, we are pleased by the results of share that we disclosed, about the results of preference that we don't disclose, and as well about the resulting pricing. I think what we said in the beginning of the year, which continues to hold true, but not necessary at the same level is, if we have the good ideas which I thought we had, and fortunately, I'm given good work, proved right, is if we have good ideas, we would invest behind those good ideas more than the usual. So that I am not totally locked by a specific way of operating. In the sense, of course, we continue to operate executing good ideas, spending the least possible. But we thought we had very, very good and powerful ideas in hand and we pushed them hard.</p>
          <p>This year, there was a combination of factors, that it probably seemed more than it really is &#x2013; which is the combination of those marketing investments coupled with the bonus accruals that were of course higher than the average as well compared with the year. That was a bad year with no bonus. That combination made our SG&amp;A look, in terms of growth, much higher than the usual, and also much higher than what we expect.</p>
          <p>So I don't think we will need the same sort of growth that we needed during 2009. We also have to remember that given what we did in 2009, we have in a way changed the level of investment in this market, and now we also have somewhat more size and scale and ideas to invest behind them, but I don't foresee that in terms of percentage growth, we'll need to continue with that sort of percentage growth.</p>
          <p>In the first half, of course, the comps will be "difficult" in terms of SG&amp;A because there is a World Cup in the second quarter. So we are investing more heavily in the first and in the second quarter to support what we think will be a very strong World Cup, and we will execute it in manners that we haven't executed in the best way. I also I think we have, let's say, below the line or trade marketing, very important activities for the World Cup, and we will put money behind them. So in terms of quarter-over-quarter, the first and the second will be a little steeper, but not in the levels of growth that you saw necessarily in 2009. But again, if we once again have good ideas, we will continue to execute these ideas on a happy manner.</p>
          <p>I would also say, Bob, that just to take advantage of your question, what we also see in the marketplace, as you know, Brazil is &#x2013; it could be one of the most competitive markets we operate, and where competitors have learned to mimic or to copy what we do in some sort of fast pace. So what we're seeing in this first quarter in Brazil is an enhanced activity, enhanced competitive scenario activity, with competitors stepping up their marketing investments and trying to bring new news in the marketplace in the same way we did in 2009. What I can tell you is, we're not going to sit and wait. We're going to fight to maintain the trend we developed in 2009, but I think it's just a way of saying that 2010 will be a very active and challenging year in that sense.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alan, it's Nelson here. Well, first of all, thanks for your comments. And the use of cash is something that we have been discussing in the course of 2009. I mean, during the calls and what we saw was a clear decline on our financial leverage, in terms of our net debt-to-EBITDA, for instance. Although we don't have a target, any specific target we specifically follow, we always try to maximize the value to our shareholders by means of managing our capital structure in a proactive way. What we can say at this stage, especially considering that in 2009, we had kind of not a typical year. We started with a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the marketplace. We focused on retiring debt in the first semester, and resumed our payout through dividend interest on capital in the course of the year.</p>
          <p>What we can say for 2010 at this stage, first of all, we believe it's too early to provide any specific guidance. The only thing I can talk about is, and by the way, you probably saw &#x2013; we made an announcement last Monday, and we already started to pay out dividends, interest on capital for &#x2013; that will be implied over the 2010 results in the amount of roughly R$1 billion. And at this stage, this is a &#x2013; I mean we can't speculate on any other decision that in the end of the day will be taken by the Board as we move along the year.</p>

          <p>I hear you.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I told you, we have, in a way, a kind of good volumes and strong cash flow generation at this stage, but any allocation in terms of our cash flow, I mean any capital structure decision will be based by the Board first, based on minimum recommendation. But at this stage, we can't announce any decision with regard to capital structure, since it's I mean still to be discussed with the Board.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, good afternoon, and congrats as well on a very strong 2009. I wanted to ask one question in Brazil and one in Quinsa. So I will do it separately. In Brazil, I wonder if you could just address two things. You took the price increase earlier than usual, so I am wondering if you think that your fourth quarter revenue per hectoliter in Brazil, about R$162.5 per hectoliter is a reasonable level for 2010. On one hand, I don't know if you know for sure whether or not your tax increases or you will face federal tax increases this year. I know that's been decided and also I don't know how your mix is going to evolve. So that's one question.</p>
          <p>And then I wonder if you could just expand upon your comments earlier on the sort of change in competitive environment into the beginning of the year, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, Lore. Okay. In terms of pricing, I think what we have to say and maybe completing what I said before is, we have moved prices slightly early than in previous years. The prices are sticking, so I think those are good news. Some of our competitors, such as Itaipava have followed most of our price increases, or others like Schin, not necessarily they have maybe half of what we did, maybe there's more to come, we don't know.</p>
          <p>And FEMSA changed their strategy for some reason and as you've probably seen their results, I mean they were increasing price along beer. And then they declined again in the fourth quarter and haven't really moved price, so I think they are probably debating between the equation of volume share and prices. But maybe given the situation overall in the marketplace, we haven't seen any need to come back in pricing given the current situation. Depending on how they behave with, there could be some changes to that, but I feel somewhat positive to the current scenario.</p>
          <p>What would be therefore, there is no necessarily further need to &#x2013; or a need to decrease the price, then the remaining question is the move on federal taxes. We have been in talks with the government &#x2013; not just us on that, but also as an industry. We have got together with Coke, with Schincariol, with FEMSA and we have made a proposal, we have presented, I'd say, a proposal to the government given that we see a positive situation for everyone where there could be job creation, a major investment from most of the players and the chain, and as well given the volume growth a bigger tax collection. So that combination could be a win-win to both the government and the industry.</p>
          <p>And the counterpart to that is major investment, job creation and the maintenance of the current tax level. If there is a maintenance of the current tax level in the federal tax, the level of the 162 or 161.6, whatever is a feasible one. And just to remember, as we talked in the previous quarters this year that the state taxes continued to grow, okay, which has happened for the past many, many years, moving generally in line with inflation.</p>
          <p>So I think with that sort of information can have a good idea of what's going to happen with price in Brazil. We haven't, let's say, signed any agreement, therefore the federal tax could still move. But it will not move in the first quarter where we are &#x2013; I would say, have a positive view on the second quarter. And if we have something firm from the government's standpoint, we will probably announce as any industry.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, it's probably more them checking whether what we're saying will happen, they always have the right to make a change whenever they want. I think if they see that what we are saying is solid, they will see the benefits of the proposal for everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that helps. And could you just talk a little bit about the change in competitive environment you are seeing in Brazil at the beginning of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The changes &#x2013; the sort of changes that we like in the sense is a fair competition in the marketplace, which is people launching new brands for one thing, people increasing somewhat their share of voice in the short term without, let's say, a decline or a use, a normal use of discounts and promotions, which would have &#x2013; which would mean us needing to change our price policy or price execution in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>That's basically it. So I think Schin has launched a new brand. FEMSA is coming back not with Heineken, much more announcing things than necessarily doing things. Okay? They are launching imports and &#x2013; but this is very, very small. So let's say FEMSA right now is more imports, which &#x2013; it's not a major event. Schin with a new brand and with much more money behind share of voice in general, and Itaipava continuing to grow their share of voice as they have done in the past few years. That's the sort of increased activity that I am referring to. And we have been &#x2013; continued to roll out the innovations of '09 and we have some new good stuff in the pipeline that we &#x2013; some of them are already in the marketplace like the rollout of Sub-Zero in Rio and other things that will come in the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And if I could just move to Canada for a second &#x2013; not Canada, I am sorry, Quinsa for a second. You faced very high SG&amp;A inflations really throughout the year on no volume growth. And I guess that a lot of the margin increases come from tighter COGS and I guess I am not so sure that's going to continue into '10, if some of these hedges roll off, I don't know if that's fair or not. So as you look at Quinsa for 2010, is it fair to think there are some risks that you'll face margin contraction in 2010 or is there someway you can contain that SG&amp;A better if volumes don't come back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, good question. We're not giving really, as you know, guidance in terms of EBITDA margin. What I can tell, which I think it will address somewhat the question is, I think in Quinsa, we'll continue to have very strong brands in terms of both share and preference, which allow us to continue to have our revenue to grow in terms of price at least in line with inflation.</p>
          <p>I think the COGS in terms of volume will be positive at a point in time. When we move to COGS, I think the hedge is in place. If you look at the last 12 months of currencies, it will give you an idea of what sort of changes you may face and I don't think they are troublesome, okay. I think what could be troublesome to a certain extent, which would generally affect more 2011 than 2010 is if there was a major devaluation on the Argentina peso, which as you saw, I mean it basically haven't moved a lot in the past few months, probably below inflation, okay.</p>
          <p>So if you have one of your main drivers of COGS devaluing below inflation, that is pretty helpful, okay. Of course, you already have the hedge in place for '10, I mean the devaluation could just have a major "distraction" in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>And in terms of SG&amp;A management, I think we look at the crisis in the first half. So we were waiting to see how bad the crisis was going to be in the first half of 2010. And we moved back in the second half of 2010 with higher investments in the marketplace. And then I think this year, in Quinsa, we'll have the same objectives that we have in Brazil that &#x2013; which is if we have good ideas, we can increase it more, but otherwise, I would say is business as usual. And the levels of '09 were more than enough as we mentioned to maintain or in some case to gain market share levels. So we are happy with the sort of share levels that we have in Quinsa. So I don't see it at the top of my head of looking at what just happened with the P&amp;L, necessarily margin contractions for no reason.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Trevor Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions please. Both related to phasing. The first one relating to the phasing of COGS across the year, you mentioned that COGS per hectoliter for beer are expected to be in line with inflation across the year. But I presume given the FX hedges, that's likely to be inflation &#x2013; so COGS increases well ahead of inflation in the first half and COGS increases below inflation in the second half.</p>
          <p>And the second thing relating to the phasing of volumes, would it be right in thinking that in the first quarter, you're going to face some headwinds from the poor weather and the timing of Carnival, but then in the second quarter, with the World Cup, that should act as a tailwind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Trevor, this is Nelson here. Well, let me start with your first question about the COGS and you are absolutely right. I mean, there would be an important phasing impact in the course of 2010. So although for the, let's say, full year, we expect to probably be in line with inflation. There would be some pressure in Q1 and Q2 and then we should have a better result, or more favorable results in Q3 and particularly Q4 2010.</p>
          <p>So we are not providing any guidance &#x2013; specific guidance by quarter, but you are right in the sense that, especially Q1 and maybe Q2, we have a tougher comps in terms of COGS, given the hedging strategy. We do have and you know about the curves on commodities and dollar, how they impacted in the recent times Brazilian cost structure. The second question, sorry, Trevor, part of your question was the phasing on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On volumes, that in the first quarter, given the poor weather, there were some headwind from that, there will be headwinds from the Carnival being slightly earlier this year than last year, but then when you get into &#x2013; once you get into Q2, there should be a tailwind coming from the impact of the World Cup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the straight answer to this, Trevor, is in the first half, we grew around seven points, 7% above the year before. In the second half we grew around 12. So of course the &#x2013; and we had much higher share, as I said in the initial comments, 260 basis points in the fourth quarter to be more exact. So we have easier comps in the first half and on top of that, World Cup and tougher comps in the second half where they grew 12, combination of maybe stronger market, but also a much higher share.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, just one question on Labatt and one on Quinsa. Kind of, you mentioned that because of the better COGS outlook, there could be potential for more investment in marketing. Should we then be thinking about EBITDA margins flattish for the year for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, Sean, as I said to that investor, we're really not giving any guidance, any specific on the EBITDA margin. I think with the information we talked about, you can somewhat predict, but not giving anymore details in terms of the sort of increase or decrease of EBITDA margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Shifting over to Quinsa then, you mentioned the potential for volume growth, and obviously we have the easy comps. But are there specific steps that are more top-line specific that you've been taking or looking to take that will help that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no doubt. I think we &#x2013; the crisis was of course much steeper in the Quinsa countries as they were in the HILA-Ex countries than they were in Brazil, and therefore we were &#x2013; we had to be probably more cautious in terms of our marketing investments, sales investments. I have no doubt that as those markets recover and it's still not clear whether this will be a first half, second half type of situation. I mean, I don't think it's totally clear where the world economy is really running although people are more positive, we're not necessarily slow positive, which is going to be &#x2013; first half is going to be tough, second half is going to be much better for sure.</p>
          <p>I think as this recovery comes into place, it will give us the necessary means to continue to over-invest in the marketplace. We have good ideas. Some of them you saw in Brazil working in 2009. We already made a lot of revenue management initiatives, a better control of our trade spend, which gave us the means to continue to invest important amount and heavily on the marketing. But I think the contraction in '09 really didn't help the market overall.</p>
          <p>So I think the potential increase in the marketplace for 2010 that we expect, combined with the innovation pipeline that we will have, will certainly help. I don't want to get into the details of the innovations we're having here, but as the year progress, I'll make sure that we mention some of them here in the conference call.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jos&#xE9; Yord&#xE1;n from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Jo&#xE3;o, and everyone. My question was &#x2013; or one of my questions was answered already. The second one was about, if you can give us an update on all the antitrust cases that you had last year, especially the one about the proprietary bottles and how that might impact your cap expense this year, as well as the ones regarding the loyalty programs, etcetera. How is that progressing and what's &#x2013; and what are the potential liabilities, if any, still attached to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think there really haven't been material developments on any of those subjects to date. Okay? I mean, as you saw, I mean the major news on the T&#xF4; Contigo program was that we had gained the injunction, right, to spot the process. It will be probably a lengthy one before we have any news. Okay? The fine was in July and the overrule of that was about 30 to 40 days after that, so in August &#x2013; so after August, no really new news as both parties are presenting the cases to the judge, this is probably more of a couple of years sort of decision rather than a quick one.</p>
          <p>In terms of the proprietary bottles, we are in "both houses" at their level, and at the CAD level discussing &#x2013; there are two cases, the 630 ml returnable bottle, as well as the one liter bottle. They are in different stages of the process, but again still some time to have a significant news on this. We have a view that this may be judged during 2009, but again this is early &#x2013; I am sorry, during 2010, but we really don't control and I think the best experience that some cases will take months. We haven't had an experience of a few months, but months and then some of them years.</p>
          <p>Since the liter has been less than a year, it's still within the normal time span and the 630, which is a little bit more time, it will more probably be judged during 2010, the liter is yet to be seen. I don't think &#x2013; and well, therefore related to your question of CapEx, right now, we have &#x2013; we're considering that we'll continue to work business as usual with the bottles as before; we are normally investing in our bottles inventory.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, yes, I'm here, sorry about that. I had a follow-up question with respect to your facilities in Chile. I understand that there was some structural damage to your competitor there and I was wondering how your <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's really a tragedy, it's a tough, tough situation unfortunately and from what I read also, about CCU I think both of us &#x2013; neither of us have lost any personnel, any people who have been working as much as we can with the government to help everyone to the extent we can.</p>
          <p>In terms of the business operation, we have a smaller operation, of course, at CCU. Fortunately, we haven't really suffered at all at our plant, which is close to &#x2013; very close to Santiago &#x2013; in the Grande Santiago. Some depots had our warehouses with some breakage, but totally within the expectation. But the whole situation overall &#x2013; we are planning as I understand also CCU that part of the production for the next couple of months, part of it may have to come from imported. So we have the plans in place to continue to use our facility, but as well we're planning exports from &#x2013; if needed from Argentina, if needed from some of the other countries we have in the region to maintain the course of business. Is yet too early to say how this will affect volumes. Therefore, we've been focusing a lot on making sure that the production sites in Chile and the imports from the different countries we have in the region will have the necessary means to supply to that marketplace.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And out of curiosity, is there anyway you can assess what the impact will be to distribution because there is quite a bit of infrastructure damages in distribution center disruptions and looting, I was curious as to the impact it may have had on your distribution infrastructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, the only really issue in terms of distribution is, we have several depots across the countries. The one in the south was damaged, so if you compare that to the overall infrastructure that we have, I would say and given the situation of the country, I would say it's a minor damage to the overall and &#x2013; but we're already working to reestablish that operation there. But it was the only operation that was really affected; it was that operation in the south of the country.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Lore Serra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking the follow-up. I just &#x2013; can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, loud and clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm getting an echo. I just want to go back to Canada for a second. It seems like the competition has got a bit more innovation into '10, maybe than we've seen in the last couple of years. They also say, they of course like the number one beer in Canada, I don't know if you agree with that, I guess having overtaken Bud and they seem to have some effective new advertising behind their core brand. I mean, as you face the beginning of '10, you said it's going to be difficult, but is it really just about pricing, or is it possible that you're playing defense on innovation in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Lore. To be quite honest, never seen any number that has shown that Coors Light is now the number one, so to the extent I know, I don't agree, given that the numbers I am familiar and saw on a monthly manner. In terms of innovation, I think we have probably the &#x2013; as I said in my speech, the best innovation we had in a long time and also the market had seen in the same way, which was Bud Light Lime. We had had and still have very high expectations for that. So I think this year it will be the first full year with Bud Light Lime. So I don't totally agree that we are going to have.</p>
          <p>There were other launches that we had, as we mentioned, with Alexander Keith, which I mean we're seeing more on the craft segment moving and we'll follow that. But again, I think in a way, the crisis took us; therefore, we had much more investments on the second half than in the first half. So I am not saying that the first-half crisis in a way &#x2013; maybe we didn't move as fast enough. But again, we were back in business fully, in case that was the case and I think we're going to combine more investments behind the deals we already started in '09, such as Bud Light Lime, Alexander Keith.</p>
          <p>We also launched another brand, which is called Blue Igloo, so that also helped and we continue to use all the research we have in place to make sure that we do not just invest behind any ideas, but behind the good ones. I think the tough start in the first half driven by the market phasing share evolution will be there, but it should improve in the second half of the year.</p>
