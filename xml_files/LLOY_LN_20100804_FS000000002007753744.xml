      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you for that and hello, everybody, and thank you for joining today's conference call. Now I'm aware that a number of you might have attended or listened into our results presentation this morning. But for the benefit of our U.S. Investors, I will cover all the key issues on this call.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased to be presenting a robust set of results, which demonstrate the underlying momentum we're delivering in our business. And I'll provide details on the key numbers. On top of that, I want to share with you our views of the future shape of the group, which will be supported by our increasing strength in the key disciplines of capital and funding.</p>
          <p>In the first half, we demonstrated that our core business is in good shape, with a strong trading performance against the backdrop of a stabilizing economy. The group delivered resilient revenues, strong cost performance and a significant reduction in impairments. In addition, we've continued to make excellent progress in the integration of HBOS. And all of this has contributed to the acceleration of the group's return to profitability.</p>
          <p>Looking at our business performance in a bit more detail, while we delivered good revenue growth of 5% driven by margin expansion and excellent cost control with expenses down 5%, impairment losses were half of those of the same period last year and much lower than the charges in the second half of 2009, and this is significantly ahead of February guidance. The reductions principally come from our wholesale and retail divisions, but all divisions are showing strong trends.</p>
          <p>It's good to be back in profit of course, and we are pleased with the profit before tax of &#xA3;1.6 billion in the first half, compared to the loss of nearly &#xA3;4 billion last time. Our cost to income ratio significantly increased to 9% driven by benefits of lower risk-weighted assets and the generation of core Tier 1 capital through a number of liability management transactions.</p>
          <p>Looking at our margin, while the net interest margin rose strongly to 2.08%, as higher asset pricing more than offset the impacts of lower deposit margins and the 5% reduction in average interest-earning assets. Asset margins benefited as pricing better reflected the real cost of funding a risk and as funding spreads normalized. In all businesses, the continued return to appropriate pricing for risk and lending duration, together with a more stable LIBOR to base rate spread resulted in a strong increase in net interest margin.</p>
          <p>We continued to see prospects for margin expansion in the future alongside asset pricing gains, slow but steady base rate rises, which will eventually fit into a wider liability margins, and of course, an assumption of stability in wholesale funding markets. And overall, we believe that the margin is likely to return to more than 2.5% by 2014.</p>
          <p>Moving on to costs; well, that's down 5% with strong cost management and integration delivery, and we've seen a continued improvements in customers' efficiency with a further reduction of the group's cost to income ratio by 440 basis points to 43.5%, which is equivalent to 45.1%, if I were to exclude liability management gains.</p>
          <p>We're delighted with progress made on cost synergies and we're firmly on track to deliver &#xA3;2 billion per annum of cost synergies and other operating efficiencies by the end of next year. With further cost savings and integration programs to come through and further improvements and efficiency thereafter, we're working towards operating at a cost to income ratio of about 40% by 2014.</p>
          <p>Now, let me update you on impairments. Well, impairment losses have halved since the first half of last year and materially lower than the charges in the second half of 2009 and as we all know, these reductions are significantly ahead of our February guidance.</p>
          <p>In Retail, impairment losses were materially down, particularly reflecting prudent risk management, stabilizing house prices and the benefit of continued low interest rates. We saw an improvement in credit performance both in the secured and unsecured portfolios and these improvements have come through somewhat quicker than we had expected at the year-end.</p>
          <p>The Wholesale charge for impairment losses also fell significantly to just under &#xA3;3 billion, and the decrease reflects the stabilizing economic environment with particular reductions in commercial real estate losses and a material slowdown in the volume &#x2013; sorry, excuse me, the value and volume of newly impaired loans.</p>
          <p>In Wealth and International, impairment charges were down 15% from the charge in the second half of last year, but the level of losses continues to be dominated by the economic environment in Ireland.</p>
          <p>So, let me just talk briefly about what we are seeing things look like going forwards. Well, we expect to see modest improvement in Retail impairment charges in the second half of 2010 compared to the first half. And next year, and as the U.K. economic environment gradually improves, further improvements will be delivered but at a significantly slower rate than this year.</p>
          <p>In Wholesale, we expect the volume of underlying impairment losses from traditional trading and manufacturing businesses to increase this year, as the full effect of slower economic growth filters into business insolvencies and asset values. However, the effects of this are significantly less than the benefit of lower absolute impairments from the commercial real estate and real estate related portfolios that we saw last year.</p>
          <p>For Wealth and International, we continue to believe that the impairment charge peaked in the second half of last year, although economic conditions continue to be monitored closely. Overall therefore, we expect group impairments to be moderately lower in the second half of this year and  but they will continue to improve thereafter.</p>
          <p>And now let's move on to talk about our balance sheet, the progress made in asset reduction and the strengthening of our capital base. Firstly, then asset reduction. Well, looking at the assets in our banking businesses, we've continued to book good progress on the reductions that we achieved last year. In this half, we've achieved &#xA3;23 billion reduction in assets whilst maintaining our support for core businesses and core customers, where overall asset levels were flat, as new lending fully offset customer repayments.</p>
          <p>Last year, we set out our strategy to reduce non-relationship assets by some &#xA3;200 billion by the end of 2014 and it continues to be our intention to manage these assets for value, and given the current economic climate, our primary focus remains on running these assets down over time.</p>
          <p>The overall balance sheet reduction will provide the group with increased optionality and flexibility from the resultant releases in both funding and capital. And over time, this will facilitate further reductions in wholesale funding through payments of government and central bank facilities and of course, provide substantial capacity for core business growth.</p>
          <p>Let me move on now to risk-weighted assets and capital. Well, risk-weighted assets have reduced 6% as a consequence of the balance sheet reductions that I've just spoken about, the lower risk mix of the loan portfolio and the generally improving credit outlook. Over the medium term, we expect to see further reductions in risk-weighted assets, as a result of both balance sheet asset reductions and the positive procyclical impact from the expected improvement in the U.K. economic environment.</p>
          <p>The group's capital ratios have increased significantly with our total capital ratio of 13.4%, the Tier 1 ratio now at 10.3%, and perhaps most importantly these days, our core Tier 1 ratio of 9%. The group has a strong capital base and is in a solid position to deal with what are constantly changing regulatory capital requirements. But putting all our guidance together, we expect capital and capital ratios to strengthen materially over the medium term.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at our funding and liquidity. We've successfully continued to reduce the absolute level of wholesale funding and our reliance on short-term funding, whilst growing our base of high quality, relationship-based customer deposits. We're maintaining a substantial high quality primary liquid asset buffer, the majority of which is cash held at central banks and we have substantially reduced our governments and central bank funding support.</p>
          <p>Pulling on a very diverse range of funding sources, we successfully completed &#xA3;18 billion of public term issuance this year against the plan of 20 to 25 billion for the year. And we're planning to continue to reduce our wholesale funding whilst reinvesting in our core business franchises. The flexibility that we have created is exactly in line with our previous guidance and over the next four years, we expect to achieve further significant reductions in the group's wholesale funding requirements.</p>
          <p>Our primary liquid asset buffer has been maintained at over &#xA3;80 billion, with over 50 billion of this held as cash at central banks and some 30 billion in AAA rated government securities such as gilts and U.S. Treasuries. So, this makes it a high-quality, extremely liquid portfolio can seek primary assets that are the main focus of our liquidly management and of course, for the FSA's new liquidity regime which broadly marries the proposed Basel III liquidity requirements and which we have been operating to for the last couple of months.</p>
          <p>Now, let me summarize our guidance for the financial performance that we expect to achieve over the next several years. We expect to deliver 6 to 7% income growth per annum from our core business through our focus on customer relationships. We expect to grow faster than the nominal rates of growth in GDP, and we believe the range we have set out is consistent with the more conservative risk appetite you would expect from Lloyds and our desire for lower earnings volatility through the cycle. The rate of revenue growth across the group that I've set out will be partially offset as we continue to run down on non-relationship assets.</p>
          <p>Let me just state those requirements. We expect to see our margins return to about 2.5% by 2014, more in line with historic rates and we expect to achieve market-leading efficiency with a cost to income ratio of around 40% by delivering the integration savings and maintaining our focus on positive operating leverage. This will enable us to further invest, to strengthen our proposition and support future growth.</p>
          <p>On impairments, we will continue to apply a more conservative approach to risk, which is underpinned by unparalleled customer insight. And this should result in a portfolio that settles in at a consistent 50 to 60 basis points of impairments per annum. We expect impairments to be moderately lower in the second half of this year, but they will continue to improve thereafter.</p>
          <p>We will continue to strength the non-relationship part of our balance sheet, so that we can focus our capital on supporting customer relationships. That will allow us to reduce our capital intensity and support our loan to deposit ratio of under a 140%. We're expecting returns on equity of over 15% in the medium to longer term, and given the regulatory uncertainty, we can't be more specific at this stage, but we expect that we'll be in the top quartile of world-class banks and we also expect to return to a more normal dividend policy in the future.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, we delivered on all of our process with higher income, higher margins, lower costs and impairments and terrific progress on integration. The capital base is stronger and the funding position is further strengthened.</p>
          <p>We set out another guidance on this risk management team will build on and deliver the earnings potential of the enlarged franchise, and the guidance given today covers target margins, income growth, efficiency, potential, the benefits of reducing the capital intensity, the balance sheet and the flexibility that we are creating for core business growth. It's a great combination. But I'm going to stop there and I'd now like to open up the call to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Walker with BlackRock. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First off, thank you so much for holding the call. I just want to verify that the 9% core Tier 1 ratio is what &#x2013; is that's the same calculation for the ECN trigger at the 5%, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lisa, hi. Yes, that's absolutely correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're still calculating our ratios under exactly the same Basel II capital regime put at time of the ECN issuance. So, they are &#x2013; you're comparing apples and apples.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then can you comment just on, I know you have a slide in here on the Basel announcement that came out and it seems to have softened some of the liquidity requirements, at least, the timing of it. And so, what does that &#x2013; where does that leave you in a world where you're complying with an FSA requirement, but a Basel environment being less onerous?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you will be glad to know, Lisa, that we are obviously complying with all of regulatory requirements that are in existence today, including the very significant stress testing environment that's conducted every year in the U.K. The Basel III changes that were announced, I guess, some 10 days ago now did make a number of changes particularly on the liquidity pieces that you are asking about. We like other predominantly retail banks will probably be beneficiaries, will be the main beneficiaries of the changes in the leverage ratio and the composition of the net stable funding ratio.</p>
          <p>What they've done here is a number of changed proposals, including more flexibility over the treatments and the weighting given to quality mortgage books, and obviously we have a very substantial and high-quality mortgage book. And they've also changed some of the weightings that are applied to some retail deposits that are part of the outflow side of the equation. So overall, we being big in mortgages and retail deposits, we are a good beneficiary of the proposed changes. But of course, everybody will benefit from the implementation being deferred until 2018, which I think is a sensible reaction from regulators as they listen to what banks want to achieve, which is a continued strong level of support for economic recoveries across Europe, and therefore being flexible on this I think is a very sensible approach that they've taken. But we're a beneficiary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the main benefit is both the treatment of the mortgage book and also the weighting to the retail deposits, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, those are the two big items on the liquidity side that help us. Also on the capital side though, Lisa, some of the proposed changes under the original Basel III proposal have been significantly mitigated or diluted or eased and on the basis of that, we will also be a beneficiary of the changes that were announced some 10 days ago. So, we've always been supportive of the direction of travel that regulators want to take capital and liquidity to making for a stronger environment. I think what they are now doing is understand that a balance needs to be got, both as to what they are trying to achieve and given that they've said they will revert on timing and also understanding some of the transition arrangements. But there is a good dialogue going on between banks and regulators and treasuries and the like, so all in all, good and positive developments for us in the last couple of weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And one last point on, so your insurance business, the impact on capital that wasn't changed, is that correct, the same applies as what we saw in December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Lisa, actually there are some changes there. What was proposed in December was a full deduction of insurance from core Tier 1 capital. Obviously, we've been factoring into our plans for many years now the anticipated 50% deduction that is already part of the way the Basel II regime has been and will operate here in the U.K. So, for us, the impact of Basel III was looking at that additional 50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What the new proposals do is turn that on its head and they say that you have a maximum amount of contribution to your core Tier 1 basis cap at 10% from relates to a number of things which for us would basically meant the insurance company. So, this is a significant improvement for us and on top of that, you may have seen in our detailed announcement today that in the first half of this year, we actually repatriated some &#xA3;2 billion of core Tier 1 capital from the insurance group into the banking part of the group and that alone is a very material mitigant against what Basel III or Basel 3.5 may eventually deliver for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if it's a 10%, what's the deduction then from core Tier 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we would be allowed to do is include within our core Tier 1 an amount that's capped at 10% which would relate to ones investment in insurance companies. And obviously, the larger your core Tier 1 base, the larger 10% is of that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what we are doing is we are comparing that 10% against the impact that we're expecting. So, 10% of one number of equity basically against what we were expecting was 50% of the insurance deduction. And the two are million miles apart. So, by the time we get to whenever this comes in in place, we don't &#x2013; we now don't expect this to be particularly adverse to us, it's one of the reasons on the detailed Basel III chart that's on our Investor Relations website, you might see that I've actually &#x2013; I am now coding this as green in terms of where Basel III is taking the direction whereas I had it as amber when we were analyzing it back in February.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have a question from the line of Christian Hantel with WestLB Mellon Asset Management. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, hi there. Thanks for holding the call. I have a quick question on funding. I am not too sure if you already touched on it, but because I joined in a little bit later. But I would be curious on your funding plans as you keep pretty much on track for the full year, or you did 18 billion in the first half and an additional 8 billion in private placements, I would like to know if you're still looking &#x2013; look for like coming into new market issuing some benchmark-sized paper? And the second part of the question would be relating to private placements. You did lot on that in the first half and I would like to know if you see this trend to be continued in the next year as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, hi. Thanks for the question. And don't worry. You didn't miss a particular comment from me on &#x2013; on this particularly in my prepared words, so I'm very happy to give you a full answer now. You've rightly identified from the material that we released today that we have completed 18 billion of public term issuance in the first six months and 8 billion of raise by private placements. Our target or goal if you like, or range of expectations for the full year on the public side remains in that 20 to 25 broad category. So, even if I compared 18 against the top end of that range of 25, we've done some three-quarters odd of our expected public term-issuance for the year at 30 June, I do expect that we will probably complete the full issuance levels that we set out earlier this year. But what we will do, Christian, is maintain the pattern that you've seen as during the first half of this year, which is access a diverse range of investors and investor types across varied and multiple geographies, and different currencies, and using quite widely different structures for the raising. We've done some secured, some unsecured. We've done a variety of asset-backed type issuance including a fair amount of RMBS during the first half. So, one thing I can assure you is that we will continue to maintain a diverse range of different funding instrument issuance and of course, we are mindful of making sure of us done a benchmark pricing as you indicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the private placements, do you see this year as an exceptional that you did a lot of private placements or you're trying to continue this trend as well for next year for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think the 8 billion that we've done so far is more than we probably expected to have done by this time of year, but I think that will always be an aspect of private placement within our plans. And I think by being able to access such a range, and I think it ensures that we don't &#x2013; that we continue to operate as we have done in the first half by not tapping into markets, individual markets too regularly. I think that's very important. And one of the reasons that, of course, the private issuance is as high as it is, is actually we've had a number of reverse inquiries during the first half of the year which we've responded to. And it's tremendously reassuring to find this level of investor interest in the Lloyds name, and in our issuance and in the quality of assets that are available to back some of our term issuance.</p>
          <p>Across everything that we've done so far this year, we've had an average maturity profile at issue of 5.9 years, which really is a very satisfactory position to be in. And by making sure that we're paying the appropriate pricing, we're getting a very, very strong benefit and spreading of the maturity profile of our wholesale funding, which means that we're just further enhancing the reasonably prudent maturity profile that we had already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe an add-on question if I may. The FSA mentioned in the Financial Stability Report that especially the U.K. banks need to lengthen their maturity profile as you already mentioned. So, can we expect if, in case you come to the market that we should expect more, a longer-dated issue coming into the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's a very good question Christian. We have actually done quite a lot of the maturity extension already. You know, if I wind the clock back 18 months or so, we only had about 44% of our wholesale funding had a maturity of more than one year. By half year last year, we've moved that to 47. By year-end, it was at 50 and today we are pretty much in exactly the same space, we've got about 49% in terms of maturity profile. If you look at the quantum that we have outstanding, the absolute quantum of wholesale funding that we've got outstanding in the less than one-year maturity space is some 32 billion lower than it was 18 months ago, the time of the HBOS acquisition, whereas the quantum of more than one-year funding we have is broadly flat. So, what you can see here is us managing very prudently the maturity profile as it marches towards us almost under the laws of gravity by maintaining strong issuance with a good spread of different-term maturities, and I said the average is about 5.9 years. So, that's the long answer. The short answer will be just for me to say, yes, you can expect us to be doing more and varied-term issuance going forward as we look to manage our overall maturity profile.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we have a question from the line of Anne McDermott with New York Life Investments. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Hello, good morning. I have a couple of detail questions for you. First of all, in your loans and receivables you have almost 29 billion of debt securities. Could you remind me are those the ones that were reclassified under IAS 39?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Anne, the large parts of that would be exactly those things which were moved principally by HBOS prior to our acquisition of them. They were moved when the IAS 39 window was open, was the November 2008. There's actually you'll find an analysis of those. If you look &#x2013; if you pull down the slides off the website, you'll find there is a slide in the appendix that actually breaks down all of our treasury asset portfolios and breaks them down between what's in loans and advances, what's in FX and what's classified as fair value through P&amp;L. I hope that'll help you, because we've also got then further information on what they are in terms of what's mortgage banks or what's a CDO together with the carrying values and the average marks. So, there's quite a lot of information in there that I hope you'll find useful, Anne.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I will do that. The other thing is, in looking at the loans and advances to customers that declined from year-end, how much of the decline would you say was non-relationship loans that rolled off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, at a headline level, the amounts of our banking balance sheet that relates to our core business is flat over the 6 months. So, we've basically got a situation where new loans and advances to customers have been effectively offset by repayments by other customers that we got in there. If I had a slide that showed the overall movement in our non-core business and what that showed is we had a 23 billion reduction overall, of which 9 billion was from our so called treasury assets, which was primarily from those debt securities that were in the first part of your question. The remaining reduction of 14 came from our non-relationship loans and advances to customers, although I should be clear that sadly an element of that 14 of reduction was due to impairments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the other question, you had a nice increase in customer deposits from year-end but a lot of it appears to be from savings and I know that everyone seems to be chasing the same customer. Is there an element of sort of a deposit war in the U.K. at this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I certainly wouldn't classify this as a deposit war. I mean, there is a degree of competition out there for deposits. But I mean if &#x2013; I guess the evidence is in the way our margins moved. And in the last 6 months, we've only taken a negative 4 basis points impacts on the overall group margin from what's happened on deposits across the whole business. What we have seen is a growth in our relationship deposits, which are up about &#xA3;12 billion over the six months, whereas we saw a slight reduction in the deposits that we get through our treasury and trading desk, which give you the reductions in the overall number that you can see from the balance sheet. The treasury and trading deposit, they tend to be particularly rate sensitive, very, very short, often even overnight deposits from customers. So, it's nice to be in such a strong position that we were able to stand back from some pricing for those deposits because of the strength of our underlying relationship customer deposit growth in the last six months. And it just looks, if you looked in the detailed Retail division disclosures, you'd see that in the 12 months to June &#x2013; if you can just bear with me, I'll give you a 12-month figure, 12-month figure to June, our retail savings and deposit balances were up 5.5%, and that's not withstanding us letting go some of the more expensive heritage HBOS deposits that we talked about in February which we let go in the second half of last year. So, relationship deposits really are performing very well indeed.</p>
