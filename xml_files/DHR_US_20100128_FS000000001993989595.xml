        <plist>
          <p>Matt, thanks and good morning, everyone. I'll start this morning by providing an overview of what we are seeing across our businesses and in markets to frame up the backdrop for our quarterly results and our outlook for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We are quite pleased with the way our business has executed in what was clearly a very challenging operating environment throughout 2009. Despite those pressures, we were able to successfully protect and nurture our organic investments, while staying quite active on the acquisition front, announcing or closing 18 transactions throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Many of our end markets have stabilized, and our order book continues to improve. In the quarter, orders were down low single digits compared to a 9% organic decline in shipments, which includes the impact of four fewer selling days &#x2013; clearly a positive going into 2010. We believe by and large that the de-stocking that has occurred principally in our distribution channels in the U.S. and in Europe has run its course. We continue to focus our efforts on capturing market share. ChemTreat, DEXIS, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Videojet, and Radiometer are among the businesses where we believe we have taken notable share in 2009, driven by our increased focus on DBS sales and marketing tools as well as our investments in innovation.</p>
          <p>After returning to modest growth in the third quarter, China domestically grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter, with our Hach Lange and Leica businesses leading the way. We also saw a return to growth in Latin America, India, and other emerging economies. The U.S. was in line with overall company results, while Western Europe was relatively weaker.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we again saw the benefits of the restructuring pay off, as our core operating margin expanded 150 basis points year-over-year. We were particularly pleased that our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up slightly over the prior year, despite the 9% organic revenue decline.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities are now substantially complete. Over the last five quarters, we spent approximately $320 million, eliminated 5,100 positions and closed 43 facilities. We expect $170 million of incremental benefit from these actions in 2010. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Today we reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.80, off 13% from last year. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $1.12. For the full year, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $3.46, a 12.5% decline compared to 2008. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $3.53.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the quarter decreased 1.5% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, with core revenues down 9%. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by 4.5%, and acquisitions contributed 3% to sales growth. Our full-year 2009 revenues were down 12% year-over-year to $11.2 billion, with core revenues also declining 12%.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year gross margin for the fourth quarter increased 20 basis points to 45.9%, largely relating to our 2008 and 2009 restructuring initiatives as well as lower commodity costs, which more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes and incremental year-over-year restructuring costs in the quarter. Operating margin in the fourth quarter decreased 70 basis points year-over-year to 12.6%, with the impact of incremental restructuring costs more than offsetting the benefit provided by those restructuring and cost reduction activities. Our core operating margin increased 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis, despite the core revenue decline. For the full year, our operating margin was 13.8% compared to 14.7% in 2008.</p>
          <p>2009 operating cash flow was $1.8 billion, a 3% decline year-over-year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 140%, representing the 18th year in a row where we delivered free cash flow in excess of net income. The Danaher business system continues to be the primary driver of our cash flow performance.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of six companies, with aggregate annual revenues of about $250 million, to strengthen our Environmental, Test &amp; Measurement, and Dental businesses and to continue the evolution of our portfolio. For the full year, we closed or signed 18 transactions, totaling approximately $1.1 billion in revenue, and which will deploy capital of $1.9 billion. Heading into 2010, we believe we have more than $2 billion of additional M&amp;A spending capacity to expand and strengthen the portfolio. As part of our portfolio evolution, we also completed three small divestitures, including our Holo-Krome business during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our operating results, Professional Instrumentation revenues decreased 1.5% for the quarter, with core revenues down 10%. For 2009, revenues decreased 11%, with core revenues down 12.5%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 80 basis points to 18.6%, primarily due to the benefit of restructuring and cost reduction activities.</p>
          <p>Our Environmental platform revenues increased 5.5% in the quarter, with core revenues down 3%. For 2009, revenues were flat year-over-year, with core revenues down 1.5%. Water quality core revenues decreased at a low single digit rate in the quarter.</p>
          <p>At Hach Lange, core revenues declined at that same low single digit rate, with strong growth in our service business more than offset by lower instrument sales. Our China business was up more than 20% in the quarter, resulting from increased enforcement of environmental regulations. Overall, we are beginning to see an increase in project activity, which is a strategic focus of ours as we look to expand our installed base and capture the recurring revenue stream from consumable sales. Restructuring actions taken throughout 2009 helped to expand fourth quarter operating margin more than 100 basis points over the prior year.</p>
          <p>Trojan's core revenues grew at a low single digit rate in the quarter, with strong growth in drinking water applications, primarily related to the New York City drinking water project. Sales to industrial and commercial end markets rebounded in the quarter, after experiencing declines throughout most of the year. For the full year, Trojan core revenues grew at a mid-teens rate, and they ended the year with a robust backlog.</p>
          <p>In ChemTreat, fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by sales of our boiler/cooler water applications, primarily to commercial and industrial verticals. We believe that we continue to capture share across many of our end markets and are pleased with recent wins in the chemical and petroleum verticals, resulting from our DBS initiatives.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we acquired Crison Instruments, a manufacturer of electrochemistry instruments and consumables headquartered in Barcelona. Crison's high quality, easy-to-use product portfolio strengthened Hach Lange's e-chem lab and process business. Also in the quarter, ChemTreat acquired Trident Technologies, a provider of water treatment services to commercial, institutional, and industrial customers in the western U.S. and Mexico.</p>
          <p>Gilbarco Veeder-Root's fourth quarter core revenues declined in a mid-single digit rate year-over-year. At Gilbarco, sales increased at a low single digit rate. Continued growth in our Passport Point of Sale Systems and payment solutions more than offset lower dispenser sales. Veeder-Root sales were down in the quarter, partially due to a difficult year-over-year comparison around vapor recovery in California.</p>
          <p>Moving to Test &amp; Measurement, revenues declined 10% in the quarter, with core revenues down 18%. For the full year, core revenues were down 24%. Fluke core revenues declined at a low teens rate in the quarter, with growth across the emerging markets and China more than offset by declines in other geographies. Importantly, bookings solidly outpaced shipments in the quarter, driven in part by the recent launch of several new products, including the 233 digital remote display multimeter and our Ti32 thermal imager.</p>
          <p>Also during the quarter, Fluke announced a $1.4 million award from the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a new instrument to calibrate and measure the magnitude and phase of voltage and current for smart grid applications. This grant is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to support research and to advance measurement science in areas of critical national importance. This award recognizes Fluke's outstanding brand quality and is a testament to its robust R&amp;D capabilities.</p>
          <p>At Tektronix, we saw strong sequential order growth in the quarter, resulting from new product introductions and an improving R&amp;D spending environment. In China, orders were up double digit year-over-year. Shipments, however, remain weak across all major product categories and geographies. We do, though, remain optimistic that the broad-based improvement in order activity is indicative of a strengthening in our end markets.</p>
          <p>Core revenues from our Fluke Networks and Tek Communications businesses collectively declined at a low single digit rate in the quarter, with high-teens growth of network management solutions at Tek Communications more than offset by weak demand across most product categories at FMed [Fluke Biomedical]. During the quarter, Tek Comms launched the G10, its next generation monitoring platform, used to collect, correlate, and analyze media and signaling data for next generation IP telecom networks. Early feedback from customers has been quite positive.</p>
          <p>Also during the quarter, we acquired Sypris Test &amp; Measurement and Davis Inotech. These businesses are leading providers of calibration services, testing, and component screening products serving military, aerospace, avionics, telecommunications and medical customers. These two acquisitions, Sypris and Davis, accelerate a key strategic initiative at Tektronix to expand its service offerings.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we acquired ClearSight, a California-based provider of network analysis tools for real-time application monitoring, protocol analysis, and troubleshooting. ClearSight came to us from TOYO, a long-time partner of ours in Japan. The business enhances Fluke Networks' protocol analysis product line and strengthens its access to the Japanese network monitoring market.</p>
          <p>Moving to Medical Technologies, revenues for the quarter increased 9% compared to the prior year period, with core revenues down 2%. For 2009, revenues decreased 4%, with core revenues down 5%. Med Tech operating margin for the fourth quarter was down 220 basis points from the prior year period to 8.5%, due primarily to the impact of incremental year-over-year restructuring costs and transaction costs associated with pending and completed acquisitions. However, our core operating margin increased 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis as the result of the benefit of restructuring and cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>Within our Dental business, core revenues declined in a mid-single digit rate in the quarter. Sybron core sales declined at a low single digit rate, with strong sales of our orthodontia solutions and disinfection product lines more than offset by soft sales of general dentistry consumables. Sales of our Damon branded orthodontic system were up more than 20% in the quarter, driven by an excellent response to our new DamonQ product and the introduction of Damon Clear. During the quarter, we expanded the distribution channels for SybronEndo's Twisted Files, which thus far has been very positively received by the market.</p>
          <p>KaVo revenues declined at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, with improved performance on a sequential basis across most geographies and product categories. A number of recent product launches, including the DEXIS Platinum Sensor, the KaVo COMFORTdrive handpiece, the Gendex 8500 2D panoramic imager, and the KaVo E70 treatment unit contributed to this improved performance. Additionally, we believe channel inventory reductions are largely complete. Recent restructuring initiatives benefited KaVo's bottom line, with fourth quarter operating margins increasing more than 200 basis points year-over-year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we also closed the previously announced acquisition of PaloDEx, a Finland-based manufacturer of dental imaging products, which is expected to strengthen our digital imaging product portfolio in all key categories.</p>
          <p>Leica core revenues were essentially flat in the quarter, with strength across Asia and Latin America offset by weaker demand in the U.S. and Europe. I'm pleased to report, though, that for the second year in the row, Leica has exceeded $1 billion in sales. Leica Microsystems continues its success in Japan, where we have been awarded orders totaling more than $15 million, including the large forensic order we referenced last quarter, as part of that country's stimulus program. In the U.S., stimulus funding has begun to flow, although microscopy awards to date have been modest.</p>
          <p>Subsequent to quarter's end, we acquired Genetix, a UK-based provider of imaging and intelligent image analysis solutions used by scientists and clinicians to facilitate the development of pharmaceuticals and biotherapeutics, mainstream research, and clinical diagnostics. The acquisition of Genetix strengthens Leica's position in the high growth virtual microscopy market and expands the reach of our research and clinical businesses.</p>
          <p>Leica Biosystems core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter. In October, we launched the BOND-III advanced staining system, which combined with our Bond-max product, contributed to a significant increase in instrument placements during the quarter. We have been very pleased with early customer demand for the BOND-III, and we recently won a multi-unit order from one of the most influential diagnostics labs in the U.K. Overall, our advanced staining instruments and consumables business grew more than 30% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Radiometer's core revenues grew at a low single digit rate for the quarter, driven by continued strong consumable sales, primarily in Europe and Asia. In 2009, we sold approximately 200 AQT instruments, which is nearly five times the number sold in 2008, and the customer feedback has been very encouraging. AQT's launch in the U.S. and Japan is still pending, as we await regulatory approvals.</p>
          <p>Moving to our Industrial Technologies segments, revenues declined 9.5% for the quarter, with core revenues down 15%. For 2009, revenues decreased 18.5%, with core revenues down 16%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 11.5%, a 220 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year, due primarily to incremental year-over-year restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin increased marginally on a year-over-year basis, as a result of the benefit of restructuring and cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>Product Identification revenues were up 7% in the quarter, with core revenues declining 1.5%. For the year, Product ID sales decreased 10.5%, with core revenues down 8%. At Videojet, core revenues grew at a low single digit rate in the fourth quarter, primarily a result of higher consumable sales. We saw sequential improvement across most geographies, with the recovery in China outpacing that in the U.S. and in Europe. While still a challenging market, we are very pleased with the performance of our refreshed CIJ product line during the year, and we believe we continue to take share.</p>
          <p>Motion was down 24% in the quarter, with core revenues down 30%. For the year, sales decreased 33.5%, with core revenues down 30%. On the bright side, we saw sequential improvement in several technology and industrial end markets during the quarter, primarily in the U.S. and Asia. European end markets remained difficult. During the quarter, Thomson received a $6 million multi-year order from a large power infrastructure supplier to provide an array of automation assemblies for a nuclear refurbishment project.</p>
          <p>And finally, moving to Tools &amp; Components, revenues for the quarter decreased 9.5%, with core revenues down 9%. For the year, revenues were down 18.5%, with core revenues down 18%. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.5%, an increase of 70 basis points from the prior year, due to the benefit of lower commodity costs, increased productivity, and cost savings attributable to 2008 and 2009 restructuring, which helped to offset both lower sales volumes and incremental year-over-year restructuring costs incurred in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Mechanics Hand Tools core revenues declined 9% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the year, primarily due to lower sales to both the consumer and professional channels. We're pleased with our sell-through at Sears in the quarter. Sales of our domestic China tool brand SATA grew at a double digit rate during the quarter. And in addition, our U.S. government business was up substantially in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect this growth to continue in 2010, with a solid backlog already in place.</p>
          <p>So to wrap up, we continue to execute well in a difficult but improving economic environment. Our investments in innovation, sales and marketing, are driving market share gains. Our restructuring and cost reduction progress is evident in our margins. Our free cash flow remains strong, and we are putting it to good use in acquisitions and in strengthening our competitive positions and accelerating our sales and earnings growth potential. We believe we are well positioned heading into 2010, with DBS driving our focus on out-performance.</p>
          <p>We are reaffirming this morning our full year 2010 GAAP earnings per share guidance of $3.80 to $4.10. We expect GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.82 on flattish revenues. Both the full year and first quarter EPS guidance represents an approximately eight to 15% increase over the comparable prior year periods.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. We're now ready for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll move to our first question. We'll take our first question from Nigel Coe, Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we saw, are seeing some very nice trends in dental quarter-over-quarter. How much of it do you think is inventory swings, and how much do you think is sort of a genuine end market improvement? And maybe any relation to sort of a yearend sort of budget flush coming through in 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, I think it's a bit of all of the above, to be straight. The inventory adjustments have been more pronounced for us at KaVo than at Sybron. We saw less of that in the fourth quarter. We're by and large confident that that's now behind us. We certainly saw I think a better uptake, not only in terms of our sales in, but our sales out, again probably more so at KaVo than at Sybron, as we ended the year. End of the year on the equipment side is often a positive or an up-tick in buying. We didn't really know how to best forecast that, but we were pleasantly surprised with our results.</p>
          <p>I have to share perhaps the most important data point for me, having been with a number of the businesses, having been at two sales meetings here in the last two weeks, let alone seeing a couple weeks' worth of orders, we have also gotten off to a good start. So it's not as if there was a lot of business that got pulled forward or there was a simply a year-end phenomenon there. I think we're seeing a return to a more typical mindset on the parts of docs. I think we're very much in a sweet part of the new product launch cycle as well. That would apply to both KaVo and to Sybron. So I think right now from a top-line perspective, we're not going to suggest we're going to blow out the top line here at Dental, but I think particularly at KaVo, we should have a better year in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and then on KaVo, could you maybe just talk about, you talked about the revenue trends, but can you maybe just address the margins? Obviously, you had a tough first half of '09, got a little bit better in the second half. Can you maybe just frame where they are right now? And then maybe switch gears to Industrial and Tools margins -- took a sizable step-down from 3Q to 4Q. Can you maybe just talk about that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, on the KaVo question, we did have a good Q4 2009 at KaVo. It is seasonally the strongest quarter in terms of margins, but on a year-over-year basis, we were up about 200 basis points. We went from kind of ex-restructuring mid-single digits last year to kind of high-single digits, seven, 8% in the quarter. We do benefit from some higher volume, but we also got a lot of restructuring done towards the end of the year at KaVo as well, and that gives us some confidence going here into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the tick-down in margins for Industrial and Tools?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tools, some of that is the incremental consumer business, which is at slightly lower volumes in the fourth quarter, creates slightly lower margins in the fourth quarter. On the Industrial segment, some sequential improvement in Motion, which is a lower margin than our Product ID business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so principally mix rather than inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, not atypically, either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, and then just a couple quick ones. Obviously, we saw the announcement yesterday on AB SCIEX. When is your best guess on getting that closed? And maybe if you could just as well give us your best guess on the AQT launch in U.S. and Japan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll take the first one and let Larry talk about AQT. We now, Nigel, we now have all regulatory approvals. We are finishing up a couple small, final transition issues, and we expect to close very shortly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, as you can appreciate, the authorities like us to limit what we say about timing, both here in the U.S. and in Japan. Suffice it to say, we're hopeful that we are through both of those efforts at some point in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>

          <p>And we'll take our next question. The question comes from Deane Dray, FBR Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Larry, I would be very interested in hearing your comments regarding potential restocking. You said de-stocking has run its course, but based on your assessment of channel inventories, you think they stay low here for a while? Or are there any indications that a restocking wave is coming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Deane, I think it's a little hard to call right now, but again, I'm encouraged by what we're seeing, both in terms of sell-out and sell-in early in the year, other companies have reported as well. A strong finish and encouraging start does not a year make, but I think that'll be helpful to certainly a company like ours, particularly where we go to market through distribution. I would also add that when we turn the year like this, distributors are not necessarily going to be out aggressively loading up.</p>
          <p>We are at low levels in a number of places, in some cases probably too low. We like to work with a short supply chain with a number of those distributor partners so they don't have to blow in a lot of inventory, they can rely on our quick turn and our manufacturing capability to provide some of that. But undoubtedly some of that will seep in, if we see this rising tide last for a bit longer here at the start of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on that point on the start of the year, we heard that Med Tech has gotten off to a good start in January. Can you just calibrate for us since the meeting in December and what experience you've seen so far in January across the businesses, just in terms of what changes at the margin you'd call out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that we finished a little bit better than we would have anticipated. Certainly if you look at Tech and Motion businesses that certainly felt the brunt of the downturn, they're certainly in a good place, built backlog. We did that in Med Tech as well, more so at Leica, and in Dental, than we did at Radiometer. So I think that backlog build was encouraging during the fourth quarter, and I think by and large, we seemingly have not missed a beat here thus far in January. Again, it's early, so I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but we're, we were thrilled to walk in with the backlog, and I think even more so to see the, just the general pulse across the businesses. What I'm describing, Deane, is really not limited to one pocket or another. It's, I'd characterize it quite simply as broad-based at this point. But again, it's early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, and last question for me, and related to that comment about backlog. We don't normally hear Danaher talk about backlog. The end of the third quarter you called out 100 million in backlog. How did you finish this quarter? Was all that backlog burned through? And how might that have added to the core revenue growth this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Deane, as Larry talked about in his, the prepared remarks, while the shipments were down 9%, our orders were only down a couple points year-on-year. So we built another comparable, about 100 million of backlog in the quarter. And that's one of the reasons, as you know, when we were together in December, we talked about the first quarter probably being down organically. We're now talking about it being relatively flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And before we move on to our next question, we ask that all of our participants please limit to one question and one follow-on question. We'll take our next question from Bob Cornell, Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Hey, guys, could you give us a little more color on your first quarter outlook in terms of what businesses are doing well, what are sort of on the soft side? I heard the oral commentary, maybe if you could flesh out the color there for me a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Bob. I think as we talk about, again, as Dan highlighted, probably a flattish outlook compared to the slightly down outlook we had back in December, I think Med Tech is going to lead the way. It will probably be Med Tech and T&amp;M fighting it out, with Water ever so slightly behind in terms of the start here. I think we're going to have some challenges at Gilbarco and Tools, but I think they're going to be up as well. Probably in Industrial is where it will lag a bit, but again certainly encouraged by the sequential trends, if for no other reason than our A&amp;D exposure obviously is a little later cycle, and that will, I think that will be down in all likelihood double digits in 2010. So all in all, I think the businesses that led us in the fourth quarter, particularly from an orders perspective, a backlog build perspective, are the ones that are going to be strong for us this year and certainly getting stronger here at the outset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the balance in the first quarter of the restructuring benefit versus some of the temporary cost recoveries and the, possibly the cost-price catch-up in terms of matching of price and materials? Is there...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, I'll try to cut that. I mean, as we confirmed again today, we expect about 170 million of restructuring benefit in the full year. We'll probably get at least a quarter of that, maybe even a little bit more than that in the first quarter. It should be on a relative basis the biggest beneficiary of the restructuring benefit as we got some of the other stuff during '09.</p>
          <p>In terms of the one-time stuff on the cost side, we talked about it being about a $60 million headwind in '10, and that should be roughly 15 million quarter. So obviously, the restructuring benefited a lot more than the headwind from some of the one-time cost actions. We did see in the fourth quarter a little less price benefit and a little bit more commodity inflation, but it's hard to quantify. I think it will be kind of relatively, it will be, it will be a slight headwind, but it's not going to be a big number for us.</p>

          <p>And we'll take our next question. The next question comes from Steve Winoker, Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. The first question is around that core growth number again, down 9% versus what you talked about being up 4% for the full year back in December. As you sort of look at that and you talk about the first quarter now more flat versus your prior thoughts of it being down and the progression, it is still going to require a very dramatic increase for the rest of the year. Do you see that having changed at all in your mind? Are you, as you've looked at the sequencing, as you've talked about some of the businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Steve, that what we said in New York is we thought we'd be up one to 5%, but we wouldn't be positive until the second quarter. I think with the finish, again, yes, we were down 9, but keep in mind orders, and we don't want to talk a lot about orders, but I think with the tide changing, it's important. We were probably down 2% in orders, and that's with fewer days, four fewer days, which obviously works against us in the quarter. So I think with the order book, the backlog build, and the start of the year, and the new news today is we think we'll be flattish, I think we've got a shot, an outside shot at a positive number in the first quarter. That simply makes it easier for us to be in that one to five range or potentially higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I might have missed this, but Tek specifically in Q4 was down what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tek Communications was up in the fourth quarter. I'm looking for the number here on how much Tek Instruments was down a comparable...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was down 25 to 30% I think in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and what you saw at Tektronix was down kind of comparable in the fourth quarter, but orders were up sequentially double digit, and year-over-year were down kind of mid-teens, and we had a significant- the book-to-bill was about 115% in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and in the &#x2013; were you able to hold margins in Tek?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in fact we saw, outside restructuring, Tek Instruments improved sequentially from kind of 10% to mid-teens in the fourth quarter. You do get a little bit more seasonal lift, but a clear sign that the restructuring is paying off pretty nicely there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then something I just want to understand, I know you took R&amp;D down from 5.3 to 4.9%, about 40 basis points. Your product vitality and other things, how should I think about the R&amp;D reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I think you should look at it as a very modest sequential decline in terms of the dollars spent. We had a couple of programs wrap. Some of that expense went to the launch. You saw a lot of those launches highlighted in New York. I really don't think it's particularly meaningful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there was no shift in particular businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's no strategy shifts, there's no &#x2013; there's really nothing to report behind that slight sequential down-tick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the SG&amp;A increase at 130 basis points, did that include the restructuring or not? The increase for SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that includes, the restructuring also included, as Larry talked about, the significant kind of go to market launches with some of the new products we kind of introduced in the midyear and the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Oh, last question, sorry, on return on capital, that looked like it was down year-on-year again also. How should we think about that, your goals for sort of return on capital going forward this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the decline in '09 was clearly a function of the lower sales and lower earnings. You should see an improvement consistent with our earnings growth during the year, but factoring in that when new acquisitions come in, they come in at a lower return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. All right, thanks, guys.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Sorry I may have missed this, but the first quarter dynamics from an earnings perspective, is that because you're going to take some charges when you close these deals? It just looks a little bit light from a seasonal perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Steve, it's fundamentally in line with the increase for the year that we talked about back in New York. So I realize that may catch some people this morning, but I don't really think there's news there. We're going to continue to invest, as we have here in the fourth quarter, in our innovation and growth activities, begin to get more of that $170 million from incremental restructuring benefit, with obviously some other costs going back to the business.  But that's just I think a clarification of what we'll do here in the next 90 days, based on what we said we would do for the full year in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no unusual charges or anything in the first quarter or anything like that? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look, Steve, if you look at our profitability in the first quarter versus the full year over time, I think it's consistent, on a seasonal basis, it's very consistent looking back over time. So I don't think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was just very simply looking at the EPS stuff, so sorry to say it's a little bit of a busy morning here. Professional Instrumentation was very strong, but Med Tech was light on the margins. Was there anything specific in the quarter that led to that? Was it a mix impact? A little bit lower than we would have expected, even ex-ing out the restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well they did &#x2013; on a reported basis, they had more restructuring dollars than any segment, but if you adjusted out the restructuring, they ran about 14%, which was up actually 200 &#x2013; was up over 100 basis points year-on-year, and the biggest driver of the year-on-year improvement came out of Dental Equipment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple small items. The R&amp;D decrease in overall spend, or at least percent of sales, is that &#x2013; should we think about that 4.9% being more or less the run rate from here, or will you have to ramp up for kind of an another product cycle somewhere down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we'll take that up in 2010, even with a little bit of a better top-line environment. We don't necessarily target that per se. We're really trying to fund the strategy, if you will, Scott, more than trying to hit a number. But as you have seen, we have been taking that up with the increased emphasis there, and I suspect that we'll be meaningfully north of 4.9, where we were in the quarter, on a full-year basis. I think we're, on a full-year to full-year basis, we'll be up modestly as a percent of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, if you look at the full year, we were at 5.7%, which was flat versus '08, and I think it will be 5.7%, or as Larry suggested, a little bit higher than that in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's just hard for us maybe to picture how this spend can be that volatile. It just seems like most of R&amp;D spend would be people, and I'm not sure how that changes quarter to quarter. Is there something I'm missing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, there's, sometimes in a project, not all of the human costs, if you will, are on your payroll.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Third parties, contractors, and the like, and if a program is tailing off, some of that becomes variable expense, some of that money in the P&amp;L will go out of R&amp;D into sales and marketing for the launch. That's really all you're seeing, again, sequentially in terms of the dollars, let alone the ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that makes sense. And just, this is kind of a bigger picture question, but when you do make an acquisition let's say the size of a Tektronix or I know that was your bigger one, but maybe SCIEX, let's say, how do you integrate the R&amp;D? Do you keep them decentralized and focused on specific projects, or is there a way to get some scale out of that spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I think the way we've always operated it with respect to innovation and technology, as well as other areas, is to make sure first and foremost that that activity is very focused around that business, those customers, those applications, those problems. And then only, if you will, quite tactically, there are touch points, be it in optics, out of a Leica, out of microprocessing, say out of Tek, where there is that sort of core technology capability that can be ported elsewhere; you'll see us do that.</p>
          <p>And in fact, I think you'll see a couple of announcements through the year. They may not be material, but I think they'll be evidence that we are connecting some of the potential shared technologies across businesses in often not so obvious ways.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just curious, you said you closed 43 facilities, and I know the market seems to be &#x2013; have this generalization that customers are going to start building inventories back, and your base of locations is obviously smaller. So you individually I wouldn't expect to be certainly not out of the gate ramping up your inventories, your CapEx to where you were entering this downturn, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and you guys are pretty realistic, pretty conservative, so I would imagine that you're expecting your customers to act much differently than that, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's hard to generalize, but I think, again, with the finish and with the start, lots of people I talk to are becoming more confident about what could happen in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But I think if you're looking at durables and so on, so far the trends have been that orders are turning into shipments right away, that backlogs really aren't being built. I mean I guess what I'm saying is that it seems like you guys are pretty realistic about the expectations, given your own patterns and probably your better customers acting pretty efficiently, pretty prudently. Is that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd like to think that we are taking a prudent approach to thinking about the sequential ramp that is likely to &#x2013; the scenarios that could occur in 2010, without getting too far ahead of ourselves, but at the same time, making sure we're not so conservative that we don't have the labor plant or the material plant in place to catch the wave, whatever size it may come in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, no, I can appreciate that. I was just thinking, if you're looking at all the -- at what you've done to the portfolio over let's say the last five to ten years, what &#x2013; as you're going through this, what are you thinking the profile of the firm looks like, of your company looks like let's say through this next cycle? Is it higher core growth? Is it more offsetting cyclicality? Is it steadier, longer growth? How do you kind of, as you're going through options, how do you think about what the eventual look will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what we have tried to do with the moves, say since the last cycle, or even the moves we made in 2009, John, is to make sure that, first and foremost, that if we were never to do another acquisition, that we have a high growth, high margin, innovative science and technology-oriented portfolio that can perform well over the long-term. And I think that very much is in place.</p>
          <p>Certainly as we look forward, we have an opportunity to do quite well from a core growth perspective, given what we've done both on the product and the go-to-market side. With respect to acquisitions, I do think the past is, the past is prologue. If you look over the last year, the last five years, I do believe that we have improved the quality and the capability of this company. So we'll look to add like-type businesses, again with an emphasis toward higher growth, higher margin, more global, more technical businesses, where our DBS skill sets are applicable and can add value.</p>

          <p>Good morning, John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I want to go back to the first quarter dynamic. Historically, your first quarter is about 20% of your year, and if you take the midpoint, $0.80, the midpoint of your guide of 3.95, it would be $0.20. But the first quarter has flat organic revenues. You're thinking you're going to do up, and even in your analyst appendix roll-forward, there was 0.10 to $0.40 of contribution from the positive organic trend that's coming in the next, beyond the first quarter. And then, I think, Dan, you even called out the fact that the cost headwinds were going to be linear, right, so kind of equally spread. So I'm just trying to understand, why would the first quarter not be low relative to the sequential ramp, which is not really, what you're actually expecting, which is not really embedded in the dynamic of the first quarter being 20% of the midpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one thing I did say is on a relative basis, Q1 will be the biggest beneficiary of the 2009 restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep, you did. How much is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's probably a &#x2013; it could be a penny or so, a penny or two. So you're  talking, if our full-year guidance is at 2.5, 3% core and we've got zero here. I mean, that costs us a couple of cents from a fall-through perspective, but that should be roughly offset with the restructuring. And it's early in the year, so that's kind of our best look at this point. If we thought organic was going to be down in the first quarter, our Q1 guidance would've been a little bit lower, and so we think it captures it as best we can at this point. But I understand the question and the point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're still expecting, Dan, to get, call it $0.25 at the midpoint from core growth spread over the next three quarters, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then, my call...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand the question. I mean we had exceptionally strong margin performance across the business in Q4, so our confidence that we can kind of replicate that the next quarter is pretty high. But going out four quarters, they are more unknowns and that, probably we factored that in a little bit as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. I'm just trying to gauge to make sure that there is nothing else unusual, that you're just being conservative. The following question really was about your &#x2013; what's going on in Europe? If I remember last year, right, Europe all of a sudden kind of deteriorated for you, and I think a lot of it, somewhat on a relative basis, deteriorated for you, and I think it had to do a little bit with your mix. What are you seeing in Europe versus, in terms of the sequential, and how does that float with your outlook for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I would say that what we're seeing in Europe, broadly defined, is just a more, a slower, maybe a more sluggish sequential improvement. I wouldn't say it's universal in every single one of our businesses, but it's not coming back... I mean, if I look at China, if I look at India, it's come back here in the second half very strongly. The U.S. has been getting better month to month, but not nearly in as pronounced a way. Europe is just in that third slot. It's just getting better, but it's, on a relative basis, much more slowly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any reason to think that it could pick up for any reason, based on your business mix or order trends, or do you think it's just going to lag throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's a potential for Europe to lag, more of a macro call than a Danaher call, but I would think it would be hard for Europe to sit out what appears to be a strengthening outlook for the global economy, at least here in the early half or the first half of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Larry, you're talking about Danaher or about macro Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm talking about macro Europe, and obviously we've got a big footprint there, John. I think if you were to look at the emerging markets, the U.S. and Europe as your three big buckets of growth potential or improvement, I think Europe will be in that third slot when all is said and done for 2010, but that doesn't mean it isn't getting better. It's just getting better at a slower relative rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand, and that's consistent with what you're seeing on your order books? Is that -- that's what you're saying?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for starting a half hour early to ease up the mess here this morning. Hey Larry, just kind of two strategic type of questions. I know this MDS thing is probably a tad sensitive, but were you surprised, given that the concentration was only going to take the players from four down to three, that there was an FTC objection there? And I'm really kind of asking that even from a bigger picture type of thing, is in some of these sub-niches that you're carving out in Med Tech, is there concentration issues that maybe are going to make the  navigation of the M&amp;A a little bit more difficult?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what I can share, Jeff, is we had a, we had a productive conversation with the authorities. As Dan indicated, that has come to a positive conclusion. And I suspect that, going forward, we may well have other like conversations. But I think we'll continue to be an active acquirer this year in and around the businesses that we highlighted in December, and I don't really see any reason to think that the landscape has changed in a way that will prevent us from continuing to put our acquisition capital to good use in the neighborhood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the flip side, on the divestiture side, those sound small, but what's the circumstances there? Are you guys actually getting some reverse inquiry from people who know what's non-core to Danaher and expressing some interest, or are you actively looking to prune a few things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Jeff, it's more the latter. That there's certainly things on the margin that we thought might be in better hands elsewhere. And with the economy stabilizing, it was probably a better time for us to do that here at year's end, and obviously there were some folks who were keen to be the counterparty, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's modest, strategically, probably important strategically more so than it is financially, but I would suspect we'll continue to look for those opportunities where we can over time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question I think is to do with your consumables business. You talked about strength on the Videojet side, but across your portfolio, your consumables seem to have held up quite well during this downturn. But could you discuss the pricing? Could you discuss whether there was push-back on pricing or what the sustainability was, particularly in the Product ID side, but also in your other businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with respect to pricing, as Dan indicated, we were positive again in the fourth quarter, but we've seen some, we have seen some sequential softening through the second half. I think by and large the consumables, and frankly, our entire aftermarket exposure, which is about 30% of our business now, has held up pretty well. Is it sustainable? Frankly I think we've seen in a downturn, let alone in good times, that we can get price in the aftermarket across the business, not only at Videojet, but at Hach and with the Medical businesses. I would suspect that going forward we'll be smart about price, and should get it. So I guess that makes it sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, and then the second question would just be regarding your M&amp;A and in a go-forward basis, you talked about continuing be active there. Over the past decade, you have diversified internationally quite substantially. But where you are right now, do you think that's still a</p>
          <p>focus to further diversify your business internationally? Or do you think that right now it's, the activity is likely to be sort of equal and that's not really a focus anymore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, in terms of the international exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the international exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you'll continue to see us, both organically and inorganically, become, or focus our energies globally, with a particular emphasis, as many companies are, on the emerging markets. When I look at our new product cycles, I look at some of our localization efforts in China and India, I'm very encouraged by the progress in that regard. You heard us talk about a Brazilian acquisition. This year we're working on and hopefully soon will complete the Indian acquisition in Gilbarco Veeder-Root, so we're going at those markets aggressively, inorganically, as well as organically, and they'll be, clearly they'll be a bigger part of our business, I suspect, a bigger portion of overall revenue every year going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Larry, Dan, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, when I look out to calendar '10 year, and I look at maybe the midpoint of the EPS guidance, back up to the operating margin line, it looks like maybe you need about 120 basis points of improvement there year-over-year. With all the puts and takes on which platform is absorbing restructuring cost, if you just look at the four platforms, can you just characterize which of the four you would expect the greatest margin improvement to occur, given the trailing restructuring efforts are largely complete?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, we think it'll be pretty broad-based, and I think if we, if you look at the '09 margins and you back out the incremental restructuring, we ended the year probably about 15%. So I think to get to the midpoint, if we have kind of 2.5, 3% organic growth, I think we need more like 70 or 80 basis points of core margin improvement. I think we could get 100 plus if we're more at the high end of that core growth number.</p>
          <p>It should be most pronounced in Medical Technologies, and the biggest driver of that hopefully, and we're encouraged by what we saw here in Q4, will be KaVo, but also should see some nice lift at Leica as well. The second largest contributor should be Industrial Tech and Professional Instrumentation. And Tools will be probably the lowest. We should have, we have a low bar here for Q1 in Tools, but thereafter we've got a pretty tough comp. So I suspect for the full year, Tools &amp; Components could be the smallest year-on-year contributor, but it's also, as you know, the smallest segment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, as you referenced earlier, the Med Tech piece in the fourth quarter excluding the restructuring was around 14%, I think you said?</p>

          <p>Well, absent, you're going to have SCIEX coming in with a lot of one-time costs, but absent that, I think we'd expect well over 100 basis points year-on-year margin improvement in Med Tech. Now the 14% is kind of the, we do get the seasonal volume lift in Med Tech, but it might not be a bad target overall, again, outside AB, outside SCIEX.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I understand. And then just lastly on price, were, are we treating that as kind of neutral for '10? Or are we going to attempt to get some gain out of pricing?</p>

          <p>We've still got a point of price here in Q4, and we think price will be positive in 2010.</p>
