          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Elena Doom, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson.</p>
          <p>This call and this webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We also identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.</p>
          <p>This morning we will review our financial results for the first quarter of 2012, as well as share with you our outlook for the second quarter and updated full year 2012 and, of course, allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>What a wonderful start to 2012. We had better-than-expected performance across a number of our different businesses, driving EPS above the top end of our guidance range and it is great to start with such a nice burst of cabbage.</p>
          <p>Sales were strong at $9.3 billion, representing 7% reported growth and that's on top of good growth last year. Organic growth of 6% was also strong. This performance in a more challenging macroenvironment underscores the value of the diversity of opportunity across our businesses, short and long-cycle exposure, our products and services and geographies. As expected our short-cycle businesses posted slower growth this quarter, particularly in Europe and to a lesser extent China. However, our long-cycle businesses, particularly commercial aerospace and UOP, overdrove expectations.</p>
          <p>We also saw terrific margin expansion in the quarter with segment margins up 70 basis points to 15.2% with strong sales conversion across the portfolio. As we highlighted in our March investor conference, we've made margin growth a bigger element of how we incentivize our people, so everyone's focused on it and interests are aligned.</p>
          <p>Given the strength of our first-quarter financial performance, we are raising our full year guidance a nickel on the high end and a dime on the low end. We now expect earnings to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share, up approximately 9% to 14% versus prior year on a continuing ops basis, meaning adjusting for the CPG divestiture.</p>
          <p>We think this represents a very strong outlook for the year and while we recognize the macro uncertainties that remain ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue executing on growth and productivity opportunities.</p>
          <p>As part of that execution mainstay, our seed planting initiatives have paved the way for exciting new wins, including an exclusive agreement with Inmarsat, a global satellite service provider, to provide airlines and OEMs all of the onboard hardware needed to access Inmarsat's Internet connectivity service. Global online services for commercial, BizAv and government customers will be available in 2014 and the contract is valued at an estimated $2.8 billion over the next two decades.</p>
          <p>We acquired EMS Technologies looking at the trends around aircraft connectivity and so far that's paid off really well. With the combination of their broad technology offering and our execution capabilities, we emerged the perfect partner to launch the Inmarset global connectivity network. Our Aero team did just a great job.</p>
          <p>And in ACS, Building Solutions launched Attune, a suite of professional services that combines cloud-based tools and analytics to help owners and operators reduce energy bills by as much as 20% and we are seeing terrific uptake. And at PMT we continue to invest in high ROI projects, including this quarter the expansion of a UOP adsorbents and catalyst facility focused on the removal of radioactive material from liquids. These are currently being used in Japan in response to last year's nuclear disaster. The expansion also supports the production of a new adsorbent and catalyst used by petrochemical producers and refiners.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we are off to a great start in 2012, despite the more challenging macroenvironment. And while our shorter-cycle businesses have seen an impact from the slowdowns in Europe and China, we are encouraged by the strength we are seeing in the U.S., other high-growth regions and long cycle.</p>
          <p>New product introductions have also helped our shorter-cycle businesses grow faster than the markets served, which coupled with accelerating growth in our longer-cycle businesses is leading to top-tier organic growth. We're going to keep doing the things we consistently talk about, including seed planting for growth, focusing on our key process initiatives, and continued strength of execution. In other words, staying hungry, smart, disciplined and flexible.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As Dave said, certainly feels good to report another strong quarter with sales of $9.3 billion, representing 6% organic growth for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's just go through some of the highlights on slide four. As you can see, we saw very strong performance from our longer-cycle businesses, including Aerospace and UOP, which more than offset slower growth in some of our short-cycle businesses. Regionally we saw solid growth in the Americas, up 8% reported, 5% organically, as well as continued strong performance in our high-growth regions, which were up approximately 20% in the quarter. And as expected, Europe was slower, posting only 1% organic growth and if you exclude Aerospace from that, Europe would have been down approximately 3% organically, so really in line with our expectations. China sales were up approximately 20%, driven by strong gains in both UOP and in Aerospace.</p>
          <p>Segment profit of $1.4 billion &#x2013; that's up 12% versus the prior-year with segment margins, as Dave said, expanding an impressive 70 basis points to 15.2% in the quarter. This represents approximately 25% revenue conversion, reflecting tremendous productivity as well as giving us a clear path to achieving our full-year margin targets.</p>
          <p>Below the line was largely as expected, the good news is we funded approximately $25 million in attractive repositioning projects, more than planned, and these will begin to deliver benefits beginning in 2012, the latter part of this year. Earnings per share at $1.04, up 18% on a reported basis, 21% on a continuing ops basis. So the better than expected performance largely is a result of stronger sales conversion in the quarter and obviously leveraging slightly better sales.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow came in at $300 million, which excludes approximately $250 million of pension contributions, cash pension contributions that we made in the quarter, decreased customer advances higher capital spending particularly in PMT, where we invest in capacity expansion and debottlenecking, were the primary drivers of the lower cash performance in the year. We remain confident in our full year free cash flow forecast for the year, which will approximate about 100% of free cash flow conversion. So we remain confident in our ability to do that.</p>
          <p>Slide number five, Aerospace, take a moment to go through the highlights of each of the businesses, starting with the Aero. Aero sales grew 9% in the quarter, 8% organically, to almost $3.0 billion. We saw continued strength in our commercial end markets, with commercial OE and aftermarket strength accounting for most of the gains, while Defense and Space was down slightly.</p>
          <p>Now on the commercial OE side, sales were up 22%, 18% organically, if you exclude the EMS acquisition benefits. The increases were particularly strong in BGA. BGA OE up 41%, driven by strong demand in the mid-to-large cabin aircraft segment, where Honeywell, as you know, has an outside share of content. And on the ATR side, we saw the benefits of growth in both Boeing and Airbus deliveries, resulting from the ongoing ramp in production rates.</p>
          <p>On the aftermarket, the commercial aftermarket sales were up 16% in the quarter. Strong gains in both Spares, as well as R&amp;O. Operators continue to depend on older aircraft to service the steady increases in passenger demand and we're seeing those benefits. We've had eight consecutive quarters now of double digit Spares growth, driven by continued increases in air traffic, uptake of selectables and also safety and efficiency upgrades.</p>
          <p>But of course as a reminder, since we're now lapping Spares and R&amp;O levels above prior peak demand, we expect the aftermarket growth to moderate as the comps get tougher over the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Defense and Space sales were down 1% in the quarter, 3% &#x2013; approximately down 3% organically, driven primarily by lower service revenues, as we lapped a prior year program completion and also some ramp downs, partially offset by growth in international defense. For the full year, we expect declines of approximately 5%, reflecting the current fiscal budgetary conditions and reprogramming expected to be felt more in the second half of the year. We'll talk about that more later when we talk about second half and full year guidance.</p>
          <p>Aerospace margins expanded 80 basis points in the quarter to 18.1%, largely driven by strong commercial aftermarket volume, partially offset by higher investments in the quarter in R&amp;D. Let's go now to Slide six for the highlights for ACS for the quarter.</p>
          <p>ACS sales were up 4% reported, 3% organic, with a favorable impact of acquisitions more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds. Top line performance was larger as expected in ACS, with acceleration in the long-cycle businesses more than offsetting headwinds in some of our short-cycle businesses. Now the expectation continues to be for slower organic growth in the first half for ACS compared to the second half and again, we'll give you some more of that in a moment, but first just a little bit more on the quarter.</p>
          <p>Energy, safety and security sales, ESS, while up on a reported basis, were down 1% organically, driven by lower ECC and S&amp;C sales, partially offset by strong growth in Scanning &amp; Mobility, as well as in Security. As expected, ECC sales were weak in all regions, driven by soft residential markets in Europe and China, compounded by the weak HVAC markets in the U.S. that we've been planning for, especially in light of the mild winter. The good news here is we expect some modest improvement in ECC in the second half, as we move out of the heating season, which has obviously been extraordinarily mild and affected everybody in the industry.</p>
          <p>Scanning &amp; Mobility growth, on the other hand, was robust in ACS, particularly in the Americas, as we've seen the benefit of channel gains, also strength in strategic accounts supported by new product introductions. Security also saw notable growth in North America, Intrusion, and in total, America sales for security up approximately 10%.</p>
          <p>Process Solutions sales were up 9% organically, with solid gains in all regions. The high growth regions, including the Middle East and Asia, were standouts, while growth in the developed markets, more tempered. Process Solutions also contributed to ACS' overall margin expansion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The Building Solutions and Distribution segment of ACS, or BSD, sales were up 5% organically, driven by strong Americas' fire and security distribution sales, partially offset by slower growth in the European commercial retrofit projects.</p>
          <p>Just take a minute, it's not on the slide, but just take a minute to talk a little bit more about the regional cut for ACS. Regarding Europe, we had anticipated short-cycle weakness in 2012, that's playing out. The first quarter outlook where ECS business conditions were particularly challenging and we anticipate only modest improvement in Europe in that segment in the second half.</p>
          <p>Regarding China, the Energy, Security and Safety sales got off to a slow start, ESS, with declines across most of the end markets, most notably ECC as well as Scanning &amp; Mobility, due to deceleration in infrastructure investment, soft commercial construction and also they're all &#x2013; we had difficult year-over-year comps. However, there are signs of improvement and we expect the resumption of growth within that segment within China in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And finally on the Americas, as we said, very solid growth year-over-year with increases in both orders and revenues. Scanning &amp; Mobility led the way with over 20% growth although Security, Sensing and Control, Process Solutions, and BSD, all saw above average growth in Americas in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at margins, EPS expanded margins 40 basis points to 13%, primarily driven by productivity improvements, benefits from prior period positioning contributing to that, repositioning contributing, as well as disciplined cost control within ACS. Those coupled with acquisition integration benefits, net of inflation, contributed to the margin expansion. Revenue conversion for the segment for ACS was 26% and 32% if you exclude the impact of recent acquisitions as well as foreign exchange headwinds.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to PMT, slide number seven. Performance Materials and Technologies continued their strong growth trends in the first quarter. Growth was up 19%, 12% organic, led by better than expected sales at UOP and also higher volumes in Resins &amp; Chemicals.</p>
          <p>UOP results, which as you know, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, led the way with outstanding growth of 40% supported by better-than-expected catalyst volumes and also licensing events. Further, we continue to see robust orders at UOP, where orders were up over 50% in the quarter driven by continued strong demand in both refining and petrochemical segments providing further foundation obviously for future growth. And we anticipate a very strong first half for UOP, particularly given the expected timing of certain catalyst shipments and we'll transition to a more modest second half for that business.</p>
          <p>Advanced materials sales were up 10% in the quarter on a reported basis, although roughly flat organically. Plans execution was strong across the board, R&amp;C benefited from higher volumes despite softer market conditions in Asia. Weaker demand in Europe and Asia contributed to lower sales of specialty products as expected. Foreign sales were impacted unfavorably by the negative year-over-year pricing due to overall supply conditions and again no surprise there.</p>
          <p>So in &#x2013; kind of in summary, a great quarter for PMT. Margins up nearly 20%, despite the headwinds and better than anticipated for the quarter. So, better than we initially guided. And obviously, Andreas and the team just continue to do a great job executing on growth and profitability levels, while also continuing to invest in the business.</p>
          <p>Let's finish then with the business segments on slide eight with Transportation Systems. In the quarter, TS sales increased 1% on an organic basis, but declined 1% on a reported basis. And it represents solid performance driven by a significant number of new product launches in the face of challenging macro headwinds with European light vehicle production down nearly 8% in the quarter and also very difficult aftermarket conditions in Europe.</p>
          <p>Turbo sales were up slightly on an organic basis with new business launches of favorable mix of platforms and increased turbo penetration offsetting OE production declines, allowing us to outperform in this market.</p>
          <p>Regionally, Europe was up 2% organic in turbo with mix performance across the board with the cross section of customers. North America saw a good growth; however, it was impacted by the mix of light trucks and also commercial vehicles in the quarter. So, going forward, we're going to continue to see increased turbo penetration as a growth driver in all of the segments and all classes of vehicles.</p>
          <p>Asia had strong growth, excluding China, which continues to be impacted by a weak commercial vehicles market. Although, we believe that worst of those declines are now behind us and we're expecting to lap lower comps in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Of course, what's impressive here is that TS experienced, on essentially flat revenues, margin expansion of 40 basis points, largely driven by productivity gains, including the benefits from prior period repositioning actions.</p>
          <p>So, with that review of the segments, let's go to slide nine and let's discuss expectations for the second quarter. Summarizing sort of at the bottom first before going through each of the businesses, we're planning for a total sales in the second quarter to be in the range of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, up 4% to 6% from the prior year, reflecting good organic growth and EPS in a range of $1.09 to $1.13, up 9% to 13% on a continuing ops basis.</p>
          <p>Just a couple of points on each of the businesses. Aerospace sales in the second quarter are expected to be up 6% to 8%, driven by continued strength in the commercial businesses, partially offset by lower sales in Defense and Space. And again as a reminder, we expect commercial OE growth to continue to ramp reflecting strong year-over-year gains, while the commercial aftermarket growth will begin to moderate due to tougher comps, although still outpacing flight hours.</p>
          <p>In ACS for the quarter, for the second quarter, we're forecasting sales up 2% to 4%, reflecting stable growth in both Process Solutions and BSD and modest improvement in ESS, as a result of stabilization in some of our short-cycle end markets. So, considering these factors, in addition to the healthy long-cycle backlog conversion we anticipate growth will accelerate through the second half of the year for ACS, and more about that in a few moments.</p>
          <p>For PMT, sales are estimated to be up 13% to 15%, driven by continued strength in UOP, the phenol plant acquisition and also moderate organic growth in advanced materials. Pricing is expected to remain a headwind overall for PMT in the second quarter, although we do see opportunities selectively in certain end markets.</p>
          <p>Transportation sales are forecasted to be down about 7% to 9%, largely driven by unfavorable impact of the weaker euro. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, we anticipate sales essentially flat for TS, against the backdrop of continued lower European light vehicle production, which is expected to be 9% &#x2013; down 9% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now our outlook continues to assume European production down 8% for the year, which we recognize may be more on the conservative side relative to some of the other estimates that you'll see. However, we think we're &#x2013; what we're seeing to-date suggest that the challenging conditions there will continue throughout this year.</p>
          <p>So, for Honeywell, in total; second quarter sales again 4% to 6% slightly less than the first quarter up 4% to 6%, another good quarter of revenue conversion and segment profit growth driving earnings per share, our expectation 9% at 13% up on a continuing ops basis.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to the full year guidance to give a little more color to the raise that Dave took us through in his introductory comments, slide number 10. As you can see from the table, we've revised our full year guidance obviously reflecting the strength of our first quarter results as well as what we believe is the balanced review at this stage for the remainder of 2012.</p>
          <p>We expect sales now to be in a range of $38 billion to $38.6 billion for the year, with slightly better than originally planned sales conversion, driving segment margin slightly higher than original guidance. We're now expecting expanding margins from 60 to 80 basis points over 2011. It's clearly a testament to the quality of our earnings outlook and the ability of the organization to execute key product &#x2013; key productivity levers and they were obviously a reflection too of the emphasis and the focus that we're putting on margin and margin expansion.</p>
          <p>And as Dave referenced earlier, we're also now expecting EPS in the range of $4.35 to $4.55, which reflects an increase of $0.10 to the low end, $0.05 to the high end of our previous guidance. So, on a continuing ops basis, again adjusting for CPG, we see earnings up 9% to 14% for the year, which I think is solid performance, very solid performance against any comparative group.</p>
          <p>So, now let's walk through some of the key planning. Just go to the bottom of the page on the planning assumptions. Some of the first half/second half dynamics at play.</p>
          <p>Starting with Aerospace. As we've said, second half sales are expected to moderate due to the tougher commercial aftermarket comps and the more outsized Defense and Space headwinds. Defense sales are planned down for the second half somewhere in the range of 6% to 8% versus approximately 2% in the first half; again, built-up on detail based upon programmatic detail. In ACS, we're anticipating better organic growth from the short-cycle products businesses, in the second half with stabilized in-market conditions, as well as easier second half comps. The long-cycle businesses are expected to be more of the same, so good overall growth for ACS in the second half.</p>
          <p>As we've said for PMT, we're planning for overall slower organic growth in the second half against tough comps, driven by UOP which has experienced a strong &#x2013; very strong first quarter and we expect again a strong quarter for UOP in the second quarter. So, UOP is tracking ahead of our original planning framework, which is more skewed now to the first half. And in advanced materials, we've lapped the acquisition of the phenol plant covered better organic growth as expected as a result of moderately improved end markets.</p>
          <p>Now the second half organic growth is expected to improve at Transportation Systems, driven by continued up-tick of new launches offsetting lower European light vehicle production, as well as what we anticipate to be continued weak &#x2013; relatively weak commercial vehicle markets in China.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, while uncertainties remain, obviously, in the global macro environment, we're bolstered by the continued strength of our execution, which is characterized by stronger sales conversion, productivity gains supporting that conversion and the seed planting that we continue to do successfully for our future.</p>
          <p>So, finally, in summary, on slide number seven (sic) [11] (25:20), before turning it back over to Elena for Q&amp;A, we're encouraged obviously by the ongoing positive trend in commercial Aerospace both OE and aftermarket. With aftermarket growth sustaining well above flight hours, industrial-strength in high-growth regions continue to be the bright spots with UOP and Aero fueling strong double digit growth. Turbo is benefiting from a strong industry position and platform launches, roughly offsetting greater European light vehicle production declines. And our long cycle businesses continue to deliver offsetting a mixed short-cycle order book.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to execute on our strategies and sustaining growth investments and seed planting for the future. We're expecting continued good organic growth and strong sales conversion with continued traction on commercial and R&amp;D effectiveness, all while controlling our fixed cost through OEF, as reflected in the terrific margin expansion we saw across the company in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So to put in perspective, we're targeting double-digit earnings growth in 2012 from continuing ops, underscoring the organization's ability to be a top-tier performer, with a balanced portfolio of short and long-cycle businesses, delivering above-average growth and continued margin expansion.</p>
          <p>We think this revised outlook reflects again a balanced view of the global economic environment, including where we see strength and where we see opportunities across the Honeywell portfolio.</p>
          <p>So with that, Elena, I'll turn it over to you for Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>One of the things you called out in ACS was weak Europe and weak China. And I guess my question is, is it sequentially weaker or just continues to be sluggish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it continues to be sluggish. We first saw Europe &#x2013; I think we talked about this back in December, we started to see weakness there and that weakness has continued and it's consistent with what we forecasted for the year. We said back then that we were going to assume Europe was in recession for the whole year and unfortunately, I think we're going to be right, fortunately we planned for it. China is also I'd say, pretty consistent with what we said, so I wouldn't say we're seeing anything consistently &#x2013; or any declamation there. Dave?</p>

          <p>And so, it is too early to say that that's a trend, but it's obviously encouraging, Scott, just some additional color, it's obviously encouraging in light of what we think is still a very balanced, appropriately prudent guidance.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I mean, it's going to be my follow-on really, is that when you think about the potential upside you have for the rest of the year, it seems like ACS is a bit of a wildcard. I mean, do you think this is &#x2013; this quarter ends up being the low watermark for organic growth? I mean, I know you're saying 2% to 4% for 2Q, but that seems pretty conservative.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Maybe, first, on the R&amp;D and Aero, it was 100 basis points of pressure there. Could you give a little more color on &#x2013; was that some opportunistic stuff? Or, what are you going after there? And, is that &#x2013; how should we think about a run rate in terms of the R&amp;D pressure there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way I think about it is we're winning a lot. And, just seeing the Inmarsat one, which is not one we would have forecasted six months ago, it's one the guys have started working on. We continue to win stuff. And, all I'd say is it's just one of those things that we're going to manage in the total context of Aero because we're sure going to find a way to support all those wins.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd just add, Shannon, to what Dave said. The good part of it obviously is it's driven &#x2013; as Dave said, it's driven by the success that we're having in the marketplace. The second thing is that, looking over the course of 2012, we expect for Aerospace while up on the dollars to be basically even with 2011 in terms of R&amp;D percent. So, maybe some pressure on that as the year progresses but it's not something that &#x2013; I think it works itself way &#x2013; through over the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then on UOP, you pointed out the lumpiness which obviously we're all familiar with, but you have several quarters here in a row of some pretty monster numbers. Can you maybe give a little more color on geographically and by end market customer, the parts of that story that are not quarterly lumpiness and that are more of a continuing driver here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reload side of it consists &#x2013; continues to have what you'd think of as more ongoing, continues to get better. But, they're &#x2013; these guys are &#x2013; they're winning all around the world. There is no one thing that I would point to that says that's driving all of it. I suppose some of the <mark type="ph" /> Oleflex (32:01) wins are &#x2013; you could point to that have been just stellar, but all in all, they're winning across the board. Dave?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just say that the queue is robust on the catalyst side of the business right now, and we're also going to have, in the first half of this year, very strong royalty revenues as well for UOP. Obviously, as we've guided, the growth percent is not going to be there the same way in the second half, Shannon, for UOP just as a result of that very strong first half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Just a couple questions; Dave Anderson, I don't actually think you said the flight hour numbers in the quarter. If you did, I missed them. Could you let us know what those were and what you're expecting for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, I think around 3.5 for ATR in the quarter. And we're expecting in that range, Jeff, in the 4% range for the full year. Stronger, by the way, on BGA and as I talked about, BGA was strong not only on the OE side, but it was also very strong on the ATR &#x2013; or on the aftermarket side; I'm sorry. So, good &#x2013; very good quarter for commercial Aerospace aftermarket in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there a way on this Inmarsat deal for us to think about shift set value or some methodology like that to get our head around the opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that on my fingertips, Jeff. I don't know that we normally would disclose that even. But I can promise you it's a good one and it's a nice bluebird.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And, then I was just wondering on ACS; obviously, there is going to be FX and M&amp;A moving around all the time. But, stripping that away, is something with a three handle on it what we should expect going forward? I think historically you've said maybe it's closer to 25 or even low 20s. Is that number moving up to some of the things you talked about at your Investor Day work their way through the portfolio here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, I think that the number that we talked about, the 20s &#x2013; mid-20s is a very good target for ACS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then just one last thing; can you update us on what you see for restructuring benefits rolling through in 2012 based on the actions in 2011 and the few things you did here in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll look that up for you. We did that. We did. While we get that number, just tell you a little bit about the $25 million that we took in the quarter; we're probably going to see anywhere between $6 million and $7 million of operating income left from that in addition this year and about $13 million in 2013. And, we've got what, about $129 million, $130 million of operating income from repositioning? Elena, what's the number that you have?</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Dave and Dave. Nice quarter. Dave Anderson, I wondered if maybe you could just comment on the aftermarket again on just commercial, just trying to better understand it. When I think about your first quarter last year, you had 14% growth and spares were up 28%, and repair and overhaul was up 6%, and you look at what you did this year, you're beating that. You're at 16% and spares continues to be strong and repair and overhaul. And I think the commentary was last year that eventually we'd see a re-coupling of the flight hours; you mentioned. 4% is the assumption for the year. Are we seeing a bigger restock here by airlines? Are we seeing higher provisioning? What is really driving this right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's a couple of things, Peter, that are working. First of all, as we said, we're benefiting from the active fleets and, if you will, the mix of that active fleet in terms of some of the older aircrafts that are being put into usage. We've got less parked aircraft which is supporting it. So, those two things are definitely at work.</p>
          <p>I think we're also seeing for us the benefit of selectables, which is supporting us; higher penetration in terms of capture on those selectables with airlines, just doing a very, very, good job of executing.</p>
          <p>Now that double-digit rate growth, as you said, in terms of spares growth and the overall double-digit growth that we've seen on the commercial aftermarket and the ATR aftermarket specifically, we expect that to &#x2013; good growth but obviously to subside and more in line, although still outpacing, flight hours in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, that's helpful. I just wanted to understand, it seems like you're continuing to see outsized growth there. And, then just as a follow-up, to stick within the rules; Dave Cote, can you maybe just give us a little highlight, how you see the M&amp;A pipeline going forward for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, the pipeline is always good. It's always a question of is it actionable and can we actually make &#x2013; can &#x2013; if the pricing makes sense and can we make good sense of it? So, I would say the pipeline is always the same and it'll be a question of how well does the pricing look and can we make it happen. The nice thing about it is having a big, full pipeline all the time means that we never have to overpay because we can be very confident that we've got other good stuff in line. And, the more we can find things like EMS technologies, you can be sure we're going to make sure we make them happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. The question in ACS, specifically the Security, Scanning &amp; Mobility, Dave Anderson's commentary regarding the geographic differences between North America up 10% but then commentary that China is weaker &#x2013; China weak on the infrastructure side. But, North America has not had a robust non-res construction cycle either. So, what are the geographic dynamics that play there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Deane, let me make sure I understand. You're referencing specifically what business there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The Security, Scanning &amp; Mobility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, Elena, why don't you just give a little color on the &#x2013; some of the regional data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, Dean, Security and HSM are obviously strong globally but in the Americas they've been particularly strong. We were &#x2013; we saw growth in the Security business in the double-digit &#x2013; low double-digit range in the first quarter organically, largely driven by North America intrusion which was up in the 15% to 20% range in the quarter and Scanning &amp; Mobility up in the mid-20s organically within the U.S. so very strong performance. The performance in China and in Europe in particular is a bit more muted but within Security and Scanning &amp; Mobility actually down slightly organically in the quarter within those regions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of that, though, is also timing related. And, you're going to see that, Deane. Those are &#x2013; in terms of size of business, et cetera, you're going to see that kind of movement quarter-to-quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>

          <p>We all care, Dave. We all care. Good to see <mark type="indiscernible" /> and range (41:25), it's getting quite rare these days. First of all, Dave, could you maybe just clarify your comment on the ACS short cycle trends? You mentioned an improvement towards the backend of 1Q. Was that a comment on China or was that a broader comment on the short cycle portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really a broader comment, Nigel. It's just &#x2013; it's I think reflective of the fact that we've seen little bit of a strengthening there broadly as we exited the first quarter and clearly doesn't &#x2013; as I said doesn't cause us to believe that's a trend but it's a positive sign and there's a lot going on obviously to influence the outcome, both in terms of new product introductions; we've got some tremendous introductions weighted to the second half of the year as well as just continuing to grow in high-growth regions. So, there's a number of things that we think will add to hopefully that trend line.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then just a follow-on; the &#x2013; in the free cash flow, the accrued liabilities line was a bit more of a negative than we normally see in 1Q. Could you just maybe comment on that, Dave?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really has to do with customer advances as much as anything that's deferred revenue. That's now being recognized in terms of sales in the quarter. Some of those are associated with longer term &#x2013; most of that's associated with longer-term contracts so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. First, Dave, to use your cabbage analogy a little bit, occasionally there's rabbits that come after you when you have a lot of cabbage. What are you doing to make sure they don't ruin what you see? Where do you &#x2013; where are you taking some extra efforts? Obviously, restructuring was one. But, are there some other things you're asking your managers to do to be vigilant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, it's the investor rabbits that we're trying to attract, Howard. So, I think this should give them a lot of focus on it. We're constantly focusing on what's next. It's one of the things that we do. The whole evolution concept that I was talking about at the Investor Conference, it's just how we think about the company. So, some of that stuff we are ready to talk about and you are seeing; some is in process and you're not seeing yet or &#x2013; and we're not talking about it. But, I can promise you that, as I said at the beginning, we are &#x2013; we stay hungry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then on that same note, I know I tend to focus on thinking about Process Solutions as being largely Energy, but there are a lot of other businesses in there. And, we've continued to see FDA pressure on some customers to step up and do things in that market. Could you address some of the other opportunities outside of Energy and Process Solutions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the big places for us outside Energy are pulp and paper, farmer and power, and we are doing pretty well in all of those. So, I am very bullish on what I think our Process Solutions business can do going forward. We've got some just terrific product there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there something &#x2013; I mean I know there's always a lot of things in the pipeline. Is there anything you can sort of talk about in terms of new developments?</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Stanford Bernstein (sic) [Sanford C. Bernstein] (46:00). Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. You are making this look easy, Dave, quarter after quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nice to hear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know it's not. It is a steady stream. I'm afraid I'm not going to get invited to the next party if we don't have a good thing to say though, so you've got to keep them coming. Two questions then, one a little more detailed. On the Aerospace aftermarket side, are you seeing a difference in terms of the discretionary versus nondiscretionary parts growth? So is this, for example, mechanical versus the electrical side? Or is there not much difference now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on the ATR side, I think again it's really driven by the things that we talked about Steve earlier, which is just the aircraft utilization, the mix of that aircraft, the strong penetration that we have in terms of selectables. Obviously we're getting a large mechanical benefit from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I would say the avionics side is pretty strong too, with the RMU growth that we've seen over the last four or five quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was going to cite that for BGA particularly is where we have seen that, is the RMU growth, Elena correctly points out, on the BGA side. We had actually stronger growth in BGA as a percent during the quarter. So that has done very well.</p>
          <p>The other thing is on the BGA side, there was deferral of maintenance that occurred, and what we are seeing now is a real demand into the system and pretty good visibility in terms of that demand. So we are quite encouraged by that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's across your different product platforms then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other thing obviously as you talk to operators and others is just the quality of the upgrades, particularly the cockpit upgrades that are offered by Honeywell and the significant appeal of those upgrades. So I hear that anecdotally all the time. I think there's just a lot of goodness there, and that's showing up in the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then at a higher level, if we step back and talk about, see the weakness in Europe again, and then just the question on emerging markets and whether they are de-selling or increasing a little bit, the U.S. still insulated from that. But in your business are you &#x2013; is there any thought that the U.S., should Europe not recover, that at some point this starts to impact your businesses in the U.S.? Or do you feel like you know what we can continue at this kind of clip from share gain et cetera in the U.S. regardless of what happens, well within reason, overseas? Are we insulated in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say both things you said are true. The first one is there's &#x2013; it's a globally interconnect &#x2013; or I'd say there's two stages there. With the first, we are a globally interconnected economy. So there's &#x2013; if Europe continues to drag even beyond next year because they just don't get the political will to do what they need to then it definitely will have an impact in the U.S. We would argue that regardless of what that economic outlook is we will outperform in that &#x2013; whatever the environment is because of the work that we've done to have the right products, right services, everybody is staying hungry, a lot of the programs that we have launched over the last 10 years are really starting to come to fruition. We've got a lot of good stuff still coming. The pipeline is full for us on everything; new products, the geographies that we see, the services that we have been able to come up with. So, I still feel very good about our ability to outperform regardless of the environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing just, Steve, if I could just add is it's obviously against the backdrop of a continued weak housing market and overall construction business...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...which are obviously huge drivers both in terms of the economy as well as we will be beneficiaries of it. So I think, Steve, as we see improvements there I think we're going to see actually a net upside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Dave, following that up, are you seeing any commercial &#x2013; improvement in commercial pricing on, for example, HBS or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in general we do a pretty good job in pricing as we've said before, Steve, in all our businesses. We really just try to do it on the basis of new products and value that we're able to provide. So I would say we're still going to continue to do well there.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from John Inch from Bank of America. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Elana on John's behalf. My first question is about the progression of EPS this year. So historically the first quarter represents only about 20% to 21% of full year EPS. So if we extrapolate out to the full year, this gets us to over $5.00 of earnings. So, in other words, why would this year be more front-end loaded than previous years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From your lips, Elana.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Conservatism or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take a shot at that, Elana, and it's a very, very good question, obviously something that we've spent a lot of time analyzing and studying here internally. A couple of things I think that we have pointed out in the call, number one is obviously the strength that we've experienced in the commercial Aerospace aftermarket. Again we're lapping eight consecutive quarters of double-digit spares increases now, and so while we're still expecting the commercial aftermarket to grow ahead of utilization rates as we have said, we're not going to see the 15% to 20% growth in the quarters that we saw in the last four quarters.</p>
          <p>We're going to see a weaker Defense and Space, that's just timing. Defense and Space down 2% to 3% in the first half, down 6% to 8% in the second half. I mean that's just built in to get to the 5% which we continue to believe is the right kind of guidance for you for the full year.</p>
          <p>And we have talked a lot this morning about UOP, and we've talked about catalyst volumes but also some licensing volumes. Those are going to be more normalized in the second half. In addition you'll recall that Petrobras contract award, the FEED award, the Front-End Engineering Design award, that's almost $100 million of less revenues second half UOP compared to first half. So there's a bunch of things, so as we roll off these first-half positives, we will see some partial offset by modest improvement we think in the short cycle sales, we have talked about that, but it's going to be more like if you look at first half/second half, it's going to be more like a 48/52 kind of year we think in 2012 in terms of the distribution of those earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to circle back to your comments about Aerospace R&amp;D investments this year being flat. When you talk about R&amp;D, are you including launch costs in that bucket? Or would you characterize launch costs as having a different trajectory year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Launch is excluded from what I just mentioned, and you'll recall launch is down significantly year-over-year because of the proactive work that we did in 2011. You'll recall 2011 second quarter in terms of the launch contribution, the larger launch contribution recognition. So the R&amp;D &#x2013; and importantly what I'm talking about is dollar-wise more spend driven by success in the marketplace, when you look at that as a percent of revenue given the growth that we are experiencing in Aerospace, we're talking about in line for the full year, roughly in line for Aerospace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you give us a magnitude of the decline in launch costs year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Launch is down about $80 million to $90 million year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask you about the pricing in the quarter, how much it contributed to top-line growth and also what was the overall per total company price cost impact on margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Elena, I'm going to let you field the question on the price. I believe I don't have that &#x2013; Elana, I don't have that data right in front of me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On pricing, net across the company, Elana, it was about 1.5% on the top line. From a price/cost headwind, we can spend some more time offline going through each of the businesses, but it was obviously net positive for the company in terms of margins.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's about $80 million. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:33) from a bottom-line standpoint we offset that with a gain.

          <p>Okay. Understood. And bizjet, you mentioned kind of the OE strength in the quarter. We're hearing more noise about Hawker Beechcraft kind of potentially filing for bankruptcy. I mean could you quantify &#x2013; I know it's not the biggest thing in the world, but what it might mean with respect to sales, earnings and I guess receivables risk?</p>

          <p>Well, clearly, there's been a lot in the news. It's really difficult to say, really difficult to predict what the outcome is going to be there. From a standpoint of receivables for us, it's &#x2013; at this stage in terms of our net exposure, it's relatively small, relatively insignificant. And we've contemplated any risk that that may pose to us, we've contemplated that in our forward guidance.</p>

          <p>Well, as you might imagine, we're really pleased with our start to the year. All the seed planting we've done over the years with a consistent strategy for growth, productivity and our enablers just continue to play out and they have lots of runway. Our diversity of opportunity in businesses, products and geographies really is a terrific advantage. Because of all that, we expect and continue to outperform in the future. And even with all that going for us, we're not resting. As I said earlier, you can expect us to stay hungry, smart, disciplined and flexible. It's our intent to be your best investment. Thanks.</p>
