        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and welcome everyone. I have the honor to open this Q2 presentation from Atlas Copco, and I will hand over directly to the moderator for today, the CFO, Hans Ola Meyer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> and very welcome also from me to everybody and also, to everyone that is participating on the telephone conference. Of course, before everybody starts to wonder too much, I can say, if you see me doing funny faces or if I move even slower than usual, it's because I had a little bit of a bicycle accident a few days ago, but we have tried to manage any way. So, now we have settled those questions that we don't need anything on that in the Q&amp;A. So, hopefully, we will get Q&amp;As focusing on the results, and so on, and so forth.</p>
          <p>We will do this in the normal format. I will hand over to Ronnie. He has a few slides that he would like to comment on the second quarter. And then we will &#x2013; hopefully a rather quick Q&amp;A, so that everybody can go back to their summer vacations and whatever you are up to.</p>
          <p>So with that, very good, I'll hand over to Ronnie and we'll take Q&amp;A later on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Hans Ola, and good afternoon, all of you here and good morning, of those who are dialing from the other side of the world. As usual, I will go through the presentation and refer to the slides when I move on, so that we are talking about the same slide.</p>
          <p>Let us go immediately to the business highlights. As you have already seen in the press release we have put out, I think it is a very strong order growth and we saw that in all business areas and we saw that almost in all customer segments and in all regions, so it's an easy statement to make on that one.</p>
          <p>We had record orders received in Asia. We got fantastic order received in South America, as well as in Australia. And one thing I would like to say here when you see the third point is a very strong performance in aftermarket. I think our investments, what we have done since years already, is really now proving also to yield very good development. It has been so good even that we do not have a mix difference between quarter one, compared to quarter two, although you'll see that the equipment has been growing rapidly.</p>
          <p>Record operating margin, if we compare comparable businesses, coming from, of course, very good volume, solid pricing, our efficiency measures, our innovation, which we have done over the last 18 months, I think is also yielding good result. And of course, we should not forget the currency. I think one thing we should make, if we could make a comparison sequentially with quarter one to quarter two, we more or less had 1% coming from revaluation of the receivables. And then this was my biggest surprise, I think a very strong operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>If we then take slide number four, the figures, they speak for themselves. Operating margins, 3.5 almost, compared to last year, it is 69% up. The earnings per share more than two, which is a very solid development, and the operating cash flow SEK2.8 billion.</p>
          <p>If I go then to slide number six, giving you an overview of the different components, you see it's very nice to make a presentation like this when you'll have double-digit, high double-digit figures. And maybe one could say, and I will comment later on when I'll talk about Australia, you say only plus 15, but I will make my remark later on that one. But anyhow a very solid development, plus 35% in the last three months and in the year it we exclude cancellations, almost 30%.</p>
          <p>If I then go to the different components and we take the Americans, and more specific North America, a very strong development, compared to, of course, the last year when we should also not forget that last year quarter two was a softer quarter. But we see a good development from equipment and also, a solid development from the aftermarket. One particular remark here is the demand on the industrial equipment. This is really developing well. See that especially on the Industrial Technique side, as well as on the Compressor side.</p>
          <p>When we look to the sales, plus 56, it is a bit inflated by the Quincy acquisition, which is a bit more than 10%. So, if we exclude that, it would come to plus 45. On Quincy maybe, another remark on that, I think it goes very well. The integration is up today according to plan. I think also distributors from Quincy are on-board and we only have our nose in the direction of growth.</p>
          <p>When we take then South America, all countries are doing extremely well. Of course, we always talk about Brazil and Chile, but I can say also Argentina and Colombia are doing very well and you see it also in the figures.</p>
          <p>Then I go to slide number eight, Europe and Africa. Europe is maybe &#x2013; if we compare with quarter one, it's the &#x2013; maybe the biggest change. We see a bit of a mixed view in Europe, where the Nordic, as it says here, Eastern Europe and Russia are developing solidly, where Southern Europe, and I think it's no surprise for any one of you, is weak and that's also what we see. But anyhow, compared to last year, plus 28. Of course, it comes if you have countries like Russia that were really down. Of course, they come up now at a reasonable level already.</p>
          <p>Then talk about Africa. The northern part, Central Africa solid is mainly mining driven, where South Africa is flat. Middle East, solid at a good level.</p>
          <p>And then going to Asia and Australia, I'm on slide number nine, like I said, already, record in Asia, very strong China and India. It was very strong the last months in China. But also what is good to see that we have a positive development in Japan. I think we see, again, good development in Japan and South Korea, but that was already in quarter one that we saw an upturn.</p>
          <p>Also the same remark, as I made generally, a very good development in the aftermarket. I think our investments, which we started to do in Asia for years, is also paying back and that's always good to see because we know where our resilience is coming from. And we have a high activity in the manufacturing industry and I think that's also no surprise for any one of you.</p>
          <p>And then Australia, like I said, plus 15, but we also should not forget that Australia was quicker out of the drop because that came a bit earlier, but they have a very favorable development overall, but more specific in the mining segment. It is going extremely well.</p>
          <p>That was about the continents. If we take then the quarter, and you see here, it's not more to say that you see the big swing, maybe after Mittal though, I didn't believe in that that we had a V-shaped recovery. I think I cannot deny that we have it here, although I tried to talk you all out of it when you asked me a couple of months or even couple of quarters back on that one.</p>
          <p>Then sales bridge. Yeah, nothing more, only that you see the difference between received and revenue. It's almost 2 billion, although the book-to-bill is 1.1. We feel a bit stressed in the supply chain, but I don't think that that will be such a big problem for to continue to get good revenue figures.</p>
          <p>Maybe here on price, you can see plus one, I think we also see that we are able to get good price management, positive price management into the market. Currency, minus 3. That is mainly coming from the SEK.</p>
          <p>Then let us talk about the different business areas. Not much to say on slide number 13. I think the ROCE, of course, is developing in the right direction as we keep working capital under control.</p>
          <p>If we then take Compressor Technique, plus 28% on organic is a fantastic result, coming then a very good development in standard machines, stationary, as well as supportables. That's good to see. We see that the rental companies in certain components are really ordering. Very strong China and other emerging markets and we have seen a good development in North America, and in some markets. In Europe, I think we've seen a good development there.</p>
          <p>Very strong development on aftermarket. I think they have performed very well. I think the structural changes we did a couple of years back I think is really yielding very good result, and also in the emerging market, it's going well.</p>
          <p>And the profit, 23.2, coming from a good price, innovation on these products, the volume. But one should not forget that the euro also has helped, the euro/dollar. So, we got here a bit more help from the revaluation of the balance sheet, as we got in the other business areas. And we keep on further developing our channels with the acquisition, yeah.</p>
          <p>Then I go to slide number 16, construction and mining, plus 40 organic. So, it's always nice to see that. Of course, we know we compare with a lower quarter in 2009, but anyhow, I think it is strong on equipment side, as well on aftermarket. I think here also we could say that we have done fantastic on the aftermarket as also on the consumable side. We continue to see a favorable demand in the mining industry, so that is developing well.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, 18, fantastic to see that, if we can recuperate so quickly. Here, you see the &#x2013; it's not so much currency, but it's definitely good volume mix, and I think also the new products, the efficiency measures we have been taking over the last years.</p>
          <p>And then we had a good, fantastic launch of new products in the Bauma in Germany. So, the big exhibition. And of course, there, it's &#x2013; again, it's the continuous development of new products we could have &#x2013; we were able to show here what we had done during the most tough crisis we had in many years, and our commitment to new products.</p>
          <p>Nothing to say on 17, I think it shows very clear. Then, Industrial Technique, plus 40, improvement in all customer segments. We go on, and we see a very solid recoup in North America and in Asia. I think India and China are doing very well. And we see some improvements in Europe. And we all know that Europe is very important for this business area.</p>
          <p>And it's good also to see that the MVI industry is investing again and upgrading existing lines or new lines. And operating margin, 18.8, I remember last year when I had to make an announcement of a loss. You see the big change here. I think it's the guys and the organization have done a fantastic work to make it a real profitable business again. Of course, volume helps, but I think they also have worked hard on the cost savings. And we keep investing in this business, for those ones who had doubt in that. I think we also strengthened our channel here in United States.</p>
          <p>If you look to this slide, 19, you see really here the recoup, very quickly when we get good volume, and we have taken a couple of measures. It is a very nice business to be in.</p>
          <p>Then I'm going to slide number 21, yeah, the result I think I have nothing more to say that &#x2013; yeah, I think it is a fantastic profit, 20.1, and a very strong PUFI. We all can see that, I think also basic earnings per share, but I think I'll repeat myself now.</p>
          <p>Then the profit bridge and I'm sure you will get more questions on that, but then I hand over later to Hans Ola, because he will tell you all the secrets about this bridge. But mainly you can say that, I think, the volume and, of course, the measures we have taken is &#x2013; yeah, you see that in this result, but it is &#x2013; a lot comes from the volume &#x2013; price volume on that one. And of course, the mix is favorable.</p>
          <p>Then I will skip slide 23, which shows you the different business areas. We can take that later. Then balance sheet, not more to say that &#x2013; okay, you see the cash, but of course, we paid dividend and we also paid back one loan of 2 billion. I think the working capital, you will see that in the balance sheet capital structure, not much is changing.</p>
          <p>Loans &#x2013; I'm now on slide 26 &#x2013; I think also that, you see one loan has disappeared as we paid it back. I think here we come to the cash flow. Of course, cash flow, a very strong absolute figure in profit, of course, that helps. And then you see also the change in working capital and the increase in rental equipment, which is still very modest, compared to the growth, but maybe I'll repeat myself. As I said, also last time, maybe this is the last time we come with such a high figure, but you never know how we go to surprise ourselves in that. But 2.8 from operation is a very solid figure. It's even higher when you look to 2009, the same quarter.</p>
          <p>Okay. So, then the outlook, yeah, always difficult to make that &#x2013; to see what is next. But when I listen to the market and see to our people, yeah, I think we see an overall demand to increase somewhat in the area. We see still a good favorable development in the emerging markets and that for all the business areas. And I think the investments in North America, I believe they will increase gradually, as we see what happens in euro with all the measures taken on that one.</p>
          <p>So that was me, Hans Ola. So, we are...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ronnie. We will then move swiftly over to the Q&amp;A session. And before we take the first questions here in Stockholm, perhaps I can ask the operator to repeat the process for the questions on the telephone line.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and we will alternate between the Stockholm crowd here and the telephone as usual. If I have the first question here in Stockholm, anyone that volunteers, otherwise we might start &#x2013; yeah, we have one question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n, Handelsbanken. First question to you, Hans Ola, or even to Ronnie, of course. On the gearing, given the cash flow development we have, your gearing now, if you look at the EBITDA, I think it's about eight times, right, or 40% on net debt-to-equity. What do you consider, over a longer period of time, a decent gearing and how much could you take that up in a shorter timeframe, if you would find something very interesting to buy? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have touched this issue before. And I think we can say that the slide that Ronnie showed on net debt-to-EBITDA showing a very steady deleveraging as you point out comes from a ratio in 2007 of close to two. And that was just after a major capital restructuring we did at that time. In talking about the future, I think you can say that the readiness to lever the balance sheet with an acquisition or as a result of an acquisition should be seen in that perspective.</p>
          <p>So I don't think that anyone in the board has any problem with seeing that there is a capacity to use the strength of the balance sheet, if it goes all the way up to that or somewhere close to that. But whatever number you use, you will come to by just making the numbers that there is ample room for harboring an acquisition or a couple of acquisitions. So, any more guidance than that, we are not prepared to give at this point in time, but that is important to remember. The ambition for the group is always to take all the opportunities for the growth. And it's important for us to have, from a financial side, never any doubt that that can be catered for.</p>
          <p>Second, after that, comes, of course, any other growth project organic. And third, we have shown in the past and it might well be also in the future that on top of that we have room to make certain further adjustments to the capital, but we will come back to that as that appears, so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is regarding mining. Ronnie, you highlighted that mining demand seems strong all over the world. Have the company sensed any hesitation among customers when it comes to fluctuating commodity prices, but also tax issues in Australia and stuff like that that maybe put some limiting factors to product orders also in the quarter, anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we hear, I think it's still that it go solid. I think when it comes to the commodity prices, I think also, I think, most companies in that industry have learnt that the long-term demand will be strong. And I think that they have to continue to keep investing. And that's also when we talk to the leaders of the companies, I think that's what we really get, and that's the input we get, I think, when we look around. Of course, if you had a big drop, but I think the drops are not so tremendous. So, I think that trend is still positive.</p>
          <p>On the tax one, even on Australia, if you hear me talking, that will be maybe a bit more &#x2013; maybe a bit doubt, but I think that will go on. I think we don't feel it and don't hear that in the market that will hold back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Anders Roslund, &#xC5;landsbanken. I just had two questions regarding order intake. Are there any large orders included or anything which you would call one-off or seasonal effects in both Mining and Compressor Technique?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To start on Compressor Technique, and if you would hint a bit to gas in process, this big huge one, I think we don't have that this time, unfortunately, I should say. So, it's more spread all over. If we look to &#x2013; if we take China, if I see more the pattern, it is a lot of small orders. So, it's much more, I could say, fragmented, which we like more &#x2013; that one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the mining, I think it's also spread, but, of course, you have a couple of bigger orders which you have, and that's typical, but you have in that &#x2013; but it's not &#x2013; if I listen and see, it's not different from a normal pattern, not much different. So, there is a couple of big orders, but that you have always in these. It's not different than, say, a year or two or three years ago. Of course, the huge, huge ones, okay, then if we will have that we will announce them and you have not seen any. So, we didn't consider that we had huge ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question regarding the EBIT margin in Compressor Technique, is major part of this receivable issue directed towards the Compressor Technique division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think there is a significant &#x2013; this is one-off. It's more in the CT and I'm looking to Hans Ola &#x2013; he nods also &#x2013; yes. I think it's more of that. But anyhow, I think the underlying margin I think was still solid, I think when you look to the mix and all that. I have difficulties to talk it really down. So, let's say it this way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. So, we turn to the telephone conference for two questions, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question comes from the line of James Moore from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. It's James Moore of Redburn. Three questions if I could. One on over-production. Did you overproduce in the quarter? I noticed your inventories are up a billion kroner. Was that because of currencies or was there a like-for-like inventory build and did it affect the margin?</p>
          <p>Secondly, how much of the 135 currency gain is the receivable and how much is more classic transaction?</p>
          <p>And then finally, you mentioned mix being positive in CT and CMT. I might normally expect in an OE recovery for the lower margin OE perhaps to be a drag on mix. Could you perhaps expand a little on what these positive mix issues in CT and CMT are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Currency, Hans Ola, you take later. Over-production, I think we don't have. I think in our concept, the way we work in our floor, we have an assemble-to-order concept. So, I think what you see in the inventory is really transit stock and, of course, currency revaluation on that one. But it's not that we have been overproducing and which has then &#x2013; maybe could have a positive effect on the EBIT level. We don't have that.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the mix, if I talk about sequential, the mix, quarter one, quarter two, we look from an aggregate level. The mix equipment of the market between these two quarters is more or less the same. So, that is I think when you have to look to the result and then you make a comparison with quarter one and quarter two, which is maybe easier to make that one than to make the quarter two last year with the quarter two this year, as you have, of course, with the bridge in that one. Maybe you can take...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if we expand a little bit further, you asked about the positive currency number that we posted, and as always, it's the currency effect comparing Q2 last year with Q2 this year. And it is &#x2013; the absolute majority of that this time, is due to the change of currencies during Q2 this year, which means that we have to revalue receivables at the end of June to higher exchange rate, let's say, and that means that we have to book that profit in Q2 this year. Last year in Q2, we had virtually no such effect. So, that's why when we use the bridge concept, we get that as a positive.</p>
          <p>So it's not very much of true underlying better currencies than last year actually nor very big difference, compared to Q1 for that matter. So, all what we call as a positive currency is really coming from this &#x2013; well, the absolute majority of it is coming from this revaluation issues. And it's important to remember that because as we now have done that and we move on to Q3, by definition, it means that we will not have that positive, if currency rates now stay stable for three months.</p>
          <p>So it has affected the margin in Q2 in a positive way, also sequentially looking at the margin, which means that it &#x2013; everything else equal, it will not appear, let's say, in Q3. So, I hope that explains that part.</p>
          <p>Perhaps just to add to Ronnie's comment on over-production, you mentioned that the inventory increased about SEK1 billion in the balance sheet between March and June, actually &#x2013; and I don't have the exact number &#x2013; but at least half of that is more related to other things than the real volume buildup of inventory, so currency primarily. So, the statement of Ronnie is perfectly true that the inventory buildup is very much linked to what we see in the order intake in a natural way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just going back to your mix point, if the mix was the same Q2 on 1 and the currency helped by a percent and your margins jumped 3% or so, what were the other mix effects helping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you may come back on that one, and maybe to explain a bit more, I think, of course, a lot is coming from the volume. And I think if you look a bit deeper through the information out here and you look through the costs and you make a comparison from a cost point of view, you have seen that we have not, and that's maybe one takeaway for all of us. I think we have not had many cost increases. So, there is more to come unfortunately on that cost side. Of course, we want to be efficient on that, but if we &#x2013; now, we got a very quick upturn with very low cost, and especially when it comes to the functional cost. And that is something which we will see what &#x2013; in the period if we go further, what will happen on that one.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to expand a little bit further on the mix that when Ronnie says there was about the same mix as in Q1, we see that as a little bit of a surprise on the positive side because normally when you have a ramp-up of revenue like we have seen even on a sequential basis, it normally comes through that the equipment invoicing is coming back much quicker, so to speak. But in this case, they have actually increased about the same, which means that we had a nice &#x2013; very nice profit effect from the revenue increase in this quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's Nico Dil from JP Morgan. Two quick questions, please. One on Compressor Technique, I would like to understand the incremental margin a little bit better. It was close to 100%, wondering what exactly made that incremental margin so high.</p>
          <p>Second question is really on the &#x2013; I'm sorry, on the construction equipment side of things, where I saw an improvement sequentially. Wondering whether you could give a little bit of color on that in terms of sort of what type of an improvement you saw, which end markets, which geographies, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suggest, Hans Ola, you take the CT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You start the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second one, okay. That &#x2013; yeah, I think the sequential improvement is mainly on the infrastructure construction part. We see there a good development, although I'll say the whole mining part, although if you compare with quarter one, you could say that it's maybe not increased so much. But I think we got, say, a bit improvement on that part if we take it in the orders received side. So, that is mainly &#x2013; it comes mainly from South America, Australia and then you have Asia.</p>
          <p>Those are the areas where we see good significant improvement. Although we can say if we take it a bit, talking about the region here, we see also a very good development in the Nordic area when you come through the CMT on that part. And we should not forget, now I'm repeating again all these, but we see also that Russia is gradually coming up. Of course, we, compared with a very low last year. We are not in Russia up to the level where we were pre-crisis, but as we see a good development. And if you take all these things together, we see a sequential improvement on that. Maybe you can take...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the Compressor Technique business, Ronnie showed the flow-through profit from the revenue increase in one of the graphs. But we saw 69%, as we define it ex-currency and ex-non-recurring items and acquisitions on the group. And as you rightly say, it was almost 100% on CT. And this is, of course, a big surprise. We fully understand that since we have explained many, many times that Atlas Copco is not very operationally geared company, we buy quite a lot of equipment that we put into our machines and then we deliver. So, we don't have a lot of in-house manufacturing.</p>
          <p>So how can then the gearing come out like this? Well, it is a very specific situation when you have a positive pricing, you have a tremendous comeback on revenue and you have a very profitable aftermarket. And on top of that, we have the benefit, like Ronnie touched upon, which is the same for the whole group that this comeback of revenue has happened with a very little addition of functional costs. And if we look at product cost in average of all the business areas and particularly in CT, we can see actually that there is quite a substantial lower product cost, compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>In spite of the fact that certain input materials are starting to become more expensive &#x2013; well, it has become a little bit more expensive &#x2013; but there has been tremendous work on the innovation side and the efficiency side when it comes to product development. So, they have, so to speak &#x2013; all of these factors have contributed in the same manner in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Perhaps just to finish on it, if you compare with what we said after the first quarter, we could hardly comment on these things on the same graph, because then we had a negative revenue, compared to the previous year, but a positive profit improvement. So, the ratio was very difficult to read. Now, we have a tremendous flow through, but again, we come &#x2013; it's a very specific situation, when we have this rapid return with also a strong growth on the aftermarket side, which is extremely profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And price, we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then price, as I mentioned that we shouldn't forget that, that is, of course, coming on top of everything that we &#x2013; falls all the way through to the profit from the revenue increase. So, the only thing we can end the comment is by saying that over time, looking forward, we don't think that one should expect us to have, let's say, anything than the normal type of flow through of 30 to 35, perhaps even 40% in certain occasions when the pricing element is good, so to speak, because that's the way the group is set up from variable to fixed costs and this quarter is a very specific one in that respect. Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Mats Liss, Swedbank. Couple of questions. First, regarding orders, just if you could indicate the delivery times on the orders, when we should expect them to be invoiced. And also, if there has been any bottlenecks during the quarter which have affected your invoicing ability during the quarter. And well, also if you could give some indication about the production rate during the third quarter. I guess it will be up, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we got a bit of bottlenecks. I think we see in certain products where we have some components more difficult. I think it's &#x2013; if we take &#x2013; one example is on the electronic parts, it's not so easy to get them, the ones we want. So, you see that a bit in Industrial Technique where we have some lagging on that part. But when it comes to the orders and delivery time, I think we see a prolongation of delivery time because the supply chain is stressed and we need to ramp up.</p>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; you have two sides. Okay, we obviously &#x2013; ourselves, we have to hire more people. And second also, our suppliers have to get the components going on. You should &#x2013; if you take a bit on the quarter three, we are ending up now, today in the holiday period, especially when you take the North America and European side, which will, of course, have a bit of an effect on our output. But we see a prolongation on the delivery times. It is mainly &#x2013; where you see a prolongation is mainly on the CMT side where you will see a bit &#x2013; the book-to-bill a bit longer or higher than you would see in CT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Another question here, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Joakim H&#xF6;glund, Carnegie. I wonder &#x2013; you talked about the mix effect. And I assume that was in revenue you spoke about earlier. In the orders for this quarter, do you see the same mix as in, say, for the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And also, when you talk about deliver times and lack of some components, do you think there will be a need to sort of build inventories to be able to deliver when you sort of get hold of these kind of products from time-to-time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer you the last question first, no. I think that is not the way Atlas Copco works. I think we will not assemble half machines. It doesn't say that you will never see that in the factory, but that is not the standard. I think we will do it when we have the components, so we do that to be complete units. So, you will &#x2013; do you not get any efficiency in inventory? I think that will be a lie if I say no, but I think it will not be significant. That's one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the mix on the orders received side, of course, you see a higher equipment than on the aftermarket, so that we will eventually go to a less favorable mix aftermarket equipment when we go further in the future. And that was also one of the reason why I made the remark on -that we have in quarter two a very good aftermarket, which lead more or less to the same mix as quarter one, which was a bit of a surprise for us in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we &#x2013; I think we turn to the telephone conference again. Yes, we'll take two more questions there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Tim Rothery from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Tim Rothery here from Goldman Sachs. I was just wondering if you could perhaps just comment on the pricing environment. Obviously, you've been successful in raising prices or getting good price retention. Is this being supported by bottlenecks in other suppliers and some of your competition and being able to meet this V-shaped recovery or is this just sort of continuation of the long-term trends?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, within the quarter, would you be able to try and quantify what you saw in terms of cost savings and just give an indication of how you see that in the coming quarters because I would imagine that as we go through the year the comp effect or the base effect from these cost savings must get tougher as we go forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You take cost savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the price environment, I think, of course, this price increase what you get is really supported by the continuous innovation and upgrading our products. I think that is the base. I think the rest when it comes to be clever and go against the competition and when they have a bottleneck and all that, I think that will fight back. I think &#x2013; and that is not the practice we try to do. So, it is definitely a very solid price management over the years what we do. Of course, it helps when it becomes, again, a buyers' market instead of a sales market like it is now. I think gradually &#x2013; of course, it helps to support good price management and increase of prices when you have much pressure on that part. When there is an oversupply, then it's more difficult to do a positive price management. So, we see gradually that the market is turning. Then it becomes a bit easier to talk about price increase. And you take cost...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked, if I understood the question right, a little bit about the cost &#x2013; on the cost side, the savings, compared to last year and then &#x2013; of course, we have pointed out in Q2 and, of course, in Q1 that that is an important aspect of the profit improvement. Absolutely. Now, if I understood you right, you're saying that when we compare with Q3 and Q4 last year, we already had more substantial savings already last year. That's also true, of course, but on the other hand, if you look sequentially from a quarter where we just delivered the 20% margin, we don't expect that to be any different.</p>
          <p>Of course, we, like Ronnie alluded to earlier, and we have said it before, the more than 2 billion personnel-related savings that we talked about in 2009 is not going to stick in the way that our business model works. It was an adjustment to the level of business that we saw at that time, but as the revenues are now coming back, as the loads in the factories are building up, of course, we will have to increase the number of employees, again, in the manufacturing and in other places. So, gradually a &#x2013; I would say even as much of a majority of those cost savings will come back, but, of course, we don't have any problem with that as long as we see that the revenues are also increasing again. And that's exactly what we believe that we will see in the next couple of quarters. So, yeah, it will be more difficult to compare with last year in that respect, but we look from it from where we are today and going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I can elaborate. I think I really believe, although, of course, we support efficiency and we go for efficiency, but we will get more cost. I think just as an example, when a supply chain get under stress and you come late, you get air freight instead of boating and sea freight. You get rush transport, you get &#x2013; I think we also will invest more in the market. If you see like last year, some of the exhibitions, no one went there. Today, you have seen here in my presentation, Bauma, you went to the world expo. All these things, investments &#x2013; to invest for the future. This is what we will do. We do more on these things. So, these costs, they're coming in more and more, but of course, we try to be more efficient as we were pre-crisis. That is the challenge, I think, management has in front of them.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Ben Maslen from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. It's Ben from Merrill Lynch. Three questions please. Firstly, on the U.S., Ronnie, you sound more positive on that market than a lot of your peers. And certainly, your growth rates, it's kind of way in excess of them. Is this a function of the markets that you are in or is it something structural that's letting you outperform your market at the moment, be it kind of distributors or products or time-to-market? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, China, your growth rates there on a macro level are slowing into the second half of the year. Could you just say what you expect for the second half in terms of kind of sequential and year-on-year growth rates? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't know how my peers sound, but I can only talk what I see about the U.S. and I see, compared to last year and also, sequential, a good activity in the industrial market and that as &#x2013; I see that in the compressor market, as I also see that in general industry from the tools point of view and MVI. I see a good activity for the rental companies. The large rental companies are ordering. They place orders; they want to have deliveries. And I see a good underlying activity on the aftermarket. When you talk really construction, road construction and other construction, okay, that is less favorable. So, that made me saying that, okay, I see good activities at the moment in U.S.</p>
          <p>When it comes to China, yeah, you have seen, we had record China in the second quarter. I'm also reading the same information what you read, Ben. When I talk to the people on the floor, to our sales people and our general managers, they are still active, but very, very positive. But of course, they say also if you compare with the record, can we repeat that in third quarter, quarter four. But they still got a lot of activities and that made me say, okay, we will see &#x2013; we had many times in China that the macroeconomical outlooks were a bit more cautious, and we saw still some good development. So, it's very difficult to predict on that one. I think we still go full speed ahead in China. I think we can still take more of that market. I think there is still some room for market share, and there is still some room for aftermarket. So &#x2013; and that is where I bet today on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually &#x2013; maybe if I could just follow-up on the gas-in-process compressors, you say that order intake is now picking up again. Where were orders in relation to revenues? The revenue is still declining there as the backlog kind of comes down, or are they fairly stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; of course, I was just looking a bit to Mattias [Mattias Olsson] if he had calculated the book-to-bill. But it is &#x2013; book-to-bill is low. But I think it's not so much different. I think &#x2013; I see when it comes to the gas-in-process, we don't see the peak orders. The big orders, we don't have, but I see all over the place, some good activities and they land reasonably good orders. So, where I was much more negative six months ago, I was really concerned, okay, what we will do with all the under-absorption we could have, that I'm not afraid anymore. I see a very solid demand, but not peaks. So, I see more activity also even on the air separation market, which was nine months ago that &#x2013; that we see a bit more activities and that's good for us. I see a fuel gas boosters coming. I see geothermal business picking up on demand. We have not landed many orders, but, okay, we get that. So, I think it is at a reasonable level.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you. Ola Kinnander with Bloomberg News. Hi. Back to issue of the employees, Hans Ola, you said you are expecting that there will be some rehiring here over the next couple of quarters. Could you be a little bit more specific of what you could expect here? I know you have reduced your workforce by about 6,000 since the crisis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I'll take it. That's maybe easier. When Hans Ola mentioned it, I think we compared &#x2013; quarter one, compared to quarter today &#x2013; quarter two. And what you see is, of course, we have more hiring in the manufacturing side because at the end of the day, we must deliver what we got as orders. That has increased, and that has increased in Sweden, has increased in Belgium. We see that also in China, India. There we &#x2013; in America, we are hiring again for manufacturing. Where we also see significant hiring is in the aftermarket. That is in the service part. That is a significant part of our re-hiring. And then, of course, we keep investing in the present &#x2013; in the market. That's mainly in the emerging markets where we put more feet in the street area. That is really the organic growth. Of course, then we had the acquisitions when you look to the figures, but we are back in the rehiring, basically.</p>

          <p>Yes. The next question comes from the line of Roddy Bridge from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Yes, Roddy Bridge, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I think you've sort of warned us that there is about one percentage point extra from this receivable situation and that you had a very positive mix. But I was really wanting sort of to ask if Ronnie would say anything conceptually about how high margins can really go? At what point do you really start stepping on the internal growth and what should we be thinking about your outlook for CapEx going forward, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, how high can the margins be? That is a one dollar question. I think one thing is definitely what we don't do, and that's also what I push. I am not pushing for high margin, we definitely push internally for growth. It can be internally as also organic growth, as well as acquisition. That's what we go. When you see the margin really changing, and really be this level around 20, it comes definitely from a very, very solid aftermarket, which is not only &#x2013; was already good, but also we have taken a lot of activities already years back improving the process, which is okay. Now, we could not prove it last year, because the volume was really down. Now, this year the volume in the aftermarket is there. The structure is there. There is more volume and that, of course, creates a very good contribution.</p>
          <p>Second, I think all the measures we have taken on the equipment side, and Hans Ola also mentioned already on the innovation part on the setup, which support the margin on that part.</p>
          <p>So how big? I don't think I will comment on that. I am very pleased with the margin we have today. And like I said, I would like to &#x2013; that we even can grow faster in this area. When it comes to the CapEx, we are not a very heavy CapEx organization. There are some plants in preparation for some extension of capacity, and that's in emerging markets. It's mainly in India and in China, where in the coming six months, we will make plans to extend our capacity on that one. The rest on CapEx, you would see a bit more CapEx also eventually on the rental part where we'll have a bit more, but the rest, I don't see any &#x2013; in the foreseeable future, I don't see big CapEx swings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe that if you look a little bit, not quarter-by-quarter necessarily, but a little bit over a certain period that we will be able on the tangible investments, the CapEx on the &#x2013; related to the factories and the net CapEx on rental fleet, but it &#x2013; we believe that we will be able to keep it in the range of 1.5 to 2% of this &#x2013; of revenue, something in that order. And coming into the recession, this last time, we were probably a little bit higher than that, but sort of overshooting a little bit temporarily. But then we also can bring it down quite drastically if needed, so without jeopardizing the quality of the setup. But roughly to give a little bit of some idea for the future, at least.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Looking at the first figures, do you see that your target for operating margin is still 15%. Is it in your intention to maintain these targets given this Q2 number, or you want to increase it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, like in many other occasions, we said that an 8% organic growth plus acquisition over the business cycle and 15% EBIT and always having a very &#x2013; a return higher than the WACC is our target, and we have not reconsidered that part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, of course, to be seen over a full business cycle, and you can then, of course, exactly the way you do, argue that we have been over that number for many years now. But it's not something that hinders us from both growing and being as profitable as possible. But it's absolutely true that &#x2013; as Ronnie pointed out that growing at the 8% level with a good profitability and still having a low capital base, that is what we are shooting for, because that creates true value. If it sounds like we're downplaying that part of the target, yeah, you're probably right.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Nicolas <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Just following up on the question on the balance sheet. You said that the first use would be the acquisitions and then CapEx internal growth. And does that mean that you are probably not intending to go forward to the share buyback program this quarter. And I think an auxiliary question here is, how much do you look at your share price when assessing share buyback, and would your decision be different if, say, your share was down 10, 15% from here? How do you look at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we, of course, have a very close dialog continuously with the board and also, any input from any shareholder is important in that aspect. And we believe that the buyback is an important part of being flexible and being able to adjust. But from a priority point of view, the first two, as you mentioned yourself, and that I said just a minute ago, is definitely the key, and that's where we aim for. But is it the timing issue? Are we desperate to have a balance sheet that looks a certain model for every quarter? No, we look at it on a long-term basis.</p>
          <p>We believe that the group has the ability to continuously add value, and that normally leads to also a slightly higher share price going forward. So, in that respect, we don't link it specifically to a certain share price level. We look at it long-term. And I cannot answer if the board would reason differently at 10 or 20% lower share price, would we be more aggressive using the mandate or not? I think it has to do with how is the rest of the world then developing in that scenario and how is the relative situation for Atlas Copco, compared to the rest of peers and the rest of the world. But we have the mandate and there is nothing saying that it cannot and will not be used. But of course, we assess the situation every month and every quarter.</p>

          <p>I think we have a final question on the telephone line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The last question comes from Arnaud Brossard from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Ronnie. Hello, Hans Ola. Arnaud Brossard, Exane BNP Paribas. Three questions. One simple one, just a clarification, your outlook statement, is it sequential or a year-on-year comment?</p>
          <p>Second question about standard compressors, you mentioned increased demand for standard compressors. Is this specific to some regions or end markets? Could you explain how you understand this increased demand and the effect you think it would have on your margins?</p>
          <p>And finally, you currently have very low costs because the recovery &#x2013; partly because the recovery has been faster than you expected. Can you help us estimate the likely amplitude and pace of the cost catch-up that we should expect for maybe Q3 and Q4? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe the outlook, Hans Ola, you can take later. I think on the standard compressor demand, what we mean here is definitely not the gas-in-process and high engineered products compressors that &#x2013; we don't see that as standard compressors. Here we talk about the standard oil-injected and oil-free compressors where we had seen the demand increases. This is almost in all markets, but maybe the southern part of Europe, which was not developing. But I see there a good development in all the BRIC countries. So, I see this time also Russia. I see a good development in the smaller compressors also for Germany. So, if you take then Europe and I think also the U.S. is developing very well in that part.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the variable cost, I think I refer a bit to a previous question we got here. Yeah, I think how much will be the cost increases are, I think we will definitely &#x2013; we have to invest in our brands. We have to invest in our &#x2013; more than even in our products. We have to invest in presence, in exhibitions. So, we will have definitely a higher cost than we had in quarter one or in quarter two.</p>
          <p>But of course, I try, as you know, when it goes up so quickly and after you come out of a very difficult situation that, of course, people and employees have the tendency, of course, now we have to recuperate. Of course, in internal, we try to steer this in a very careful way. But if you look to the amount of people which we have increased, in a previous question also, what we gave &#x2013; have given the answer, I think we have increased people related to manufacturing, which is volume related, and we have increased the majority of our people also in service, which is again volume related. So, I try to get the cost increase a bit less than the volume increase. That is a bit the guidelines I'm using for. Maybe Hans Ola on the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the outlook, we always try to talk about sequential. Let's say, we stand here in the beginning of July and we try to see the activity level of our customers for the next three to four, five months or something like that, that's the way we do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very clear. Just one thing about the cost catch-up, maybe to ask it in a different way, could you quantify maybe the benefits you had in Q2 of lower-than-expected costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we might take turns here in trying to dissect the question. But the &#x2013; it's very difficult to give you a statement that this is lower than expected, and so on. That's not so much the case. It's just the fact that in the revenue buildup that we see, we are still in a mode where we are very selective and careful in the addition of costs and that's why Ronnie repeats that in manufacturing, if you have the type of setup we have, we have to bring in assembly people, and so on, and so forth. And we have to cater for the very strong aftermarket growth out in the field. That's where the cost comes. But they are still added in a careful way.</p>
          <p>Now, that cannot continue forever, but &#x2013; so if I look into the future, the best guess is that you will see costs being added in more of a normal rate to how our business model looks like, which means that we perhaps have something like 20 to 25% fixed cost and the rest is variable. So, we move closer to that norm. That's why I previously said that incremental profit going forward, needs to go back to some sort of 30 to 40% rather than the extreme high flow-through that we saw in Q2. It's the same side &#x2013; the two sides of the same coin, so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course, you see what &#x2013; if you compare with last year and the beginning of the year even, salary increases, if you just take that, I think it was very, very low. I think if you see here in Sweden and I think there are many other countries in the world where salary increases were very modest. I think if the volume goes like this, we will definitely see a demand for salary increases, which will then, yeah, yield cost increase. And I have mentioned also inefficiency when you have to catch-up with late deliveries and all that. These type of cost increases we will get when the volume is more stressed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But at the same time, it's important, of course, that as these costs come back, we're also generating more revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are generating from the business. That is, of course, positive. It's not that we are starting to see that that cost increases that we are talking about now is going to hamper our profit margin going forward. It's just that it cannot explode like it did in the second quarter.</p>
