          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first quarter Ford Motor Company Fixed Income earnings conference call. My name is Katina and I will be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Shawn Ryan, Manager, Fixed Income Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katina, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Bob Shanks, Ford Vice President and Controller; K.R. Kent, Ford Credit Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. We also have some other members of management who are joining us for the call, including David Brandi, Assistant Treasurer; Mike Seneski, Assistant Treasurer; and Paul Andonian, Director of Global Accounting.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to review a couple of quick items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media websites for your reference.</p>
          <p>The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2010.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly, and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Vice President and Controller, Bob Shanks. Bob?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Shawn. I'll begin by reviewing the key financial results on slide 1. I would like to note a couple of things right up front. The first is that as a result of our agreement to sell Volvo, all of Volvo's 2010 results are being reported as special items and excluded from our operating results, and that includes wholesales and revenue. The 2009 results on the other hand do include Volvo. The second thing I would note is that we have adjusted our 2010 and the other data that we're showing in the deck to reflect the new accounting standard on variable interest entity consolidation.</p>
          <p>As shown at the top of the slide, first-quarter vehicle wholesales were 1.3 million units, up 267,000 units from a year ago. The increase was explained by higher wholesales in all of our automotive segments, offset partially by the exclusion of Volvo wholesales.</p>
          <p>Our first-quarter revenue was 28.1 billion, which was a $3.7 billion increase from a year ago. The increase was more than explained by higher volumes, favorable exchange translation, and favorable net pricing, offset partially by the exclusion of the Volvo revenue. If Volvo had been excluded from 2009, automotive revenue would have increased by $7 billion or more than 30%.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $2 billion, a $4 billion improvement. Automotive results improved by 3.2 billion and Financial Services improved by $877 million.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter net income attributable to Ford was $2.1 billion, including favorable pre-tax special items of $125 million. This was a $3.5 billion improvement from a year ago.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with $25.3 billion of automotive gross cash, which was up $4.4 billion from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Slide 2 covers our special items, which were a favorable pre-tax amount of $125 million in the first quarter. We recorded $63 million of personnel and dealer-related charges, related primarily to global personnel reduction programs. And as mentioned earlier, based on our agreement to sell Volvo, all of our Volvo's 2010 financial results are being reported here as special items. We recorded $188 million of held-for-sale adjustments for Volvo, primarily the elimination of depreciation.</p>
          <p>As shown in the memo, if we had continued to report Volvo as an ongoing operation, we would have recorded a first quarter pre-tax operating profit of $49 million for Volvo. This would represent an improvement of about $300 million compared with the first quarter of 2009, and would be explained primarily by higher volume and favorable net pricing.</p>
          <p>Slide 3 shows automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. We ended the first quarter with $25.3 billion in automotive gross cash, which was up $400 million from the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our automotive operating related cash flow was $100 million negative in the first quarter, and it reflected the following: first, an automotive pre-tax operating profit of $1.2 billion; secondly, capital spending during the quarter that was equal to depreciation and amortization; thirdly, changes in working capital that were 400 million negative; and other timing differences that were 600 million negative. These changes are related to seasonal inventory increases and normal timing differences related to our end-of-year production shutdowns. These are a partial offset to the $2.3 billion of favorable inventory reductions and timing differences that we realized during the fourth quarter of 2009. And finally, payment of $300 million to Ford Credit, reflecting upfront payment of subvention. If we include the upfront payment &#x2013; subvention payments to Ford Credit, our first quarter operating related cash flow was $200 million positive.</p>
          <p>Other major changes in first quarter automotive gross cash include the following: first, separation payments of $100 million and pension contributions of $300 million; secondly, net receipts from our Financial Services sector of $500 million related to a Ford Credit distribution; third, net receipts of about $500 million in loans, including $300 million in loans from the U.S. Department of Energy for the development of more fuel efficient vehicles; fourth, equity issuance proceeds of about $500 million; and finally, other cash outflows of $600 million, including the net cash flows of Volvo, investments to support unconsolidated subsidiaries, and the impact of exchange on our non-U.S. cash balances.</p>
          <p>And again, including all of these impacts, the total increase in automotive gross cash during the quarter was $400 million.</p>
          <p>Slide four summarizes our automotive sector's cash and debt position. As shown in the left column, at the end of the first quarter, automotive debt was $34.3 billion. Included with our debt payable within one year is $3 billion for repayment of a revolving line of credit. This was in fact repaid on April 6, lowering our outstanding debt obligation and interest costs. Excluding this repayment, our debt payable within one year was $2 billion. Our gross cash net of debt as of March 31 was $9 billion negative.</p>
          <p>The right column provides a pro forma of cash, debt, and liquidity after the revolver repayment. It's important to note that while that action reduced our gross cash and debt by $3 billion, it did not affect automotive liquidity because the commitments of the revolving lenders have not been reduced.</p>
          <p>Slide five summarizes the status of our key planning assumptions and operational metrics for the first quarter and for our 2010 full-year outlook. First quarter industry volume was equal to a SAAR [Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate] of 11.2 million units in the U.S. and 16 million units in the 19 markets that we track for Europe. We expect full-year U.S. industry volume to be consistent with our previous guidance. Full-year Europe industry volume, however, is now expected to be in the 14 to 15 million unit range, which is somewhat higher than our previous guidance. The change reflects strong first quarter results, although uncertainty remains in Europe about the extent of payback from scrappage programs.</p>
          <p>On the automotive operational metrics, our initial quality improved across all of our regions based on our latest Global Quality Research System surveys. Our automotive structural costs were reduced by about $100 million in the first quarter. Now as we mentioned, last year we've achieved significant structural cost reductions over the last four years. And in 2010, we still expect full-year automotive structural costs to be somewhat higher as we increase production to meet demand and increase investment in new products.</p>
          <p>U.S. total market share was 16.6% and U.S. share of the retail market was 14.1% in the first quarter, both improved compared with 2009 and were consistent with our plan. Europe market share for the first quarter was 9.4%, equal to a year ago and on track with our plan.</p>
          <p>Automotive operating related cash flow was $100 million negative in the first quarter, reflecting primarily seasonal timing differences, and was consistent with our plan for the full year. For the full year, we remain on track with our plan to generate positive operating related cash flow.</p>
          <p>And finally, capital expenditures were $900 million in the first quarter. And consistent with our plan, spending is projected to be higher during the remainder of the year to support our product programs.</p>
          <p>So overall, our performance this year is off to a more encouraging start than anticipated. And based on our improving business performance, the gradual strengthening in the economy, and our present assumptions, we now expect to deliver solid profits this year with positive automotive operating related cash flow.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now turn it over to K.R.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Bob. Slide 6 shows Ford Credit's operating results and key metrics for the first quarter of 2010. As shown in the left box, our first quarter pre-tax profit was $828 million, compared with a pre-tax loss of $36 million in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>You can see in the right box our March 31 on-balance sheet receivables were $88 billion, about $16 billion lower than a year ago and about $5 billion lower than year-end 2009. These declines reflected primarily the transition of Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, and Volvo financing to other finance providers and lower industry and financing volumes in 2009 and '10 compared with prior years.</p>
          <p>Charge-offs for on-balance sheet receivables in the first quarter were $133 million, and the worldwide loss-to-receivables ratio was a very low 58 basis points, which was down 63 basis points from the same period last year, and I'll speak more about this in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>At March 31, the allowance for credit losses for on-balance sheet receivables was about $1.4 billion or 149 basis points of receivables. The allowance was about $200 million lower than year-end 2009 and about $350 million lower than a year ago.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we did pay a $500 million cash distribution to our parent, Ford Holdings, and are projecting total distributions of about $2 billion during 2010, which is up from $1.5 billion previously projected. We will continue to balance future distributions with the successful execution of our funding plan.</p>
          <p>At March 31 our managed leverage was 6.9 to 1 compared with 10 to 1 at March 31, 2009. And at the end of the first quarter, our equity was about $11 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide seven explains the change in Ford Credit's pre-tax profits for the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009. For the first quarter, Ford Credit reported a pre-tax profit of $828 million, an $864 million improvement from a year ago. Volume was about $130 million lower compared with a year ago, reflecting a decline in receivables. Financing margin was about $50 million higher compared to a year ago, reflecting primarily lower borrowing cost.</p>
          <p>The decline in the provision for credit losses of about $440 million reflects primarily a lower credit loss reserve and improved charge-off performance. Residual losses declined about $440 million in the first quarter compared with last year. This improvement reflects primarily the impact of higher auction values on vehicles returned during the quarter. The improvement in other of about $60 million is more than explained by the non-recurrence of net losses related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives, as well as lower operating cost.</p>
          <p>Our international segment, which is primarily Europe, reported a pre-tax profit of $96 million in the first quarter, which was $63 million better than a year ago. This increase reflects primarily a decline in the provision for credit losses and lower losses on residual based products, offset partially by lower volume.</p>
          <p>We expect our 2010 profits to be about the same as our 2009 profits. The recent improvements in used vehicle auction values and credit loss performance are expected to offset the effects of lower average receivables and the non-recurrence of certain favorable factors in 2009.</p>
          <p>Slide eight shows quarterly trends of charge-offs and loss-to-receivables ratios for our on-balance sheet portfolio. The top box shows loss-to-receivables ratio for the worldwide portfolio and loss-to-receivables ratios for the U.S. Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury retail and lease business. Both worldwide and U.S. Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury loss receivable ratios in the first quarter are down from the year-ago level, reflecting primarily lower repossessions, lower severity, and lower wholesale and dealer loan losses in the U.S. as well as lower losses in Europe.</p>
          <p>Both worldwide and U.S. Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury first quarter loss-to-receivables ratio are lower than the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting primarily lower repossessions and lower wholesale and dealer loan losses in the U.S. as well as again lower losses in Europe.</p>
          <p>Charge-offs in the first quarter were $133 million, which was down $199 million from a year ago, and down 105 million from the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting the same factors I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury retail and lease business. Repossessions in the first quarter were 19,000 units, which was down 6,000 units from the first quarter of 2009 and down 4,000 units from the fourth quarter of 2009. Severity of $7,300 in the first quarter was $2,000 lower than last year and $400 lower than the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting primarily improvements in auction values in the used vehicle market.</p>
          <p>Over 60-day delinquencies totaled 17 basis points for the first quarter, which were down 12 basis points from last year and down three basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009. Bankruptcy filings totaled 10,000 in the first quarter, down 1,000 from last year and the fourth quarter of 2009. The credit quality of our contract placements remains very good, and we continue to closely monitor our key loss metrics for any changes related to broader trends in the overall economy.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows the lease residual performance for our Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury U.S. brands. Lease return volumes were the same in the first quarter as a year ago, reflecting primarily a lower return rate offset by higher terminations. The first quarter lease return rate was 71%, which was down 18 percentage points compared with the same period last year as a result of higher auction values. This return rate was up two percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and has remained relatively constant over the past three quarters.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, auction values of 24 and 36-month leased vehicles at a constant mix were up on average about $1,900 per unit and $2,200 per unit respectively from year-ago levels. This reflects primarily the overall auction value improvement in the used vehicle market. Compared with the prior quarter, auction values were up about $400 and $500 for 24 and 36-month leased vehicles, respectively.</p>
          <p>Lease placements by segment are becoming more balanced but remain concentrated in cars and crossovers. In the first quarter, cars and crossovers represented 76% of new placements, down from 89% in the first quarter of last year and down about three points from our fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting higher Escape/Mariner SUV and F-150 lease volume in the first quarter. Our lease portfolio is presently 63% cars and crossovers, which is up eight percentage points from one year ago.</p>
          <p>Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $13.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $20.2 billion in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, K.R. Turning to slide 11, our access to the capital markets and credit spreads continued to improve. We completed 8 billion of funding in the first quarter and another 3 billion during the month of April. Compared to the fourth quarter 2009, spreads on unsecured issuance have reduced from 480 base basis points to about 430 base basis points. Spreads on our AAA-rated notes for our U.S. public retail program tightened from 48 basis points in November to 18 basis points in last week's transaction. The all-in spread for our full capital structure from last week's retail transaction was 32 basis points.</p>
          <p>The key elements of our funding strategy remain unchanged. We remain dependent on access to public and private securitizations, asset-backed commercial paper, unsecured debt, and hedging instruments. We continued to extend the term of our securitization and unsecured funding. So far this year, we have issued ten-year unsecured debt, five-year public and private wholesale securitizations, and we have sold subordinate notes from our prior retail and wholesale securitization transactions.</p>
          <p>Our strategy on committed capacity is to achieve renewals consistent with the overall size of our balance sheet. We will continue to explore and execute alternative business funding arrangements in those locations where we lack diverse funding capability while also ensuring that Ford has continued support in these markets.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit's funding strategy remains focused on maintaining liquidity to meet short-term funding obligations, including holding a substantial cash balance.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows the trends in our funding for our managed receivables. As K.R. mentioned, at the end of first quarter, managed receivables were $90 billion. We ended the quarter with about 21 billion in cash, including 5.6 billion to support on-balance sheet securitizations. Securitized funding was 59% of managed receivables at the end of the first quarter, up from 56% at year-end 2009. We are projecting 2010 year-end managed receivables in the range of 80 to $90 billion. We are projecting securitized funding to represent about 55 to 60% of total managed receivables.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows our 2010 term funding plan for Ford Credit, which does not include our short-term funding programs or asset sales to our on-balance sheet asset-backed commercial paper program. Including last week's transactions scheduled to close tomorrow, we have completed about 11 billion of term funding. About 8 billion of this funding was public, including two unsecured debt offerings totaling about 2 billion, two wholesale securitization transactions totaling about 3 billion, a 1.5 billion U.S. lease securitization, a 1 billion U.S. retail securitization, and a 500 million Canadian retail securitization. In addition, we completed about 3 billion of funding through our private securitization channels.</p>
          <p>For 2010, our public term funding plans are in the range of 12 to 17 billion, consisting of 9 to 14 billion of public securitizations and 3 to 6 billion of unsecured debt. We are forecasting 7 to 11 billion of funding from our private sources.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 details our liquidity program and utilization. The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity, which includes unsecured credit facilities, our FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines, and our other asset-backed capacity. As of March 31, we had 53 billion of committed capacity and cash. After excluding securitization cash and adjusting for available assets, liquidity was 38.4 billion, of which 17.3 billion was utilized, leaving about 21 billion available for use given our present level of eligible receivables. Available liquidity as a percent of managed receivables was 23%.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, our cash not related to securitization totaled about $15 billion. Compared to year-end 2009, we reduced our committed capacity by about 1.5 billion and our utilization of liquidity by about $1 billion as a result of the smaller balance sheet. Renewals and added capacity were more than offset by voluntary termination of certain excess capacity.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with $9 billion of excess committed capacity. This excess capacity reflects our lower assets and higher use of the public markets. Of the 32.3 billion of total committed capacity, about 66% is up for renewal through the remainder of 2010. Our renewal strategy will focus on optimizing capacity and liquidity to protect our global funding requirements. Additionally, during the first quarter, we repurchased or called about 300 million of near-term unsecured debt maturities, split equally between 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>So in summary on slide 15, Ford had a pre-tax operating profit excluding special items of $2 billion, a $4 billion improvement from a year ago. Net income attributable to Ford was 2.1 billion, including favorable pre-tax special items of $125 million. First quarter automotive gross cash was $25.3 billion.</p>
          <p>As part of our plan to improve our balance sheet, on April 6 we paid down 3 billion of our revolving credit facility, which remains available to us through December 2013.</p>
          <p>For Ford Credit, the pre-tax profit was 828 million and net income was $528 million. In the first quarter, Ford Credit paid 500 million in distribution to its parent, and is projecting total distribution of about $2 billion during 2010. Our capital market access and credit spreads continue to improve. Ford Credit has completed 11 billion of term funding year to date. Ford Credit's liquidity available for use is about 21 billion, of which 15 billion is in cash.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it back to Shawn to start the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Neil. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to start the question-and-answer session now. Katina, can we please have the first question?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Eric Selle, representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey; good morning, guys. I believe it was Lewis on the last call that said something to the tune of Ford Motor Credit's profit is going to be the same year over year. And if I do some quick math, you basically did 1.9 billion in '09. You did 800 million in the first quarter. That leaves about 1.1 billion for Q2 through Q4. Are you guys just being conservative or is profit actually going to be cut in half in the back three quarters of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, good morning. I'll give you a couple of &#x2013; a little perspective on that. We made about $2 billion in 2009, so the profits are going to be around the same level 2010. First quarter was a bang-up quarter, but there are some headwinds, I'll call it, going forward, and I'll just give you a couple of them so you can get a perspective. One is volume. We're going to end the year probably somewhere between 80 and $90 billion of receivables. Ended the first quarter at 90 billion, so there's going to be a little bit more receivable decline coming at us for the rest of the year, especially as the Jag/Land Rover/Volvo/Mazda portfolio continues to wind off.</p>
          <p>The second one, in the first quarter we actually had a credit loss reserve reduction of about $200 million. And you look at the credit losses, they were actually fantastic compared to where we have come from, and so we reduced the reserve by about $200 million. That will not repeat all year long. I'm not -- don't want to give you what the forecast for the reserve is, but it's not going to be 200 million for every quarter for the next three quarters in a row.</p>
          <p>Third element is the auction prices. The auction prices have been extremely strong. I'd say for the last six months or so, they have been offering somewhat in a seasonal manner. When I say somewhat, they've actually improved a little bit but they've been fairly close to a seasonal level. And if you derive that out for the rest of the year, on a normal seasonal basis, you should see a decline in auction prices. But I wouldn't be the first to admit in the last two years there has been nothing seasonal about auction prices.</p>
          <p>And then finally, the fourth one is, like most of the market, there is a projection in our forecast for somewhat of a rate increase by the end of the year. And depending on when a rate movement would happen, it'll have an impact on our profits. Obviously the earlier it happens, it has a bigger impact to margin and also the FAS 133 mark to market on our derivatives. So those four elements are all planned into what our forecast lays out right now. I will tell you, if rates don't go up, if the auction market holds where it is today, we would see good news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great color. That's great color. And in that regard, looking at &#x2013; your allowance: it's down to like 1.4 billion. And if you run it as a percentage of AR, we haven't seen it this low in, I guess, 5 quarters. Are you guys seeing a trend in delinquencies going into spring following the normal seasonal pattern, improving as we go through the spring, and obviously mindful of the fact that the stimulus is waning and we don't have the lower tax withdrawal impacts this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, I think you can really see it on slide 8 in the presentation. Compare first quarter this year versus first quarter last year, the losses are down dramatically. I agree a piece of this is the severity has improved dramatically as well, but the actual delinquencies are down. The repossession ratio is down. Things are moving in the right direction right now. I really hope that it continues that way. And I want to point out that it's not only in the U.S. We're also seeing it for the most part in Europe as well.</p>

          <p>That is good to hear. Then looking at your Appendix 11 on your first slides, it looks like you got about $10 billion of secured debt, a lot of that maturing. This is on the auto side; sorry for switching gears. A lot of that is maturing in 2011. Is the goal to continue to chip away at it or to do a massive refi of that debt? And if it's not a massive refi, 2 follow-on questions: why wait, and then how would you rank your top sources of capital to chip away at it?</p>

          <p>Eric, this is Neil. I think &#x2013; first of all, I think the majority of the secured debt doesn't mature until December of 2013, so it's not a 2011 maturity. I think as we've stated generically, we need to reduce debt and improve our balance sheet, and I think we're looking at a lot of things associated with all of our capital structure, but really don't have anything at this point that we're really ready to announce.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then I have one dumb question. You know I'm good for at least one dumb question. If I look at slide 13, you have wholesale increasing 56% in North America and revenue is only up 41. Said another way, revenue per wholesale dropped about 3,000. Is that the story of mix because we obviously didn't see that in pricing?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob. As Lewis said in the earlier call, there were two anomalies that occurred, and they had largely to do with the effect of the very, very low volumes of last year. The first and the larger effect was the fact that a portion of our rental vehicles come back to us at the end of the cycle and then we sell them through auction. So when we initially build and then sell the units to or ship the units to the rental companies, we book the wholesale, but you don't actually pick up most of the revenue until the units come back some months later and then they go through the auction. And so what you had last year: the rental companies weren't buying much, so there were very, very low levels of wholesales to them, so the number of units was very low.</p>
          <p>And we had conversely a lot of de-fleeting going on by the rental companies, and so there were an abnormally high number of rental units coming back and through the auctions. So this year basically those two things are aligned in terms of wholesales and number of units coming back. So you had the effect last year of very few wholesales, very abnormally high revenue, and that's not repeating in the first quarter of this year, so that's affecting the per-unit quite a bit.</p>
          <p>And the second thing is kind of related. Our parts sales are relatively constant. Last year, they didn't go down proportionate to the decline in wholesale because they cover the whole car park of the last three, five, seven years. So they on a per-unit basis were quite high last year now that the wholesales are returning more to normal levels, and we're not seeing a 56% increase in our parts revenue. Again, that anomalous situation has corrected itself, and so we're back to normal. So you put those two things together and that's what's driving the decline in the per-unit revenues. Net pricing was actually favorable, as we've talked about. So it's really those two things that are affecting it.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I want to talk a bit about the lease residual performance on slide 10. Can you give us a sense of &#x2013; yes, we know the lease book is running out. Yes, we know at some point in 2008 you pulled back on lease originations as the market went down. But can you give a sense of what lease return volumes might look like through the remainder of the year, and then we can make our own assumptions about auction values off of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't really give that much guidance related to the lease return volumes. I would hesitate to give you anything more than assuming that it's going to be basically along the same lines that we've seen so far this year. I just don't really &#x2013; we don't provide that data, Brian; sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of when you book the profit on the residual, how should we be thinking about what the baseline assumption on that residual was? Was it when the car was leased? Or was it many of these vehicles caught up in the June 2008 mark-to-market of the lease book after the gas price spike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, lease depreciation accounting is very complicated, Brian. Let me give you couple perspectives. Since they are depreciable assets, almost always you're depreciating something. Even when we had the impairment back in second quarter of 2008, didn't really write the vehicles down to their final expected value that you would get, say, in 2010 when the vehicle came back. There was always still a bit of depreciation coming at you.</p>
          <p>I'll give you -- there are cases where the depreciation stopped for certain vehicles and that's because you had &#x2013; you can't un-depreciate a depreciating asset. So you do pick up some gains along the way eventually. To give you a perspective, the $440 million profit improvement versus 2009 in the second &#x2013; in the first quarter, about 60% of that is related to the vehicles that returned in the quarter. The other 40% is lower depreciation for vehicles that are in the future going to come back still.</p>
