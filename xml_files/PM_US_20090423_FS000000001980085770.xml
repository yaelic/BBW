          <p>Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2009 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmintl.com.</p>
          <p>As we take you through our call today, we'll be talking about results in the first quarter of 2009 and comparing them with the same period in 2008, unless specified otherwise. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and share data is sourced from AC Nielsen, other third-party sources and internal estimates. Net revenue data exclude excise taxes.</p>
          <p>You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to revenues and operating companies income or OCI for currency and acquisitions at the end of today's webcast slides, which will be also posted to our website.</p>
          <p>Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.</p>
          <p>And now it's my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. I'm pleased to report that PMI's strong business momentum continued into 2009 in spite of the difficult economic environment. Net revenues in the first quarter grew by 3.9% excluding acquisitions and currency, driven by price increases across a broad range of markets.</p>
          <p>OCI increased by 6.2% excluding acquisitions and currency. This was driven by strong performances in the Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EEMA. In Asia regions where net of currency, we achieved double-digit OCI growth in key markets of Russia, Ukraine, Australia, Indonesia and Korea.</p>
          <p>A 2.3% decrease in the EU regional OCI, net of acquisitions and currency, resulted from a sharp contraction in industry volume in Poland, due to large tax-driven price increases, low shipment volume and a less favorable mix in Germany, some minor market share erosion across the region, and higher marketing investments behind our new Marlboro initiatives.</p>
          <p>Reported diluted earnings per share, or EPS, declined by $0.05 or 6.3% in the first quarter to $0.74, but were up $0.10 or 12.7% excluding the adverse currency impact.</p>
          <p>Before I go into further details, let me focus on the three topics which appear to be top of mind amongst our investors and the analysts who follow us. These are consumer trends in emerging markets, pricing and currency.</p>
          <p>I can say today that we have not seen any broad-based trends towards consumer down-trading on a global basis. Let me illustrate the situation and how it varies from country to country with four examples: Russia, Ukraine, Indonesia and Argentina. In Russia, we are seeing signs of consumer down-trading, driven by the impact of the collapse in oil and metal prices on the Russian economy, and the substantial cigarette price increases that have taken place over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>While shipments of super-premium Parliament continued to increase in the first quarter, the volume of premium Marlboro and mid-price Chesterfield were below last year's level and sales of low-price Bond Street increased significantly. Overall, PMI shipments in Russia were in line with last year. Our first quarter market share was up 0.3 points to 25.1% as measured by AC Nielsen. It should be noted that we have now switched to this service provider in Russia due to its more extensive market coverage. We have achieved double-digit OCI growth in local currency through pricing, and this has partially mitigated the negative currency impact on profitability in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>The impact of the global economic crisis on Ukraine has been worse than on Russia, and this has been compounded by political uncertainty. Nevertheless, our shipment volume in the first quarter rose by 0.7% and our market share for the period increased by 1.1 points to 35.8% driven by Parliament and Chesterfield.</p>
          <p>In an effort to boost revenues, Ukrainian government has brought forward to this May excise tax increases planned over the next two years. This is expected to result in large retail price increases, which in turn could lead to consumer down-trading. However, we believe that we will be able to maintain our leading position should any turmoil occur, thanks to our excellent momentum and broad brand portfolio.</p>
          <p>There has been no consumer down-trading in Indonesia, where our volume in the first quarter increased by 2.8%, broadly in line with the evolution in the total market. Consumer sentiment in Indonesia has been positively impacted by a reduction in inflation following significant price increases last year for cooking oil, gasoline and rice, and unemployment levels have remained stable. The Indonesian economy has weathered the economic storm much better than most countries in Asia, helped by its lower dependence on exports.</p>
          <p>The fastest growing segment in the Indonesian market is machine-made lighter tasting kreteks. This has helped us to grow the volume of A Mild by 12.5% in the quarter, while our hand-rolled Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna Hijau brands have been negatively impacted by a difficult transition to higher per-stick price points. In addition to a continued strong volume performance, we have been able to boost profitability in Indonesia by pricing both A Mild and Marlboro ahead of inflation.</p>
          <p>The fourth country I would like to talk about is Argentina. Their up-trading in the cigarette market has continued. This is a country that has been frequently mentioned by economic commentators as being particularly vulnerable. This pessimism is not reflected in the performance of the cigarette market so far this year.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, consumers continued to trade up from the low and super-low price segments to the mid-price Philip Morris brand and premium Marlboro. PMI's volume was up 1.2% and our three-month moving average market share through the end of January reached 72.2%, up 2.7 share points.</p>
          <p>In addition, we were able to implement price increases in order to improve our profitability. The outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. The introduction of a minimum excise tax in February should help minimize tax-driven down-trading to lower price brands over the longer term.</p>
          <p>As these four examples show, we are not witnessing a global consumer down-trading trend and the situation is quite different market by market.</p>
          <p>Some people have questioned our ability to continue to increase prices in the current economic environment. Our track record over the last six months shows that, on the contrary, we have retained our ability to increase prices in order to boost our profitability. As shown on this slide, we have increased prices across a broad range of markets, including Greece, Italy and Spain in the EU; Romania, Russia and Turkey in the EEMA; Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines in Asia; and Argentina, Canada and Mexico in the Latin America and Canada region.</p>
          <p>Also, you may have seen press reports that we have announced to the trade our intention to increase prices by &#x20AC;0.20 across our portfolio in Germany in June.</p>
          <p>Our pricing variance in the first quarter was $358 million. This is the largest pricing variance that we have ever achieved in a quarter. This highlights our ability to successfully implement price increases during a recession. In fact, our pricing variance this quarter was larger than our total annual pricing variance just three years ago in 2006.</p>
          <p>We trust that our presentation at CAGNY provided investors and analysts with a better understanding of how currency impacts our business. As anticipated, our first quarter results were severely impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Indeed, currency adversely impacted net revenues, OCI and EPS by some 700 million, 400 million and $0.15 respectively.</p>
          <p>As you are all aware, in recent weeks we have witnessed a slightly more favorable currency environment. In fact, should current spot rates prevail for the rest of the year, we would anticipate that our EPS would climb to the high end of our February guidance. While unit volume may be somewhat softer than our earlier expectations, we are confident that this shortfall, should it occur, will be more than offset by the benefit of pricing.</p>
          <p>All in all, given continued currency volatility, we believe that it would be imprudent to raise our guidance at this early stage of the year. However, our solid start to the year certainly affirms our confidence in achieving our 2009 constant currency EPS targeted growth of 10 to 14%.</p>
          <p>Let me now comment on our first quarter results in a little more detail. Our cigarette shipment volume was stable at 203 billion units, but was 1.1% lower excluding acquisitions. However, on a per-selling-day basis volume excluding acquisitions was stable, in spite of significant price increases. This represents a solid achievement in light of our strong results in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our shipment volume in the EU was down 3.7%, driven primarily by the aforementioned contraction of industry volume in Poland, and a slight market share erosion in Italy that was compounded by trade inventory distortions.</p>
          <p>At 38.4%, our estimated market share in the EU region was down 0.3 points, due mainly to the shedding of low-price, low-margin volume in Poland, as well as the impact of a slight decline in the premium segment in Italy. It is important to underline that our market shares in France, Germany and Spain have stabilized.</p>
          <p>In the EEMA region, volume was down 0.3%, but up 0.8% on a per-selling-day basis. This region includes our worldwide duty-free business, which was down 10.5% due to the expected impact of reduced travel. PMI volumes and market shares were strong notably in Algeria, Egypt and Turkey, and we also gained market share in Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.</p>
          <p>A very strong share performance in Korea, continued volume growth in Indonesia, and a favorable distributor inventory moment in Japan related to the resourcing of production from the USA to Europe last year drove a 2.2% shipment volume increase in the Asia region. We have stabilized our market share in Japan at 23.9%, thanks to the strong performance of Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Filter Plus, and have just launched Lark Classic Milds nationally and Lark Mint Splash in test market. In Korea, PMI gained 2.8 share points and achieved a record share of 13.8% in the first quarter, thanks to Marlboro, Parliament and Virginia Slims.</p>
          <p>In the Latin America and Canada region, reported volume was up 4.4%, boosted by our acquisition of Rothmans Inc. in Canada. Excluding acquisitions, shipments were down 4.7% due to our targeted inventory reductions and weaker consumer demand in Colombia, the impact of December price increases on industry volume in the first quarter in Mexico. Our share of the Mexican market increased by 2.3 share points to 69.2%, behind the strong performance of Benson &amp; Hedges and Delicados. Marlboro Fresh contributed 0.5 share points to the 48.3 share of the Marlboro family.</p>
          <p>On a brand basis, super-premium Parliament was a top performer with a growth of 5.9% in spite of the weakness of the duty-free business and the continued market decline in Japan. Volumes grew strongly in Korea, Russia, Turkey, and the Ukraine. After a particularly strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2008, Marlboro shipment volume was down 2.4% to 71.1 billion units, driven by lower industry volume and an 0.4 share point erosion in the EU region, the already mentioned decline in duty-free sales and a softening in the premium segment in Russia.</p>
          <p>We are not particularly perturbed by Marlboro's performance this quarter. As we continue to roll out our new brand architecture for Marlboro across many markets, we indeed remain very optimistic about the future of the brand. The new Marlboro Gold packaging has been introduced in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland after very positive trial results.</p>
          <p>The slimmer diameter Marlboro Gold Edge is performing ahead of expectations in Russia and Ukraine, and we are just launching Marlboro Gold Advanced, a 10 milligram product under the Gold umbrella, nationally in France after excellent consumer feedback in test markets. Under the Marlboro Fresh umbrella, Marlboro Black Menthol continues to drive the return to growth of the Marlboro franchise in Japan.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, Marlboro achieved a share of 10.4% in Japan, 0.5 points ahead of the same period last year, with Marlboro Black Menthol contributing a 1% share, and enabling U.S. to stabilize our overall share in the growing menthol segment at 44.9%. Given the success of Marlboro Black Menthol in Japan, it was launched during the first quarter in Hong Kong and Indonesia. In the mid-price segment, after achieving strong growth in 2008, Chesterfield volume remains resilient. A strong performance in the EU, their volume was up 5.5% thanks to Austria, France, and Portugal, was partly offset by a decline in Russia.</p>
          <p>L&amp;M is globally showing a stronger performance than in 2008, with volume just down by 0.5% in the first quarter, in spite of a continued double-digit decline in Russia and weakness of the Polish and duty-free markets. L&amp;M remains the fastest growing brand in Germany, and is the second largest cigarette brand in the EU region after Marlboro. Our key low-price international brands, Bond Street, Next, and Red &amp; White, achieved a combined volume of 15 billion units, up 1.5% over the first quarter of last year. Overall, during the first quarter, PMI volume by price segment remained very stable, with premium representing 49% of cigarette volume, mid-price 29% and low-price 22%, in line with the previous year.</p>
          <p>PMI's financial position remains very strong. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures, was $1.3 billion, in line with last year, as lower capital expenditures in the quarter offset the negative impact of currency on net earnings and working capital requirements remained firmly under control.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains very strong, and we continue to benefit from strong fixed income investor confidence. During the quarter, we successfully issued additional bonds for a total of &#x20AC;2 billion and 0.5 billion Swiss francs, and now have a weighted averaged cost of long-term debt of 5.6%. We continue to implement our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. We have declared our willingness to support our target dividend pay-out ratio of 65%. And, we spent $1.3 billion to repurchase 36.7 million shares during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As we have said previously, we do not expect the tobacco industry to be immune from the impact of the global economic crisis, but to remain resilient. This has been borne out during the first quarter. We have seen some softening of consumer trends in Russian and Ukraine, but no global negative pattern. We have continued volume growth for example in Indonesia, and further trading up from the low and super low price segments in Argentina. We have also seen some reductions in trade inventories in certain markets as our partners seek to optimize cash flows.</p>
          <p>If unemployment continues to increase, we may see a further softening of global consumer trends, but think that, should this occur, it is likely to be moderate in nature. We believe we have the strongest overall brand portfolio, and the best geographic balance in the industry between mature and emerging markets. The efforts that we have made to refresh our innovation pipeline and to strengthen the Marlboro architecture are beginning to bear fruit.</p>
          <p>As highlighted earlier, we have increased prices across a broad range of markets in order to partially mitigate the impact of unfavorable currency as well as any future potential volume or mix softness, and most recently have announced a price increase in Germany. The excise tax and regulatory environment continues to appear manageable. We are not aware of any potentially disruptive threats on the horizon in our key markets except as previously mentioned in Ukraine. We continue to implement our productivity progress, and are on track to deliver substantial cost savings.</p>
          <p>In the short term, we face some strong currency headwinds. Nevertheless, our business continues to generate substantial cash flows which, along with our very solid balance sheet, provide U.S. with excellent liquidity. We remain committed to a generous dividend level, and foresee share repurchase in 2009 at a level similar to those undertaken in 2008.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on further strengthening our brands and our overall business, and will therefore not take any measures that provide only the short-term gain. We remain committed to our mid to long-term currency-neutral financial growth targets, and strongly believe that we will be able to achieve them in 2009 in spite of the difficult economic environment.</p>
          <p>I will now be happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Christine Farkas of Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, Hermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Christine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am looking at the EU, I know &#x2013; I respect your comments about no global trade down, but looking at Marlboro share across France, Germany, Italy, and of course Poland, we did see some share erosion as well as some sequential slowdown in some key markets. Given the importance of the EU on your profits, can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing sequentially, and given the strong innovation portfolio behind Marlboro, why perhaps Marlboro isn't holding up better than what we saw in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I would say that if you look at the shares for the EU region, then you clearly can see that Marlboro is stabilizing. Let's not forget that Marlboro, over the past couple of years, was under pressure by price re-positionings of premium brands or mid-priced brands that went to the low end. That is behind us. We still have some slight share erosion in Germany; it's still down 0.6. France is down in the quarter-on-quarter comparison, but flat actually, if you compare it to the &#x2013; to Q4 of 2008. Spain down 0.5, Poland down 0.04.</p>
          <p>So, these aren't much lower rates than what you have seen. And actually, when you go to the innovation pipeline, well, look, we are just at the very beginning of rolling that out. You have the Marlboro re-launch, repackaging of Marlboro Gold. It's now in the markets in Germany, Austria, Poland, France, Italy. So, this is just starting. Marlboro Advanced 10 milligram product under the Gold umbrella; the roll out actually is only starting with France now late this month or the beginning of May. So, many of the initiatives that we have done has just started.</p>
          <p>There is much more to come. And, this is what gives me the confidence that this is going to strengthen the Marlboro franchise going forward. When it comes to the total EU market, then you have to see that there was one really very special item in there which was the trade or the retail inventory reduction in Spain, which was driven by working capital requirements of the tobacconists. These are all small entrepreneurs, which have brought their stocks a little bit down, but not to the point where we would risk any other stocks there. So, that had an impact on the markets, and therefore on the volumes this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that, Hermann. If I could follow up with just a couple of housekeeping items, could you quantify the cost savings achieved in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are &#x2013; we have to live with our 4 or 500 million actually last year. We are fully on track to achieve 500 million again this year. We have leaf cost increases in the quarter; that was 40 million. Again, that also something that reflect earlier. So, let me tell you I fully &#x2013; I can fully reassure you that we will deliver the next 500 million in the year 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And finally just on the chatter around multinational tax changes or potential changes in the U.S. tax regime, do you have any commentary about that, and what your potential impact or alternatives may be there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have. I mean, the most important thing first of all is that any limitation of tax deferral would put U.S. companies simply at a competitive disadvantage versus their international peers. That is certainly not something that the U.S. government wants. I would say that actually, probably what the U.S. government has in mind but all of those points don't apply to PMI. I mean, first, I think the government probably wants to avoid that foreign profits are parked abroad forever. I mean, our case is that three quarters of our earnings abroad are actually repatriated to the U.S. every year, in order to satisfy dividends and other U.S. dollar requirements.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that this is of course a fight against the abuse of tax havens. We are not using or abusing any of those tax havens. And the third one is probably that the government wants to avoid profit shifting via inter-company pricing abroad. I can tell you that we have conservative inter-company pricing policies around the world, consistent policies, and actually we secure those policies wherever feasible with advanced pricing agreements with the respective fiscal authorities of those countries.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of looking forward, we will see what will happen. We did some &#x2013; if you like simulation what the Rangel proposal actually would mean to us. You know that this is the idea of combining some restrictions of deferral and restrictions on possible deductions with a rate reduction, but that impact would be less than one percent on our tax rate. So, we will see what's going to come, but you can see we are clearly not the target that the U.S. government is having in mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Great. Thanks for that, Hermann.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Hermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First, Hermann, a question about market share. I think it's fair to say that your overall share trends improved throughout 2008 particularly in the fourth quarter, and it appears not just in the EU, but broadly that some of that momentum has moderated in the first quarter. Do you think that's a fair observation, and if it is true, what's happening?  Is it a reflection of the economy, your premium price positioning, the price increases you've taken, and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have been talking about the EU before. Let's go to the other regions. I do not agree with the statement. I mean, let's go one by one. You go to the Asia region. There, actually, we have stabilized our share in Japan, a very important market at 23.9%. We are growing tremendously in Korea.</p>
          <p>We are growing 2.3% in Singapore to 48. The region share in terms of in-market sales is also up 0.3% to 19.8. So, that's not valid I would say for the Asia region. If I then go over to the EMEA region, then when you look at the Nielsen shares; well our shares both in Russia and Ukraine and actually in Turkey, another important market, are up quite a bit. So, no, I don't see any general trends. There are always specific market situation on a market-to-market basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, Hermann, is illicit trade becoming any more of an issue with the weakening economies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't see that. I mean, illicit trade I would say in general is rather triggered by large price differentials between neighboring countries. No, we don't see an increase there. It remains a problem, but it's not increasing; it's not much decreasing either. I mean our EU agreement there is very successful. You have seen that the U.K. actually joined now the EU agreements just a couple of days or a week ago. Now all 25 member states are now part of that agreement.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Okay. And then two last things, Hermann. The &#x2013; with respect to share repurchases, what's the argument given where the stock is valued, where it traded in the first quarter?  What's the argument against either accelerating the program which &#x2013; or just front-end loading it a bit, given the current stock price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean it's again &#x2013; it would be a speculating if you like at the end of the day. We have been pretty heavy in the market in the first quarter I would say, 1.3 billion is U.S. $1.3 billion, that's a sizable amount of money I would say. We will continue to do what we did that in principle and in general we will go on a steady pace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, Hermann, in Brazil, I know it's not a big profit center for you, but BAT led a price increase in that market I think a few weeks ago. Have you followed them as of yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are filing our price lists today and the price list contains substantial price increases across the board of our portfolio. That being said, it's a bit unfortunate that this heavy excise-increase-driven change was not accompanied by a reform of the excise tax system, which in my opinion is overdue in Brazil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="inaudible" /> UBS. Yes, a couple of things, in Germany, taken a price increase for the first time for a number of years. Given the down-trading continues and then there still seems to be a problem with illicit trade, is <mark type="audio gap" /> perhaps you've accepted the sort of ongoing down-trading within Germany or is that something that can still be stopped?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I mean the German market is not an easy market; has never been an easy market. But I mean I think in terms of performance, we have seen substantial improvement in Germany. We have a great team there. They have done a great job. Our share performance for cigarettes is stable now at 35.8%. So we have really stabilized Marlboro in that market is still slightly down.</p>
          <p>The new Gold &#x2013; the new pack design is going out there. At the same time, we have established L&amp;M at the low price, which as you know is not that much of a difference in price than in other markets, just some $0.40. We have established L&amp;M there. It is the fastest growing major brand in the market. It is now at 7.6% share. It's having an <mark type="inaudible" /> to 24 share of 15%. So I think overall we are doing fine in the market. It's just that the market environment in that sense has changed.</p>
          <p>And what you were used to say three, four, five years ago that we were talking about the image contenders between Marlboro, Lucky Strike and Gauloises Blondes, and today we talk about those three together eventually versus at the low end JPSs, the Pall Malls, and most importantly our L&amp;M.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, on the Ukraine, I mean you mentioned the big tax increases coming through in May, are you therefore expecting &#x2013; I mean is the slight increase in volumes now and the trade, is that just going to be, we're going to see a sort of very large trade load in the second quarter, is that something that's illegal in the Ukraine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not going to be much of a loading question there in the Ukraine. I mean the thing in the Ukraine simply is, and that's why we issued the word of caution there on that market, is that whilst overall prices are still I would say nevertheless in the affordable area, nevertheless we have seen a series of excise-driven price increases in a very short timeframe. You had one in September of '08, you had another one in January, and now you will have another one in May. So kind of the speed of those price adaptations is what really &#x2013; what makes it difficult &#x2013; in an overall really difficult economic environment for that country. So that's I think is the crucial point in the Ukraine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And in Canada, just lastly include the industry signed an agreement to try and get the Canadian government's crackdown on the illicit trade there, there seems to be a bit of a slowdown in the decline of the market. I mean is the enforcement agencies actually looking at the issue of cigarettes coming off the reservations or is that still an issue to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is still an issue and we don't see much improvement there yet. The one notable improvement I do is see, however, is that the problem gets much more media attention and usually governments' attention follows media attention. So that's a good development because at a certain point in time this will need more enforcement, and therefore more government intervention into that topic. But we talk about 30% of consumption which is coming out illegally out of these reservations.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. A question on the balance if I may between pricing and share. You said that &#x2013; if I understand you right &#x2013; you are extremely confident that your constant currency earnings guidance for the year will be met even if volumes are perhaps slightly weaker than expected and if necessary that you will increase pricing and clearly this year you've already have a huge increase in pricing as you said on the pricing variance.</p>
          <p>But at the same time I'm interested in how you square that in &#x2013; with the market share loss in the EU and there are beginning to be some signs of down-trading in Russia, which I guess is your most important emerging market. And in the past you've &#x2013; I've always understood that you wanted to balance profit growth and share growth. And I was wondering just in this rather difficult year whether there's a slight change in emphasis compared with where you may have been a few years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean I can only talk about past pricing here. You see what we have done. Look, I mean this is not a question that you'll answer for the world. This is not a question that you can answer for a region. This is clearly an answer on a market-per-market basis. We try to find the right balance there, that's what we have done in the past, that's what we do now, that's what we want to do going forward. It is a balance overall on a market-per-market basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess what I infer from that; if in some markets you lose a bit of share, but you basically improve the profit by taking pricing as you have done, then you are very comfortable with that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi, Hermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Judy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One question on Russia here, as you see signs of some down-trading in that market, can you talk about what's happening with price gaps between premium and low-price?  And as down-trading is happening, do you sense any reluctance on the part of your competitors to follow on price increases or is this industry still pretty rational in terms of the pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean in terms of price gaps in the Russian market, they have not increased substantially. I mean sometimes at the low end it's a little bit less in absolute terms in terms of our price increases than at the high end. I mean the gaps in Russia are wide in any case. So therefore &#x2013; I mean the question of down-trading is not driven by price gaps in that market. I'm speaking Russia here. It is really rather the environment overall.</p>
          <p>And then when you looked that at our in-market sales data and you see that actually Parliament, which is super-premium, continues to grow, then Marlboro being premium, Chesterfield being at the high end of the mid-price being in &#x2013; somewhat declining. And then you see sharp increases at the low end, in our case with Bond Street being up 27% almost.</p>
          <p>Then it's clear what's happening there and it's clear how the different segments of population are doing. So this is very much driven by that. Let me add there that actually Parliament in our case in Russia is a bigger brand than Marlboro. And actually the margin we derived from Parliament in Russia are about 50% higher than the ones from Marlboro, if I may add that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in Latin America and Canada regions, Hermann, you saw profits down about 9% if you take out currency and there's actually &#x2013; pricing seemed pretty favorable there. So I am just wondering what happened just from a profitability perspective in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Of course minus 9%, I agree with you sounds terrible, but that actually means in absolute terms $14 million. So of course, I mean, we have to put it into the context there. This is actually driven really by trade inventory adjustments; Colombia as I mentioned, also a little bit in the Dominican Republic. Then in terms of comparison to the year before, you had an excise windfall profit in Ecuador which you don't have this year. So it's kind of unfavorable comparisons there.</p>
          <p>And in terms of absolute money, we don't talk about big stuff. I mean let me put it this way; there is nothing fundamentally wrong in the business model to the country. We are doing well. We had price increases, as you said, in both Mexico and Argentina. We are growing share in our most important markets of Mexico, up 2.2% to 69.2, Argentina 72.2 I mentioned. Brazil is also up. And important, Canada is up also one share point pro forma if you compare it to really a year ago where we were not yet 100% owner of the company. So there's nothing fundamentally wrong in the Latin America region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally on currency, Hermann, if I look at your first quarter, it looks like currency was about a $0.15 of a negative impact. I think your guidance still implies about $0.80 hit for the full year. And I know you've alluded to some favorability that we're seeing more recently. But if you sort of annualize the $0.15, you get $0.60. And then fourth quarter I'd imagine year-over-year comparisons are actually more favorable versus kind of the first three quarters of the year. So it actually seems like there is even bigger currency upside than kind of the EPS coming in at the high end of your guidance at spot rates. Am I not reading this correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I mean we are doing here also kind of regularly our currency sensitivities of where we think we're going to come out. And it's actually the volatility in there which is the key argument. I mean we had this $0.80 of impact when we gave the guidance at spot rates then, beginning of February.</p>
          <p>Then actually if you would rerun and we did rerun the simulation at quarter-close, i.e. at the end of March, the $0.80 would be $0.75. Then if I would do it and we did do it again on Monday this week, then it was $0.70. And if I do it yesterday, it's $0.73. You see the volatility up and down in there. So given that volatility we simply see no basis to change our guidance based on currency at this point in time. Let's talk again once we have three more months of actuals after end of quarter two.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you talked about Spain and the one-off inventory change that you saw there due to working capital requirements for the wholesalers. What gives you the confidence that this is only a one-quarter phenomenon?  Why couldn't this drag out into second and third quarter as well?  And how much do the price increases in Spain have to do with the volume shift there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's the price increases. It is really working capital at the retailer level. But I think that they are at least close to the levels that they really, really need. I would imagine that quite a number of retailers given the difficult situation the whole country is in and they are in in terms of working capital that they had a close look at their inventories again, what they really really need and that's what they have adjusted to. I mean if I just give you a comparison, I mean you had the 10% down as I mentioned. But if you take the last four-week moving average, then it's only down 3.1%. So I think that has already come down and I think it was an adjustment and it should not repeat itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the down trading that you're now seeing in Russia; you said it was driven by the state of the economy and commodity prices. What has to happen for the down-tradings to turn into up trading again? Is it entirely the oil price and other commodity prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the oil prices, the commodity prices, I mean they will &#x2013; they would have certainly an immediate and big impact on the currency rate of the ruble. For the consumer, I think &#x2013; and it's all about consumer confidence to start with. And I would say a leading indicator be it Russia or be it elsewhere is unemployment rates. Steeply rising unemployment rates are always a warning signal and improving rates are a good signal. I think that's what I would look at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last question on Poland real quick. How much is the illicit trade driven by the tax amortization there in Poland, a problem that's contributing to the volume decline there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. It is righted. Of course now Polish prices are relatively high, and therefore there is now inflow into Poland whereas we were rather used to inflow from Poland into Germany. So I mean the thing really is that the key to the situation in Poland is higher than not that. It plays a role. I mean you are right, it plays a role. But the key there is simply that driven by EU accession, and therefore compliance with the EUX's requirements. We had a series of really steep excise-driven price increases in the market. I mean look today, eight zlotys, are Marlboro prices after a stock depletion we have already announced, almost nine zlotys for a pack of Marlboro.</p>
          <p>That's quite a price, and the whole portfolio in the market has become much more expensive than what it used to be. Smoking incidents, which used to be in the range of 40% or even slightly above in Poland is coming down to, last measurement date, we have about 33% in the market. That's a steep decline. On the other hand, this is a rather normal rate for a Western European county. So, it's rather there, than in cross-border sales.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody, a couple of things. First of all, on Germany, how optimistic are you that the price increase you've announced for June is going to be something which generates a longer-term price increase, or is it something that will just be in there for however many months it is before the number of sticks per pack goes up?  And then, the second thing was on &#x2013; just on this general situation of distributors and destocking. Are there any other markets around the world where you think there might be vulnerabilities to that going on that we haven't seen yet, that you are concerned about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, the first question on Germany, I'm not commenting on future pricing, but I fully enjoy the existing price increase that we have announced. Then, on the minimum pack content, yes, that law is in the parliamentary process. I see no reason why that piece of legislation should fail. So, the change to the new minimum pack content of 19s can eventually be in August. In terms of stock reductions, it &#x2013; they leveled. I mean, we have in the general trend, we probably have seen that already. I mean, Spain was of a magnitude that I do not see repeated elsewhere.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we took care of it with our partners in the trade try to manage pretty tightly those stocks. So, I can't exclude some adjustments in addition in other markets driven by the financial situation, but only by that. But, it would not lead to a situation that would have impact on the competitive position, i.e., I cannot see a situation that that would trigger out of stocks. There we have the necessary trade programs in place with our partners to make sure that there is always enough stock available.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just last &#x2013; sorry on Japan, where you benefited, I think, a little bit in shipment terms because of this reduction move from the U.S., Europe, is that going to unwind in the next quarter or coming quarters, or is that a sort of one-off adjustment that we won't see again?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Look, I mean, overall, I mean, maybe a couple of words there really on the situation in Japan. I mean the underlying market decline in that market because the minus 5.5% down on the market is of course influenced also by selling days. I think the underlying market decline is rather in the range of 4%. We are really happy that we have stabilized our share performance in the market. That's very, very important. Marlboro is up. That was our priority in terms of market competitiveness. We have achieved that. And, we have doubled that share in young adult share. And so, I think we've been doing pretty well there. Congratulations to the team down there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I wonder do you have like an overall measure of your product mix in the quarter?  Would that have been positive in the quarter?  I know you had a little challenge of course with Marlboro being down in volume, but was your overall product mix &#x2013; can you give a measure that you could share with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of our volumes, I mean there we have that chart in the presentation there. Premium, mid and low, that actually &#x2013; the percentage rates have not changed versus last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, right, that's the best way to look at it, sure. And then, I guess, may be you perhaps you answered this question before, but I was surprised by the degree of the OCI increase in Russia given the weakness in Marlboro, but perhaps Parliament was that much stronger that it overcame that. Would that be the main factor even though you had big growth in the low end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, in Russia, first of all, we have gained market share. We have kept our volumes stable. We had very nice increases on Parliament, and of course, overall, we had substantial price increases in the market. So, it's the combination of those elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. And, just one last question. You've mentioned how volumes could be tied to unemployment. That's no secret. I guess my question would be that as much as your &#x2013; you've been very strong and diligent about taking pricing and seemingly really focusing on profitability, as you look ahead, are there markets, or have you seen this I guess to-date where you're having to get more &#x2013; a little more promotional because of whether it's down trading or it's just weakness in volumes that's forcing you to be a little bit more volume-sensitive than may be you would like to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean in terms of us making promotional price offers or ...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, correct, you promoting more heavily to try and maybe stabilize volume or to slow some down trading. Are there any markets where you've had to move on that to this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, look, I mean first of all, it plays a much lesser role in the international markets than it does play in the U.S. So, we have that to a much lesser extent. And, actually our target would rather be to bring that in as a general rule to bring it down than up. So, there might be here and there a market where we need to do it for a technical reason at a certain point in time. But, is there a general trend to that? Then the answer is clearly, no.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good Morning, Hermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to follow up there a little bit more in terms of Polish situation. Given the excise tax increases have &#x2013; now that have been put in place, and are unlikely to increase further, is it fair to think that we could gradually see some recovery in Polish volume over time, given that the illicit trade doesn't appear to be massively increasing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean, the situation in Poland, I would describe that at present we are managing through a very difficult environment. With all those tax-driven and price-driven consumption declines in the market, some down trading to OTPs, so the economic downturn, so that that is a difficult period that we have to manage through.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, now and after the end of this transition period by the end June, the consumer will see the new prices finally. So, there will be another price increase for the consumer if you like by that time. That being said, going forward in the Polish market, I see really substantially improved parameters. I mean, the excise tax place, is now in place, the system is being reformed, ad valorem went down, specific went up, there is an effective MET in place, forestalling regulation is in place. So, these crazy situations we have seen before should not repeat itself.</p>
          <p>There is no new excise tax increase on the horizon. So, I think overall that's gonna be okay. And therefore, going forward, I would say that our performance in the market is also bound to improve once that has all shaken out and once we come back to a normal marketing and sales competition in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then, just going back to the Russian situation, could you give us some more precise information on the degree to which pricing has come up in the Russian market, perhaps in different segments, say since December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, look, I mean, essentially if you look at the two recent price moves that we did, then that was December-January, where we went up at the high end by two rubles and one and a half at the low end, and then the next one in April where we went roughly two rubles at the high end and one ruble at the low end.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hermann, I wanted to ask about the tax &#x2013; the raised in the U.K. were announced increase in the U.K. on both tobacco and alcohol, and is this in line and in your forecast? And should we be concerned that we might see a drop in smoking incidents in pubs given prices are going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I personally don't think so, because look at the overall price levels in the U.K. already today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, you highlighted the higher leaf &#x2013; tobacco leaf cost in the first quarter. What is your expectation for leaf cost in the second half versus the second half of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Look, essentially, what happened on leaf there is really that we had to bite the bullet already last year. I mean, the price increases in terms of cash flow came last year. So, we bought at those higher prices, and there was a cash impact last year of $480 million.</p>
          <p>And, now this of course washes into the income statement as you use the leaf. So, this crop is actually going to be a much larger crop, and we expect the situation already to normalize this year. But, what we have on stock we have on stock. So, I would say it's something between 250 and 300 million for our P&amp;L this year. However, that amount is of course included in our guidance.</p>
