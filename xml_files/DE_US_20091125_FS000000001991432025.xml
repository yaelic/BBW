      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marie. John Deere today announced the completion of a solidly profitable year. We did so in the face of challenging market conditions, affecting virtually every one of the company's major businesses and major markets. Earnings alone though tell only part of the story, and the fact is 2009 was a year of significant achievement in many ways. 2009, for example, saw the biggest single year sales decline in company history, over $5 billion. Yet our net income of just under 900 million was the eighth highest ever.</p>
          <p>What's more, John Deere generated a good deal of cash last year, $1.4 billion from the equipment operations. That was more than enough to cover capital expenditures and dividends, both of which continued at healthy rates, and it leads to another impressive statistic. Company and dealer inventories came down by well over $1 billion last year. As a result, these inventories in relation to sales finished the year right where they started, at 24%. That's quite an accomplishment in light of the magnitude of the sales downturn.</p>
          <p>What about economic profit or SVA, one of the primary metrics used to manage the company. SVA was obviously much lower for the year, but it actually remained in positive territory for our equipment businesses. Liquidity was another success story. In spite of the worst financial crisis in memory, the company maintained competitive access to the credit markets. We issued over $9 billion in new debt and have the cash in hand to fund virtually all the maturities coming up through 2010.</p>
          <p>Partly as a result, our customers were able to experience uninterrupted access to financing from John Deere. No doubt, 2009 was one tough year, but the company remained on a profitable footing, reinforced its financial position, continued to fund important projects, maintained its dividend rates and made further progress on a number of other fronts.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the fourth quarter in more detail, starting with slide three. For the quarter, Deere reported a net loss of $223 million on net sales and revenues of $5.3 billion. On slide four, if you look beyond the headline numbers and exclude the two items called out in our press release this morning, the goodwill impairment charge for John Deere Landscapes and the charge for the voluntary employee-separation program, net income as adjusted was $99 million or $0.23 per share for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide five includes the charges for the closure of our factory in Welland, Ontario, Canada, in the fourth quarter of 2009 and for the full year. Although this number is negligible in the year-over-year comparisons, we are providing it for those who are tracking the Welland closure expenses. Last year at this time, we provided the fourth quarter 2008 charge for Welland, which is found in the appendix on slide 38.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at slide six, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 30% in the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter 2008. Currency translation on net sales was positive by about one point with about three points of positive price realization. Both of our equipment divisions had positive price realization in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide seven, worldwide production tonnage was down 38% in the quarter. This is a bit better than our fourth quarter forecast provided in August. The single biggest factor behind the improvement was the successful start-up of and better than expected demand for the new 8R series tractors produced at our factory in Waterloo, Iowa.</p>
          <p>Looking at the bottom chart on this slide, worldwide production tonnage is expected to decrease about 17% in the first quarter, with the second and third quarters being approximately flat and a double-digit upturn in production tonnage in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We thought it would be helpful to provide total worldwide tonnage by quarter for fiscal 2010 so you can get a feel for how the year shapes up. Clearly, it implies a difficult first quarter with improvement as the year progresses. For the full year, projected production is down only about 3%.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the company outlook on slide eight. First quarter net sales are expected to be down about 10% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Currency translation on net sales is positive by about three points with about two points of positive price realization. Price realization in each of the first three quarters of 2009 was about six points, meaning 2010 will be up against stiff comparisons.</p>
          <p>For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be down about 1% compared with fiscal year 2009. This includes about one point of positive currency translation on net sales and one to two points of positive price realization. Net income for the year is forecast to be about $900 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with agriculture and turf on slide nine. In the quarter, net sales were down 26% and production tonnage was down 36%. The division had an operating loss of $24 million in the quarter with the largest factor being lower production and the related loss absorption. Also having a negative impact on operating profits were charges of $365 million for goodwill impairment and voluntary employee-separation. Lower raw material costs and positive price realization helped offset these charges all of which resulted in a reported decremental margin of about 34%.</p>
          <p>Excluding the goodwill impairment and voluntary employee-separation charges, the division delivered an 8% decremental margin on a 26% sales reduction. This is a non-GAAP financial measure. The reconciliation to GAAP is on slide 37 in the appendix. Finally, in an extremely difficult year, the division reduced receivables and inventories by approximately $900 million.</p>
          <p>Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business in 2010 starting on slide 10. As everyone is aware, due to very cool weather and wet field conditions, this year's U.S. corn harvest is one of the slowest on record. The size and quality of the corn crop is in question. Our consultant, Informa, estimate that about 250 million bushels of corn have been lost. Mold and fungus have been found in some of the harvested corn, which could affect the crop's nutritional value. Core corn quality could mean more grain needed to deliver the proper level of nutrition.</p>
          <p>Projected commodity prices are on slide 11 where you can see we have included our first look at commodity prices for the 2010-2011 crop year. Strong demand, the late harvest, and a weaker dollar, which help support exports are keeping corn prices at attractive levels. For soybeans, tight stocks will keep prices relatively high in the near term. Exports from the U.S. are expected to remain strong due to last year's low South American production and robust Chinese demand.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12, forecast prices as you can see are below the very high levels of last year, but remain strong on a historical basis. On slide 13, U.S. farm cash receipts are forecast to be down in 2009, but 2010 cash receipts are expected to show a slight increase.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 highlights the big changes that have taken place in U.S. farm cash receipts over the years. As you can see, the 2009 receipts are down, but remain at extremely attractive levels. As you've just seen, commodity prices and cash receipts are expected to remain at good levels. Although the livestock and dairy sectors are under stress, the balance sheet and income statements of the U.S. agriculture sector are strong. Despite positive fundamentals, farmers follow the daily news and are as concerned as anyone about the general economy. It is one reason farmers are expected to be somewhat cautious in their purchasing decisions in the year ahead.</p>
          <p>Also keep in mind that most farm equipment purchases are driven by cash receipts in the current year and in the year immediately before. While 2010 receipts are attractive, they also are an additional year removed from the record high of 2008. Putting all that together, as you can see on slide 15, our outlook for industry sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada is down about 10% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Western Europe ag sales are expected to be down 10 to 15% in the year, mainly due to lower incomes in the key sectors of livestock, dairy and grain. That's one of the reasons that Western European farmer confidence is low and purchases there are being made cautiously. Another factor is rising used equipment inventories in Western Europe. Prior to the liquidity crisis, Eastern Europe, including the CIS countries were important markets for the sale of used equipment from Western Europe.</p>
          <p>In 2009, these markets were effectively closed off. We expect sales in Central Europe and the CIS to remain under pressure as well due to weak general economic conditions and tight credit. Although the near-term outlook is somewhat bleak, we believe Russia offers enormous long-term market potential for our ag, forestry and construction equipment.</p>
          <p>In the appendix on slide 43 is a picture of our new assembly and part center in Domodedovo, Russia, where we plan to begin operations in the spring of 2010. This strategic investment reflects Deere's confidence in the long-term potential of the Russian market.</p>
          <p>South America sales are projected to increase 10 to 15% as parts of the region recover from last year's drought. Brazil farm income is expected to receive support from attractive prices for sugarcane and soybeans, which are main drivers of ag machinery purchases in that country.</p>
          <p>The forecast assumes the Brazilian currency does not appreciate further against the U.S. dollar. It also assumes that producers continue receiving help from government supported financing, and that Federal and State programs remain in effect for the purchase of small tractors.</p>
          <p>Turning to another product category, we expect retail sales of turf equipment and compact utility tractors in the U.S. and Canada to be flat for the year after a sharp drop in 2009. Deere sales for worldwide ag and turf are projected to be down about 4% in the year. Currency translation on net sales is projected to be positive about two points.</p>
          <p>Product mix: referring to the sales of different categories of equipment, is key to understanding the 2010 outlook. Slight 39 in the appendix illustrates the approximate breakdown of sales by equipment category in 2009. Sales of large ag product such as large tractors, combines and sprayers account for nearly half of the division's sales and absorb a lot of overhead. In 2010, sales of large ag products will be down almost 10%. This will have a negative impact on margins. Mix will cost the division about one point of operating margins for full year 2010.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, lower absorption will cost about two points of margin reflecting the significant drop in production tonnage. It will also offset the amounts charged for goodwill impairment and voluntarily employee separation in 2009 and the savings from lower material costs. In addition, about 300 million of the increase in pension and OPEB expense will be charged to ag and turf.</p>
          <p>Finally, the division will see higher R&amp;D expense, primarily for Interim Tier 4, the regulatory engine emission standards in the U.S. and Europe. Bottom line is, the division's margins, our forecasts remain similar to those in 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's focus now on construction and forestry on slide 17. With continuing weak markets in the U.S. and abroad, net sales were down 47% in the quarter, production tonnage was down 50%. Even under these conditions, the division had operating profit of $2 million. Again this quarter, C&amp;F demonstrated commitment to its trough management plans through tight expense control. The result was a decremental margin of 15%, which is quite respectable considering the state of the construction and forestry market. Although production levels and sales have been extremely low, C&amp;F has continued to aggressively manage inventories, helping to support positive price realization in the quarter and the year.</p>
          <p>At the end of October, Deere construction dealers in the U.S. and Canada were carrying less than half as much inventory as the rest of the industry, based on percent of days on hand. This further highlights the success of our efforts to align production with demand and set the stage for our 2010 outlook.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, construction and forestry sales are expected to be up about 18% in 2010 from the very low levels of 2009. The focus on inventory management the last few years will now enable us to produce near retail demand. Construction and forestry production tonnage is expected to be up by double digits in the last three quarter of the year, which is quite a change after being down 50% in 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to forestry, we expect a bit of a recovery as a result of improving global economic conditions, better pulp prices and low field inventories. Again, this is in comparison with very low levels of 2009. Although the division will benefit from these positive factors, they will be offset with a higher charge of about 100 million of the increase in pension and OPEB expense and by higher R&amp;D expenses, primarily for interim Tier 4.</p>
          <p>As a result, the C&amp;F division's operating margins are expected to be similar to 2009. On the construction side as you can see from the chart, U.S. economic indicators for 2010 indicate the retail market will remain weak.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to our credit operations. Traditionally at this time, we present only the worldwide credit operations. Today though, we will discuss the worldwide credit operations and John Deere Capital Corporation. To keep it simple, the Capital Corporation primarily finances the U.S., European and Australian portfolios and issues publicly traded debt. The worldwide credit operations include John Deere Capital Corporation as well as credit companies in Canada, Brazil, Finland and also include John Deere renewable.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows the worldwide credit operation's provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average portfolio. The 0.89% reflects higher losses and an increase in the allowance for credit losses.</p>
          <p>On slide 20, still in the worldwide credit operations, past dues representing customer payment 60 days past due, and full year write-offs for ag and turf retail notes, which represent more than half of the total portfolio are still extremely low. Performance like this is testimony to the high quality of the notes in the portfolio. What you see in the C&amp;F and revolving charge portfolios is a reflection of current economic conditions. Slide 21 breaks down the owned portfolio at 31 October 2009 by market for the worldwide credit operations.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 22, the worldwide credit operations had a net loss of $22 million in the quarter versus net income 67 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. We will discuss the two biggest factors accounting for this loss. First is a $57 million reversal of the wind energy investment tax credits that were taken in the second and third quarters of 2009.</p>
          <p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included two new incentive options available on qualifying renewable energy projects. The election to claim the investment tax credit in lieu of the production tax credit or the option to elect a government cash grant in lieu of the investment tax credit, the application and administration guidelines for cash grants were not available until the summer of 2009.</p>
          <p>After evaluating these two incentive options, the company determined the use of cash grants allows for more operational flexibility than investment tax credits with about the same economic return. However, the accounting is different on each option. Tax credits were recognized immediately in income, while cash grants are recognized as income over the life of the project.</p>
          <p>In summary, the election of a cash grant in lieu of investment tax credit had a $45 million impact on the tax provision in the fourth quarter for the worldwide credit operations.</p>
          <p>The second item was a $25 million charge after-tax for higher write-off and an increase to the allowance for credit losses. In 2009, the higher provision brought the year end allowance as a percent of the total portfolio to 116 basis points versus 86 basis points in 2008. Looking ahead, we're projecting net income of about 240 million for the worldwide credit operations in 2010. The forecast assumes the provision for credit loss rates in dollar terms stabilizes at near 2009 levels.</p>
          <p>Now we're going to shift gears and look at John Deere Capital Corporation's results for the quarter on slide 23. Importantly, the Capital Corporation had net income of 21 million in the quarter versus net income of 58 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Among other things, this reflects the higher write-off in the C&amp;F and revolving charge portfolios as we just saw.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 provides detail on John Deere Capital Corporation's portfolio, 60 days past due and write-off as a percent of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn our focus back to the equipment operations and take a look at receivables and inventory on slide 25. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were down nearly $1.3 billion for the year as we aligned production and inventories with retail demand. We anticipate receivables and inventories to be roughly flat in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 26 presents the product category details for the month of October expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were down 35%, Deere was down double digits, but less than the industry. Row-Crop tractor industry sales were down 22% and Deere was down slightly less than the industry. Four-wheel-drive tractor industry sales were down 6%, Deere was up a single digit.</p>
          <p>Combine industry sales were up 6%, Deere was down double digits. If you look at the bottom chart, for Row-Crop tractors, Deere ended October with inventories at 23% of trailing 12 month sales, up from an unsustainably low 11% at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Combine inventories were at 2% of sales. Turning to slide 27, in Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors were down double digits and combines were up a single digit in October. Deere's retail sales of selected turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were down double digits in the month, while construction and forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada on both our first and the third and settlement basis were down double digits for the month.</p>
          <p>Slide 28, shows raw material and logistics costs were down 235 million in the quarter versus the implied guidance of down about 150 million. We ended fiscal 2009 with a year-over-year increase in raw materials and logistics costs of $215 million. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect material cost decreases of approximately 150 to 200 million for the year, all ag and turf.</p>
          <p>The financial forecast incorporates all the decrease in the first half of the fiscal year and assumes that things will be flat for the second half.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&amp;D expense on slide 29, R&amp;D decreased 4% in the fourth quarter, but was up 4% for the year. R&amp;D expense is expected to be up about 11% in fiscal 2010. The bulk of the increase is accounted for by Interim Tier 4 emission spending.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide 30, the 2010 forecast calls for an increase of about 400 million in pension and OPEB expense, primarily due to a change in the discount rate. As you can see on the slide, of the $400 million change, about $325 million will hit cost of sales leaving about 75 million in SA&amp;G. As mentioned earlier, ag and turf has responsibility for about 300 million of the additional expense, while the increase for C&amp;F will be about $100 million. Approximately $125 million of the increase is expected to occur in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 31, equipment operation's SA&amp;G expense was down about 2% in the quarter. Lower variable incentive compensation accounted for about three points of the reduction, but currency had an unfavorable impact of about one point. In 2010, we project SA&amp;G to be up about six points, currency will account for about four points of the change and pension and OPEB adds another three points.</p>
          <p>Moving to the tax rate on slide 32. The fourth quarter and full-year tax rate look odd because most of the goodwill impairment is non-deductible. For 2010, the full-year effective tax rate is expected to be about 35%. One important observation about 2009, turning to slide 33, is the strong cash flow we have continued to experience from our equipment operations, even in some tough market conditions. This reflects in large part, our success managing assets and controlling working capital levels. As you can see, we anticipate very strong cash flow from operations in 2010, which is further testament to the success of the SVA model.</p>
          <p>On slide 34, capital expenditures, primarily driven by Interim Tier 4 spending were 788 million for the equipment operations in 2009. Depreciation and amortization was about &#x2013; was 516 million and we contributed 358 million to pension and OPEB. Financial services capital expenditures, primarily reflecting wind projects were $119 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, slide 35 highlights the forecast numbers for fiscal 2010. Capital expenditures are expected to be between 850 and $900 million, primarily driven by Interim Tier 4. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $550 million. Our forecast currently includes about $400 million pension and OPEB contributions in the year, and capital spending for financial services is forecast around $200 million in 2010, primarily for wind projects.</p>
          <p>In closing, John Deere has wrapped up a solid year in a difficult market environment. Looking ahead, we're forecasting a performance along similar lines in 2010. The first quarter of 2010 will hold the chair of challenge, as we keep a tight rein on production and run our factories at low levels.</p>
          <p>Production will pick up some later in the year, but remember the conditions overall are expected to remain fairly restrained. As we position our operations to keep pace with customer demand however, we'll be setting the stage to fully capitalize on any future upturn in our markets. And we'll be making further preparation for a promising future based on the world's prospects for population and economic growth over time.</p>
          <p>The global economic slump has taken a toll on the financial results of many companies, including John Deere, but the recession has not changed the fact that the world's population still needs food to eat, clothes to wear, shelter to live in, and infrastructure to support its lifestyle. And it hasn't changed our belief that no other company is in a better position to respond to these needs, day in and day out than John Deere.</p>

          <p>I was hoping we could talk a little bit about cash in 2010, and I'll put my question and follow-up together. Should we be expecting, I guess working capital to start to become a use as things kind of stabilize here and you rebuild a little bit. And give us your thoughts with respect to that? And then, obviously you have basically no net debt on the equipment balance sheet here. What's your thinking with respect to how much cash you need to keep on the balance sheet as we go through 2010?</p>

          <p>Let me start with working capital. Our forecast currently has trade receivables and inventories for the enterprise, but that includes the equipment operation piece that is funded by the Capital Corporation staying about flat in 2010, so I wouldn't expect a big change.</p>

          <p>I think, as we've said before that we've decided in this environment to maintain a relatively conservative financial position with a sufficient amount of liquidity, given the choppy nature of what we saw over the last year and now I think you can anticipate that we will continue with that posture throughout 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, but you've also said that over time you would expect to draw down that liquidity as market conditions allowed and I guess what you're saying is that you see no signs that they are allowing that so far?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that everybody. Just one quick cleanup question, I thought your separation charges were going to be about 85 million in 4Q. It was 47, are those going to come back later? What was the reason for the forecast versus the actual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe we have got pre-tax or full year or something mixed in here. Bob, the separation for the full year on an after-tax basis is about, this is &#x2013; well, it's exactly 57.6 million in the quarter, 47.6. And then on a pre-tax basis, the voluntary separation in the quarter is 76 million and I don't have it for the full year &#x2013; 91.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So pre-tax in the quarter it was 76, I think you expected 85, so it's not such a big gap. Okay. Okay. Second question would be, and this is just a bigger question, when you're talking to farmers especially in the U.S. and Canada, are you hearing caution because they don't how they are going to end up the year or are you hearing just &#x2013; we just flat don't want to buy or are you hearing we don't know yet because we haven't finished?</p>
          <p>And then the second part of that would be are you seeing a big split between tractors and combines? Because combines have been stronger this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually as I think Susan alluded to earlier, I'm sure you are all aware, the harvest has been running very late, so we've seen our farm customers very much focused on trying to get that crop in. Interestingly, in the month of October, we saw a big decline in our used combine inventories that our dealers are financing as customers were getting additional equipment to help support their requirements in the harvest.</p>
          <p>As we moved out of October and into November, we have seen actually a pickup in the pace of retail activity and it actually influenced our outlook a bit. So we're maybe a little more positive than we would have been a few weeks ago. So we have seen some better than expected retail activity. I can't really differentiate between the combines and the tractors in terms of retail activity in part because the combines have an early order program on them, as is our custom, and tractors don't.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Used-equipment prices in the United States are down. I am speaking on the Ag side, are down seven to 10% from the very high levels of a year ago. We continue to see very good levels of turns in both tractors and combines.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso. Please state your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>ISI. My question is about price versus cost. The spread you're forecasting for '10, using the midpoint is about 486 million, that more than offsets the post-retirement increase. But given the comment you just made on used-equipment pricing, I'm just trying to think through what percent of your raw material cost &#x2013; component cost for '10 do you already feel you have locked in, hedged, however you want to describe it, that makes you feel comfortable that raw materials will be down year-over-year? As well maybe what percent of your sales for '10 already in backlog with a pretty set selling price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the selling price, we &#x2013; after the events of 2008, I think you're aware that we changed the way we lock our customers in and that is we don't lock the price until we actually provide the shipping or we lock in on an availability date. And until that time there is a possibility of up to another 4% price increase, and obviously the customer would have the ability to make another decision at that point.</p>
          <p>Regarding our hedging, as you well know, there is no ability in the steel markets, for example, to go out, no practical ability to do hedging. We have used various contracting strategies with our steel vendors and actually with many vendors, some of which involved indexing. So you have the ability to take advantage of moves up and down, but we actually do use a variety of techniques and maybe I'll just conclude by saying that there is a lag effect on this, you certainly saw it very pronounced in 2008 and 2009 and it's &#x2013; for us it's, in round numbers about a six month lag up and down.</p>
          <p>The bulk of our production as you know, we really start to ramp up in the latter part of the first quarter, heavy production typically in a typical year in the second quarter and then as you move into the end of the third quarter, we're starting to ramp down a bit. You can assume they were probably contracting for materials in a few months ahead of that. So again that kind of gives that plus the index probably gets rise to the six month lag. Jim, is there anything else you wanted to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that covers it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what I'm trying to figure, I mean, in the channel, you hear about the 4% combine increase, three on the tractors, five plus on the new 8000, but we're already starting to hear about some discounting, on the sevens, some on the sixes and so forth. And I'm just trying to &#x2013; obviously the one to 2% price increase, if maybe you can split it between ag and construction that might be of some help. It looks like the initial ag increases are above that, but this is already some discounting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The initial ag increases, David, are &#x2013; on an average, the price increase is about 3%. And we have not told or not published anything to our dealers on the construction side, but we have told them in dealer meetings that they should look for things that are flattish and that really explains the price increase.</p>
          <p>The other thing is as you're quoting some of those price increases, remember that when we do our price calculation, we strip out any kind of feature upgrade and so &#x2013; and we reclass that into volume. So when you're hearing a list price quote on, say, the new 8R Tractors, which is in the four to 6% range, some of that is going to be reclassed into volume because it has &#x2013; it reflects higher horsepower, some new features in the cab and things like that.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, I have a clarification, two clarifications I want to make sure. On page &#x2013; on slides 34 and 35, you shows pension and OPEB contributions 358 in '09 and 400 million in 2010, that's different from the incremental 400 million that will hit the P&amp;L statement that you're talking about, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good question. One is the cash number, that's actual funding. The 400 million that when we talk about the income charge, that's an accrual expense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so is the incremental 400 million hitting the P&amp;L, but that's not the cash impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's just coincident that they are the same number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right, I just wanted to make sure I didn't misunderstand. And the other little clarification, you said margins effectively in fiscal '10 in both divisions are going to be similar to '09. Is that adjusted margins or as reported margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As reported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As reported. Now, didn't construction equipment lose money for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you forecasting that it's going to lose money for the year in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is exactly what that would imply.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, although &#x2013; and again, I applaud their performance given the extremely difficult market conditions they're in. They do benefit from some increase in production tonnage, but basically their 100 million higher pension and OPEB eats most of that. There is a little bit for R&amp;D as Susan talked about earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a question, two part, in your statement 2011, you gave 2011 prices for &#x2013; or preliminary prices for the ag market. The implication, if I draw it correctly that farm cash receipts in 2011 you'll be assuming will be relatively flat to down? And the second part of the question, with new management, congratulations everyone...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eli, you're going way over the number of questions, so let's stop with the cash receipts question. We do not yet have our forecast for 2011 cash receipts, I think we typically provide that, I can't remember if it's February or May when we forecast that. So I don't know because remember that as we look at cash receipts, it is a function of quantity and price. So &#x2013; and at this point, we're not prepared to &#x2013; I simply don't have the detail to provide you with any more comments on 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm hoping that just to start out, you can talk about the extent to which revenues by segment trailed dealer retail sales this year and what you're assuming there for the contribution from the catch-up in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at the &#x2013; I wouldn't have a better way to describe it than to tell you to look at the change in receivables and inventory, that's probably the best way to characterize it. Does that &#x2013; did I not understand what you're looking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was talking more from a revenue standpoint, how much your revenues trailed your dealer retail sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; our dealer retails would have been down I'm sure a little bit less than what our own revenues were because again we &#x2013; I'm not sure. Go ahead, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I want to say Meredith, probably the easiest way to look at that is look at the change in the receivables, that's the difference between what we've shipped and really what's going on in the retail marketplace for sort of a gross approximation of that difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then thanks for giving the color on the large ag versus the small ag. When you talked about the down 10%, I mean were you talking about production down 10%, or were you talking about revenues down 10%? And then as we net out price, etcetera, I mean, how should we think about what volumes are down in that business for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've &#x2013; that would have been a &#x2013; it's proxy, that down 10% is the sales, but it's a proxy because our inventories are again, on receivables our outlook is flat &#x2013; a proxy for what we're thinking that our sales will be, but it's kind of &#x2013; this time it's both the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, maybe if you can just kind of follow along those lines around the large ag, give us an update on how your order book is trending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then Meredith, we're also over on the number of questions. Actually, going forward, I am going to ask that all analysts do respect the one plus one because we have several people in queue and we need to make sure we get through them. In terms of the order book, the combine order activity, we're about 75% covered for model year 2010. As I've mentioned earlier, we've actually seen retail activity jump, so we've seen a pretty good increase in that over the last few weeks.</p>
          <p>In terms of the effective availability date for 8Rs, it would be April and it's the same for our 9000 series tractors. This is the last year for 8Rs or it would have been the 8030s then. The effective availability would have been July, but remember that, at this point last year, we still had the expectation that we were going to send a lot of products into Russia and we were not.</p>

          <p>I think that it would be fair to say that we are working very closely with the Russian government to make sure that we understand any rules that are being proposed. Our investment in Russia is limited. We're going into a leased facility and basically it's &#x2013; the lease and the tooling combined are about a 50 million investment. So we have quite a bit of flexibility. And I think at this &#x2013; I think I'm going to stop at that.</p>
          <p>If you are thinking about the risks in terms of the 2010 forecast from any impact in Russia, bear in mind that we said all along that we would start up production in the spring of 2010, and we are online for that. But we're going to do one model, get it right, go to a second model, so the bottom line is there is a not a lot of sales &#x2013; production and sales activity effectively that occur over the course of the year because we will be very much in a ramp up mode.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great color. I appreciate it. And my follow-up then is on Western Europe. How much confidence do you have in the down 10 to 15% just given the lack of visibility in that region right now and how bad things are currently in the ag equipment market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would agree with you that there is a lot of concern. There are a few glimmers of positive things happening with dairy. There &#x2013; the prices have stabilized to the point that we've seen a &#x2013; they are not slaughtering their herds and so we've seen some stabilization in profitability so that they're breakeven, maybe a little bit better.</p>
          <p>One of the factors at play is certainly lower levels of income. Again, we think that as people take a look at their income positions over the course of the year, benefiting from some of the lower input costs, you might see a little bit of improvement as you move through the year there.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we would tell you that, and we talked about this before, used equipment. There was very, very little used equipment in Western Europe really up until the liquidity crisis in the world that affected the ability for used equipment in Western Europe to move East and it went all the way into Russia. That has had a pretty pronounced effect, I think, over time on values. We have not &#x2013; we are not at a crisis stage by any means on used equipment in Western Europe. But that does &#x2013; we did very much temper our outlook for the market, and take that into consideration. I think Jim's got another point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In terms of how confident we are, I mean, that is our forecast and &#x2013; but I'd offer a couple of other points. That's on top of, of course, a pretty significant decrease this year that we saw in that Western European market.</p>
          <p>The second point is, I would tell you that our folks that are in the Western European theater have been pretty good in their feel for the market and we called the softness and basically were pretty accurate with our projections in '09 in this marketplace. So I think the team there is very close to the market and of course it always is a forecast, but we think it's a very reasonable forecast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I just guess my last follow-up question, just back to Eli's question on construction and forestry. I know we have to add back the 100 million or so in pension, but that's still &#x2013; given your sales increase, I thought you would do a little better than just slightly breakeven or so, so I'm just trying to &#x2013; R&amp;D, is there anything else sort of that I'm missing there? That still seems a little disappointing relative to what I thought even if I adjust for pension?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie, when we talk about being up 18%, you are off an incredibly low base. So you're not &#x2013; it's not like you're adding production at the sweet spot of the cycle, and I think that's what you need &#x2013; all need to bear in mind, you're off a very, very low base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just returning to the outlook, I'm trying to understand the quarterly progression in the tonnage, is that all related to very weak comparisons this year and then the 8000 series startup or are you expecting some of this November trend that you highlighted earlier to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it has, frankly more to do with the way tonnage played out last year and the backorder positions that we had than really what you can read into the market for this year. If you'll recall last year in the ag division, we were expecting a very good level of retail sales, and frankly in many parts of the world. And as events played out, we still had extremely good retail sales in the early part of the year in the U.S. and Canada. But &#x2013; and redirected production that have been intended for other markets into the U.S. and Canada.</p>
          <p>So I think that you need to bear that in mind, in construction they have been jamming on the brakes for a very long period of time and so &#x2013; and last year as a result of the liquidity crisis and the extreme difficulties in the U.S. housing market, they really took their pain early in the &#x2013; very early in the year, and they went into the year, excuse me, thinking that it was going to be a little better, and then took their &#x2013; then jammed on the brakes even harder. And so I think it really has to do more with the comparisons.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Could you detail the breakdown between res and non-res demand for construction equipment as you see it today? And what are you looking for as a sign post that equipment demand could finally begin to start to improve again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're at least six &#x2013; probably six to nine months away from a slight up tick in overall construction equipment demand in 2010. In fact, we have industry retail activity this year down about five to 10%. We still have rental companies de-fleeting, although we think that the pace is slowing in at least in our equipment sizes. But we have a &#x2013; as you know, a very cautious outlook on the non-res side.</p>
          <p>And although the government money is flowing, this would be the federal stimulus money and it is pretty much going as planned. You still have significant budget issues in states and local governments that is restraining the overall impact of that stimulus money. And so again, we have a fairly pragmatic view of the construction markets in the U.S. Did that help?</p>

          <p>You highlighted the real-dollar exchange rate as a risk to Lat Am sales. Could you give a little color on how you're thinking about that and what you're watching for to see if that could go the wrong way on you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't take a view on the future direction of the real, but we would note that it has been strengthening at a pretty good clip against the U.S. dollar. And we know that farmers in Brazil sell their crops in dollars, their expenses are real based, and so we're keeping a close eye on that. I can't say that there is a specific trigger point.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following-up on the production question, the ramp through the year. I mean at what point do you think that you'll be needing to add employees back and start re-staffing to meet that ramp up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not be able to answer that question. That would not be something we would be able to do in this forum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, maybe asked differently, I mean, how much can you maybe try and handicap what percentage of your cost savings over the past year you think are permanent versus temporary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, you bet. If that's &#x2013; for next year, we are looking at savings from the voluntary separation program, and again this is 2010 in the 50 to 60 million range, that's a pre-tax number. And then, in 2011 beyond about 75 million, that's &#x2013; that includes the 50 to 60 we'll get in 2010. We have savings from Welland in the 40 million range, we've got raw material &#x2013; that raw materials &#x2013; I'll just recite that because that's in 150 to 200 million range.</p>
          <p>In our Landscapes operation, they have closed 15% of their store locations. They've done a lot of store mergers with fertilizer and irrigation. So we're not really pulling out of markets, but we are realigning our organizational structure. I don't remember off the top of my head the number of employees, but we have restructured those operations, and we think that next year the savings from that would be in the 50 to possibly 75 million range.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And thanks. And just a quick follow-up. Can you talk about the credit situation in Brazil please, I know last quarter there were some timing issue with some of the payments coming back online, and can you just give us any color there on Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. You will &#x2013; if you look at the non-performing, you will still see that it is higher in ag and we cite &#x2013; this is in the appendix, that like 70, 75% of that is due to Brazil. We are working our way through the normal credit collection processes, have collected a little bit more cash and do have some customers that are stressed, but the most important thing is that we believe that our reserves are adequate. We are stress testing that portfolio every two months. We do a thorough customer analysis. So we feel that we are adequately provisioned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's BofA &#x2013; Merrill Lynch. Just a follow-up, and I apologize if I missed it. So for construction and forestry, we are explicitly guiding for margin that is very much in line with '09 in 2010? Is that &#x2013; am I correct in understanding...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is exactly what we are saying.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to follow-up on that question, so taking a top-down view, and revenue is going to be down 1% next year, and we've taken out a lot of costs over the past couple of years, and I understand the pension issue, but if you look at pricing, if you look at tax rate, if you look at the finance sub, that's offsets most of it. So how should I be thinking about a company about an industrial company that has revenue decline of 1% and profitability decline of 25%, what am I missing here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pension and OPEB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but I mean, a lot of it is, you have pricing, you've taken &#x2013; you've been cutting costs, you've done a fantastic job cutting costs in this downturn. I mean, should I just be thinking is that really pension and OPEB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pension and OPEB and I have to say that the mix in North American ag is not trivial. This is a big deal. Susan gave you a number of a point of margin for the full year. That's mix. There is also absorption issues as we take tonnage down in North America and that is also very significant. And that might be the missing link in understanding the outlook.</p>
