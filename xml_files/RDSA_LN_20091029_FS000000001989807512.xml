        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, good morning, wherever you may be. Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Third Quarter 2009 Results Presentation. Let me take you through the results and the portfolio developments for the third quarter and we will leave plenty of time for some questions.</p>
          <p>First, please take a moment to read the definitions and the cautionary note. Good. So just a quick summary, we're facing a very challenging environment in 2009. Against that I'm pleased with the operating performance in the quarter, but earnings are sharply lower in upstream and downstream compared with year ago levels.</p>
          <p>Earnings on a current cost of supply basis were $3 billion and cash flow from operations was $7.3 billion. The dividend has been increased by 5% versus year ago levels and we're taking a prudent approach to the downturn, although there is some evidence that the economic environment is actually bottoming out.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on our own costs and we're maintaining the financial flexibility to continue with our investment program through the down cycle. At the same time we're keeping an eye on the medium term launching selective new projects and continuing with relatively high levels of exploration. By taking these steps, we can bridge the company and our shareholders in a period of growth in 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>Let me update you on Transition 2009. We announced this reorganization program during the second quarter of this year. Transition 2009 is all about increasing accountabilities within the company, simplifying the organization and reducing costs.</p>
          <p>The simplified top level structure has been in place since the 1st of July and then you'll see the results today are presented on the new basis. A series of internal mergers is creating new efficiency gains and cost savings through the Group and we're moving quickly. We achieved a 20% reduction in senior management positions by the end of July.</p>
          <p>A broader reorganization is now underway and we expect a 10% head count reduction in the redesigned divisions and functions and that's mostly in management and non-operational positions. Today and at the moment, Shell staff are reapplying for some 15,000 roles within the divisions that we've restructured. Around 5,000 staff will leave the company as a result of this restructuring and the reorganization as a whole will be complete by the end of 2009. We do expect to take a restructuring charge to reflect this, with the fourth quarter results.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the portfolio, we're making good progress with the portfolio. Upstream we have around a million barrels a day under construction, and substantial additional options under design. Downstream we have an asset sales program with non-core &#x2013; from the non-core portfolio together with selected growth projects.</p>
          <p>So let me give you some highlights of the third quarter. On the upstream, two of the new projects Sakhalin II and Ormen Lange, in Russia and Norway respectively, reached their production plateaus. Production performance in the ramp up stage of both projects has been better than we had expected. We also made good progress with the next generation of upstream production. We took FID on 15 million tonnes per year Gorgon LNG project in Australia and entered into front-end engineering design for what we hope will become the world's first Floating LNG development.</p>
          <p>Looking further into the future, we had exploration success in the quarter with the Vito oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico and the Achilles-1 gas discovery in Australia. In the downstream, we agreed to sell our activities in Greece and we used GTL gas to liquid jet fuel for the first time on a commercial passenger flight, a flight from London to Qatar.</p>
          <p>Sakhalin II has made very good progress this year. The September average production was some 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and ahead of schedule. We reached daily production of more than 400,000 barrels a day oil equivalent per day in October, which is the planned peak production. Both of the LNG trains are online and LNG is being delivered to Japan, Korea and other customers. This is been a very well executed start up in a difficult operating environment.</p>
          <p>Now let me update you on the third quarter results and I'll start with the macro picture. If you look at the picture compared with the first quarter of 2008, all prices are significantly below the 100 plus levels we saw a year ago. Natural gas and LNG prices are also down from a year ago levels. Refining margins remained under pressure for the quarter and were significantly lower than year ago levels. The chemicals environment remains challenging with lower margins than a year ago in Europe and the U.S., although we have seen an uptick in demand in China. Given this background in Q3, I'm pleased with our operating performance.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings, and to highlight to you there is a detailed set of information on the quarter available in spreadsheet format on our website and I hope you find that new disclosure is useful. Earnings for the quarter included identified items of $371 million, a net credit, but that included an asset impairment of $1.1 billion offset by other gains.</p>
          <p>Excluding identified items, CCS earnings were $2.6 billion and earnings per share decreased by about 67% compared with the third quarter in 2008. The quarter was characterized by lower earnings in both upstream and downstream, but that's mainly as a result of lower oil and gas prices and lower industry margins. The cash flow from operations for the quarter was $7.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let me talk about the business performance in a little bit more detail. First, upstream. Upstream earnings decreased by 73% to $1.7 billion in Q3 '09. The fall in oil and gas prices was the main factor behind this decline in earnings. Much of the Shell natural gas and LNG portfolio has price realizations that are lagged to spot oil prices, typically on a four to six month time lag and longer than that on some of the LNG contracts.</p>
          <p>What this actually means is that although oil prices did increase from the second quarter levels, Shell's LNG earnings didn't increase by the same extent due to the contractual lag effect. In addition, the environment, gas and LNG trading activity was poor and has deteriorated versus both the second quarter and the year ago levels. These factors have all combined to soften the upstream results.</p>
          <p>The upstream production was similar to year ago levels at around 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, but within that the new fields and ramp-ups more than offset the natural field declines, adding 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to our production. Our LNG sales volumes increased by 13% Q3 to Q3, with increases from Sakhalin in Russia and the North West Shelf in Australia more than offsetting the security related gas supply shortfalls in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>So the upstream operational performance has been good, but against a background of weak pricing and trading environment.</p>
          <p>Moving to downstream. Downstream earnings declined by 62% versus a year ago level to $0.8 billion on a clean basis. This decline was due to losses in refining, partially offset by earnings from marketing. Chemicals earnings have improved, mainly by Asia. Shell's Q3 to Q3 refinery intake fell by some 8% as a result of weak demand and economic run cuts. The marketing earnings did decrease versus the year ago levels. However, marketing earnings actually increased from second quarter 2009 levels, with higher earnings from retail, from aviation and commercial fuels and slightly weaker trading result. Shell's marketing portfolio has proved very resilient in the face of a really tough economic environment.</p>
          <p>So those are the results. Turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet, where we look at the cash position over the last 12 months, the rolling 12 months, upstream and downstream segments cash inflows have been broadly balanced against the outflows.</p>
          <p>Cash flow positions improved from the second quarter 2009 levels, but it's something we watch very closely. We're using the balance sheet to finance some of our medium term growth projects across the bottom of the macro cycle. As a result, the balance sheet gearing was 13.7% at the end of the third quarter. Gearing has increased across this year, but it still remains below the 20 to 30% guidance range.</p>
          <p>Before we go for your questions, let me make some comments about the costs. We reduced Shell's operating costs by some $1 billion before tax in the first nine months of 2009. This figure is a good snapshot of what we've already achieved. It excludes exchange rate movements, which have reduced headline costs by a further $2.5 billion and it also excludes other non-cash accounting effects.</p>
          <p>This improvement comes from a number of areas. The Transition 2009 program, simplifying and standardizing our activities to reduce supply chain costs, a holdback on discretionary spending and lower utilization rate and energy costs. So good progress here and of course there is more to come.</p>
          <p>Now let me summarize and then we'll go for your questions. I am pleased with the operating performance in the quarter despite the difficult environment. We're taking a prudent approach to the downturn and our cost programs are on track, $1 billion of cost reduction year to date and staff reduction of some 5,000 expected to conclude by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We have the financial flexibility to continue with our investment program and at the same time, we're keeping an eye on the medium term, launching selected new projects and continuing with exploration. And by taking these steps, we're bridging the company and the shareholders into that period of growth that we expect in 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll move to take your questions. Please could we just try and restrict ourselves to one or two each so that everyone has the opportunity to ask a question? Thank you for helping out with that. Operator, I'll conclude now. Please could you poll for questions?</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Mark Bloomfield from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. A few questions on the asset impairments, please. First, I just wondered if you could clarify how much of the $1.2 billion was in E&amp;P. Second, of that of E&amp;P impairment, I just wondered if you could state whether any assets were individually a material part that total, and if so what those assets were. And then thirdly, I just wondered if you could run through the main reasons for those write-offs. Is it exploration? Is it a change of view on timing of projects awaiting development or is it perhaps any change in commodity price assumptions on producing assets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. Good start. The $1.1 billion is the total impact on the identified items of which $800 million was in the upstream. And it was all of what we might want to call EP. The largest single item was some Canadian heavy oil in two properties, but that was less than $300 million. So there's a variety of the assets in here. About a quarter of the total was downstream, which again are multiple assets.</p>
          <p>The prime reason for the impairments is every third quarter we do a comparison of future cash flow expected from an asset against the carrying value and if one falls below the other, we do an impairment test under normal IFRS rules. So there are variety of reasons affecting this from a lower expectation for future cash flows to maybe a later development in the case of, for example, the Canadian heavy oil is taking a later, a view on later development than we otherwise might have expected. So that's what's driven it really. There's no major single item in there.</p>

          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Jon Rigby from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A couple of questions. The first is the on the pensions and the cash out, the charge that you're making. If we just assume all equal as we stand right now, it actually marks where they are, how much you paid into the pension fund et cetera, can you just comment on how much you expect more to pay from pension fund if anything? And also how this would then feed out through your P&amp;L into 2010? Would you be taking any further charges, et cetera?</p>
          <p>The second is just on the likely benefits of the job reductions that you're talking about. Obviously, you probably at this stage can't comment on the value. But from your judgment, what would you say are the associated costs that come with each person? So what could we think about as a sort of multiplier of the payroll effect that you save by losing jobs on your staff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. And I'll figure out, work my way through the pension situation overall. Differentiating between the cash and the P&amp;L issues, they don't run in the same phasing. Earlier this year, we said we expected to book six to $8 billion into the pension funds in cash terms to address some of the deficit we were carrying forward. Of that, the annual amount contributed under normal circumstances is somewhere between one and $2 billion and that normal circumstances contribution will be around $1.5 billion or slightly over.</p>
          <p>So we have in, mainly in the third quarter, injected additional funds such that the total contribution for the pension funds, we now expect $5 billion this year, of which $4.2 billion has already been paid out by the end of Q3. So, another 0.8 to come, which is basically the phasing of some &#x2013; of the normal payment. That is slightly less than the six to eight guidance we gave -- has been helped by equity market recovery. Our Dutch fund with its regulator requirement is now back in surplus. We don't expect equity markets staying where they are, a further additional supplementary contribution this year. The P&amp;L charge is also typically between one and $2 billion, given where the deficit was at the year end. And that is again around a $1.5 billion level this year. It was actually a credit last year, so the year-on-year difference is quite material. Under the staff costs, benefits from the jobs we take out, well the 5,000 jobs reduction so far in Q3, by the end of Q3, it was only a few hundred that have actually left payroll. But the 5,000 should feed through from Q1.</p>
          <p>At least in part from respect for staff, I think it's best that we update on the costs when they are actually done. And of the $1 billion that we've already saved, very little comes from the 5,000. Maybe a bit from some of the reorganization and the supply costs that we did, but the $1 billion, everything that comes from the 5,000 should be incremental going forward to the $1 billion we've already delivered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would I be right in assuming that along with the payroll costs associated with those people, a quite significant sort of secondary costs of pensions, relocation, office space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Real estate, IT, yes, you would be right in making that assumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Alejandro Demichelis from Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two questions if I may. The first one is coming back to the impairment. My understanding is you have some tax credits offsetting this. Should we assume that you should be paying a lower tax going forward? That's the first question. And the second question about the cost savings that you've seen so far. How much are we factoring in in this one billion here for foreign exchange gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alejandro. The tax credits were all essentially one-offs; they're related to settlements of outstanding issues or a recalculation effectively of interpretations being available on deferred tax balances. So that will have not any impact going forward. Normally, we're sort of 45 to 47% tax rate; it's lower this quarter because of those one-off items, but they are really generally one-off. In the costs, the $1 billion excludes any impact from foreign exchange movement. Our actual costs in year-to-date were $2.5 billion lower, just as a result of foreign exchange movement. So, been a very significant movement, but that would be imprudent to comment about including them as the exchange rate just going exactly the opposite direction and of course the costs will also go back up again because of that. So it's a cyclical effect on the FX. The $1 billion is clean of FX.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And your next question comes from Theepan Jothilingam from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon. Good afternoon. I've got two questions, actually. Firstly, on E&amp;P and your exposure on to European gas. I thought demand and price have negatively impacted the profitability of that business. I was just wondering what you see going into Q4 and then into 2010, if you could give us some visibility there?</p>
          <p>The second question is on DD&amp;A. Again, sort of stripping out for impairments, there's not a huge increase in DD&amp;A. I was wondering if you could give again a little bit of visibility on where you see group DD&amp;A moving both into Q4 and then into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Theepan, thanks and thank you for the question. The European gas market has indeed been a significant factor for us and we're seeing reduced demand throughout all sectors really, but particularly industrial commercial demand in the industrial heartland. That has had a knock on impact on prices at the margin. However, more than half of our European gas is sold, linked to oil prices, usually a combination of distillate and fuel. And by definition, of course, that lags the oil price roughly by three to six months, sometimes longer. And therefore, our EU realized gas price headed downwards in the third quarter relative to the second quarter.</p>
          <p>One thing you don't see and what we actually report is the Netherlands gas prices, which is a significant part of our gas production, but is not a consolidated company, and therefore, doesn't hit the average that we report. So overall, sequentially, European gas prices were moving down in Q3 because of the lag. That does mean that going forward into Q4 2010, there should be some reversal there as the gas price reflects the improvement in oil price that we saw from March, April onwards. At the moment, the gas prices are really reflecting that March, April trough.</p>
          <p>As we go into 2010, obviously two things matter. One is the weather, seriously, and secondly is the pace of recovery, if there is one, in the commercial and industrial sector. So the weather is by far the most significant factor in the short-term. Hopefully, that covers the question.</p>
          <p>DD&amp;A, not a large increase excluding impairment. That is correct. We've got two factors at work here. Obviously, we get depreciation on new project coming on stream, which tends to increase. But over time, we are booking more reserves against already producing assets, which tends to reduce the unit cost over time, or the unit DD&amp;A on those assets over time. The more conservative your booking approach, the more you see that effect. And this year those effects are roughly offsetting each other as we go forward. We will bring more new production on the stream, so you can expect the DD&amp;A to rise over time. I hope that covers it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's perfect. Can I just come back on European gas, are you seeing, sort of, from an underlying perspective, any improvement in sort of industrial or commercial demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As of today, to be honest, no we're not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll move onto the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Iain Reid from Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon. Just one question please, on Nigeria. There's been a fair amount of news on that recently, with a reduction in insurgency, and also the renegotiation of various contracts you have there. Could you just bring us up to date on exactly what's going on in those areas as far as it affects you and how you see any potential production recovery on the basis of reduced insurgency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Iain, many thanks. Good question and there are many moving parts in Nigeria. So I'll try and give due justice to a couple of them. First of all, the reduction in the insurgency or as a result of the amnesty process that the government initiated, yes there's been some good progress. It's good to see. There are, however, still security issues. We have challenges from theft as well as just security, as our production is about 120,000 barrels a day down this year relative to last year in the quarter. So quite significant. And it really is too early to say how sustainable the more positive climate will be. We, as Shell, are working, actually with both parties, both the government and the parties in the delta to help try and ensure we can create positive economic activity and opportunities, such that we will result in a more stable situation overall. But the situation has been volatile. Likely to be a while before we can give you a more definitive answer. But it is actually a more positive place than we were three months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the renegotiation of various licenses there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the license, yes there's has been a lot of press comments. Not all of it consistent with each other. I know you're aware of issues between Nigeria and China. We wouldn't comment on any particular assets. The speculation that you've seen suggests that the Nigerian government would sell their share and it's another one of those issues where we're actually waiting for the government and any kind of parties we're really talking to come to talk to us about what the actual impact might be on our own situation. The one thing you probably will have seen and can be sure of is that both ourselves and the industry will defend our interest. Of course the overarching issue of the petroleum industry bill is also in the background and we are in discussions with the government, you'll have seen that Peter Voser met with the president last week. And we do see relatively positive developments recently relative again to three months ago in the level of discussion, the type of discussion that is going on, not just with the industry but with multilateral agencies and multiple stakeholders within the country itself.  Hopefully that's okay, we'll move to....</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Simon. Two questions, please. Can you briefly comment on the results of oil sands, which is now sort of hiding in the upstream? And secondly, looking at the $1 billion cost reduction, how much of that is due to the environment. In other words, lower energy costs, cost deflations versus internal? In other words, how much would be sustainable if oil and gas prices moved back up again? And related to that, since Transition 2009 only started in July, could we anticipate an acceleration next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Irene. The oil sands cost is back in profit &#x2013; but that does benefit from the oil price going back up. But it still remains relatively immaterial. We've given the production. What we are and you'll see that maintaining at a reasonably stable level now. What we are seeing is over time, we are squeezing costs out of the operations out there. So, we're pleased with the performance as it stands.</p>
          <p>The billion dollars, how much is due to the environment? Well, not much in terms of energy and fuel. Most of this is sustainable and most of it in the downstream, actually, for the year to date. Some of it reflects lower supply chain costs as well which are sustainable as long as you can negotiate the third party contract. So we see almost all of the billion dollars being sustainable into the future.</p>
          <p>Transition 2009 isn't really kicking in much at all yet because people haven't left the system. We do expect, of course, probably a significant severance role or redundancy provision in the fourth quarter, but any benefits that we see will be fully additive to the billion dollars.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Simon. Two questions please. The first is the cash flow clearly was a lot more resilient in the quarter than the earnings. Was there any things you particularly draw to our attention in respect of that? And the other thing is actually in the statement I think Mr. Voser referred to taking shareholders into a period of significant growth in coming years. Is that a reference to the growth period that you referenced in your opening address of 2011//12 or is this something beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lucy. The cash flow, the $7.4 billion is more a reversion to the mean, it was the second quarter that was odd and largely because of the pension fund contribution and the increase in the working cap. There are no special items really in that cash flow. As we go forward, Q4 has some one-off tax payments that are normal for phasing for the Q4 and may not be entirely 7.3, but this was pretty much where we expected to be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Inventory movements were quite significant. So I wouldn't actually, draw more attention to this year than last year and this just as what we would normally expect of cash flow generation. On the growth comment by Peter, it's really reference to the same period of growth, the million barrels a day of production that we are constructing that's currently on the balance sheet in effect and is progressively coming on stream. Of course 150,000 barrels already on from BP <mark type="inaudible" /> factory, that goal is  added to the queue as well, so we're still roughly around a million barrels. And that comes in around 2011, 2012.</p>

          <p>Arithmetically it would be good to be able to say that, but I also got a few variables such as Nigeria that I wouldn't want to commit myself on until I've got more certainty. So, yes, we're actually very pleased with what Sakhalin has achieved and let's hope that we carry that forward into next year. We will be holding a strategy update in March next year, and that will be a good time to take stock on some of these questions, the different parts of the portfolio and how they will evolve.</p>

          <p>I wanted to see if you could give us some more color on the integrated gas segment, just noting profits down about 22% sequentially while LNG volumes were up 20%. In particular, wondering if you could split out three primary components, at least just qualitatively; one being any timing effect on dividend receipts, recognizing income from liquefaction ventures; secondly, the rate of change in trading, which it sounds like was down sequentially, perhaps considerably so. And then finally, any negative effect from the absence of cargo diversion capabilities in the third quarter relative to the second quarter.</p>

Any just general thoughts you may have on whether or not the increase in volume you've exhibited already and are expected to see going forward, particularly the Soku coming back online.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon, just a few questions. First of all, just looking at your refinery asset sales, is it fair to presume that the refineries you've got on the block are not making any money at the minute? And you've alerted at 15% of your capacity. Is that a minimum number or should we be thinking about that actually increasing if you continue to see weak refining conditions? And I've got a second question too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it possible to take the same question if, so I don't get pulled into multiples, Neil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Second question is on your exploration success so far this year. Could your run through what your hit rate is and what has been the key successes so far this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Will do. Thank you. Refining assets has 15% of production or capacity, as it was; Europe, New Zealand and Canada, and within Europe, it's the U.K. and Germany. I wouldn't like to say it is the current profitability, but the European margin is certainly not that profitable at the moment. There are active buyers out there and we are looking to negotiate an exit there. I can't put hand on heart and say we will be able to do so, because we're not going to give the refineries away. The refining, as a whole, did make a loss in the quarter, although it has improved, the loss is less than the one made in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As we go forward, you said, you said could we see 15% as a minimum? The overall aim has always been to focus our refinery portfolio and our larger assets and the more complex assets. So I can't rule out further reductions in the footprint, but at the moment the only ones we're pursuing are the ones that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>In terms of exploration, at the half year, we advised 700 million barrel oil equivalent added in the first six months and since then we can add two further discoveries in detail on Achilles. The primary discoveries were at Australia and the Concerto discovery, which gave us the volumes that we'll make the Prelude floating LNG project potentially economic. In the Gulf of Mexico, we had the West Boreas discovery which will do the same for the Mars B new TLP  opportunity it is additional volumes that we can hopefully monetize relatively quickly. The Cardamom Deep discovery is adjacent to the Auger platform, so we should be able to bring that on fairly quickly. Vito, of course, is the poly gee ann play in the Gulf of Mexico. So we look forward to seeing how that one develops. Achilles was adjacent to the Gorgon fields, and was quite helpful in thinking about well, is three trains enough in Gorgon? As Chevron had announced earlier, so it's additional volumes there. And of course the final one I draw attention to is Gro in Norway, which was quite a large structure but we've only got one well in it, and it is a long way from land. So we'll need to do a bit of appraisal work on several of the above. But particularly Concerto in Australia and West Boreas and Cardamom in the Gulf of Mexico have quite early development capability.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on floating production, Simon, any idea of what the sort of gas prices or LNG prices should say, you would require to make that feasible?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would depend on the cost, of course. And we're going through the feed  now. So it will come, we expect that feed by early 2011 to give us an answer to that question but the answer would need to be competitive with projects such as Gorgon. We wouldn't look at them differently, necessarily, so it would need to be attractive relative to other opportunities.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Simon. Just wanted to come back to your cost savings of a billion. Have you got a view on what you may or may not be able to achieve going into 2010 particularly in light of the progress that one of your competitors has been making on the cost savings front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one billion that we have saved we believe will be pretty sustainable, it's mostly in the downstream anyway, we haven't yet identified the exact amount that we'll be expecting people to build into their operating plans for next year, but we have said publicly several billion dollars of opportunity relative to the 2008 baseline, which is a total cost of 42, $42 billion, that is. We would stick to the several billion dollars of opportunity and that's what we regard as a sustainable basis. It is likely that the transition 2009 cost reductions will come through -- from relatively early in 2010, so the step change there. But there are several ongoing continuous improvement programs, such as that in the downstream and in some of our corporate functions that will continue to contribute over a period of time.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions, if I may? Firstly on Sakhalin II, can you say anything at all about its earnings or cash flow contribution in the quarter, even generically? And second, in terms of your previous guidance about gearing being in the low 20s for the end of this year, given that gearing only moved just over a percent in the quarter, is that previous guidance now out of date and if so, could you update us on that and say what's changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, thank you. Sakhalin II is building up average of 335 in September. It was actually 64,000 barrels a day overall higher production than it was a year ago. Of course we were producing oil, it's in profit and growing.</p>
          <p>What we don't see yet necessarily, because it's an equity associate, that cash flow will come from either dividends or equity redemptions. And the amount there remains relatively low, because obviously, the company is using its own cash flow to continue the drilling program. So it's income positive or earnings accretive, not yet making much contribution to the cash flow.</p>
          <p>On gearing, 13.7% at the end of the quarter, a good quarter for cash flow. We do expect the gearing to continue to increase in the fourth quarter absent any other major changes in the macro, partly because of some of those one-off tax payments I referred to, but also dividends and the CapEx. We still expect to spend the 31, $32 billion this year in investment, and when that comes through in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So we are on the right side of the gearing advice or the guidance we've given. I might expect it to come in a bit below where we originally expected, at least in part because I think I mentioned earlier the pensions we've injected less cash into the pension fund than we expected, which is worth a couple of points on the gearing, and overall we've been squeezing cash out in one our two prices as well. So maybe we'll see where it ends in the fourth quarter. But it is likely to be on the lower side of the previous guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, good afternoon, I had two questions. First, on the upstream earnings, at least based on our preliminary thinking, and taking into consideration your comment a moment ago regarding trading, it very much looks to me as if costs went way up in this quarter, as opposed to falling, unless there are some other tax related effects that are buried in there. And I was hoping you might be able to comment on that?</p>
          <p>My second question relates to the comment in the release regarding the fact that underlying production increased despite being flat on a reported basis. Now it's clear that entitlement volumes under production sharing contracts in a lower price environment were probably up.</p>
          <p>So I was hoping that perhaps you might clarify what you mean by underlying, whether it includes/excludes OPEC quotas and be able to reconcile those two statements. Thanks, Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. Good to hear from you. The U.S., the upstream earnings, did costs go up? Well, fortunately, I mentioned earlier, in the supplementary data hopefully you will be able to know exactly what the upstream cost is. And no, they didn't go up, they're about flat. So the upstream earnings were basically hit by the fact that our earnings sensitivity is about $80 million per quarter per dollar of movement on the oil price, $90 million per dollar movement in the Henry Hub gas price per quarter and that explains basically most of the earnings movement. There aren't that many other factors.</p>
          <p>The underlying production, the PSVs (platform supply vessels), yes, they gave us about 1% of production, but offsetting that was about the same amount on OPEC acquisitions and divestment basically offset. So that left the weather, so we didn't have hurricanes this year, which gave us an additional 90; Nigeria, where we lost 120; new field ramp-ups just under 180; and decline around 140. So the underlying production, if you work that back, effectively, the ramp-ups against decline is an increase. But overall, headline is flat. That's really what makes the difference in the financials. So that's what we said. Hopefully that...</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, good afternoon. I have a fairly similar comment to Mark's because I think certainly if you look at the production movement sequentially, you've delivered a pretty low result compared to peers in the upstream. And I wonder if you could just go back to that additional segment information and just talk to the various line items there on a sequential basis perhaps and just identify anything might be going down, coming up or staying the same going forwards from here? Because there are some quite big movements there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have a maintenance season in Europe, and gas demand has been well down in Europe, so that's taken us sequentially down quite materially, Q3 against Q2. We've got some growth in Asia-Pacific as a result of the North West Shelf gas volume. Nigeria, of course, is down year-over-year but flat sequentially. Elsewhere, although we did come back up a bit offshore in Nigeria, which was a help. Elsewhere, Russia is the main contributor going up. In the USA, sequentially we were down. Again, there's a maintenance effect in there. Those are primarily the main factors that we see. I don't know if that helps, but I'll just check, Colin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For example, if you're looking at 3545 million, for example, for production and manufacturing expenses in the third quarter against 3266 for the second quarter, is the 3.5 the number we should be thinking about going forwards or has that come back down to something lower? And it's really the same kind of comment for the others. I guess the much lower profit from equity account investments you kind of touched on, I guess, in the LNG comments and the comments about gas pricing for half Pernis?</p>

          <p>Yes, and of course Woodside in there as well. So equity associates is almost all price effect, and anything I have said about cost does not relate to costs within the equity associates themselves. Or tax for that matter. So the sequential performance is largely a result of the volumes that you see. The costs you refer to, both upstream and downstream, are probably running at around trend levels but will go most likely back up again in Q4, at least as reported, because the dollar has weakened materially as we have gone through the year. We also expect to see severance provisions. Because the underlying costs we expect to move in the opposite direction sustainably. One of the hopefully, the advantages of the greater granularity we've given will be to give you and maybe even us better insight into the key drivers of the business performance. Okay? Take the next question.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you got a potential range for the restructuring charge that might be taken in Q4? And secondly, I see there's a couple of headlines on Peter Voser's comments this morning that a dividend freeze is certainly possible in 2010. Would you say it's possible or likely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jason. The potential range for restructuring charge, it could be quite significant. It will be hundreds of millions. I don't think it will top a billion. But to be honest, we don't know until we have gone through the full process we know the names and the countries involved.</p>
          <p>Dividend freeze, I think at the current macro and the current expectations for investment, there is a reasonable probability that we will freeze the dividend as we go forward, but of course it is a decision reserved for the board and not one that's been taken yet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Simon. Just coming back to the question of upstream equity affiliates, and I guess you've hinted at a lot of this Nam and Woodside. What's the main profit driver of Nam  in particular as you head into the fourth quarter? Is it contract pricing or spot pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of it is contract pricing. The main driver is production. The driver there obvious is the weather. So more than half for Nam itself, well over half is long-term contract pricing. So it's oil and gas price linked to I think on average four or five months ago.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon. Quick question on gas prices or a request on the gas prices, given that most of us don't model associates separately or at least I don't, would it be possible to consider perhaps giving us an estimate of group European gas prices and group Asian gas prices in the next set of quarterly results, because as you have already highlighted the lack of having Nam realizations in there makes those numbers perhaps a little less helpful than they could be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good suggestion. One we might consider, but I will point out it's actually not easy to get prices from all our partner companies, something like Nam is rather more transparent than some of the other companies. Point taken and it is in our best interest to help you understand this gas pricing because clearly, as we go forward, we are seeing an increasing proportion of gas in our production mix. Thank you for the suggestion. All I can say is that Nam was in fact lower in Q2 and should improve again &#x2013; lower than Q2 and it should improve again in Q4.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. I think we've exhausted questions now. Thank you for joining us today and your time and thank you for the questions. The fourth quarter results will be released on the 4th of February, 2010 that is. And we are planning a strategy update for March 16, 2010, which hopefully will be an opportunity to talk a little bit more in detail and in depth about some of the themes underpinning your questions today. So I look forward to speaking to you all then, if not before. Thank you very much and have a good day.</p>
