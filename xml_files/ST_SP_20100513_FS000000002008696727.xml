        <plist>
          <p>A warm welcome to all investors and analysts. You are listening to SingTel's earnings con call for the quarter and full year ended March 2010. My name is Yang Fong and let me introduce panel members on the call &#x2013; Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO Singapore; Mr. Lim Chuan Poh, CEO International; Ms. Jeann Low is Group CFO; and Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO, Optus who joins us from Sydney. They may also be assisted by other members of the management team. And before we start taking questions, I'd like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And good morning, everyone. This morning we announced our results for the quarter and full year ended 31st March, 2010. So it was a very strong quarter again. The group net profits were up 12% and underlying net profits up 7%, and that's driven by very strong performance across the group. Revenue is up 25%, lifted by the very strong Australian dollar that appreciated by about 26% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, revenues were up 13% on very strong growth in IT &amp; Engineering as well as Mobile. EBITDA was, however, stable at about $579 million. That is due to an increased mix of IT &amp; Engineering revenue, also cost to support higher Mobile customer connections and mio TV content costs.</p>
          <p>In Australia, Optus revenues were up 6%, reflecting very strong results in Mobile. EBITDA up 5% in line with revenue growth. The group and its associates continue to register very strong customer growth. We now have 293 million mobile customers. Earnings from the Regional Mobile Associates for the quarter increased 12% due to increased contribution from Telkomsel, as well as fair value gains on associates' foreign currency liabilities. That's partially offset by lower contribution from Bharti.</p>
          <p>Next, on the issue of dividends, the Board is recommending a final ordinary dividend of $0.08 per share, together with the interim dividend of $0.062 that had been paid in January. Total ordinary dividend amounts to $0.142 per share, which is up 14% from last year. This represents a payout ratio of 58%, which is of course at the higher end of our dividend payout range of 45 to 60%. And based on current share prices, this translates to a yield of approximately 5%.</p>
          <p>But we are balancing a desire for an efficient balance sheet with a desire also to have financial flexibility to make further investments. So if you look at the group's overall earnings contribution, overseas operations &#x2013; that is Australia and the Regional Mobile Associates &#x2013; contribute to about 75% of proportionate EBITDA.</p>
          <p>So maybe with that, I'll hand the call back to Yang Fong.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Sock Koong. I would like to remind participants that this call will last for about an hour.

Our operator will now assist you to put through your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ma'am. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Okay, first on line we have Mr. Sachin Gupta from Nomura Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I've got a few questions, firstly for Sock Koong or Jeann. Just want to get your thoughts on capital management. It's been three years now. Your cash flows are quite good. So just wondering what's the thinking on capital management.</p>
          <p>And I guess the related question is just your thoughts on the Indian market given the TRAI's recommendations yesterday. If these spectrum changes do go through, how would you view your investment in Bharti? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, for Paul, your Mobile trends are obviously very strong. Just want to get your thoughts on the DSL net adds. It looked &#x2013; I think it's about 1,000 or so. Is it a function of Telstra coming back or the impact through the TPGs or iiNet? Just any thoughts there would be good.</p>
          <p>And lastly, just for Allen. Allen, this 81 million contribution from OpenNet, just wondering what are the costs associated with that? Is that a negative margin business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to get Jeann to talk about capital management and then Chuan Poh can talk about all the spectrum issues in India. The third question I think is about Optus. I'm going to hand it back over to Paul and then Allen can talk about the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Sachin, on the capital management, we have &#x2013; as Sock Koong mentioned, we are proposing a final dividend of $0.08. That actually, together with the interim dividend, reflects a 14% increase in dividends year-on-year. So clearly, while we guided to a 45 to 60% payout ratio, we are at the toppish end of the range. And we have, if you look at the payout, last year we paid out about 58% and this year we're keeping to the 58% mark.</p>
          <p>I think we have always stated and we continue to state that we have a desire for an efficient balance sheet, clearly, also with some financial flexibility to make further investments. And that continues to be the position.</p>
          <p>I think if you &#x2013; a lot &#x2013; the significant associates are all making dividend payments, except for Bharti. And if you were to adjust for the Bharti profit contribution to the group, the effective payout ratio, excluding Bharti profit contribution, is closer to 74%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin. This is Chuan Poh. On the TRAI recommendation, I think it is too premature to really discuss about what is the possible outcome. As you know, the recommendation will still be subject to a lot of legislative discussion. And we hope that DoT and the Government of India will take this seriously. I think Bharti today issued a statement to comment on the TRAI recommendation. I think it's sufficient details in that for us to look at without further comments on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's Paul here. We'll pick up, Sachin, on your question on DSL. I'm actually going to pass to Mike Smith, who runs our consumer division, to talk about some of the trends in the broadband market and some of our plans in terms of response.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin. Yeah, it picked up in the last quarter, a quarter that was pretty competitive in the Australian marketplace in broadband. ULL growth continues against the exchanges we've built. And the HFC area was particularly competitive. In the last few weeks, we've launched a set of quite aggressive new rate plans in that market to bring ourselves back into a more positive, aggressive, growing market share base in fixed broadband. And as I think we've alluded to in this forum previously, we're now a few months away &#x2013; middle of the year, we'll deploy our DOCSIS 3 capability on our cable network as well, taking that through 100 megabits of speed which will again bring that network back to a premium in the areas that we have it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sachin, in regard to the question on fiber rollouts and OpenNet, the costs that are associated with 81 million are obviously the costs of the fiber and then the construction costs and contractor costs related to laying that fiber. We do make margins from this contract that we have with OpenNet. The margins are more in line with our IT&amp;E business type of margin. The cost of this is inside our cost of sales line in the MD&amp;A, but of course that has other items as well. We don't identify this separately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, sir. The next on line is Mr. Sachin Mittal, DBS Vickers Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Congratulations on an impressive set of results. I have actually four questions. First is for Singapore, on a sequential basis, we can see higher selling and administrative expenses. You mentioned that this is because of probably higher content costs. Could you throw us light what kind of contents costs are actually already factored in this set of results, which have resulted in actually 20 million higher expenses this quarter?</p>
          <p>The second question is again on Singapore. On your 81 million fiber rollout revenue, what kind of numbers should we expecting on a quarterly basis going forward? Is it a similar number as this one?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on Australia. You have guided for a CapEx of 1.2 billion, which is higher than the last year 1 billion. Could you share with us where are the key differences compared to the last year in terms of higher CapEx?</p>
          <p>And the last one is actually &#x2013; it's kind of a comment I'm looking forward to. Given that iPhone subsidies are looking like much higher in Singapore compared to Australia, could you share us where are the difference in the dynamics between Singapore and Australia, given that all the players are offering the phone now? These are the four questions I have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, sorry. We're a bit distracted. Could you just repeat your question three and four a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three and four?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question number three is for Optus that you have guided for a CapEx of 1.2 billion, which is higher than last year's 1 billion. So could you just share with us where are the key differences compared to the last year that the CapEx is higher this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the fourth one is on your iPhone subsidies, looking like they're much higher in Singapore compared to Australia. So could you just comment on the difference in the dynamics between Singapore and Australia? Why is Singapore so competitive in terms of iPhones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first question on the SG&amp;A that has increased, is it because of content and what sort of content? I think our SG&amp;A has increased by mainly &#x2013; not just because of content, it's also because of higher mobile subscriber acquisition and retention costs. And actually that is the bulk of it because we had quite a large number of connect and re-contracts for the quarter. There is a mio TV cost increase compared to the same quarter last year, but that is smaller and it's mainly due to the UEFA Cup and Champions League content that we have secured exclusively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to kind of clarify, I thought sequentially 4Q is having lower S&amp;A costs than 3Q because all the phone-related subsidies are there in 3Q, so &#x2013; and subscriber acquisition cost is also lower in 4Q compared to 3Q. So it does not look like it is because of smart phones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat that again? You're saying what...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On a sequential basis, the 4Q acquisition costs are lower than 3Q, which you can see in the MD&amp;A. And it doesn't look that it is because of smart phones that that cost is higher. To me, it appears it is coming from some other area because on &#x2013; on an annual basis, you are right, but on a sequential basis it doesn't look like to be smartphone subsidy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Why don't we take a look at that? We'll get back to you offline, so that we can come back with the quantitative numbers that we reported and we'll get back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 81 million that we reported for the fiber revenue, going ahead, next year, the only thing we can tell you is that we expect the fiber rollout next year to be at its peak. I think as to what revenues reported on quarterly basis, it depends very much on how many homes we complete.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So likely to increase next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't &#x2013; I think it's reasonable to assume that it will be higher, but for the whole year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, do you want to talk about the Optus or do you want Murray [Murray King] to talk about the Optus CapEx for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Murray, go ahead please, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As you rightly pointed out, we have got in relation to CapEx that it will be around 1.2 billion next year versus around &#x2013; just over 1 billion this year. Predominantly, we're going to continue investment in our mobile network infrastructure. As you've seen from this year, very strong growth in relation to our overall customer base and particularly underpinned by growth in wireless broadband customers. So we'll continue to expand for the depth and the breadth of our coverage to be able to satisfy the ongoing demand for data services and the expanding customer base that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to get back on your question about the relative levels of subsidies in the SAC, in Singapore, the SACs are defined as on a per postpaid subscriber, so it only relates to postpaid subscriber. In Australia, the number that is shown there is actually a blended number, inclusive of both post and prepaid customers.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Next online we have Mr. Guerra [Christian Guerra] from Goldman Sachs, Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for your time. I have four questions for you this morning, two on Singapore and two on Optus. Firstly, on Singapore, just a question for Allen Lew. Allen, just with NBN coming this year in Singapore, I'm wondering if you could talk us through, please, how you're looking at the migration path from your network to the NBN in Singapore? What sort of factors you are focused on in terms of how that migration will work and also the timing of the migration?</p>
          <p>Secondly, with your guidance on the Singapore business for the EBITDA decline, can you please tell us whether there's anything in that guidance from the NBN? In other words, are you assuming some sort of margin decline as a result of the migration?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on Optus, Paul, you talked about &#x2013; earlier you talked about the competition in the Australian broadband market during the quarter. Could you also maybe talk about what you're seeing in terms of the fixed to mobile migration and things like cancellations of telephone numbers and cancellations of voice lines as people move to wireless given the strength in the wireless broadband numbers?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just a question on your mobile network, you mentioned earlier that you're upping the CapEx for FY '11 to 1.2 billion mainly as a result of the investment in the mobile network. The churn for the quarter was 1.5% in the fourth quarter, which is a great result. It sounds like from a network performance perspective, things are actually going okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Christian, I'll answer the two questions. On NBN, I think because of the competitiveness of the market, I can't share with you the details of which customers are going to approach to migrate from copper to the fiber network. But just very broadly, obviously, a significant number of our TV customers and, of course, a significant number of our mio Home customers, those that take a TV, a broadband Internet access and a fixed line voice from us, and there will be those that are probably today on the higher speed plans.</p>
          <p>In terms of the EBITDA decline and what amount of that is due to NBN, actually the NBN has a very small impact on the EBITDA margin declining next year, primarily because next year the rollout only goes from 30 to 60% of businesses and homes. So the margin decline next year is more due to some of the mio TV growth projections that we have when we have to roll out more customers, we have to send our contractors there and we have some additional content costs as well.</p>
          <p>And of course, when these customers &#x2013; mio TV customers move across to us and we provide them with a mobile bundle, there will be some SAC there as well. So in short, I think the NBN impact on our margin decline is quite small and it's mainly in the business segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Allen, from that we should assume that looking, I guess, out to FY '12, there's going to be more of a margin hit in the Singapore business from the migration to NBN?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Unfortunately, this is not as simple as that because as we go to FY '12, we have some of our other multimedia and solutioning business starting to kick in as well. NBN is a rather complicated thing. So I think basically there's two parts to NBN. One is the infrastructure part where we own 30% of OpenNet, which is the company that provides the fibers, so that we do get some return from our ownership there. We have an arrangement with them to roll out fibers and maintain their fibers. So there's some revenue coming in from there. So I wouldn't just make a straight assumption that in FY '11/'12 we would necessarily get further margin erosions based on NBN.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, would you like to take the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to pick up on Christian's question on fixed to mobile migration on the network. We've actually got a small presentation on wireless broadband users and some survey stuff we did recently. And I know that Stuart [Stuart Tucker] is planning to take a number of the investment analysts through that shortly. But I think it shows the early signs of the trends you're talking about, Christian, which is that the younger demographic seemed more willing to use wireless as its primary connection from the home.</p>
          <p>I think that we would probably caution that by saying that it is certainly a trend line that we have yet to see the really significant shift of people switching off the fixed line in the home across the broader market. And that will certainly be in the survey itself we're able to show you.</p>
          <p>In terms of the network, certainly if you look at the last 12 to 18 months, we have a very large focus on investing to improve quality in our network. We've done a lot of work to split frequencies and to dedicate frequencies on 3G to voice versus data. We've recently bought the Qualcomm spectrum which will allow us to double spectrum and our capacity for 3G in the metro areas &#x2013; in fact, in the eight capital cities.</p>
          <p>We've done a big investment over the last 12 months to upgrade our backhaul of the sites. The average metro site, 18 months, two years ago, had maybe one to two E1s on backhaul. Our average today is six to seven and we continue to work to expand that.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, we've also been increasing our footprint. We've got two elements to that. We've been building out our network. We are now at 97% 3G voice coverage. We were 96 18 months to two years ago. And we're on track to build that to 98. And likewise, in the metro areas, we are actually for the first time in about a decade building more metro sites because we have a view that we will need and benefit from a denser network given the surge in demand we expect to see for mobile broadband and mobile broadband applications.</p>
          <p>All of that has been pleasing. Our own testing of our network relative to competitors has shown both a dramatic improvement in the last 12 months and us making significant inroads on competitive position. And likewise, third parties such as Australian PC magazine, who recently looked at all the different carriers, who rated our mobile broadband and Virgin Mobile as being in the top categories in terms of value for money which is a composite of network quality and price. So we think we've come a long way and we think we're very well positioned moving forward, with a continued focus on investing to improve the quality and experience.</p>

          <p>Paul, just a comment on the growth of the market, you guys have done 250,000 net adds for the quarter and Vodafone, 3 did about 0.5 million. So that's basically three quarters of a million new customers just from two of the three carriers. Sounds like there's a tidal wave of usage and therefore CapEx coming over the next 12 to sort of 24 months for this industry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in our case, we've been investing ahead of demand, so when we look at where we're selling today, we actually quality-control at our stores who we sell to make sure that we are selling in areas where we have good capacity. So from our point of view, the sort of CapEx that you've seen us spend in the last 12 months and that we currently guided to in the next 12 months, that's pretty consistent with the sort of demand we're both winning and that we expect to continue to materialize in the market. So I wouldn't be signaling in today's results any major change in our CapEx profile.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Apology in advance for a slight skew towards Optus on the questions. A couple for me, just on the ARPU, the overall postpaid ARPU is increasing by sort of 1, 2%, but you're saying your postpaid excluding wireless broadband is increasing by 6%. And the implication is that your wireless broadband ARPU must be coming down. So I was just wondering what sort of drivers are you seeing there? And just on the back of that, overall, is there an acceleration in sort of wireless data growth? Is it a positive story for mobile margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Laurent, Paul here. If we take those two questions &#x2013; I might ask Murray to comment on them. But actually the answer on the ARPU is probably less sinister than it might appear at first glance. But Murray, you're happy to talk about the ARPU and also give some sense of understanding as to how we look at the profitability of wireless data and wireless broadband.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Paul. Laurent, in respect to the overall ARPU, as you rightly point out, our overall postpaid ARPU up around 1%, but if you exclude wireless broadband up around 6%. The impact there in relation to wireless broadband is just the penetration of wireless broadband customers into our postpaid base.</p>
          <p>As you would appreciate, the wireless broadband retail market at the moment, the average sort of retail pricing for wireless broadband is around sort of the 30-odd-dollar mark, 30 to 50-odd-dollars for reasonable data allowances. And that's obviously significantly below average postpaid ARPUs that we're getting from customers with handsets.</p>
          <p>So the increasing penetration of wireless broadband into our postpaid base is the dilutive effect there. So you're not seeing any sort of significant decline in wireless broadband ARPUs. They've really been stable at those sort of relative retail pricing.</p>
          <p>In relation to your question &#x2013; in relation to data growth on margins, yes, a lot of the growth in our ARPUs is due to data growth both from wireless broadband customers and also from customers using their handset more for data services. So you've seen our non-SMS ARPUs, data ARPUs increase to 16% of ARPUs, up from 10% in the same corresponding period last year. Those data revenues ultimately will flow through to margins. So it will be positive in relation to the overall margin position with regards to our mobile business.</p>
          <p>The margins in relation to our mobile business and the fact that they've stayed relatively flat year-on-year is more a consequence of customer acquisition activity. So you've seen our selling expenses for the quarter up about 11%. But that's off the back of a record quarter of 254,000 net additions for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow-up, just on the margin uptake sequentially, so you're flagging a seasonality effect. Is there a component of sort of structural recovery as sort of you're getting scale into your sort of the higher ARPU, the likes of iPhones, et cetera? Are you at the crossover point where your quarterly SACs are more than offset by your accumulated sort of ARPU uplift? Is there an element of that in that margin uptick or it's only seasonality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The majority of the margin increase between quarter three and quarter four is predominantly due to seasonality. That's off the back of lower revenues in the quarter because of the holiday period and the shorter months in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The structural element, we continue to obviously grow our higher value base off the back of smartphone penetration, but really as a consequence of the increase of the continuing volumes of smartphones driving higher acquisition costs, it means that that base of smartphones, the incremental revenues and incremental margins have not been able to offset the volume impact as yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And just a very last one for me, just on &#x2013; I've seen your new plans, your plans on the iPad. I remember sort of teething problems initially on the launch of the iPhone, partly because of &#x2013; you were sort of a victim of your own success there. So obviously, given the nature of the device and success it has had in the US, are you provisioning for obviously a potential load on the network following the launch? Have you priced your plans with that in mind as well in terms of managing the demand on this particular device?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Laurent, so I might pick up on that. Look, it sort of goes back a little bit to my earlier comments where we've been investing very heavily over the last 12, 18 months to upgrade capacity on the network and to get ahead of demand. Our pricing on iPad reflects the way that we think customers will use it.</p>
          <p>We do think there will be good demand for 3G because it does &#x2013; huge advantages to people who are out and about. And interestingly, we think there may be some reasonable uptake as well in the business market because it's a great device for use as a sales tool or for keeping track of anybody who's got to do inspections or audits. So it's got some value in terms of that.</p>
          <p>But we also think that people will heavily use the Wi-Fi component of it when they're within range of a Wi-Fi network. So it will be a little different to the utilization patterns you've seen on an iPhone, which are all 3G based and which are very much associated with mobility. So we have dimension for it; we are expecting it. And certainly, if you look at our plans, we've very much continued the philosophy we had with the iPhone, which is we believe people have a hunger for browsing the Internet in a time-immediate way and being able to take advantage of a situation. So we've designed plans that make Optus again the network that your iPad is going to be happier on just like it was with the iPhone.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. Next on line we have Mr. Ian Martin from RBS, Sydney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just two questions if I could, one to Paul first and then one to Sock Koong. Paul, the margin trend over the year, incrementally you've added $628 million for an extra $86 million EBITDA, so incremental margin about 14%, and even though margins have recovered quite well in the fourth quarter, the incremental margin is still well down on the average.</p>
          <p>And when you look at what's happening with where that cost is highest in the costs of goods sold and SG&amp;A, previously I thought that this is a trend that you could recover as you build up scale, carrier scale, but now it seems to me that it's a transfer of scale from Optus as a carrier business to these handset and applications providers and so on. Is that the trend as you see it? First question.</p>
          <p>And secondly, notwithstanding all of that, the cash flow is still quite reliable, but at the group level, you look at the balance sheet where net debt has come down to 6.3 billion, gearing 21%, EBITDA which last year was less than net debt, now $1 billion higher than it. It looks like a relatively inefficient balance sheet, given the certainty of cash flow coming out of Optus and the Singapore business. And I just wonder, at least as a minimum, where the shareholder should be expecting that dividend to remain at least at the high end of that range or whether there's, you talked about capital management before, but looking at it from a balance sheet perspective, the case seems quite strong for some change there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ian. It's Paul here. I'll take the first of those questions, and I'd say that it's absolutely incorrect to take a snapshot view or try and reach finite conclusions on the mobile business based on simply the in-year margin performance. And the reason for that is, that it's all about getting a balance between how much you spend in acquisitions and the value of those customers and what it does to your future earnings potential.</p>
          <p>I mean, we've just had several quarters in a row of really, really high acquisition levels compared to our traditional run rate. Those are helping us fuel a very good growth at the top line, and the way I look &#x2013; I'd urge everyone to look to see, well is that growth being bought in an NPV-positive way, in a way that is accretive to Optus as earning future profits.</p>
          <p>And, it's very hard to look at the EBITDA margin, because that's going to be extremely distorted and muddied by the level of acquisition we're doing each quarter. Instead I'd look to other lines. I'd look at things like ARPU. Most mobile operators at this stage in the world on voice are diluting their ARPUs as they bring on more customers, because they're having to rely on just getting new entrants to the market.</p>
          <p>Our postpaid ARPU, excluding wireless broadband is up 6%. That's completely against the trend of most mobile operators, which shows that the customers we're acquiring are higher ARPU than we have traditionally in the base. So, our acquisition activity is clearly fuelling our base with customers who have probably been in the market for a while, probably coming from competitors, and therefore there's a significant shift in revenue share from high quality customers associated with it.</p>
          <p>The second line I'd look at is our operational EBITDA. The fact that we're able to fund this level of record acquisitions, and at the same time expand our EBITDA in absolute dollars is again a testament to the quality of the revenue that we're winning, by virtue of winning customers over. It's up 4.5% for the quarter, nearly 5% for the full year. So the type of revenue we're winning is generating very good outcomes for us in terms of profitability.</p>
          <p>Sure, while we continue to do record levels of acquisitions, it's going to have a short-term depressing impact on our in-quarter margin, but we think that the investment is worthwhile. It's showing through in both ARPU and in the EBITDA. And if anything, from what we can see, it's getting a lot of plaudits and kudos from most of the market in terms of our performance.</p>
          <p>Murray, I'll past it over to you, if there's anything you want to add to that, and then maybe over to the Singapore team to comment on the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, this is Sock Koong here. Speak on the dividend capital management issue, just want to draw your attention to a couple of points. Firstly, the underlying net profit for the group was up 13%, and you see that the increase in the dividend here for the year is up 14%. So in line with the increase in earnings, we are paying out a higher dividend. We are paying $0.142 this year, which represents a payout ratio of 58%. That is certainly at the high-end of our dividend payout range of 45 to 60%.</p>
          <p>I should also highlight, and I think this was mentioned earlier in the call, that if you look at the different parts of the business and the cash flow generation, if you exclude Bharti, Bharti pays a very small dividend only, the payout ratio is actually more like 74%. So, that I think for a company that still delivered double digit earnings growth and has a dividend yield over 5%, I think that certainly is not a weak performance. I think we've also made quite clear that we do want to retain some financial flexibility, so that if there are good investment opportunities, we will be in a very good position to take advantage of those opportunities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the conference call. I actually had three questions, the first one was with regards to your write down of the value of Warid. If you could now share with us what your latest book value for that asset is, and then do you see any further risks of write down I guess going forward?</p>
          <p>The second question again I had with regards to the capital management policy. You did mention that you want to keep some flexibility for future opportunities. I was wondering if you could help us understand what those opportunities might be. I know in the past you have talked about Africa, but with Bharti kind of directly going there, one would imagine that the possibility of you going there would be low. So how do we look at what kind of acquisition opportunities would you still be looking at?</p>
          <p>And do you have any timeframe on that? So let's say, if something doesn't come for the next couple of years, you would be prepared to revisit your balance sheet, something like that? Sorry, those are the two questions I had. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jeann. On the Warid investment, we have taken a write down of 260 million this year. If you recall last year, we took a write down of 300 million, so we have taken a total write down on the investment of S$560 million. And it is a combination of a couple of factors, and I think, the key of which is the weaker operating conditions in a very challenging market. So that's the Warid investment in terms of the provisions.</p>
          <p>We do not disclose the details of the carrying value of each of our associates. At this point, we have not publicly disclosed that. So, I'll refrain from making disclosures.</p>
          <p>On capital management, I think Sock Koong basically covered a large part of that in terms of wanting to retain financial flexibility yet keeping an efficient balance sheet when opportunities arise, to be able to capture that. I think if you look at our capital management initiatives in the past, when we do a special dividend or capital reduction, it is always around very exceptional gains like when we divest our European asset or when we had the compensation from the government. So those are extraordinary proceeds. You would see that the $0.142 per share that we have declared this year or proposed this year is actually the highest ordinary dividend ever.</p>
          <p>Navin, have we answered your question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call. I've got two questions. First one on mio TV, you guys have recorded quite substantial growth in subscribers, can I ask whether, are these mostly BPL subscribers? And do you see many of these new subscribers also taking up your other channels? And Allen, can you talk about your strategy with regard to content bidding and also building up the pay TV business going forward, given the cross carriage mandate?</p>
          <p>And the second question is in regards to the guidance on the EBITDA margins and EBITDA decline in Singapore, should we expect the same trend as well for the net profit line? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me talk about the mio TV. In terms of mio TV, yes, we've seen a substantial pick up, and a large number of these are taking our early bird offers for BPL as well as for ESPN STAR Sports. So, yeah, we are seeing a significant number coming across that are taking up our new sports channels. But what is also quite heartening is that we are seeing these same people also taking up some of our SuperSaver Packs. We have a English, a Chinese and a Malay SuperSaver Pack, which comes in at about $19 a month.</p>
          <p>And we're also seeing them taking some of our Video-on-Demand. I think recently we had the premiere of Avatar on mio TV, and on that weekend, we had the record number of people watching it using VoD.</p>
          <p>With regards to our content bidding, as a result of the content sharing regulation that's right now being consulted with the industry, I think it's premature at this time to talk about our strategy there. I think for us we feel that we already have a very strong suite of products with sports. And we've augmented that with movies, we've augmented that with US TV series, and we will then look at what are the opportunities that become available to us, as these new content sharing regime start to take place in October.</p>
          <p>With regard to the impact of net profit next year, I will hand over to Jeann for the Singapore business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we basically provide guidance on the three parts of our business. So, on the Singapore part we basically disclosed the revenue trends &#x2013; the revenue guidance as well as EBITDA guidance. We have indicated that EBITDA would decline slightly between the low to mid single-digit range because of the investment that we're making in our strategic initiatives, particularly in NBN.</p>
          <p>On the Optus end, we have guided that the revenue and EBITDA will grow at mid single-digit and we have also provided some guidance on the two major associates. I think we have also highlighted, as you know, that our reported performance can be impacted by currency volatility as we have seen in the last two years. But those are basically information out there in the market as and when the currency moves. So, I think the guidance is provided along those lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>

          <p>Thank you. Next on line we have Mr. Tucker Grinnan from HSBC Hong Kong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have three questions. First, following up on the investment strategy, at the Regional Associates Day, you spent some time chatting with us about how investments in core network, i.e., emerging market wireless businesses, those opportunities might be diminishing and that you thought future investments might be focused more on corporate services, infrastructure, call centers, et cetera, et cetera. I wonder if you could give us some update on your thinking on that shift.</p>
          <p>Second, not to beat a dead horse, but on the capital management issue, when you think about the dividend, do you think about it relative benchmarking to other South-East Asian names or other Asian telco names; 5% is a good number but I think for most of the investor base you're caught in the middle, maybe in there with the Chinese and Korean telcos.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, to follow-up on Paul's comments on CapEx and wireless broadband, are you seeing evidence either in Singapore or in other markets with capacity constraints impacting you or your competitors? Is the increase in data traffic off of wireless dongles and smartphones higher, lower or within your expectations? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Chuan Poh here. I think you're right, we did say very clearly at the last time we met that the opportunities available for the traditional acquisition of mobile companies are pretty limited, especially now that Bharti has gained our support to do a deal with Zain. That takes care of the last remaining large block of emerging markets that we are focusing on. So we are now looking at other ways of delivering values and growth to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>One of those things that we've been looking at is how do we comprehensively build upon the assets that we've invested on, especially the network and the customer base that we acquired today, onto higher value added services. That will involve some degree of regional infrastructure as well as content services. Those are the kind of projects that we're now embarking &#x2013; I'm sorry, I can't share the details of those initiatives that we're embarking upon now. But you are right in saying that the focus going forward in the next few years will largely be on other than the traditional acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question about capital management and whether we benchmark to other companies and telcos, yes, we do look at the Singapore blue chips. We look at telco stocks as well. I think you make reference to Korean and China companies. I actually would point you to the companies that actually have got higher dividend yields, and they are companies like Telecom New Zealand, Telstra and maybe the two telcos in Singapore, that I suppose is not of the same profile as SingTel.</p>
          <p>We do have growth in parts of our operation, particularly into the Regional Mobile Associates. And I think, if you look at what we are delivering in terms of the payout relative to our net profit after you adjust for the Bharti contribution, because we have explained that Bharti currently pay a nominal dividend, although they do &#x2013; they have started to generate very strong cash flow from the operation. If you exclude the Bharti contribution, our payout is in the region of about 74%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, I think let me talk a bit more about your question on the wireless broadband and CapEx in the Singapore content, and then I'll hand over to Paul. He can talk about it in Australian context.</p>
          <p>I think for us the wireless broadband and ensuring that our mobile networks are efficient and effective in handling all this higher speed is a definite must for us. It is where our new growth is going to come from mature markets like Singapore.</p>
          <p>We're also heightened by the number of smartphones that are coming up, not just Apple but also the Android phones, the new Microsoft Windows Mobile 7 phones. And we are coming out with a whole series of applications to make sure that we utilize the foundation that we have with our wireless broadband.</p>
          <p>The bulk of our CapEx these days goes into ensuring that we have the best mobile data network in this country and that we can differentiate ourselves on that basis. To make sure that the CapEx doesn't blow out as a result of people using this more and more, there are techniques that we use within our network and we work with our suppliers to make sure that these are implemented to ensure that things like peering traffic get lower priority on the mobile network and things like TV traffic and some of the other types of traffic that is revenue generating for us gets a higher priority.</p>
          <p>I'm going to hand over to Paul to see whether he's got anything to add to that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Allen. Well, I think I outlined earlier really that we've been working very hard to make sure that we're ahead of the issue. We certainly have had nothing like the experience you described from AT&amp;T. Sure, like any carrier we'll have pockets of congestion from time to time, but overall our investment to dedicate frequencies in the metro area to data versus voice to acquire extra spectrum from Qualcomm which doubles spectrum for 3G in the eight major capital cities, to expand our backhaul from an average of one to two E1s per site two years ago to now in our metro area at an average of six to seven E1s.</p>
          <p>And then after that, also the expansion of our footprint, which includes building some extra sites in metro. All of that's been designed to make sure we stay in front. And certainly the independent surveys we've seen are recognizing that Optus has actually lifted quality substantially over the last 12 months, which is quite the opposite, I think, of some of the experience you're referring to in the North American environment.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick follow-up questions then. On Chuan Poh's comment on content, does the Singapore Government's decision to limit your ability to use exclusive content alter that strategy? If the Singapore Government and your home market believe using your market power to control the content base is not something they want, how does that impact your view on investing in content as a way of adding value?</p>
          <p>And then second, if Bharti is effectively going to be the mechanism for investing in Africa, certainly based on the capital requirements that we see for them to level the playing field with people like MTN, there's going to be additional capital investments. Should we assume no significant change in Bharti's dividend payout ratio or in cash flows coming out of Bharti the same way they come out of your other associates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will address the issue of the content. Actually, the Singapore Government's policy on the content has got very little impact on what we are looking at on a regional basis. In any case, if we're looking at content as a regional business, then obviously as much as we would like to give our own related company some degree of exclusivity, ultimately I think it is a larger marketplace in the Asia Pacific that we're interested in.</p>
          <p>So it will not change the way we look at content business, not so much on a local geographic basis but on the regional basis, because ultimately if you look at the way that the value added services game is being played today, it is not about any one operator but is across the whole base of customers that we have.</p>
          <p>I'll leave Jeann to talk about the Bharti CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think on Bharti's dividend, Bharti declared a dividend &#x2013; announced a dividend of one rupee per share. That translates to about 4.5% payout, 4 to 4.5% dividend payout ratio, which is &#x2013; so the level of dividend is the same as the previous year.</p>
          <p>It is nominal but if you look at the transactions that Bharti has been doing, I mean, Bharti is basically on the acquisition of Zain said they have announced that they've entered into a definitive agreement and currently it's pending completion. They've also announced the financing that will support the acquisition.</p>
          <p>And of course, with the 3G &#x2013; expected 3G investment, Bharti has given &#x2013; as you know Bharti has very little net debt prior to the Zain acquisition as well as the spectrum acquisition. So if you look at the debt ratios, it is probably very comfortably around 2.5 to 3 times. Clearly, Bharti have also talked about the ability to manage their debt structure and &#x2013; but the debt ratios that Bharti is currently at is still at a healthy level.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. One question from me, please. With regards to your Singapore CapEx for FY '10, the original guidance was around 800, but the actual is somewhere around 650 or so. I'm just wondering if you could provide some color in terms of what was originally expected and is it pushed out or is it something that has not materialized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will let my CFO for Singapore, Kung Yang, answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, some of it was due to a timing difference but I think a lot of it was also due to how we negotiated prices with our various equipment vendors. So I think that's why you're seeing that number coming in lower than what was the guidance that we've given.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, when you say equipment vendors, has it to do with the fixed network or the wireless network, or can you provide some color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's largely a mix of both. As what Allen was alluding to earlier on, we're also very much investing in the mobile side of things and we also &#x2013; in terms of the fixed network, we're also doing a lot of investment there as well in anticipation of the NBN. So, it's a mixture of both.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for the call. I've got basically two questions. The first question relates again to the argument to why there is a need for financial flexibility and the need for a little bit more investment.</p>
          <p>I'm just trying to understand it more from a capital management standpoint, and SingTel has 1.6 billion cash right now, net debt to EBITDA of 0.9 times. You have guided for free cash flow of over 1 billion for Singapore, about a $1 billion free cash flow from Australia, and we estimate roughly your associates' dividends could be almost as high as a total of almost 1 billion next year.</p>
          <p>So, there seems to be a lot of scope for a capital return and I just don't understand, unless there's a chunky investment coming up, I mean, even small investments, there seems to be flexibility to do that at this point. So anyway, could you just help us understand within this context, what is the desire for further financial flexibility? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question relates more on the CapEx front. I just want to understand for Singapore &#x2013; for Singapore, I understand the CapEx is mainly due to the satellite. Would this year be the end of the CapEx for the satellite, and thereafter the run rates should be more or less the normalized run rate for Singapore? That's the first part within CapEx.</p>
          <p>Second question on Optus is, how should we think about CapEx from here? There's been some good CapEx growth over the past year to support growth, but do you expect this to continue beyond this next 12 months? That's the question there.</p>
          <p>And a third question relates more to the EBITDA margin guidance for Singapore. I note that it's looking like a bit of a decline and could you help me understand the reason, what kind of &#x2013; is it mainly due to mio TV impact that's causing that? I mean in addition to the IT and engineering mix, is there anything else that's causing the decline on a year-on-year basis?</p>
          <p>And for Optus, I just want to understand the guidance seems to imply EBITDA margin stability. I just want to understand some of the basic tenets of your scenario behind that guidance. Have you factored in, for example, the competition from Vodafone? Are you factoring in some slowdown in the iPhone net adds and therefore some SAC pressure will start to ease this year? And if you could provide more clarity on that front it would be much appreciated. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a lot of questions. I'll take the first one, which is the debt and the capital. I'd just like to highlight that when you talk about our net cash of 1.6 billion and then you talk about our net debt ratios, clearly the net debt is after deducting the cash, you know, the ratio. So you shouldn't try and double count by telling me that I've got 1.6 billion and then I've only got 0.9 of debt to EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Yes, it is at a healthy level and I think we are looking at &#x2013; we have, I think, time and again repeated this. We have increased the dividend. It is a 14% increase. It is in line with our profit. We have also indicated that the payout ratio on the group profit is 58%. If you adjust for Bharti, it is at 74%. So, we have &#x2013; basically we put those statements out. The group continues to want to have financial flexibility, because we believe that investment opportunities are opportunistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the CapEx question, you had in terms of the satellite expenditure, the satellite is going to be launched in the first half of 2011. So there's still going to be additional capital expenditure that will be incurred. So what you're seeing &#x2013; the guidance that we've given is only in respect of this financial year. It's the second half? I'm sorry, by the second half of next financial year &#x2013; calendar year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Optus question on CapEx, in respect to guidance and looking forward, we only obviously provide guidance in respect of the forthcoming 12-month period. We said we'll invest around $1.2 billion, but you've seen us historically hold our CapEx at low double-digit percentage of revenues around the 11 or 12% mark. We will remain financially disciplined so we don't see ourselves moving out of that sort of range in any time in the foreseeable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the margin decline for the Singapore business, I think that the top three things that contribute to that; number one, it's not just mio TV content costs, it will also be the cost for us to pay our contractors and go to homes. We're expecting a large number of people to want to have the mio TV set-top boxes as the new season of BPL starts and as we move towards getting some of the other sports contents from ESS on. And there are also some subscriber acquisition costs that we'll have related to broadband as well as mobile.</p>
          <p>The second big area where we will obviously have some margin decline is also because of the lower margins, mainly from IDD. IDD continues to be one where we're seeing a lot of free IDD traffic and customers are going onto calling plans.</p>
          <p>And then the third one is the cessation of the government resilience package that we had this year, that we will not have next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In relation to the Optus guidance question, as you rightly pointed out, we've guided that revenue and EBITDA would grow at mid single-digit levels, which implies margin would be stable. We have factored in the competitive environment and the overall subscriber acquisition cost.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that we expense subscriber acquisition costs up front, for those subscribers we particularly acquired in the FY'10 financial year have only contributed revenues for part of the year. So the full year revenue impact from those customers will flow through in the next year. And as we've provided in the guidance. We do expect our margins and our revenues to be underpinned by continuing positive momentum and above market revenue growth.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the call. Just one question from me. In spite of your diversified exposure, it looks like your FY'11 earnings outlook leans very heavily on Optus. Would you kindly help us understand if you've left room for positive surprise in any of the other guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We want to make sure that we provide enough information for the investment community to be able to work through what the likely earnings outlook is for the group, so you see the way we've done it. We've talked about Singapore. We've provided the factors that would impact the Singapore business. We've done the one for Australia. And then the associates, of course, it's a lot more complicated. And we've focused on the two largest associates, Bharti and Telkomsel.</p>
          <p>We are also very mindful that a number of the associates that we have are separately listed &#x2013; they are also listed and they also would have responsibilities on disclosures et cetera. So we would have to be quite mindful in what we say to make sure that we don't cause them to have problems with their respective home exchanges. So that's how we've done the guidance.</p>
          <p>I think the biggest issue of course is at the group level. Since a large part of the earnings is not denominated in Singapore dollars, the translation difference would have a significant impact on the top line because of A$. And on the bottom line, it would also very dependent on how the A$ as well as the currencies that our associates &#x2013; of the countries that the associates operate in &#x2013; move relative to the Singapore dollar. So I suppose currency is a big impact in addition to the individual performance of the different parts of the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that, but just for the Singapore operations in that case, is there anything that could happen that could change your EBITDA outlook? I know you're planning for a lot more on the mio TV front, anything that you think could be an area of positive surprise?</p>

Now, of course, markets are very dynamic and you've got a management team in place that will adjust its operating plans depending on the competitive dynamics in the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, the businesses are both EBITDA positive already. It's just that the operating environment hasn't been very kind to telco as a whole. It's not just to us. In the case of Pakistan, as you know, I mean, the political and economic situation hasn't really improved very much.</p>
          <p>Bangladesh is also further complicated by the fact that we're on a technology that doesn't have a very good competitive edge, but we're trying our best in Bangladesh because we are now rolling out EVDO, which is the only semblance of a high speed mobile broadband there is in the market. So hopefully that can give us some traction, but on the whole both markets looks pretty &#x2013; as we said before for some form of consolidation and we are still working on the other possibilities there.</p>
