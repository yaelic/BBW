          <p>Good morning. This is Kent, welcoming you to ING's First Quarter 2010 Conference Call.</p>
          <p>Before handing this conference over to Jan Hommen, Chief Executive Officer of ING Group; Patrick Flynn, Chief Financial Officer; and Koos Timmermans, Chief Risk Officer, let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comments are subject to a number of current views, assumptions and variables including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movements in securities markets including equity markets and underlying economic conditions and changes. These are set out in greater detail in our public filings, which we could urge you to read.</p>
          <p>The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered by unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables. Good morning Jan, Patrick and Koos. Jan, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Welcome everyone on the telephone and also on the webcast. I am happy to report that we made a good start of the year. Of course markets started to stabilize or improve a little bit in first quarter and impairments and negative market impacts have diminished significantly from previous quarters.</p>
          <p>However, our first quarter results also show the strengths of our franchises and we are seeing early progress on the performance improvement programs that we have set out for the insurance company as well as for the bank.</p>
          <p>Volumes are up in banking, loan loss provisions are trending down and insurance also have gained momentum in this first quarter. Margins are stable quarter-on-quarter and efficiency has continued to improve on both sides of the business. So I think an encouraging start for the first quarter of the new year.</p>
          <p>When I look at slide number two I would &#x2013; well, you can read it yourself, but I will make a few comments. The underlying profit of just over 1 billion, that compares to a loss of 236 million in the year before. Bank underlying profit almost &#x20AC;1.3 billion, compared to 769 million a year ago. And importantly total income of the bank now is at levels that we have seen pre-crises.</p>
          <p>Insurance had an underlying profit of 269 million, that compares to a loss of 954 a year ago and you can see here that non-operating items declined and operating profit for life and investments increased by 30%. So also here you see that &#x2013; that the plans &#x2013; the performance improvement plans are beginning to get hold.</p>
          <p>Shareholders equity was up by 4.4 billion and shareholders equity is now &#x20AC;10.10 on a per share basis. And the return on equity on an annualized basis was up to 11.3 compared to 3.3% a year ago so, all-in-all a significant improvement on previous quarters and as I said earlier, a good start for the year 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide number three. Here you see the improvements in underlying net results compared with previous quarters. And you clearly can see here as a result also that impairments and other market related impacts have diminished, but the volumes at the banks and the margins have continued to improve.</p>
          <p>Expenses are under tight control and loan loss provisions have declined from both the first quarter as well as from the fourth quarter last year. Insurance has benefited from improved investment margins and cost containment which drove a 30% increase in operating profit from Life and IM. Importantly this improvement was very broad-based with almost all segments within the bank and the insurer showing higher result than a year ago.</p>
          <p>On page four, slide four, you see on the top left the commercial performance for banking, on the right, the operating results for insurance both excluding market impacts. Both sides of the company are showing improving terms and real operating performance. And I can strength that again to say that this is reflecting the strengths of our franchise in both of our businesses.</p>
          <p>In the middle part you see the negative market impacts and risk costs for the bank, both showing an improving trend as the market have stabilized and/or improved in the first quarter. And finally the underlying result, you see more volatility from quarter-to-quarter but clear improving trends for both the bank and insurance company.</p>
          <p>On page number five, you see expenses for the quarter. Again here on expenses the reported numbers show little increase, but &#x2013; compared with Q4, but it's a bit distorted by the fact that we had accruals for certain benefit programs that we moved into the year 2010, so Q4 got a benefit and the subsequent quarters and Q1 in particular got a little bit of a negative impact on that.</p>
          <p>On the bank side, operating expense also include impairments on real estate and the DSB provision which is shown in orange, last year in Q4. On a like-for-like basis, if we compared that operating expenses are down 1.8% for the bank and 1.9% for the insurance company, if we compare that with last year.</p>
          <p>Slide number six, you see that we are making good progress compared to the ambition that we have set for 2010. This slide shows the bank &#x2013; our targets are top line growth of 5% so we did very well this quarter. Our cost income ratio, we want to see that trending down to 50%, it was 57, but if we eliminate the impact of impairments and market volatility, that is down to 53%.</p>
          <p>Risk costs have been trending down to 59% or 59 basis points. Our target is 40 to 45 and you see that return on equity has gone up to 14.9, there is an objective of somewhere between 13 and 15%. So all in all I would say, we are approaching our objectives and ambitions and the ambitions I don't think are really that aggressive as many of you have felt earlier.</p>
          <p>Page number seven, you see the insurance company, management set out performance improvement plans and they were shown at the Investor Day last month. It's still early days, but we are seeing really encouraging improvements in Q1. Investment margin in life and investment management was up by 10.4% driven by growth in the general account and also asset prices were higher.</p>
          <p>Spreads increased slightly from Q4 to 84 basis points, but are still significantly lower than in Q1 last year. And that is of course reflecting the de-risking that we have taken during the year 2009. Efficiency has improved. The ratio of administrative expense relative to operating income declined to 43.5%, of course still higher than the 35% objective, but we're moving in the right direction here.</p>
          <p>Sales of life insurance was up by 14% and that &#x2013; and then we measure that we exclude the closed books in the U.S. as well as in Japan. Return on equity, whilst the low, improved to 3% and there is clearly that we need to do some work here, but I'm very encouraged by the fact that we have the improvements in Q1.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight, you see shareholders equity up by 4.4 billion. It was up because of revaluations partly by foreign exchange and of course by the net profit that we booked. And equity now is almost double what it was a year ago.</p>
          <p>Page nine, the capital ratios, all are better. Debt/equity is at 11.8%, core Tier 1 at 8.4, Tier 1 at 10.9, the FiCo ratio is at 162 and the insurance solvency at 261, all in all I would say, again here a good improvement.</p>
          <p>Next slide, return on equity, that's up to 11.3% and a share &#x2013; earnings per share at 0.35. You see the trend line and I think I'm very encouraged by the trend line here. Now let's summarize, a good first quarter results. We are making good progress on our priorities for 2010. Performance is improving both for the bank and the insurance company and we are approaching and being on our way to our long-term objectives that we have set for 2013. This year will be very important that we maintain our vigilance because markets still are volatile and yes, we have seen an improvement in the economy but it's quite fragile as you could see in the last couple of weeks with the concerns we have had about sovereign risk.</p>
          <p>The bank and the insurance company are separating, as you know, and we are well on track to accomplish that by the end of the year. We have really taken inventory of all the issues. We are now in the design phase and we think we will be done by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>And let me now hand over to Patrick, who will go more into the numbers. Patrick?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you, Jan. ING has had a strong first quarter. The total net result is a profit of 1.3 billion which compares to a loss of 793 in the same quarter of last year, a turnaround of 2 billion.</p>
          <p>Underlying net result of 1 billion, which is before the profit and disposal of our private banking in Asia and Switzerland, compares to a 236 million loss in the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Underlying result before tax at both bank and insurance is up with the bank recording a profit of just under 1.3 billion, and insurance of 269 million.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to the bank on slide 15, the underlying result before tax of &#x2013; just under 1.3 billion, 1,278 million, is the highest we've seen in the previous five quarters, 66% higher than the first quarter of 2009. That was achieved on the back of underlying income up 11% and staff expenses when you exclude impairments, actually down 2%. In addition, loan loss provisions of 497 million are the lowest we've seen in the past five quarters and declined across all business lines.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to underlying income, slide 16, as I said earlier, these levels are high, back to pre-crisis levels driven by lower impairments, strong margins and some volume growth.</p>
          <p>Margins, slide 17, a key driver of performance, remain high at 142 basis points and indeed we've seen an increase in the margin at ING Direct to 118 we were at 98. However we do expect interest margins to decline over time to the long-term average we quoted at 120 basis points.</p>
          <p>Volume growth in the Bank, slide 18, as compared to the previous quarter in retail we've seen some growth in mortgages and retail deposits. But on the commercial side the demand is more muted, just limited growth there.</p>
          <p>Costs, slide 19, excluding impairments which have reduced, operating expenses declined 1.8% in line with our Back to Basics program. On the right hand side you can see the cost/income ratio on a headline basis which includes impairment is highly volatile. The red line below which excludes impairments which is closer to the managed number, is more stable and is at 53.5% which, as Jan said, compares well with our longer term target of 50%. Clearly we have still some work to do to achieve that. That is a target for 2013.</p>
          <p>Retail banking on slide 20, Retail Banking underlying pre-tax profits have tripled to 867 million which is on the back of a good margins, reduction in cost, risk cost down 16.5%, cost/income ratio is improved to 56.2 from 71.6.</p>
          <p>In addition as you can see on the right hand side, the mix of profit is more evenly balanced with a better balance between ING Direct, the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to slide 21, on the segmental results, you see that all our segments are in profit and all are reporting higher results than the same quarter of last year. The commercial bank, slide 22, reported a profit excluding real estate of 683 million which is down 2.7% from the same quarter of last year which you will recall, the first quarter of 2009 was in the depth of the crisis when spreads were at their widest.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, you can see the composition of our commercial banking results and here the red box shows the relative contribution of financial markets. And what we are seeing is that, this is reducing, is down to 32% of the total compared to 53 and we are seeing a stronger contribution from other business lines and those would be structured finance and general lending.</p>
          <p>As I said, this excludes real estate and Koos will give you some further insights on development of the real estate portfolios a little later on.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to insurance, this is the basic slide, but as we said in the Investor Day, we will be using this margin report as the key to explain the performance of our insurance business. Two lines here highlighted in red, underlying performance, 269, which we mentioned at the beginning, compares to loss of 954 in the preceding quarter. Perhaps more importantly operating results, which is before the impact of these volatile items, at 415 million that's an improvement of 63% as compared to the same results last year, that was achieved by income up 10.5% to 1.7 billion and strong cost control with admin expenses showing a modest 2% growth.</p>
          <p>One point to note here in response to the reserve inadequacy we highlighted in the fourth quarter, we are no longer righting up DAC balances when markets improve in respect of the closed block VA business. This has led to a strengthening of reserve of approximately 100 million. Pre-tax, the same impact in results. In other words, results would have been approximately 100 million higher had this change not have been effected. Again, Koos will give you further insights into that element later on.</p>
          <p>So how did the income levels increase in insurance? If we turn to slide 25, investment margin is up 10.4% to 329 million, this increase was achieved in the back of an increase in spreads and the growth in the &#x2013; in volumes in the general account. The spread increase was partly attributable to investing cash assets in fixed income securities, achieving higher yield particularly in the Benelux. As Jan has mentioned the decline in spreads you can see on the graph on the right, is attributed to de-risking, particularly in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Fees and premium based revenues in aggregate up 11% to 1.2 billion, show two components here. The top line loading on premiums is up 670 million in line with growth in sales on premiums. Fees on assets under management are up 22% even though the cost of guarantees increased so much due to lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to slide 27, on admin expenses, if we exclude the impact of the accrual adjustment in respect of the deferral of variable comp awarded in fourth quarter -- our change in the fourth quarter, our expenses are actually down by 9% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>And on the right-hand side you can see, as Jan said, that the key metric we flagged on the Investor Day we are seeking achieve admin expenses to operate income ratio of 35% by 2013 and at 43.4, this is trending in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Segmental results on slide 28 with the exception of the U.S. all the segments are showing profits higher than the first quarter of 2009. I mentioned on the first page where I talked about the margin results. This slide 29 that we would be &#x2013; excludes the impact of non-operating items, so it's worth spending a minute just explaining what they are.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter on impairments we have taken a charge of an aggregate 200 million. This is primarily due to a 75 million realized loss on selling CMBS as we sought to reduce our exposure and 108 million impairment of subprime RMBS and CMBS.</p>
          <p>The other market impact, it's reduced from 829 million to zero. This is where we record the impact of DAC unlocking, Japan SPVA hedging results and the NN separate account. These effects, while not individually zero, did net to zero in the first quarter and across all three lines are lower than previously.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to sales on slide 30, sales increased 15.2%, if you exclude the closed blocks in the U.S. and Japan, which is attributable to presales in the Benelux, Asia and LatAm. In Asia we did benefit from the seasonally high COLI sales as the corporate tax year end approached.</p>
          <p>So in summary, before I just hand over to Koos, ING has had a strong first quarter with an underlying net profit of 1 billion. Most of our ratios have moved in the right direction but we do remain vigilant, particularly in light of the recent market volatility.</p>
          <p>And now I will hand you over to Koos who will take you through the risk section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning. I would like to take you to first slide 32 if we take a step back and look at the whole picture then what you've seen is over the last year we have shortened our balance sheet significantly without sacrificing P&amp;L or margins. We have basically doubled our equity and that is what you see back in an improvement of the leverage ratio. But what we have also done is apart from the core Tier-1 ratio, we have sort of yet made our balance sheet more shock absorbing also by reclassifications on the accounting side so that we are less susceptible to changes in impairments and everything else.</p>
          <p>Also underlying what you see is that the loan book its start to stabilize, so lower risk costs. We actually see the first positive development of the RWAs I think over the last year we kept it in check but what you see now is actually a small improvement. At the same time what you see is that our ABS revaluation reserve that starts to become smaller and smaller in the negative territory.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless does it mean like we are ready on the risk side? The answer is no, I mean we have to stay vigilant on the various aspects and we still do some measures of more precision surgery which is at the moment happening for instance in the real estate development part, which is happening in the CMBSs and the reserve adequacy.</p>
          <p>So with asset values in the news, let's first go to the sovereign debt portfolio of ING. And overall, what you see on page 33 is that we have a government bond portfolio of 91 billion. That government bond portfolio it has a revaluation reserve which is positive on the 31st of March. And after all the movements with Greece and all the other countries, you still see that it's positive because inherently there is a hedge in there, because you have the boons and you have the other currencies where you have a positive gain at a time when it deteriorates in Greece. And if it reverses then you see it differently, but overall the price movements on the whole portfolio were not that significant for us.</p>
          <p>But let's now move to the bank and we see the bank on page 35, what you see there is first the RWAs. It's interesting to note following, the RWA stayed stable. Now what you see there is actually on the loan book although the PDs in technical terms, the probabilities of default are still slightly higher, we have seen loss given default going down and you have some loans which come out of restructuring which also get a better rating, therefore our rating migration contributed this time.</p>
          <p>We still see small upward adjustment on the prime, but net-net, the loan book was positive in terms of RWA production, you see 7 billion on foreign exchange there, and there you can just ignore it, because we hold some capital in dollars as well, so the foreign exchange move is basically irrelevant.</p>
          <p>So let's move to the loan book to the NPLs. What you see on the loan book is actually the following. Total NPLs 2.1, so more or less stable. We see actually a positive development in mortgages U.S. because there it's stabilized. At the same time we've seen some increases in the leasing and in the real estate finance part and that is more particular in the areas of Spain and in the Netherlands. Overall we have a lot lower risk cost, because we've seen that in U.S. mortgages, we've seen that in structured finance, but we also see that in the Benelux in the mid-corp area, so those were the big contributors to a fall in our total risk costs.</p>
          <p>Also what we have seen is if we look at the watch list where we already saw that our corporate side watch list was already declining a little bit. We see that right now also on the mid-corp and the other segments. So it's not a spectacular drop, but overall the watch list, so that is the room before you enter the doctor &#x2013; the patients room, that is basically getting slightly smaller.</p>
          <p>What we see there as well is if we draw conclusions from this that based on the current state of the economy and assuming no big relapse due to governments or other things, then you could say that our risk cost guidance for the next three quarters is more somewhere between what we had this quarter and the last &#x2013; and the second half of last year whereas the previous time I told it's more second half of last year is the guidance. But we see it now more somewhere in between.</p>
          <p>If we look at risk cost over time and then we are on page 37, what you see is actually there that gradual and modest trend downwards, but we also &#x2013; I have to tell you one other small technical thing. Long-term the average for us is 40, 45 basis points but what I have given here is it's over RWAs instead of CRWAs. And the reason that we do it is we want to align it with the other ones. Does it mean a change, does it mean higher guidance, the answer is no. In essence the following is the case.</p>
          <p>The denominator, the amount there, it stays the same. And the reason that it stays the same is that our RWAs to ORM and trading they have now been included, but at the same time the CRWAs per unit of loan produced are basically forecasted to be lower. So net-net denominator stays the same and therefore the amount of risk cost projected stays the same. This all ignores of course all the Basel III and all the other measures coming because that is still unknown. So overall that guidance stays the same.</p>
          <p>So let's now turn from loans to securities. And I am on page 38. On page 38 what you see is the ABS portfolio and you see a decline in the revaluation reserve and again that is still something ongoing because if you look at Alt-A and if you look at it in April prices already move from 61 to 64.</p>
          <p>So market prices of Alt-A are improving, nevertheless, what you still see is delinquencies and that is what you see on the top right hand side of the portfolio, they were still increasing.</p>
          <p>Revaluation reserve on the Alt-A portfolio in total end of first quarter was minus 26 million which comprises of some bonds which have a positive revaluation reserve and that's for 96 million and some for 122 million have a negative revalue reserve. What we had in this quarter is impairments 52 million over an expected credit loss of 20 million. So overall those amounts are getting smaller.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to real estate development. On the real estate development side -- let's first before we talk about real estate development &#x2013; let's first before we talk about real estate development if we talk about <mark type="inaudible" /> and the investment portfolios. In general what you see there is you see that there is a stabilization in terms of revaluations. And why is that happening? In general the cap rates they are stabilizing at around 7% and at the same time the occupancies are still edging a little bit lower but not too much, I think that went down by 1%. So overall you discount a little bit lower cash flows with the same cap rate but that leads to far less revaluations.</p>
          <p>But turning now RED [Real Estate Development], on the RED side what you see is over the last year we had 3 [inaudible] portfolio but what we took already last year is 600 million of impairments and we sold 300 million. This quarter we had a 151 million impairments the expectation is that the amounts will gradually start to edge off in this year because we are still looking at all these projects with the lot of scrutiny.</p>
          <p>If we then move to the insurance company and then we are on page 31, on the insurance company you see &#x2013; 41, sorry. What you on the see on the insurance company is in general, the general account it moved up by 10 billion contributed largely to foreign exchange as well as revaluations. We still did some de-risking and that is with CMBSs and I'll come back to that. And on the U.S. insurance side, the focus for investments at the moment is more on the corporate side. if you look at public equities, we hold some public equities in general a third of it is hedged, you benefit little bit in the hedge because you do that with stock 50 indexes including financials and our portfolio doesn't contain financials which have a bit of higher beta. So that's in a nutshell the developments on the general account.</p>
          <p>Turning to CMBSs what you see in the U.S., you've seen price increases from 77 to 84 which meant that we saw that as an opportunity to sell some of the CMBS portfolio, remaining is basically 44% AAA, credit enhancement 21% and debt service capacity ratio constant at 1.6% nevertheless the price improvements will be used for some more active portfolio management at least we have the opportunity to do that. So on the CMBSs some changes happening overtime.</p>
          <p>Then if we turn to the reserve adequacy on page 43, just the step back there on this part, we have a reserve adequacy and the reserve adequacy is a net number, its net of DAC. Now not writing the DAC up helps basically in this case to reserve adequacy. So what is happening there is a following, if we take it into a sensitivity, we normally assume 2.25% growth of the equity market per quarter.</p>
          <p>If you have now a quarter that you have 15% equity growth, then typically what you see happening is that your reserve adequacy it will move up and it will move up by 0.6 billion and your DAC will stay unchanged. So that's basically profits will not be taken and it will be added to the reserve. So it strengthens. At the same time, if the market moves down 15% from the 2.25, you would see your DAC basically go down by 450 million and your reserve will move up, but DAC and reserves at the same time move up and down means then that your reserve adequacy doesn't change.</p>
          <p>So overall positive markets will strengthen your reserve adequacy, negative markets will not do anything. That is basically the change which has been made and therefore you now have the sensitivities of the DAC as well. So those are in a nutshell the risk management things done. So working on the real estate development side, working on the real estate development side, working on the CMBS side, working on the VAs, but overall you are looking at a bit better situation in terms of balance sheet and the lot of things have been stabilized both in terms of balance sheet as well as in terms of the loan portfolio and then I hand back to you, Jan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Koos. Well, to summarize, I think it was a good quarter, good start of the year, with encouraging numbers. Performance improved both at the banks as well as at the insurance company. And we're approaching our longer term ambitions not everywhere yet but I think we are making good progress towards those ambitions.</p>
          <p>We will continue to work hard this &#x2013; the rest of this year to make sure that we stay vigilant when markets are still quite volatile as we have seen recently. The attention is still on the further improving the operating results at the bank and at the insurance company and to be ready by the end of this year with the full separation of bank and insurance organization.</p>
          <p>And with that, I think we are happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good morning. I have two questions, please. First question is I was just wondering if you could update us on the European Commission and the Dutch government with respect to the Dutch government capital and the restructuring program etcetera, particularly in the light of the recent developments in Europe and the extent of the bailout we are seeing now across the whole of Europe. Does that change &#x2013; or are you aware of that changing either the view of the EC or the Dutch government with respect to your particular capital injection awhile back? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is just on the U.S. life sales, could you just provide a bit of color please on the sales in the retirement business in the U.S.? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Duncan, good morning. The first question on the European Commission, we have seen that the European Commission has filed an answer with the European Court on the appeal that we have made against &#x2013; and remember we have appealed the amount of state support as calculated. We have appealed some of the price regulations we are subjected to and the proportionality of the total package. We are getting ready to make a reply to that reply that we have to file I think some time in the next &#x2013; in June. And then we will wait what the European Court will do with respect to probably getting oral testimony from parties sometime later this year or sometime next year. That's all we know at this moment.</p>
          <p>The European Court has decided not to give us an accelerated procedure. But we are now in an &#x2013; let's say priority procedure with the full three topics still on the docket. More than that, I can not tell you, because we don't really know more than that.</p>
          <p>With respect to, does this change the position the recent situation and the need for restructuring maybe, we don't know. We have not had any &#x2013; this is all quite fresh. We have not had any further discussions on the topic. So I can not give you an answer there.</p>
          <p>Koos &#x2013; Tom, would you like to deal with the U.S. Life?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Duncan, you asked a question on the retirement service sales in the first quarter. The full service plans, so that's where we're providing asset management and record keeping, were up just under 5%, so some improvement there. On the large end is more lumpy and there the quarter was flat to where we've been. So no big sales but good sales in full service plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you doing as well as the market, Tom, or better, worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look at the two segments that we really focus on which would be K212 and 401(k) full service plans. We have maintained market share in the fourth quarter and continue in the first quarter. The full numbers aren't out, but we think we are still where we were in terms of market share in our respective ranking of one in K212 and two in the corporate plans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Obviously, you're building up capital nicely in the bank with a core tier-1 of 8.4%. Can you talk about that excess relative to your target and what you are likely to do with that capital?</p>
          <p>Number two is can you just generically talk about the fungibility of capital in the insurance business. Clearly you have excess in the bank. What about in the insurance and the movement of that capital in insurance and the movement of that capital insurance business?</p>
          <p>And just finally, in terms of the insurance business as well, just on your closed books, can you talk about any deviation of policyholder behavior relative to your assumptions in those books, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question the capital, yes we have &#x2013; I think we are nicely building up capital in the bank. We are at 8.4, our target is about 7.5 which means that we are building excess capital. We probably will at some point move that to the holding company to have more flexibility with that capital and be in a position to either pay down debt or to use that for other purposes. As you know, we still have to repay the Dutch government and also therefore we need to build up some additional capital.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me take that one, Johnny. So if you look at the capital ratios in insurance in the U.S., the RBC ratio was up in the first quarter. I think we ended the quarter at about 390 versus about 360 in the fourth quarter last year and the overall solvency ratio on an EU Solvency 1 basis was 261.</p>
          <p>In terms of the closed book, no changes in terms of lapse or other assumptions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Brilliant. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Spencer Horgan [Deutsche Bank], please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you very much. Firstly, could I just kind of follow-up on that last question because I guess, what I thought he was getting at is there is essentially sort of 3 billion odd of capital that you could at least upstream to the holding company from the bank, if you were to take the Tier 1 dumps target, but it is not sort of quite clear what capital level you actually think this is appropriate on the insurance side. I mean, is 261% about right do you think? Maybe you could answer that by reference to the economic capital position of the insurance business at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>And then the second thing was on the net interest margin, which is you've said before you expect to normalize to about 120 basis points over time. Could you give us a sort of update on what you think the timeframe for that potential normalization is? And in particular is sort of margin on your business, if I can call that, already being written on a sort of 120 basis point margin? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think to answer in terms of the insurance capital ratios, we are clearly focused on trying to keep our capital ratios in line with where the competitors are, so you can see as I talked about in the U.S. the RBC ratio went up and overall went up. I think you're seeing that with competitors in general, just building some of the capital positions, given where we are in the cycle. So our main issue there is to have capital ratios at AA, AA minus standards, and looking to be in line with our competitors that are also increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the net interest margin, Patrick would you like to take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Spencer. If you &#x2013; as you look at the graph you can see that the interest margin in aggregate is reaching a peak. I think that we've talked about re-pricing and how that's been favorable but margins are tightening as competition comes back. So we think it's broadly as high as it's likely to go, it was 40 &#x2013; last quarter 141, and over time it will trend down to the 120. We can't give you a precise quarter-by-quarter analysis on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way -- maybe by the time that we see a decline, we also see that loan demand for this moment is quite weak. So maybe we can get an offset maybe the margin will get a little bit lower but that might be offset by more demand for loans so that I think is going to play well when the market continues to recover.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Jan Willem Weidema. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Jan Willem Weidema at Fortis Bank, Netherlands. Three questions from my end. Can you say something about development of risk costs and how you expect that to develop for the remainder of the year?</p>
          <p>Basically the same for the Netherlands -- for the NPL, sorry, and especially for the Netherlands? Will you see an increase there and what do you expect there with regard to a lag there in unemployment rates and how that affects NPLs?</p>
          <p>And thirdly how and where are you expecting to scale down your real estate development pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jan Willem, if you look at risk cost, indeed first quarter was below 500 million. Last time I gave guidance which was more on average the second half of '09. I think going forward during the next quarters, we see it somewhere in between. So lower than the second half of '09 the average but maybe a little bit higher than what we have right now. So &#x2013; and again being more refined than this is difficult because it can always be on the positive side be influenced by a release or on the negative side with one addition so, trending down again as compared to the guidance which I gave for last time.</p>
          <p>If you look at the NPLs basically we see the NPLs at the moment we have seen it kind of stabilize and given the fact that the watch list is not growing. Normally, we should assume that NPLs don't necessarily overall increase. Now you could have certain segments where you at a quarter it goes up or down but then again that is more driven by incidence. If you look at the Netherlands NPLs, that is more driven by the mortgages and the mortgages are more linked to unemployment and at the moment you don't have the indicators that you should expect a large increase on that side. And again I mean very much related to the unemployment numbers what we see.</p>
          <p>If you go to the development side, the scale down. I mean what we are doing is it's not exiting something like country-by-country. What we are looking at -- we are more looking at it project-by-project. And on some of these projects if we have &#x2013; if we foresee that the further development will be difficult then the question becomes do you write down your accrued cost or do you sell something, do you sell a lien position or do you continue to develop. And this is the way how you look at it project-by-project and there are some of these projects here you say like, well, we don't build anymore because you mean building without tenants does not make a lot of sense. And so therefore we have a bit of scrutiny.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Benoit P&#xE9;trarque. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Benoit P&#xE9;trarque, from Kepler in Amsterdam. Three questions please.</p>
          <p>The first one is on the operating expenses of the bank. I think you had 2.4 billion, what do you expect? Do you think that Q1 is a kind of normalized run rate for the rest of the year? And linked to this question actually, if you amp one cost to income ratio of 50%, I mean if we assume interest margin will normalize to 100 bps in my opinion you still need to realize quite some effort in terms of cost cutting. So do you see some potential room for further cost reduction on the bank side? And if yes, on what obviously?</p>
          <p>Then on the U.S., I see some outflow of client balances it's 1.3 billion outflow annual basis its 5 billion roughly, so can you chat a bit on that's one? And I also see outflows at 5.4 billion outflows in the asset management unit, so I will be interested to know more about that one.</p>
          <p>And on the risk weighted asset side, you said that they &#x2013; we had some decrease in risk weighted assets coming from LGD improvement, I would expect that the last part of the LGD is linked to the housing price assumptions and I do not see massive price move in the Netherlands maybe small stabilization so did you change your housing price development assumption for the Netherlands and the Benelux? If yes, is that an explanation for the LGD improvements? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we will have different people answering a number of your questions. Patrick will start with the expense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Benoit, on the expenses, although we gave you the Investor Day targets, we were targeting a 50% cost income ratio which would be getting us to a run rate of around 2.1 per quarter, if you ex-out, if you take out the impact of impairments which are reducing we are at 2.2. So we have a bit of work to do to get further down as we said, but it's not a million miles off.</p>
          <p>In respect of the margin, I think you quoted 100, we're targeting a more normalized level of 120 basis points. We're currently at 140. So we still have a bit of work to do, but we are getting closer on expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But did you figure out some room for further cost cutting on the bank side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly we have some further room particularly we want to do as we said at the Investor Day, last year we want to bring down expenses in Belgium and there are some projects planned to try and achieve that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in addition, we have a number of options in procurement and IT, plus we have the One Bank idea that we have still giving us some further opportunities to reduce our expense. We have come a long way, but I think we still have opportunities in the One Bank idea to further improve not just our cost structure, also our processes and our efficiency and our ability to generate more, I'd say, more revenues. So, there's still some more to come here.</p>
          <p>On the outflow, Tom, take that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first I think you were referring to the &#x2013; in the statistical supplement page 33. So you can see in terms of retirement plans there was a modest outflow of about 100 million in the quarter. I think quarter-to-quarter that number moves. Below that, you see the, in the two close blocks, the variable annuity and the financial products, both of those are closed blocks in run off mode, so there the net outflow was 900 million. You would expect that going forward as you run those businesses off.</p>
          <p>In terms of assets under management, you referred to 2.9 million net outflow, but we did, we sold our Taiwan insurance business to Fubon and we had a &#x2013; an agreement to manage their general account for a period of time but then that moved to Fubon and that was 5.5 billion. So outflow in that, so if you adjust for that, the 5.5 there, the net outflow of 2.9 would be a net inflow except for that of about 2.5 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the LGDs you are right that Dutch mortgages play a role there and every quarter indexes &#x2013; our following indexes we adjust, that is one of the factors contributing to the number. The other ones are of course the fact that files go from restructuring into normal again or some slight changes in the composition between retail and wholesale, but indeed this is one of the explanations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from William Elderkin [Citigroup]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I've got two questions please. First of all, could you outline the overall financial impact to ING if, say in two years time you had a formal Greek sovereign default or very substantial restructuring? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly on the insurance side can you give us a sense of how far through that re-risking process you've got in terms of shifting asset excess liquidity and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we start on the Greek part its an interesting question, because you say if it's done in two years, so then implicitly you could say like well, does the bond get restructured which have a two year maturity or not because we have a total portfolio in Greek of three billion and if you expect for instance a 20% haircut then you normally think about 600 million at the same time that does not necessarily need to be case because if it happens in two years you have already a roll off the Greek exposure as well. So it's difficult to give a direct answer to it but overall I would say it's a manageable number what we see there.</p>
          <p>If you talk about the other part, the re-risking on the insurance side, I mean gradually we have re-risked something in the European segment where we have invested a little bit more than what we have done in the past. But at the same time if you look at the U.S. portfolio that is a bit more that what I mentioned the precision surgery de-risking that we are still doing, not affecting margins big time but just using opportunistically a good market at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow-up on two things? First on the Greek issue, your answer referred, I think, just to the specific sovereign exposures. Given such a scenario, would there be any another negative implications for wider loan exposures within the bank, for example?</p>
          <p>And secondly I didn't get a sense from your comments in terms of the re-risking how much more sort of commercial incremental earnings we can expect to come through once the asset allocation reaches the target level, if you like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I find it in general difficult question to answer wider implications, because if I look at total Greek exposure, I mean how wide do you want to look at it? I mean in general, we have our Greek government bond exposure but in the rest I mean if you look at corporate or financial institutions it's actually is not significant number. So therefore yeah, this is not one of our major issues to be honest.</p>
          <p>If you ask like the re-risking part on the insurance side &#x2013; I am sorry, yeah, so the &#x2013; gradually there will be some re-risking and I think there are some opportunities. We see it in the corporate bond part. We also like to make sure that we do little bit solvency to prove everything as well. So yes, there are some opportunities to re-risk and we will continue to do so over the year but we do it with a gradual approach.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much indeed, couple of issues. Just I don't know whether anywhere in the disclosure there is a quantification of the -- on the sales numbers of this Dutch pension recognition? If so, could you sort of help me through what it is and how that works?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the Greek &#x2013; on the sort of the exposure to sun-belt European corporate bonds which I think we have to call it now. Could you tell me, how much is cross-border in the sense that it is bonds held by a unit of yours that is not in the relevant country?</p>
          <p>And finally, yeah, you talked about how some of the Japanese COLI sales were related to the end of the tax year. I mean, can you give us some picture of how much that is in &#x2013; how much &#x2013; how exceptional it is, quantification?</p>
          <p>And finally, just what is the story behind ING Direct USA's profits? Can you help me with that? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Chris with regards to the cross border exposures I would rather refer to the Pillar 3 disclosure we have given at the end of the year and what you have seen then for instance is we have given the more significant exposures per country, but I don't think Greece made the cut there. So it's not even on there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll take the COLI question, so the COLI sales, there are tax advantages. The fiscal year in Japan for most companies is March 31 and so they are &#x2013; from &#x2013; since they are corporate tax driven, there tends to be a spike at the end of the fiscal year. So you saw that in the first quarter. We would certainly expect year-over-year okay sales in the second quarter but they will be below the first quarter, because of the year end effect in the first quarter or March 31, close.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Farquhar Murray. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. It' Farquhar, Autonomous Research. Just two questions if I may. I mean, firstly with regards to the risk-weighted asset development. I mean you've essentially seen a negative 2 billion of rating migration. I just wondered whether you'd go as far as saying that you're over the hill on that kind of impact or was the quarter slightly peculiar and we should just continue to expect positive rating migrations next through this year?</p>
          <p>Then turning to the kind of big Portugal and Spain topic, just to try and finish this one off, could we just get the loan book exposures? I know I have looked at your Pillar 3 disclosures, but they seem to be <mark type="inaudible" /> help? Those are my questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the risk-weighted assets indeed we have the 2 billion RWA increase and that comes out of the prime U.S. portfolio. Prime U.S. portfolio in the bank is very small. I think there is only 1 billion left, so that part, the prime is not going to give the huge amount of RWA increases. I think on the Alt-A it has already migrated a lot so indeed a bit the ABS RWA increases are going to level off by the sheer fact that all of them have already migrated. So in that sense there is not going to be a big issue about this.</p>
          <p>If you look at are we already expecting a lot of positive RWA migration over time that will come because then LGDs, NPDs will start to improve on the loan book which is a significant one and that will start to improve, but at the same time what we have said is also in line with the guidance on the loan loss provisions. It will start to edge off gradually, but not something very, very quickly.</p>
          <p>If you look at the cross broader exposures in general, yeah, we have on exposure on Portugal, we have exposures on Spain and Greek. Spain and Greek are relatively small. Portugal, that's where we are a bit more sizable, I mean we have a 20 billion local balance sheet as well -- sorry, Spain has a relatively sizeable because we have Spanish operation and we have basically a liability side in Spain of 20 billion as well.</p>
          <p>So overall yeah, we do have a Spanish exposure in terms of for instance bonds, we have it in financials. We have it in the schedule loss and in general with more mortgages backed with mortgages with LTVs of around 50% so high end, the better quality exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But are you willing to give any numbers on that, just in aggregate?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the only thing is on the loan book and really booked as loans there is 7 billion portfolio of mortgages and it is in the corporate side. It's approximately 7 billion as well and there you are talking about utilities. You're talking about transportation and you're talking about the real estate finance part. Those are the predominant asset classes.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Thomas Nagtegaal. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thomas Nagtegaal, RBS. I've got two questions. First of all on page 26 of your presentation the VA cost of guarantees in Q1 above long-term interest rates and equity markets were higher still the cost of guarantees were higher as well. So what's driving that? Is it bullish behavior or anything else?</p>
          <p>And second question on your balance sheet, there seem to be some one-offs and FX there, what do you believe would be the annual underlying increase of the balance sheet you have currently in there and given the fact that the leverage ratio is up of course as well and is that developments which were issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Matt Rider. Maybe I talk a little bit about the cost of the VA guarantees. It's actually a combination of a couple of things. We did see lower short-term interest rates in the first quarter and that's driving part of that. But also you'll recall that we had some policyholder behavior assumption changes last year which are now working their way through the notional amount. So that is causing an increase in the hedge costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of the balance sheet, there was some FX movements as the dollar strengthened. We hedge obviously &#x2013; we hedge our core Tier 1 ratio, so it's stable for FX, but not the total balance sheet. Leverage ratio moved up to 1%, but it's comfortably within our range of 25 to 30. So we are relaxed about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Farooq Hanif [Morgan Stanley], please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there just again on slide 26, I didn't quite understand what duration of yield curve is more important? I would have thought that it's longer term if you are using swaptions to hedge and what impact does volatility have on that cost of guarantee? I get the point about policyholder behavior, but I don't understand the yield curve point. That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is going back to this target of margin going up, the investment margin going up in the insurance business. What level of &#x2013; again, what duration of yield do we need to be more interested in, most interested in when we are looking at the yield curve to give us an idea of what you are investing into?</p>
          <p>And then similar question on the net interest margin, going back to 120 basis points, I know you've talked about it before, but can you remind us again how much of that is just competition and regulation, the external factors and how much is the shape of the yield cure normalizing to some shape and which countries and which yields curves are you most sensitive to? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I take the first one again on the hedge cost, I think you'll recall that we hedge interest rates only to limited extent so it's more on the short end of the yield curve where we see working through the hedge costs. Certainly the value of the guarantees is affected by longer term interest rates. We tend to look at something like a 7 to 10 year interest rate to look at that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Farooq on your question on interest margins or investor margins in the insurance portfolio, we said two things at the investor day and we still stay with those which is that the general account should grow over time at 4% and that our margin should increase over time as we gradually re-risk from 85 basis points to 105. In terms of the approximate duration of the liabilities on the insurance side, it varies quite a bit by country and type of business, but overall blended in the eight year range is probably a good sense for sort of the duration on the liability side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you &#x2013; sorry, just to go back on that particular point, if we had a steepening of the curve then you would potentially be able to lock in higher margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the bank, we are targeting 120 basis points to be &#x2013; to derive over time. That's primarily euro and it's primarily coming down due to competition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you picked that number, is that something you modeled or is it just look, let's pick a number that we think is reasonable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of looking back over time to see where margins were in the past and actually when we were back to the investor day, we actually modeled a number a little lower to give us a little bit of a cushion. But the 120 is fundamentally where we see -- where the mix of business will come out at. We also, you will recall, while we see margins going down and Jan mentioned it, we also predicted &#x2013; expect that we will see economy improving over the period to 2013 and we are looking for an average 5% loan growth as well. And we still believe that there is plenty of capacity for that to happen before 2013 so the NII will be a combination of margins coming down from elevated levels but still reasonably high 220 but back the fire volumes at those higher levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Tony Silverman. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Tony Silverman from Standard and Poor's Equity Research. I just had two questions, please. Firstly on the banking side, the rise in interest margins over previous quarters, I wonder if you could talk a bit about whether that's from funding costs or loan re-pricing and perhaps more importantly when looking at margins tightening as you mentioned over the next few quarters, shall we say. Again if you could talk about whether that's coming from funding costs or loan re-pricing?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the market impacts of zero in insurance that were mentioned, it was mentioned that was the sum of some larger numbers, I may have missed it but it's be interesting to hear what some of those larger numbers that netted out were? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the interest margin I mean the &#x2013; this will gradually decline over time. We're seeing the &#x2013; if you'll recall, in the crises, spreads on the commercial side widened significantly. We re-priced and that helped improve so we see competition coming back which will diminish those spreads and we think they are tightening now.</p>
          <p>On the other side, the strengthening of the retail margin through 2009 was supported by &#x2013; on the interest side where some of the distortions, particularly in the Dutch market have abated over time. So the widening spreads are a combination of widening loans spreads, and an improved deposit margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You also asked a question on the market impacts for insurance that netted to zero, so there are some pluses and minuses, as we said and you said, that are in the range of 50 million plus or minus. So just to give you some sense on the positive side was the in the Netherlands the separate account shortfall changes that were positive and then there was some DAC unlocking on the U.S. side including the not writing up the DAC on the variable annuity business. So those all &#x2013; and a number of &#x2013; a few other things all netted to zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If I can just come back on the profile of the interest margin, so you are saying it will tighten going forward both due to funding costs and do you see any change in loan re-pricing or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we are saying is that competition will come back in on the commercial side. We're seeing that already. So you will not see any widening, perhaps some narrowing of spreads on the commercial loan side, that will be primary driver. Currently &#x2013; we don't see deposit interest rates going up at the moment. So in the near term the deposit margin profile should broadly be the same but as primary competition in the commercial loan side which could tighten margins in the near term, medium term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Omar Fall [UBS]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just had four questions on the bank if I may? Firstly can you give some color on why there was such a big decline in operational RWAs in the quarter please, the 5 billion, since that's the biggest positive driver of the RWAs being stable? Are those model changes or what is that?</p>
          <p>And secondly coming back on Spain, at the end of last year, according to your annual report, it looks like you had something more like 50 billion in Spanish loans so without putting you on the spot, can you expand a bit more on, what is in there ex- the 7 billion of mortgages and commercial loans, especially as it seems provisions on that have been pretty minimal?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, can you update us on where you would stand on some of the liquidity and funding measures being proposed under Basel III, which I guess is a pretty key concern for the sector, so the net fair stable funding ratio for example?</p>
          <p>And then finally just to help us on the net interest margin, if you could maybe just give us a very vague split across the Group &#x2013; sorry, across the bank, how much of the net NIM comes from the asset side and how much comes from the deposit side? Just a very vague split? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First on the RWAs of operational risk, indeed it went down. It's a model change. If you look at operational risk capital and you compare that to, for instance the total risk weighted assets of most of the financial institutions in Europe then you find that our operational risk capital was higher as a component than most of the other banks. So a recalibration of the model happened.</p>
          <p>Second point if you look at the Spanish exposure in our Pillar 3 what we have seen is &#x2013; I don't recall the 50. 38 is something which I do recognize and there indeed we have mortgages, we have commercial loans, we have a bond portfolio, collateralized bond portfolio. So there is various compositions which are part of this total and again it is partially to serving as an asset base for our Spanish ING Direct unit and partially it's part of the investment pool of the other countries.</p>
          <p>If you look at liquidity and funding overall, we are a bank which has a loan to deposit ratio which is very sufficient. At the same time, what we are always keen on is we hope that with the new liquidity measures that eligibility criteria which are applied in Basel that they stay wide enough to give the market enough breathing room there, but for the rest we are not the primary bottleneck but a secondary consequence could be that you have more fight for our savings money and we like to keep it ourselves. That's basically it on the liquidity part.</p>
          <p>So then we go back to the net interest margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net interest margin, I think the breakdown that you asked for, we don't have available here at this moment. So we cannot answer that question right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. There appears to be no further questions. Please continue with any other points you wish to raise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, then I think we like to close the meeting and thank you all for attending. To repeat, a good quarter, encouraging progress that we made in all parts of our businesses, performance of both the bank and the insurer, I think we're very pleased with so far. But we will continue to be vigilant because we are not out of the woods yet. The markets are still quite volatile and we want to be sure that we can continue to report good numbers.</p>
          <p>Important part for this year is the separation of the bank and the insurance company and that one is on schedule and we hope to be done by the end of the year completely so that we have the ability then to set the insurance company in the market whenever markets are attractive and willing to do so.</p>
          <p>And let me now say that again, thank you, again and have a good day.</p>
