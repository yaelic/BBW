          <p>Thank you very much.  Good morning, everybody. It's really a pleasure to be here with you today. First of all, I don't like really to talk about past. But let's talk a little bit about '07. '07 was a bumpy-road year, we have a lot of problems, we have a lot of targets to be overcome. I think we were able to deliver a very good result.</p>
          <p>The beginning of '07, the first quarter was a disaster in terms of performance. We had a lot of problems with rain, with social movement to destructing our roads and we have problems with cost, with supply, with a lot of things, et cetera, et cetera. But during the year we improved our operations, the last quarter was really very strong.</p>
          <p>This first quarter of '08 is going to be much better than it was last year. I think we invest a lot money in automation, improve our facilities, improve our personnel, in terms of training, in terms of processes et cetera. So '07 was a very nice and very good year in terms of results, we achieved records in almost every single operation in terms of results. The investments, we had some problems with our licensees, we had problems with permits, but anyhow we could &#x2013; we were able to deliver all the investments that we were supposed to realize.</p>
          <p>So I'm very happy with the results. I think the team worked very, very well. We finalized that their position with income. The first quarter of '07, the integration is going very well. The Inco's result was very good and I think it's completely stable. Of course, we had some problems. We faced some problems in Inco in terms of maintenance, in terms of the reliability of the operations, but we assessed it a lot and I think '08 is going to be much better than it was '07.</p>
          <p>In terms of market, the market is still very strong, was very strong last year. I think for '08, the demand is still very, very strong with China and Japan, in Middle East, in Europe, everything is going very well. Brazil is growing, the demand is growing here. I think what I have in mind, what is concerning me right now is only the projects.</p>
          <p>We needed to really to invest to pay attention about the costs, about the schedule of the investments, and you know that is not going to be &#x2013; is not easy or it hasn't been easy to overcome all these challenges as you have to realize that all the investments that we have are in our pipeline. But, anyhow '07 was good, I think was a record year.  '07 was maybe worse than is going to be '08. I'm very optimistic that we are going to have or to realize a very nice and very sound year in '08.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to ask Fabio Barbosa to talk a little bit about past and then I'll be very happy to answer any questions you may have later on. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roger. Good morning to all of you attending the conference. Thank you very much for that. Let's start with our performance in 2007 as we get there, we believe that's the second consecutive year for Vale after a great year in 2006. That's we call interest and now we are repeating the same label because we do believe that was a great year for our company. It's an outstanding operational performance with nine production records and outstanding financial performance as you can see in the 70-K that we put there.</p>
          <p>As for iron ore, we would like to stress the fact that we are the only player with global reach. Actually we are in all the five continents and last year we reached a record production of almost 296 million tons and the shipment of 296.4 million tons. We are the largest supplier and legal supplier to China, and which is the most dynamic market that we have today.</p>
          <p>And again, we were able to negotiate a very satisfactory price increase with our clients for both finds in the southeastern and southern systems and the high quality ore of Caraj&#xE1;s. So we are happy with the outcome, we believe that was a very satisfactory agreement between the parties ensuring or stressing again the long-term nature of our relationship with our clients. So that's a very important segment that we conveyed the markets.</p>
          <p>As we look at our performance in the last five years, we did deliver a very strong result. Our net earnings grew average per year 66.2%, and our EBIT margin jumped from 30.7% to 44.2% despite the cost pressure that we have been facing associated in particular with the long cycle, the appreciation of the currencies and the efficient cost as you could appreciate in our release.</p>
          <p>Our operational margins are very strong, ferrous minerals, 47.9%; non-ferrous minerals, 47.1%; aluminum 31.2%; and logistics, 34%, so a very good performance across the board in our operations in 2007 making this as again as I mentioned before a vintage year for our company.</p>
          <p>In terms of EBITDA, excluding the effect of the non-cash adjustment of inventories, EBITDA reached $60.8 billion and also a growth rate of around 57.7% per year over the last five years, a very strong performance and a composition changed to reflect acquisition of Inco and now non-ferrous minerals are representing 43.2% of total cash flow, ferrous minerals 47.3, aluminum 5.8.</p>
          <p>If we put together aluminum and non-ferrous there, we would have almost an equal split between ferrous and all non-ferrous material that we have in our portfolio. So it's a very good balance exposing the company in an equal way to the bulk and the volatile LME markets in our products.</p>
          <p>As for evolution for EBITDA, we have growth of $4.5 billion compared to 2006, and of course prices were a major driver, volumes as well given the increase in our production and then we invested more in research and development, we had some non-cash adjustments. We faced the challenge of coping with the cost inflation that is offset, has been offset in our operation, mining operations around the world as you can see and of course the appreciation of the currency that implied a major impact in our cash flow.</p>
          <p>Although as we mentioned before, our margins were up and reasonably a very sound figure in terms of consolidated margins. Another point that we like to make and these are the major challenges when we acquired Inco in 2006 was the fact that we did leave again what we promised in terms of de-leveraging the company and at the same time keeping the remuneration to our shareholders in line with expectations.</p>
          <p>So in 2006 we invested $20.6 billion, 2007 we just pushed $11 billion in CapEx. At the same time our dividend per share reached $0.39 growth accumulated growth rate of 26.8% in a period that Vale invested very heavily in the expansion of its operation and also have a very important acquisitions program.</p>
          <p>So we're able to combine a very aggressive CapEx program with a strong dividend payments to our shareholders and at the same time with a very sound balance sheet with our total debt EBITDA coming back to the same level it was in 2005, the first part of 2005, after the acquisition of Inco by the end of 2006. So after reaching two times EBITDA in 2006, our total debt to EBITDA is now 1.1, a very comfortable position at the end and at the same time, we took advantage of the various favorable market and were able to improve sharply the profile of our debt structure.</p>
          <p>I believe that another important note would be on the capability to generate value to acquisition growth as we put them in Page 13. And the fact that we did have a very successful integration of Vale, Inco in operations. It was a major challenge for our company considering debt wasasage, the first major international acquisition of our company I feel that was based on a Brazilian company.</p>
          <p>We are able to combine operations to keep the production inline with the project and we delivered very strong results, at the same time we enjoyed a much better environment that we anticipated by the time that we made our offer. So we are very happy, very fortunate to see this very good combination of good integration &#x2013; good integration and a much better than expected market to our products.  And I believe that this was a remarkable achievement for our company.</p>
          <p>We feel that we delivered what our shareholders expected from us with a record nickel production of 247 and 900 net response in 2007 with the new projects in the Sudbury basin for instant starting that as the first project in the business in the last 30 years. That increase in reserves in Sudbury was great indeed that we announced during our investor tour in May, last May or June. And the capability to explore the synergies in the Sudbury basin, the global procurement in play and the mineral exploration that we now have a global mineral exploration office.</p>
          <p>I think that most emblematic, the most emblematic aspect of this integration is the status of implementation of gold or the development of gold. It was a very challenging project, if you maybe &#x2013; if you all recall anything today, we had some bad news in the press about the project either with the communities, or the government, or the permits.  The fact that the project disappeared from the press, not negative press but its just effect.</p>
          <p>So we were able to implement the project and in Page 14 you have our comparison between December 2006 and 2007, it's amazing what we were able to achieve in just 12 months, and the project is on track to reach the startup at the first half of last October and production, we will start by the end of 2008. That's impressive, a very large project, and we &#x2013; again, we are delivering what we promised.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to mention that in 2007 again we ranked at first as a global leader in terms of total shareholders returns when we compared the last five years ended in 2007 with 73.7% of TSR is undisputed leader in the mining industry as &#x2013; in terms of total shareholder return.</p>
          <p>We are very happy with the outcome and if you look at the other ranks with &#x2013; comparing with the large cap companies, we also performed extremely, extremely well. It means that the right strategy was met, the right environment, and the right execution. So, we are able to deliver value to our shareholders over all these years and I believe that our market cap is reflecting that at this stage.</p>
          <p>A brief comment on the corporate social responsibility activities.  We are very keen on using a safer place to work. So we have been working very hard and not happy yet, but we were able to sharply reduce lost time, injury frequency rates by 31% decline &#x2013; by 31%, a sharp decline and but we are not happy yet.  It's something that Roger is personally involved and very focused on that and he keeps asking every single week about our performance, so this is actually something that is in our daily agenda and our operations as well. And in terms of investments and corporate social responsibilities, our social projects absorbed $251 million last year and environmental protection activities $400 million. In the period between 2008 and 2012 we are going to invest $4.2 billion, almost $4.2 billion in those activities, again a record sum to be invested in those areas.</p>
          <p>Trying to our drive our share here and talking about the future, let's move to Page 21 and I think these first charts are very interesting, one, because its positions, they reference the end of July 1st, 2007. And July is the month where lets say the major turbulences associated with the subprime started. And as you can see there, in the red line, Vale shares really picked up from the performance of the old equities and also the statistic performance of our sector in the MSCI Metals &amp; Mining meaning that we're actually able to show market and markets were able to perceive that we were in the midst of something of a different nature but the company has a very good strategic plan, has a very good environment to work with and was delivering the result in markets we are expecting. And in a way, this price evolution indicated that market didn't bide the perception that there will be a major deceleration in the global economy with negative effects on those specific markets. And if you turn to Page 22 you see that this is something that is evidenced by the numbers, if we take into consideration previous episodes of deceleration of the global growth.</p>
          <p>At the end of 80s, early 90s where we had a reduction for the water climate growth below 3% per year and then in the late 80s, 1990,1991 there was a clear decline in the metal prices, the combined metal prices. The same happened after the Asian crisis and with the deceleration that followed into 1998,1999 and then the technological bubble in 2001 after September 11 as well, so metals they are in a way sort of leading the status of metal prices leading the cases of deceleration of the economy if we can say that, and Page 23, its in more detail is the same argument.</p>
          <p>So we see the combination of Page 22 and Page 23, the message here is that there is no single time of deceleration of the world economy that would affect in a meaningful way our market to the various countries.  Prices are very steady.</p>
          <p>If we look at the latest figures for nickel, aluminum and copper, we see they are reaching record levels, this week, this very week.  Not for nickel that reached a higher level last year but its really aluminum and copper are in a very, very high level. And in the case of iron ore, even after the assessment of the benchmark prices, the spot prices did not decline. So Indian iron ore is being traded at $215 per ton and the Chinese iron ore, is spot market, $204.</p>
          <p>The same goes for metallurgical coal, the coking coal, hard coking coal, clearly the spot prices &#x2013; clearly decoupled from the contract prices indicate a very strong market. And this is in a way a concern that we have due to the associated demand of hard coking coal and iron ore. So if there is an absolute discard of hard coking coal it could affect in a way our iron ore sales as hard coking coal is also required to produce steel.</p>
          <p>This performance of the commodities is of course associated with the change the world economy particularly driven by the emerging market economies, that's a massive process of urbanization and industrialization. So this is what makes this cycle longer, stronger, and different from previous shorter cycles that we see in the last few years.</p>
          <p>So we don't believe that what's happening right now is a reversal of this trend, actually we believe that its just a small adjustment, a short-term adjustment that would not change the long-term trend of very solid growth of the market, and particularly of the economies, the emerging market economies.  And if you look at the chart at Page 27, you will see a very interesting comparison. As China is the major driver of this market today, as you may appreciate, we are trying to figure what would happen to the Chinese economy considering what happened there after the deceleration of the US economy.</p>
          <p>So we see that clearly, small economies like Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, they were affected, sharply affected by a deceleration of the US economy that is more or less in 2001. But at the same time, we see that the Chinese economy kept its steady growth rate and actually it increased the growth rate in the following year. So it's not clear at all that a deceleration in the US economy will be able to revert a very sound set of macro economic policies that is put in place in China, that is allowing the country to grow at adjusted rates as its grown in the last few weeks.</p>
          <p>And another aspect of this comment is that, if you turn to Page 28 you see that the bulk of the growth, the Chinese GDP growth is associated with a domestic demand. It's not export driven. So of course nobody if you have right mind to say that will be unaffected. The economy will not be affected by this US economy slowdown. But we have to measure this a second, and not assume that will be a major change in economy that has a different set of fundamentals in place. So if we look at the growth that took place in the last 30 years, we see that as the bulk of the GDP growth in China is determined by domestic demand and this trend should continue in our view.</p>
          <p>And in Page 29, we indicate our forecast for the next five years saying that, okay, we may have a deceleration in 2008, where Chinese GDP growth would not grow 11.4 but just 10.4%. But it is again an impressive figure by any standard and we are indicating a deceleration of this growth rate up to 8.6% by the end of the period in 2010. So by any measure, it's a very solid environment and that's why we have this very strong pipeline of project that we comment on later on.</p>
          <p>As for the global GDP, of course, the weight of the US economy should bring down the average growth rate of the world economy. So the world economy should grow 3.6% is our expectation, but look at this <mark type="inaudible" /> with accumulative growth rate as we indicate there in the same chart of 1970, 2006. It's coincident with the long-term growth rate of this period. So a very long period.</p>
          <p>So again in the very year that we have the major adjustment determined by the sub prime, what we will reach in terms of growth is that growth that is similar with the long-term trade of the world economy, well above the growth of the world population. So it's a benign environment anyway and it may be less benign this year, but is a benign scenario this year and then the former years as well.</p>
          <p>In our view, China has to remain as a main driver of global materials demand, indicated there in Page 31 that China should represent 54% of the iron ore consumption <mark type="inaudible" />, and nickel, 31%; aluminum, 41%; and copper, 30%, and look where they were in 2000. So it's a transformation that is taking place in an economy that will actually change the world.</p>
          <p>If the demand is so strong, we do have some issues on the supply side and this is part of the equation that we must discuss with you that is the fact that we have no doubt that the markets will remain very strong for the next few years. But there are a lot of uncertainties associated with the supply side. So, if you look at the pipeline of projects of several players, you see that in some cases there is a lack of large-scale, world-class projects in statistic markets, making difficult to adjust the supply in the short-term.</p>
          <p>The so-called easy discoveries are done. So, we have to look now for more challenging resources that involve higher cost of operation and higher CapEx cost as well. Natural resources nationally, this is a phenomenon that's of course largely to happen in an environment where commodities are benefiting from this long cycle. So it's natural to have more discussion and debate about this, but this has an effect on the availability of resources to be explored and developed.</p>
          <p>The same goes for environmental permits, that's a worldwide phenomenon in terms of getting tougher to get those permits. Delaying projects in some cases make some projects impossible to develop. In other cases, so it's an issue that is faced by every single mining company today. Higher CapEx cost and shortages, of course, is still labeled in technological challenges. So, it's not evident that supply will be able to catch up with the demand over the next few years.</p>
          <p>And in Page 33, you have our pipeline of projects. And we have 30 major projects that's been our production over the next few years in the several businesses that we operate. I will not comment in each one of them, but I just call your attention that the size of the pipeline -- so we do have a great option in pursuing organic growth for our company. And in this year, 2008, we are going to deliver seven major projects.</p>
          <p>Just a reminder, the last five years we delivered 20 large projects. In this year, we will deliver seven large projects. Iron ore falling down with the 50.8 million tons per year at two pelletizing plants, <mark type="inaudible" /> and the former ADR and now San Marco as well, 7.3 million tons.</p>
          <p>The Goro project, which is 60,000 tons of nickel, and 4,600 tons of cobalt, the second stage of Paragominas is an additional 4.5 million tons per year, Alumina, Alunorte, 1.9 million tons per year of addition, and of additional production in copper, the hydro metallurgical plant of copper in Caraj&#xE1;s that will test this technology, that will enable us possibly to explore other deposits by depletion with a 10,000 tons per year capacity. So again, we are delivering what we promised on time. Sometimes we are not very on budget, but we are delivering what we actually promised you a few years ago.</p>
          <p>And if you look at the next page, Page 35, you will see that we were early deliverers in the duration and the strength of the cycle. So that's why we are able to deliver the value, the TSR that we commented a few minutes ago. We have been growing our production at 11.6 average rate in the period 2003-2007. It was one of the most, if not the most dynamic player, in the metals and mining industry. And our strategic plan will allow us to keep the same trend with the growth of our production in both greenfield and brownfield projects of almost 11% per year.</p>
          <p>So, we should reach in 2008 a capacity of 325 million tons in iron ore for Uinta basin of course pellets; nickel, 280,000 tons; copper 300,000 tons; alumina 5.3 million tons and coal 5.6 million tons, remarkable growth rate for the volumes.</p>
          <p>And finally in Page 37, you'll see our production profile in 2012 is a production by the end of 2012 of 450 million tons of iron ore, in 2012 we should produce 422, pellets 55 million tons, nickel 507,000 tons, doubling our capacity from current &#x2013; last year's production.</p>
          <p>The same goes for copper.  We are doubling our capacity 2012, alumina 8.2 million tons and finally coal with 15 billion tons. So it's a very strong pipeline of projects, and growth that is embedded in our strategy.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And myself and Roger Agnelli will be at your disposal to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Before that I would like to make some comments about M&amp;A. I think everybody is curious about what we are doing, or to what we haven't been doing. We always, we have been saying that our priorities are organic growth and is going to continue to be organic growth, our priority.</p>
          <p>Of course we believe that this cycle and you saw that Fabio Barbosa is really bullish about the future of our industry, and I include myself in this point of view. I'm really bullish about the market in the coming years. And of course, we can't close our eyes to what's going on in the industry, in terms of consolidation, in terms of M&amp;A transactions. You remember that we have been buying a lot of companies in the last five, six years and we tried to acquire other assets and we couldn't be successful in this, in two or three transactions.  But anyhow, we are always open and we are always analyzing opportunities.</p>
          <p>You remember that three years ago or four years ago we were talking with Noranda guys regarding to their Falconbridge asset. We couldn't reach an agreement at that time, but right after that we bought Inco, which is a much better asset than Falconbridge. And of course Falconbridge is a very nice asset also, but Inco for us in terms of value, in terms of results, it seems to be much better than that.</p>
          <p>Later on last year, we bid for ALCA, Rio Tinto bought it, great, congratulations for them but we don't regret because we have limits to what we are able to pay, and we reached our limit, isn't that great, so I don't regret about that. So it's best.</p>
          <p>Right now we think that Xstrata is a very nice fit for our future strategy. They have a very nice asset, we are bullish on copper market, we are bullish in met coal market, thermal coal also. Nickel, we are really bullish, we are bullish about iron ore. So if we can, or if we could combine these assets, we are going to create a very strong, and very nice and very growth-oriented company, because we have a huge pipeline of projects. This is our priority, to deliver all these projects in the right time.</p>
          <p>So Xstrata is in the press, everybody is talking about that.  Of course we are interested, we are open to continue to analyze the possibility. We made indicative proposal. Of course there are three parts involved in this negotiation.</p>
          <p>One is Glencore, which has 35% of the Xstrata shares. Another one is Xstrata, and another one is Vale. Glencore, we have a very good relationship. I'm a very close friend of Ivan, and we have been such that for a while right now. They are very good, they are traders, they are very successful. Ivan has a very nice and very good strategical orientation, he knows exactly what he is looking for. The same thing for Mick Davis, the CEO, the Xstrata CEO. I admire him very much. He is very good, he has been doing a very good job to put together several assets and create this very strong company, Xstrata.</p>
          <p>They have a very good team, very good people there. They have the knowledge, they have a very good operation, it's not a high-cost operation. So for us, Vale seems to be a very nice and very good and very sound feet and that can really strengths our position in the mining industry.</p>
          <p>We have been discussing that we have limits, we achieved our limits.  The problem is that Glencore must to or can agree with that, or not. We depend on the Glencore's position to continue to discuss, to continue to build this transaction. Xstrata, of course depends on the Glencore's position to go ahead with the transaction. But anyhow, we are right now in a position that we achieved our limits, we are very disciplined, we are not in a rush to buy or to acquire any assets, but if makes sense, if it's good for our growth strategy, if it's good to strengthen our position in the market, we are always open to buy new good problems to solve in the future.</p>
          <p>We have a very strong pipeline of projects, so this is our priority.  We are really focused, we are really committed to realize to delivery all these projects, so we are not in a rush to buy anything. Only if it makes sense, only if we can add value for our shareholders, always I discuss with my team that we must be really very disciplined, we can't just jump into the &#x2013; in a very exciting period of M&amp;A, and we needed to be disciplined because we are a long-term mining company.  We are not short-term mining company.</p>
          <p>So what we wanted to buy is asset quality, people quality, knowledge, technology, and market position. So, Xstrata.  If we become successful to realize this transaction is good, if not it's not good also.</p>
          <p>I can tell you that it's really very difficult to overcome all the issues that we have there, but we keep trying to solve that or to clean up all the issues, all the obstacles.  We have problems with &#x2013; going to press that we have been investing a lot of time in to see how we can overcome all these issues, but okay, we are hoping we have enough energy to continue to continue to discuss if they want.  If they don't want, is okay also.  But it is in their position to see if they want to go ahead or not.</p>
          <p>But again, this is not our single option, we keeping analyzing all the options. I told you that we are bullish on copper, we are bullish on coal, we are bullish on nickel, and this is our core business. We are a mining company, we are focused on asset quality, we are continue to be very disciplined to give priority to the organic growth and that's what we are going to do.</p>
          <p>Okay, I'm glad to answer any questions you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Felipe Hirai with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone and thanks for the clarification on Xstrata and the great outlook on the metal prices. So my first question is regarding the cost as we saw a significant cost increase in the quarter, can you comment on how you are managing to control your cost and if you're increasing your hedging activities aside from the payroll in Brazil that we saw that you, for the first time you announced were somehow hedging your costs, and what kind of cost increase can we expect for 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, thank you for your question, and I think we did have an effect in cost both in SG&amp;A and the cost of goods sold, of salaries. But this is associated with a very important change in our relationship with the Brazilian workers, that corresponds to about 75% of our labor force, that we are now able for the first time, a Brazilian company was able to settle an agreement with the legal force for two years. So if you will recall, we postponed previously our labor agreement used to end in July. So last year, 2006, we extended it to November. So it was 15 months or 16 months, and now we settle for 24 months. So this was associated with a salary increase, a phenomenal salary increase of 7% but I believe that, what is clear was a very such factor, an arrangement that will increase the predictability of our disbursement and this very important item, of our cost.</p>
          <p>So there was in a way a specific cost associated with the discussion. Also as you know, we changed our brands and so the branding effort consumed $50 million roughly at the end of the fourth quarter of '07 and affected SG&amp;A. In terms of outsourced services, we did have an increase associated with the change of tracks in some of our railroads, in particular Carajas Railroad, the poor quality of tracks that we have to replace. They are not resisting the volumes that we are transporting, so we spend a little bit more. The furnace in El Brasa that we have to replace, some issues in the potash operations. Also, I would like to highlight the fact that we consolidated TNIC, a Taiwanese subsidiary that was not under US GAAP consolidation procedures. We consolidated it in the fourth quarter of '07, and this brought of course, costs that were not included previously. We had in terms of other expenditures, I would like to point out that the establishment of our shared service center. That's a major change in the way we manage our company. It may represent an additional cost now, but we believe that the cost per transaction of the shared service center will be much lower than the current structure. So if you are able to support the operations on a worldwide global basis, and we do hope that this will represent a structural reduction in our cost moving forward.</p>
          <p>So I would say that relative &#x2013; of course the exchange rate is also affected of course, but I would say that we are able, we are not happy yet with the costs that we face, we are fighting every single day to reduce them, we are changing for instance from our costs, to in-source some services that were previously in the market. We are very active in this area, we are not simply waiting for the results, but we have to recognize as well that it's a very tough environment because no only the currency is appreciating, but they all are competitors that searching for the same services, contractors, equipment, and things are more expensive, things are more expensive. So this is a challenge that we will continue to face over the next <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add some comments about energy.  Energy is going to be, and is a very tough issue for everybody in the industry and for everybody, consumers worldwide. The price is going up and I feel that it's going to be a major problem for everybody in the industry. You know that we have been building several hydro power plants. We are going to invest in thermal power plants also, in order to have a hedge in terms of costs for us. So I think we have a small part of our consumption, hedged by our own operations. Of course we are making a lot of cash in our hydro power plant right now.  For the future, you know that we bought several areas here in Brazil to explore gas. Gas maybe is going to be another alternative for us in the future to supply our needs for energy. Another portion of that went up sharply and is still growing is oil, diesel. The oil price in the market is going up.  Yesterday, it was $102 per barrel, so oil and diesel is really an issue for us, so we are, as you know, we develop a technological center and Sanchos Verstop in S&#xE3;o Paulo State to find out new processes or new ways to produce cheap energy and clean energy also.  So we are working hard to solve this problem for long-term, not only for a short-term, but long-term. Another issue is this part of spare parts and everything that is related to steel, as steel price went up last year sharply and is still growing due to maybe the cost and the demand that the market has today. So we feel that still affected almost everything in terms of cost because this spare part mainly is made by steel. So anyhow last year we invest roughly $60 million in automation. I think that in '08 we are going to re-state all the investment that we made the last year. In Inco operations, we have sharply cost increase due to the upgrade of several plants that we see and we feel that we needed to bring to the level that we are confident that we are comfortable with and some facilities, some plans weren't in a very good shape.</p>
          <p>So we invest a lot of money, including automation loss and we are continuing to invest this year in automation. What I would like to say is that our target is to be or to become a benchmark in terms of cost in two years and we are expanding, we are investing, we are even increasing some cost to realize or to delivery or to be the benchmark in terms of cost. I think we are able to do that, we are continuing to work.  I feel that compared to our competitors or to compare with other industry, I think we are in a very good shape, but it is not enough. We need to be the benchmark in terms of cost in two years. This is our goal.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add another question here, you mentioned about all this issue that happens over time with negotiations with Xstrata, could you comment with us what are the main issues?  Is it the financing, is it that you are going to have to pay with P&amp;E shares without title and rights or is it the marketing rights on the meadows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that Ivan is a tough negotiator and Michos is a very tough negotiator. I like that, I like that. Of course they have their point of view, we have our point of view. If we sold some, let's say, principle issues, I think we are going to be in a position to close the deal. In terms of past issues, I really I think we solved everything. Final thing, a concern about rating, concerns about everything that we could have, I think we solved everything.  We overcome all these big issues that we have. In terms of issuance of preference shares is not really a issue.  Our shareholders, they are very comfortable, they are supporting us very much. The press always say always these things that we are facing problems here with the government.  I can tell you we did not have any, any interference, any issue with the government, none, no one, no one, no issue regarding that.  All of our shareholders are supporting that, but they know and they always, they remind us that we need to be very disciplined and we are very disciplined. I think we proved that or we have improved that to the market there to have it been very disciplined. So I should say that from our side we don't have any problem to conclude the debut. The problem is there are some principles that we don't want to abandon. I think we are very stick to it, marketing is something very important for us. We like to have a very good and very, very open and straight relationship with our clients. Of course, we can't accommodate things, we can't really let's say compromise things, but there are some principles that we don't and we will not abandon. So let's see what's going on.  I can tell you, it's not a easy test, it's not a easy transaction, it's very complex and it's very difficult to realize, but let's be optimistic.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question, Mr. Hirai. Please remember to restrict your questions to two at a time. Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. It's Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank. My question is one more strategic, talking about energy, you detail in your press release that you're investing in certain electric generation projects in Brazil and as well as in Indonesia.  But collectively those are going to add about 1 gigawatt of capacity, which would increase your energy self-sufficiency by 4.4%. You're looking at increasing your volume output by probably 12% in 2008, so I just wanted to understand how these relatively small investments in energy will shorten or actually increase your energy integration overall as they don't seem to be keeping pace with the growth in your volume projections?  And if maybe Roger could talk to that point a little bit as to is energy becoming a missing component in Vale's overall portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  It's not really a concern for us. The point is we are growing mainly in iron ore operations and iron ore is not really intensive in terms of energy, so we are not concerned about iron ore. We have long-term contracts to supply the orders operation, nickel here in Brazil or in Canada, we are well very positioned there. Indonesia I think we are going to be self-sufficient with the number 3 hydropower plant that is under construction right now. With the thermal power plants that we are going to build, each one, we are looking for three coal-fired power plants, each with 600 megawatts capacity. So we are able to grow a lot in this area.</p>
          <p>The problem is for iron ore we don't have any problem, for nickel here in Brazil we have long-term contracts, with that we don't have any constraints in terms of growth. If we talk about copper, also we don't have any constraints to keep growing the copper business. The big issue is aluminum business.  This is really a big issue. This is the sticky area we have constraints. We don't have enough energy supply to build a new smelter in Brazil, that's why we are looking in other countries to build or to have energy supply guaranteed for long-term. I can include Colombia in this area. There are some potentials to develop new hydropower plants there in Colombia and we are talking with the government. I went there one month ago and I had a very good and very let's say open discussion with the Uribe, President Uribe and it was really very good. We are looking for some areas in Middle East that we can have access to gas and to build a thermal power plant there.</p>
          <p>So for aluminum I can tell you it's something that we need to carefully analyze how to expand our smelting capacity. The problem is that or the problem or the let's say the benefit is that we have a huge bauxite deposit that we can really grow very much in this area. Alumina, we are building, we are logging alumina, so the smelting capacity is something that we needed to really focus. For the other operations, we don't have any problems. We are right now building the Estreito project, we are going to add a lot of megawatts to our portfolio, but mainly what we are looking for is the possibility to find out new areas to build new capacity and we are working on it, we are working on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sorry, just the second part of my question was do you view that energy is becoming a strategically more important part potentially of Vale's overall portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. We are not looking for self-sufficiency or we are not looking to increase very much the investments in energy, as I think it's clear that to energy for us we are looking for a hedge in terms of cost. I believe that for the next year the price of energy continues to go up. We have a very good contract signed for the distribution companies here in Brazil, in Canada, in Indonesia, in China, in Australia, so it's not really something that we needed to rush, we needed to really be concerned about the supply of energy. It's just a matter of decorate our portfolio in terms of hedge and cost and how to control a little bit the booming or the cost for energy. So it's not going to be really a major investments for us. You know that we are in the gas exploration right now together with Petrobras.  We have several areas and maybe if we are lucky we are going to find out new gas deposits, I'm really optimistic about that. But if we put together the hydro power plants, the thermal power plants, the goal that we are going to produce ore in Australia or ore in Mozambique project and if we put together the gas of course if we covet as energy, the energy portfolio as a whole is going to grow in terms of representative in our turnover. But only if we consider gas, coal and our hydro and thermal power plants as a single entity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank your for your question, Mr. Beristain. Our next question comes from Carlos de Alba from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Good morning. Two questions, the first one would be regarding the rapid increase or the sharp increase that we saw in the depreciation expense in the fourth quarter vis-&#xE0;-vis the third quarter of '07?  And the second question would be in terms of generally speaking on M&amp;A strategy, obviously Xstrata is a diversified producer. Is this a type of acquisition that you will like to pursue not only in this case, but generally going forward?  Or would you be looking at also single commodity companies in order to expedite your growth in your coal, copper or aluminum?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos, this is Fabio.  Thank you for the question. I will answer the first one, the depreciation in the fourth quarter is reflecting the effect of the appreciation of the currency, the increase in asset base, but also a one-off adjustment in Vale Inco plants.  So it's basically an adjustment of around $100 million or so that was a different procedure that was adopted in the first quarter.  It was adjusted and should not have a recurrent nature moving forward and now I will give the floor to Roger for the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos, you know that it is not easy in our day to acquire or find out new or good reserves.  It is not easy because.  The cost is very high nowadays to develop a greenfield project, it's not easy.  Of course to develop a brownfield project is easier and cheaper and that's what we are doing in Vale, so we are really speeding up all the investments in brownfield projects. Greenfield projects, we and everybody sees some problems with cost. It always change, always changing, maybe one day is better, you develop a greenfield project and another in the very next day it is better that you acquire after.  The problem is, again, quality. We are looking for high quality deposits. We are looking for high quality mines, that's what we are looking for. If we have in our combined company everything together as we have in the Xstrata, okay, let's go for it. If we find out a company that has a very strong asset base and a high quality asset base and is able or is hoping to discuss or to sell or to do something with together with us, okay, we are going to. Our main areas are copper, we are bullish; coal, we are bullish about the market. Of course something in aluminum business is something that is interesting, I'm not saying that we are discuss or we are looking for to acquire any company in this area. I think it is more feasible to develop a greenfield project and attach it to the energy supply, this is very important. Cost of energy for aluminum is really very important and there is nothing really good or really nice in the market right now to that we need or we must pay attention. There is nothing really available ready in the market right now. I think we need to develop these values, so again if there are some companies, very good companies in the market, but everybody is full of cash, everybody is making a lot of money, everybody is bullish about the future. So price is not easy to negotiate, the cost is not easy to negotiate and what we are doing again, our main priority is organic growth. So we are not in a rush. If someone wants to exchange some ideas or dating with us, I think we are open to dating, but I'm not saying that we are able to marriage at first.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. I think everybody must be fair.  We don't have time to spend in one thing that is not feasible, so again, I don't know. Let's see what's going to happen. They needed to move, they needed to do something.  If they don't do, okay, I'm really concerned about that, about our project. What I'm going to do next week is just start to traveling again to visit all our operations and to see, analyze how it's going our projects around the world. That's it, this is not really a priority for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you. A follow-up question, under what circumstances would you sacrifice your investment-grade rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have a very strong balance sheet. We are doing everything and we are building all the solutions for any acquisition, any acquisition in order not to jeopardize our investment-grade status.  We don't want to jeopardize that and we are comfortable that even if we go for a major acquisition we are able to go around or to avoid any downgrades in our status right now. So including these conversations with Xstrata, we are really very careful to build a solution that is not going to jeopardize our current status.</p>

We are working hard to increase our production. We believe that for the next two, three years we are not going to see any problem in terms of demand in the market.</p>
          <p>Let's see what is going to happen in four or five years because there are some greenfield projects, newcomers entering the several different industries and if the demand stays like it is today, I don't see any problem to absorb all the new production in the market.
