          <p>Chandra and Maha will give us a brief overview of the company's performance followed by the Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Anything said on this call, which reflects our outlook for the future, all this can be construed as a forward-looking statement. It must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the results presentation emailed to you and also made available on our website.</p>
          <p>With that I would like to turn the call over to Chandra to begin the proceeding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone and thank you Kedar. I am very happy to address all of you today. We have had another excellent quarter and a great year. In terms of growth, we have delivered 5.1% growth, but if you look at the international revenues alone, it's about 5.5%. So the volume also is much greater than the 2.92% reported. It's around 3.3%, if you look at the international volumes alone. The Indian market has grown 1%.</p>
          <p>In terms of the different segments and geographies and services, it is again well-rounded performance. The noteworthy points are; we are seeing signs of recovery in Continental Europe.</p>
          <p>Continental Europe delivered close to 12% growth on a sequential basis and on a constant currency basis more than 7% growth. And Asia-Pacific once again delivered an exceptional growth close to 10%, and U.S. continues to be good, growing about 4.8% on a Q-on-Q basis.</p>
          <p>From industry perspective, banking and financial services continues to do well, but a number of other sectors have delivered upper single-digit growth and couple of them have even shown double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>We have delivered double-digit growth in Hi-Tech, and Travel &amp; Hospitality, and Energy &amp; Utilities, in these three segments. And then, Manufacturing has delivered over 9% growth, and Retail &amp; Distribution, 7% growth; and BFSI under 4% growth.</p>
          <p>So there has been a significant growth across verticals and Telecom has declined, but we're seeing signs of recovery. It will continue to grow from here; but nevertheless, it will always be in the near term below the company's average growth rate.</p>
          <p>Coming to the services, the most significant thing to notice is a significant uptick that we have had in the Enterprise Solutions phase, which kind of indicates the growth in the discretionary spend and the projects coming thereof. And we have had double-digit growth on a sequential basis in the Enterprise Solutions.</p>
          <p>From a customer metrics point of view, across the customer revenue bands, if you look at the pyramid, it has been excellent client conditions, whether it's a $1 million bracket or a $5 million bracket or a $10 million bracket or a $20 million bracket and so on so forth. It has been very nice to see that there is a significant number of additions at the bottom end of that, the customer revenue bands pyramid.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of the operational metrics, we have had a slight drop in the utilization, in fact more than 100 basis point drop &#x2013; 130 basis point drop in utilization. And that is due to the large number of trainees coming into the system, and also Q4 being a seasonally weak quarter. But having said that, we have been able to maintain margin, in spite of the drop in utilization at the 28.02% at the EBIT level.</p>
          <p>Overall, looking forward the deal pipeline is very robust. I would say that the total number of deals that we are chasing, the total volume of the deals that we are chasing, and the qualified pipeline that we have, all of them are much better than the same time last year, and they have been getting incrementally better quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>We've had a pricing up-tick of 80 basis point this quarter, which is in line with some of our predictions earlier. We have had a pricing up-tick in Q3 of 118 basis points and we have followed it up this quarter.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we continue to expect some pricing improvement in the next fiscal year, because the customers by and large are not only focused on costs, they are increasingly focusing on value. And which should drive significant number of projects due to discretionary spend in the coming year, and also new technology adoption, whether it is mobility, whether it is cloud, whether it is social media or analytics, those things will come into play.</p>
          <p>So we see a &#x2013; we see a volume led growth, but there will be some pricing improvement, that's what we see and we are not seeing any specific issues in any of the markets for the industries that we operate in.</p>
          <p>Those are the initial comments and I'll pass it on to Maha to give some more color, then we'll be happy to take questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chandra, and we have already seen the &#x2013; you have noted the improvement in the revenue, seen sequential quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year both in rupee terms and dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Let me just give you the additional factors, for instance on the revenue analytics, we had a volume growth of 2.9%, and a constant currency pricing improvement of 0.8%. Currency had a positive impact of 1.3% and onsite shift contributed to 0.1%, adding this up you get that 5.1% INR revenue growth &#x2013; sequential revenue growth for the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we have had a growth of 24.3% year-on-year, and I would like to emphasize that on constant currency basis, it has been 28.5%.</p>
          <p>And giving you details in terms of revenue analytics for annual, volume growth was 29.65%, exchange was minus 4.2%, pricing was minus 0.3%, and FX mix was minus 0.85%, so totally 24.3%.</p>
          <p>As far as the operating margin is concerned, we had a 58 basis point benefit from currency in Q4 and this gave us the &#x2013; helped us to mitigate the negative impact of onsite shifts from higher SG&amp;A. So our operating margin remained flat around &#x2013; at 28.02%.</p>
          <p>For the full year, despite adverse currency movement, our EBIT margin expanded by 134 basis points to 27.8%. There was 215 basis point negative impact from currency, but this was offset by 252 basis points gain from SG&amp;A efficiencies, 35 &#x2013; 39 basis point gain from offshore shift and 58 basis points from productivity improvement. And adding all these four figures, you get a full year of 134 basis point margin expansion on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>On the side of net income, we have an effective tax rate in Q4 of 20.8% and this was offset by the higher other income. So the net income margin came down by just 47 basis points to 23.7%.</p>
          <p>For the whole year, the EBIT margin expansion on higher other income led to 33 basis point year-on-year expansion of our net income margin to 23.3%. Despite our higher effective tax rate of 19.4%, this year compared to 14.9% in FY '10.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share in FY '11 was INR44.36, which is a 26% year-on-year growth. In dollar terms, EPS was $0.97, which is 31.1% higher than the previous year. We have also announced a final dividend of INR8, bring the total for the year at INR14, which works out to a payout ratio 36.7%.</p>
          <p>Our DSO stayed flat at 80 and invested fund stood at INR93.6 billion. So in conclusion, despite all kinds of economic uncertainties from threats of double-dip recession in the U.S. to sovereign defaults in Europe, FY 2011 turned out the year of strong demand and we are very happy on how we foresaw this and created sufficient capacity in advance, which helps us to exploit this demand surge.</p>
          <p>Another source of much satisfaction to us is that the cost management exercise we started during the downturn evolved into something much more substantive over the year. On the one hand, we were able to optimize and stabilize our cost structures to enhance operational efficiency and to meet the organization's strategic imperative.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we were able to ensure sustainability by building an institutional framework for decentralizing the control process. This has what helped us expand our operating margin and hold it in a very narrow band through the year despite all the heavy headwinds.</p>
          <p>All in all we began &#x2013; we begin the new fiscal year from a comfortable stance with good demand and a sustainable margin structure we are confident of yet another year of profitable growth.</p>
          <p>With that, we can open the lines for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen &amp; Co. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Chandra, I'm looking at the &#x2013; some of the revenue metrics, it seems that UK was a bit weak for the quarter. The infrastructure was also a bit weak for the quarter, maybe you can comment on that.</p>
          <p>And then, how should we think about margins considering the fact that we are looking at record &#x2013; still record utilization rate levels. I guess, keeping in mind that utilization rates will decline in next few quarters and then you do have some headwinds coming in from FX and wage inflation. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from the revenue contribution point of view, yes, it has been a soft quarter for UK this quarter and we think it will get better going forward &#x2013; there is nothing structurally wrong, there are no client-specific issues, as far as UK is concerned. So I think that is just a one-off from a demand point of view. It will continue to get better from here and it will do well in FY '11, '12.</p>
          <p>From infrastructure services point of view, this has been one of the fastest growing services for us and it will continue to be so. We assigned a number of deals, very large deals transformational deals. And we are in the process of executing them.</p>
          <p>In India, our revenues is down. There is a portion of infrastructure revenues, that was coming from India and that assignment got over last quarter and that has resulted in a debt this quarter, but otherwise infrastructure services are doing extremely well, both in term of pipeline, the order book, the &#x2013; currently what we are transitioning and executing it's doing very, very well. So there is no cause of concern.</p>
          <p>And from the point of view of margins, I think the first thing I would like to highlight is the margins that we are exiting is one of the best ever we have done; in that quarterly basis it's almost at our all time high, the 28.02%. If you look at the annual basis, again, this is the best margin that we have exited a financial year.</p>
          <p>So there has been a lot of discipline in the way we approach the business. We have overcome wage increases, promotion cost increases, currency headwinds, all those things we have very deftly handled all through the year. And you are absolutely right, there are headwinds coming in terms of wage increase and we have given a substantial wage increase 12% to 14% and there will be promotion costs and there will be possible currency related challenges.</p>
          <p>I think from a leverage perspective, utilization we used to say we are comfortable at 78% to 80% at utilization for &#x2013; excluding trainees. That will no longer be the case. I think we are pretty comfortable operating between 82% and 84%. And that's the level at which we'll operate. So I don't see a reason for a significant drop in utilization at the excluding trainee level.</p>
          <p>Including trainee level will depend on the inflow. Already we have come down this quarter, next quarter there will not be much of trainee additions, trainee additions will come in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So, I expect in Q1 the utilization to go up from here. So utilization will be a lever that we will definitely deploy, and growth &#x2013; growth is very, very critical. I think if growth comes that will definitely help. And we are going to work on pricing. Having said that, I don't want to indicate that there'll be a significant increase in pricing, but the demand environment currently indicates there'll be pricing increase.</p>
          <p>And so we're going to work on that. So there will be a growth lever. There will be utilization lever. And there will be a pricing lever. And of course, we will continue to look at optimizing cost on SG&amp;A. It is has gone up slightly this quarter. They are investing in huge new infrastructures, but we'll continue to look at that and then trade optimize. Those will be my comments on market.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Katri. Our next question is from the line of Balaji Prasad of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Congratulations on your continuing great run. I had two questions. Firstly, with two of your large Indian peers being in the middle of management changes, business restructuring, how has this altered the competitive landscape in your favor? Are you seeing them where you would normally have &#x2013; are you not seeing them in RFPs, or bidding process, where you normally have seen them or are you getting any market share over here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think that I will comment on that. I don't think there is a competitive advantage or anything of that kind. I think from our point of view I would say that we have a structure that we put in place, and actually that's firing all cylinders, that's why you have seen a well rounded growth across verticals and across markets and we have got a good platform. Our full services strategy is really getting traction. So there is a good demand environment, we are firing all cylinders, but I'm not looking at this as something that's one off that will happen to us in a quarter or two because of any particular situation elsewhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. So if we understand correctly, it's not a market share that you're grabbing elsewhere, but the general burgeoning demand environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, there will be &#x2013; see there will always be a combination, okay. But the point is that, we are on a path which we have put in place couple of years ago and we are going on that path and we're seeing lot of traction. The teams are all delivering results and we're seeing opportunities and we want to increase the velocity and fire on all cylinders, as simple as that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. My second question is, you did just give some clarity on pricing, just also wanted to get your views on how much of this was related to COLA adjustment or competitive differentiation or just a resurgent demand scenario?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it will be a combination and COLA will always be play a factor and when we have no demand, COLA doesn't hold an argument.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you have good demand COLA has an argument and also the differentiation in the type of engagements do has an argument and the wage costs in a demand environment has an argument. So I definitely see enough reasons for pricing uptick. And I would caution anyone in factoring in a pricing growth immediately in the subsequent quarters. We have had two quarters where there is a gradual increase and it'll take some more time but we're going to be &#x2013; trying to see what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair, and that's helpful. Thank you and good luck to the team.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Prasad. Our next question is from the line of the Diviya Nagarajan of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congrats on the quarter. Just a couple of questions. I heard your comments on CNBC and if I'm not mistaken, you guided for about 60,000 head count addition this year, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, from a total head count addition will be at 60,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just trying to reconcile that with Chandra's statements of growth and outlook because this year we've added almost 70,000 people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And all the 70,000 people are not yet billable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So all of them are in &#x2013; many of them are on the bench.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got that, got that. Even if I assume some utilization improvement, we're probably looking at volume growth being in the high teens of maybe close to 19%, 20%. Is that a fair assumption to make? Or do you think that as the year progresses, you could actually look at hiring more people if needed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Diviya, we don't give guidance. So we can't tell you clearly how much will be the growth, but all we can say is that the pipeline, the qualified pipeline today is better than last year, and we've hired 70,000 as a post year target of 50,000. So those people who are on the bench and going through training and we will look to increase utilization.</p>
          <p>And we have already made 37,000 offers in the colleges. We expect at least 25,000 people coming from that 37,000 hire we made an offer to. Then remaining will be lateral hires through the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Thank you Ms. Nagarajan. Our next question is from the line of Viju George of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Congratulations to the management team on yet another fine quarter. My question relates to the commitment by Chandra earlier that utilization and a steady state ex trainees can now move &#x2013; be consistently at between 82% to 84%. That's quite interesting, because we &#x2013; people thought that running at more than 80% success in successive quarters might be a bit difficult. Can you just take us through how that has changed from the past and why do you think this might be sustainable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Viju, there are two points. First is that that is the intent. I'm not saying that we'll always be able to run between 80% and 84%. The goal is to run in that range, because we are already close to 200,000 employees. Thus the size has to count. At 200,000 employees, if you run at 82%, that gives a lot of room still. That's the basic point. And the fact that we have been able to do 82%, 82.5%, 83.5% during the year gives us the mechanism to be able to &#x2013; able to achieve that.</p>
          <p>In fact, if you look at last year, all through from Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, we've always been between 82% and 84%. We started the year at 82.8%, then we crossed 83% to go to 83.8%, 82.6%, 83.8%, 83.8% and 82.4%. So that's a very credible rate that we have been able to manage. So if you're going to ask people more, the expectation is that we should try and do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you. All the best.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. George. Our next question is from the line of Srivathsan Ramachandran of Spark Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I just wanted to get an update. You said about hedge book currently stands at $1.9 billion, just wanted to know the effective rate to run, what kind of tenure the hedge book would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are all for the short tenure of about three months or so, and the effective rate is somewhere around 45.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>45 sure. My next question is on the BPO business. Just wanted to get an update on where you initially set up with a target of $3 billion kind of number by 2015, '16, just wanted to know how is it doing and what's happening in Diligenta, it's just that given that now you've taken the couple of clients live on the new platform, what kind of traction are we on track to maybe take it forward to some other countries abroad of U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the BPO business is doing well. Already, we are almost $1 billion, a little less than $1 billion on annual basis. And so we're on a growth trajectory in BPO and on FY '11 basis, it is maintaining its share more or less in the overall revenue of TCS. So, BPO business is doing well. From a Diligenta point of view, Phiroz can you add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, we're on track. We've had a good year. We've had a year as per plan. The traction in the U.K. market remains significantly high and we are quite confident of growth in the periods coming ahead.</p>
          <p>In respect of going to other markets, the current thinking is to actually leverage the bank platform rather than repeat Diligenta model of trying to in-source large of numbers of people. But we are keeping our eyes and ears open and some opportunities especially in Europe are presenting themselves and we are in the process of evaluating whether we should do a platform positioning or go back and see whether we want to do a Diligenta type of deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Thank you Mr. Ramachandran. Our next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah of RBS. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. Congrats on a good quarter. Just in terms of pricing we talked about 80 bps constant currency pricing improvement. So is it largely coming through a service mix change because this time we had discretionary services also growing faster or is it also some bit of a COLA adjustment reflected in this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a combination. Service mix certainly has played a role and also some of the contracts that we renewed are getting into effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Okay. And Chandra, you also spoke about most of the margin headwinds and the tailwinds and your comments are also being positive in terms of the growth going forward. So in that scenario this high margin, which is like 28% on EBIT level, you expect on a constant currency likely to be maintained?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give guidance, but our intent is to grow the business with margin focus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we have &#x2013; Sandeep, I have been talking about 27% and so on. This year obviously we have done exceedingly well. And I've also said we'll have an ideal margin structure, so I think we would leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even better, you should expect with the kind of headwinds we have declines in Q1, but then you should also know that we're going to be driving the business with clear focus on profits as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And sir, earlier in CNBC you also talked about some bit of organizational change, which can enable a faster decision making. Can you throw some more light exactly what was the purpose, is it to more &#x2013; become more aggressive within the market, or is there any change in the demand trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did not speak anything about organizational change. Yesterday, when I was in a function there was a question for which I answered that the organizational structure we put in place two years ago has really delivered for us. It has brought in the agility, it has brought in the well-rounded growth across industry some markets. And as organization evolve there will always be incremental changes. That was a broad comment, but I did not make any specific comment on a change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Shah. Our next question is from the line of Nitin Mohta of Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Chandra this is more regarding a comment you made about couple of quarters ago about 10% incremental revenues coming from cloud services. You also launched the SMB product. I wanted to understand from a three year perspective, if you can tell us how you plan to scale this product up, and what are your thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said that the 10% of our incremental revenues will come from non-linear initiatives from Q4 of FY '12, and we are sticking to that. And we have a multi-dimensional strategy for non-linear growth. We are driving the products business. And second one is the BPO cloud, process cloud we call it, or BPO platforms. The third one is iON. All the three are significant areas of focus for TCS, especially this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>And we definitely want to deliver that 10% of incremental revenues, but actually the importance there is not whether it is 10% or 8% or 15%. The importance there is to put them on a trajectory, where from there they will grow at a faster rate than the rest of the company for a sustainable period of time. And that's the focus and that's what we intend to achieve. And I can't really tell you how much it will be three years from now. I hope it is very material.</p>
          <p>We are working on definite numbers and we are putting significant effort. And the incremental revenues from the non-linear revenue &#x2013; non-linear business has to be material when you look out at the horizon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks. In terms of any feedback from clients in early stages about these initiatives, that would be very helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Currently, it's all positive. Lot of interest, lots of positive, but I'd like proof points. I'd like really to see a significant number of clients, for example, in iON we want to see 1,000 clients operating, extreme &#x2013; and express extreme level of satisfaction on everything about iON and also we want to see the right financial model which we originally constructed being proven and I hope that we can share some specific data at the end of the FY '11-'12 fiscal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Mohta. Our next question is from the line of Mitali Ghosh of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks and congratulations to the team. First, just wanted to understand that when you went into the quarter were you expecting the kind of volume growth that you saw in this quarter or was it perhaps a little softer than what you expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at the beginning of the quarter, I think the volume growth we always expected between 3% to 4%, and the international business has delivered that it's just that the India business has gone down &#x2013; or has been very, very marginal this quarter to some extent that has brought volume numbers below 3%, otherwise 3% to 4% was &#x2013; also was a good growth for this quarter. And I think we have done very well on that basis with the way we have been able to manage margins. And if you see the line items we have made the improvements in gross margin and that's very credible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So you know have there been any &#x2013; were there any delays in ramp up in the international side? And have all those projects started now so should one expect that any delays that you saw are clearly behind us now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to say delays, what I want to say is that all the discretionary projects that get finalized and the spend approved, don't start on 1st January. That's the nature of Q4 and that's why many times Q4 is referred to as seasonally weak quarter. Because things take a while, in some markets it's January 10, in some markets it's January end. Those kind of things happened in this quarter, but I'm not saying there is any delay postponement &#x2013; a deliberate postponement of projects because of a particular situation in any client or in a market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, just on the pricing, I wanted to understand that number you gave us was a blended pricing number 80 basis points. You know any sense on how that moved onsite and offshore, because onsite has gone up this time. So I'm just trying to understand how much of it is due to mix and how much of it is pure pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mitali, we never share that, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's because of onsite shift, we've taken out the onsite shift and it's started stripping onsite shift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is pure pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pure pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure. Thanks, that's helpful. And just in terms of the outlook I had two questions. One is, if you could give some color in terms &#x2013; around the large deals that you have signed this quarter and the kind of pipeline you have. And secondly on the banking, BFSI vertical, last year has been quite a phenomenal year for spending by BFSI. So what you feel are the trends this year and whether that will grow at above company average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see there are couple of comments I want to make. In terms of deals we signed seven large deals during the quarter, and one of which in banking and financial services, the remaining came across multiple verticals, retail, financial services, manufacturing, Hi-tech industries, tool manufacturing and then one public services. So there are seven large deals we signed and again they came across markets U.S. dominated with four deals and the three other deals came one in each of the different markets.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the pipeline that we are having, as I said, the total pipeline and the qualified pipeline that we chase today is definitely much better than what we had last year and also what we have seen every quarter, so it's getting better and better. We are chasing more than 20 deals which are very material in terms of size, quite large in size and they are full services deals. They come across verticals and across markets, both on the efficiency side and also on the discretionary spend side.</p>
          <p>What are the second question you had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On BFS, so that will grow at above company average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, see the point I want to make is that if you take U.S. and BFS as two distinct things where we have a significant presence, one from a geography perspective and one from industry perspective; both are growing. We are significantly present but they are nowhere near saturation. They have lot of upside and lot of headroom to grow for us.</p>
          <p>The second point I make is that, having said that, the dependency on them are not increasing because there is other business, whether it is from a market perspective or from a industry perspective, is growing and we are putting tremendous emphasis and focus on the market &#x2013; other market and other industries. So they will continue to grow, but they will not make us more dependent on them than ever before or anything like that. I hope I'm able to give you what you want.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. No, I think that's very helpful and finally if I can just ask two quick questions, one is, I didn't catch the hiring number correctly, was it 50,000, 5-0 or 60,000?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>6-0.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>6-0, okay. And just Ajoy a quick question on the fresher to lateral hiring mix, what it was last year and what you're perhaps targeting this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year, we have done &#x2013; in India, if I look at, because that's where we try to look at, it's about 56 to 44 &#x2013; 55-45, 56-44 was the mix that we had. And this year going forward, I think what we are planning is more closer towards 50-50 at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The 56 was lateral last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

          <p>Thank you Ms. Ghosh. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Miller of TechMarketView. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, gentlemen, can I just come back to the organization issue again. I mean you're now, well you probably are at 200,000 employees, and it's very possible that this time next year we'll be talking about 0.25 million employees and maybe three or four years time if we can sustain these growth rates, it's going to be more than 0.5 million or more like 0.5 million. So you talk about incremental changes to your organization, but at what point, at what number of employees do you think that incremental won't be enough and you'll have to undertake another fairly significant reorganization and what sort of shape do you think that might take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think there is no point in discussing it in great detail here, but I'll tell you this: we put in a structure two years ago where we had 23 units and they all have strong leadership teams and each one of them are capable of managing $1 billion business. So we have a very strong leadership team in place. And whether we alter it, whether we support it with more bandwidth etcetera is something that we will constantly look at.</p>
          <p>There is no point in coming up with a theory because to be very frank and honest when we were 50,000 people we didn't know how we will manage a 100,000-people company from structurally; when we were 100,000 people, we had no clue how we will manage a 200,000-people company. And it's just that we have constantly looked for it and we have done the right thing, and we have a structure where we have highly involved teams, and the governance, the mechanisms, the controls in place and we are going ahead with it. And you know that we will do the right thing.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and congratulations to the management for a good team, for a good score this time. I was just seeking a little more explanation on the utilization remark that you made. You had explained this earlier but a little more commentary on that will be helpful. Is it correct to assume that at now close to about 200,000 people, we should view the bench as an absolute number than utilization percentage as we've been used to seeing it all through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at it both ways. Internally we look at it both ways.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But Chandra is it now more meaningful &#x2013; that probably a 20,000, 25,000 bench is more meaningful than having to see about 15% or 20% bench on the total number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See you can definitely take that view, except that we also have to keep the growth environment in mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So therefore two, three years down the line can we also expect that utilization can go up to 87%, 88%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very hypothetical; why don't we leave it for at least couple of years?</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. And anything on your acquisition strategy that you'd like to highlight upon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think except that you know we will do things sensibly. If there is an opportunity for us to bring a new strategic capability in terms of a business model, in terms of a industry or in terms of a geography, we will do that, but we will be very sensible about it. And we won't do anything for the sake of revenues.</p>

          <p>Thank you Mr. Maheshwari. Our next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan of Indiabulls Securities. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on great quarter. You had &#x2013; you were giving 12% to 14% salary hike for the next fiscal, do you find that the overall job market for next year seems &#x2013; is actually tighter than what we saw in the previous year that is FY '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a job market point of view the kind of talent that we need we are able to get it from the market. But is it getting tighter? Probably, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you were mentioning about 343 colleges that we picked up freshers from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it that we are possibly, the change in mix to 50-50, is it got something to do with the overall pool available being a little lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think, Nitin the way to look at it is this: at the beginning of an year, we do plan in terms of how many people we are going to hire, and based on which we decide, ideally we would like to get 60% of the people from colleges and 40% laterals. Some years it will be even 65-35, some years it will be 55-45, it depends on the current employee pyramid structure we have, and we decide that. But what happens is that in a year if the growth momentum picks up then in between the year all the extra hiring you do, you have to go lateral. You see last year we went a significant amount of lateral hires because the 20,000 people is an upward revision that came during the year. So if you see a demand environment changing in a positive direction during the year I think you will end up hiring more laterals in addition to obviously the skill sets, the types of engagements etcetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. Just one more, you are mentioning that we're chasing 20 deals which are very material in terms of size. Have the TCVs of the deals that we have been chasing increased in size versus last year versus what we would have seen at the same time last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's not a factor of last year and this year, that's a factor of the company's scale today and the recognition for the company today that we are invited to their larger deals. I don't think it's &#x2013; I just don't want to say that it is because of last year's market situation and this year's market situation. Today, we are just definitely -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it could be ratably larger than what was seen earlier.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong quarter. Just one thing on the discretionary spending you mentioned it's &#x2013; to being strong, obviously reflecting the enterprise solution being very strong. I wanted to understand in that context the weakness in Consulting and also Products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for Products, it's &#x2013; Q4 is a seasonal issue and we had a great Q3. And you're not going to see a tremendous consistency but the point is that it has done reasonably well. And we are seeing excellent pipeline, the traction is very, very good. But if you really look as a annual level from FY'10 to FY'11 the Products business has grown 43% on dollar terms. That is against a 29% dollar term growth for the company, I think that's pretty significant.</p>
          <p>And the pipeline is pretty strong and the size of the deals are going up and we are getting opportunities across our portfolio whether it's retail banking or investment banking or capital markets, insurance, market infrastructure, global custody and if you see the research reports and we are pretty much top of the chart in every analyst report for our various financial services products. I think that business is on a very, very solid platform for growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And just on the consulting and discretionary spending side, are you seeing specifically those projects lengthening out into larger engagements compared to what you saw in FY'11 &#x2013; earlier part of FY'11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you see the global consulting, global consulting also while it has gone down in Q4, on a year-on-year has done on a dollar terms basis 47%. Yes, it's a very &#x2013; small in size, but still 47% growth is very credible. And we are getting lots of opportunities. But we are not &#x2013; we are not growing the consulting business just from a revenue perspective. Our consulting business is tightly integrated with TCS' core business. And what we really aspire to do is to leverage the thought leadership, all the intellectual property we have, the process knowledge we have and round it up with a strong program management and change management and deliver value to customers.</p>
          <p>From a financials perspective, there are two or three impacts it will make. Definitely for the work we do in consulting, the billing rates are significantly higher. The second thing it does is it kind of positions us early in the game in many of the transformational engagements and we are seeing that and there are enough examples of proof points and success. But by no means we are in an optimal situation where we would like to be. So it is &#x2013; some more work to do, but it is on the right track and there is a lot of traction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one last question. Could you comment a bit more on the health of the telecom vertical in terms of demand? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See the telecom vertical on a year-on-year basis has grown 23%. And it is lower than the company average of 29%, but 23% for a very weak vertical &#x2013; for a vertical where we have had lot of weakness is not bad. So we are expecting the telecom vertical to grow, but at least in the first two quarters I expect the telecom vertical to grow at a rate lower than the company average, but I am pretty sure that it's going to deliver quarter-on-quarter growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any changes to the kind of opportunities you're seeing in telecom, which is driving probably this slowdown and then possibly growth toward the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing, I can pick up. I &#x2013; we keep studying it; nothing specific that I can pick up as a pattern and tell you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on a sterling quarter to finish off the year. Very impressed by the growth in the newer service lines and &#x2013; on verticals, and in most geographies. Could you elaborate please on the performance in Latin America this last quarter and really for the year? What was the constant currency year-on-year growth rate this quarter and can you &#x2013; just to give us sort of clarification on this &#x2013; on the business there, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; I have said it in the past whenever we grow in new markets we need to get certain size and &#x2013; to deliver consistency in terms of growth rates. From a Latin America point of view, we have attained overall a sensible size; we are over $300 million in revenue in that market. But we are present in multiple countries. In some countries we have achieved the size and the business mix between annuity revenues and discretionary projects, where we can expect to grow consistently. Still there are countries in the region where we are heavily dependent on discretionary projects. And so we see volatility in the Latin American revenues, and in this quarter, we pretty much had a &#x2013; growth of about 3.5% in constant currency terms in Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And looking ahead, I mean, will the strategy for Latin America, will it continue to be as it was, or will there be sort of a &#x2013; you've made a small acquisition a number of years back, were you looking for any inorganic growth in Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are looking at organic growth. I explained to you in one of the calls earlier, we have some excellent clients in the region, who are not only &#x2013; there are two types of clients &#x2013; we are having global customers of the U.S., whom we serve in that market but more importantly, we have developed strong relationship with some of the regional local champions or national champions as we call it, and we have such clients in Brazil, in Mexico, in Colombia, in other markets, Chile and those clients are developing deep relationship and partnership with us and we are slowly but steadily growing in those accounts. So our strategy is to grow from here organically, I expect both the revenues and margins to go up in the region.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Most of my questions have been answered. But, Chandra, when you mentioned about pricing increase being a margin leap within FY'12, are you seeing it coming from a mix change or are you &#x2013; did you mention about like-to-like price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm hoping for like-to-like. I can't commit on it, but I'm hoping for like-to-like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And second, would you like to comment on the decline in the $100 million client base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, there are always a few clients who are under cost &#x2013; in the $90 million to $100 million range. So one such client who was marginally ahead in one &#x2013; above 100 has gone slightly below, and that's not a Q4 impact, that's more a Q1 &#x2013; last year Q4 to Q1. There was a decline in the client, so even though there is an increase in Q4 now on a &#x2013; since it is a LTM basis, you are seeing a decline from nine to eight. Absolutely, there is no cause for concern on any specific clients. Client metrics is pretty good. And it's good to point out that all the four quarters this year we have had an incremental revenue of $100 million plus.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ms. Gurumurthy. Our next question is from the line of Dipesh Mehta of SBICAP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of demand, whether we are seeing any divergence in U.S. and Europe and rest of the world? And in general, what kind of demand we are seeing from different geographies? That is the first question.</p>
          <p>Second, about &#x2013; just to understand what kind of growth we expect because NASSCOM has guided around 16% to 18% for industry. So your comment about where we would be? And last is about client, our top 10 client is showing some kind of relative lower performance compared to company average, so if any specific comment to make?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a market perspective, U.S. is definitely doing better than Europe. And while Europe has picked up momentum, I expect the U.S. to grow faster. There are a lot more opportunities, a faster revision cycle, et cetera, are leading to higher growth in the U.S. But the other markets, which are growing; Asia-Pacific is growing almost 10% this quarter. And other markets like Middle-East, Africa are growing and LATAM will grow from here, so that's the color on that.</p>
          <p>I don't think there should be any concern in terms of any specific client. As I said, on a large base, there will always be volatility between our top client &#x2013; our top five client, our top 10 client, but in absolute terms, all of them are growing, that's more important. And in terms of the FY '12 growth, you see, we don't give guidance, but we have always been ahead of the NASSCOM estimates.</p>

      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And so lastly, is about U.S. because some of the players have suggested they are seeing some kind of softness in U.S. So I just want to understand whether we are seeing the same thing or no?</p>

          <p>Yeah. Hi, this is Kunal here. My question is on the &#x2013; you &#x2013; Chandra, you had earlier mentioned that Life Sciences and Healthcare, you see particularly good traction. Could you talk about what kind of opportunities are emanating from this particular sector and what would be the service lines that you see here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a Life Sciences perspective, I think it's full services. We see lots of opportunities in the IT services, good opportunities in BPO. We work with a good number of top 10 pharma companies and we work in drug discovery, safety, clinical data, statistical analysis, all kinds of areas, we work with them. We are helping them in programs to bring drugs to market faster.</p>
          <p>We are doing a significant number of engineering services work, where we are helping them design products and transplants and &#x2013; we do those. So engineering services, we do lot of work, we do lot of KPO work, IT services. We are also doing infrastructure work in terms of consolidation, virtualization, et cetera, assurance services, pharma companies are leveraging us on a well rounded basis and we do lot of compliance work recently. There are lot of regulatory changes coming in the U.S., <mark type="indiscernible" /> and so on, and those kind of work is also picking up momentum.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there was any problem in the willingness to increase to offshore players from our pharma clients, but we have achieved quite a bit of traction and definitely, the KPO work has gained momentum also.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I think, in summary, we have had a excellent quarter to round off a good FY '11. And as we exit, we are coming off the last four quarters where we have had incremental revenues of $100 million plus in every quarter. So there is a good growth momentum and our pipelines look healthy and there are number of deals that we are chasing look good. The customer pyramid in terms of revenue branch looks very good.</p>
          <p>And in terms of margins, as I said earlier, we are exiting at the best margin levels we have ever exited a financial year. We are conscious of the macro environment and we are conscious of the headwinds that are in front of us. In terms of the wage increases, in terms of the currency, et cetera, but we are preparing for a good year ahead. We can see it in the number of associates that we have recruited and the guidance we have given for the recruitment next year. Thank you for your support. Have a nice day.</p>
