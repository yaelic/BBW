      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in Grupo M&#xE9;xico's first quarter earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>Joining me today are Mr. Oscar Gonz&#xE1;lez Rocha, the Chairman of ASARCO; Rogelio Velez, CEO of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano; Jorge Pulido, Head of Investor Relations, and other executives of the Company. On today's conference call, I will briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and the main issues impacting the Company's profitability. Then comment on our Mining Division's most relevant results, and pass on the call to Rogelio, who will explain the financial results of our Transportation Division.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, metal prices were volatile. And, consequently, during the first quarter, we saw a range between $462 per ton of copper, an all-time high, and $415, which obviously reflected the increased volatility that we've been looking at.</p>
          <p>Copper prices continued to strengthen, given the expectations for high consumption and the rebound of the construction sector. Prices have also been supported by a weak dollar.</p>
          <p>The earthquake in Japan has resulted in slightly lower consumption worldwide, which will be compensated by very high consumption once re-initiation of production in plants and reconstruction of housing in Japan starts. We, therefore, remain confident in the industry fundamentals and believe that we will be a deficit in copper production and consumption during 2011. This is due to increased demand from China, despite the efforts of the Chinese government to moderate growth.</p>
          <p>Considering the current market circumstances and volatility, the Company has decided to take some price protection through the use of swaps and zero-cost collars. And we provide the details of our consolidated hedges in a minute.</p>
          <p>The average price for the quarter was $4.28 per pound, 33% above the $3.28 recorded in the same quarter of 2010 and 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding molybdenum which, as you know, is our main byproduct, in the first quarter 2011, it represented 7% of our Mining Division sales, and it averaged $17.18 per pound, which is 9% above its average price in 2010. We are currently seeing a recovery in molybdenum consumption. For the year, we are expecting an relatively balanced market for this metal.</p>
          <p>Regarding revenues, we are happy to report that in this first quarter 2011, our total consolidated revenues were a record high of over $2.5 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year. This increase is mainly due to higher metal prices and higher copper production volumes, as a result of the production restarts in Buenavista, which was previously named Cananea, combined with an increase of 18% in the revenue generated by our Transportation Division.</p>
          <p>As copper fundamentals remains one of the most solid in the entire commodity sector, we anticipate that good results will not only continue in 2011 but will improve, as I will point out in a production section of our Mining Division.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for the first quarter was $1.2 billion, an increase of 21% on a year-over-year basis. This cost increase of $250 million is mainly explained by the reincorporation of Buenavista which, alone, accounted for 76% of this increase, although costs were also affected by higher prices of diesel and the liquidity, mainly.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the first quarter was nearly $1.2 billion, with an EBITDA margin of 48%. This figure represents a significant improvement of 35% year-over-year, out of which $843 million came from Southern Copper, which were equivalent to 52.6% of its sales and representing a 22% increase over the first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for ASARCO reached $254 million, equivalent to 49.4% of sales. EBITDA for the Transportation Division reached $108 million. This was equivalent to 28% of sales. Net income in the quarter was $532 million, an increase of 47% year-over-year and 6% higher quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, total CapEx amounted to $121 million, out of which $89 million was spent in the Mining Division, $27 million in the Transportation Division and the remaining $5 million in our Infrastructure Division.</p>
          <p>In the Transportation Division, investments were made for the continuous expansion of <mark type="ph" /> sidings (5:45) and improvement of safety measures. The capital expenditure budget for the Railroad Division in 2011 will be nearly $400 million, mainly for the acquisition of 58 new locomotives, 44 of which will go to Ferromex and 14 to Ferrosur, that will be delivered in 2011.</p>
          <p>As a result of the solid performance in 2010, in our Mining Division we will continue with our mine expansions, particularly the Buenavista mine. We are expect to increase in Buenavista and up production from 180,000 tons to 450,000 tons, an increase of 150%. I will provide details further on, on this topic.</p>
          <p>The total consolidated debt at March 31st amounted to $4 billion. With a cash balance of a little south of $3 billion, the Company's net debt stands at $1 billion. The Company maintains a comfortable, long-term amortization schedule and ample financing flexibility going forward. Our current cash position plus our cash generation capability will support all operational needs and CapEx expenditures. It will also allow us to have ample room to explore additional value-generating opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends, on February 18th, we paid a dividend of $0.30 pesos per share outstanding, which was equivalent to $190 million. For the first quarter 2011, the Company's board approve a quarterly dividend payment of $0.40 pesos per share outstanding, which will be paid in cash on May 5th and represents a disbursement approximately $260 million.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, the Company has contracted swaps and zero-cost collars to both Southern Copper and ASARCO. Combined, we have swaps of 36% of 2011 estimated production and nearly 36% of zero-cost collars. For 2012, we have only hedged 5% of the estimated production, and this is only zero-cost collars. With this hedging strategy, we are also assuring the necessary cash generation to fund our aggressive CapEx program.</p>
          <p>I will now discuss the main developments of the Mining Division. Southern Copper had its conference earlier today, so I'll concentrate from an Americas Mining point of view, which is the entities that, as you know, consolidates both Southern Copper and ASARCO.</p>
          <p>ASARCO's mine copper production &#x2013; AMC's mine copper production &#x2013; I apologize &#x2013; in the first quarter 2011 increased 5.2% year-over-year. This increase was mainly due to the restart of Buenavista mine, which produced 27,598 tons of copper. Greater production's expected in the coming quarters, with Buenavista operating at full capacity, and the completion of the optimization of the mine's recovery process in the concentrate.</p>
          <p>ASARCO's mined production in the first quarter 2011 decreased 15.6% to 42,897 tons compared to 49,608 tons in the first quarter 2010. This decrease was mainly due to less production because of expected lower ore grades at Mission and Ray mines. We expect higher production in the remaining three quarters of 2011, as the Buenavista mine, which is now operating at full capacity, will complete the optimization that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Also, in the second half 2011, we expect a significant increase in ore grades at the Cuajone mine, which will offset the lower production during the first quarter 2011, which was due to the expected ore grades, as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>We are maintaining our copper production guidance of 830,000 tons of copper for 2011, of which 630,000 tons will be produced by Southern Copper and 200,000 tons by ASARCO. Molybdenum production also decreased 10%. The production was 4,274 tons in the first quarter 2011 compared to 4,753 tons in the same period of 2010.</p>
          <p>The decrease was mainly due to lower ore grades at Cuajone. However, this still was above our mine plan and production estimates for the quarter. This quarter, the molybdenum sales represented 7% of AMC sales. We are maintaining our molybdenum sales guidance of 17,000 tons for 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning now to CapEx. Southern Copper had a conference call today &#x2013; earlier today asking about details of the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a suspension in the Q&amp;A session, as there are still queries remained unanswered. However, I would just like to stress that we're confident that the Peruvian government will provide the legal stability required to allow for economic development of a mining investment and, hence, a favorable environment for growth and development in Peru.</p>
          <p>As you know, one of the main strengths of our company is the diversity of world-class assets, which allow us to continue with our other expansion projects. In Buenavista, as I have mentioned, we are working at full speed. Particularly, we're working to develop the two SX/EW facilities that are planned to produce 88,000 tons of additional copper through our &#x2013; the leaching process. We anticipate this plant to come into production during the second half of 2013.</p>
          <p>We are also constructing the corresponding crushing and conveying systems, which is known as <mark type="ph" /> cavalesis (11:19). Additionally, we are working on the molybdenum recovery plant at Buenavista with a capacity of 2,000 tons per year, which we anticipate will begin production in the fourth quarter 2012. We are also concluding the detailed engineering studies for Buenavista's new concentrator, which will allow us to increase an additional 188,000 tons of copper in 2015.</p>
          <p>Currently, there are more than 4,000 employees and contractors working in Cananea; some more at our Buenavista mine. The estimated investments in these projects are $2.6 billion over the following four years.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures for ASARCO in the first quarter 2011 were $16.2 million, mainly attributable to the maintenance projects at our Smelter in Chile, and also payments made on four new 400-ton trucks for the Ray mine.</p>
          <p>Well, ASARCO have been working on a project to restart molybdenum circuit as well. This is at our Mission mine. The studies are expected to be completed in May 2011. We are also continuing ASARCO with our exploration and drilling program in order to try to increase our reserves.</p>
          <p>The consolidated AMC operating cash cost per pound of copper, net of byproducts, was $0.642 per pound in first quarter 2011. This compares to $0.356 per pound in the first quarter 2010. The increase is principally due to less copper production, increased stripping at the ASARCO mines and higher fuel and electricity costs.</p>
          <p>I will, therefore, now pass on the call to Rogelio, who will discuss the main financial highlights of our Transportation Division. Rogelio, <mark type="ph" /> please?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel, and good afternoon to everyone. I will talk about the main developments during the first quarter of 2011 for our Transport Division, represented by the holding company, Infraestructura y Transportes Mexico, ITM, and its principal subsidiaries, Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, then Ferrocarril Mexicano, Ferromex and Ferrosur now presented consolidated in this quarter.</p>
          <p>ITM's load volumes transported during the first quarter of this year, measured in net tons/kilometer, were 12.5 billion compared to 12.1 billion during the first quarter 2010, representing an increase of 3% year-on-year. The volume transported by Ferromex during first quarter increased 3%, moving 10.7 billion net tons/kilometers versus 10.4 a year ago.</p>
          <p>In terms of loaded cars, the increase was 7.6% to nearly 204,000 cars. The main increases were seen in the intermodal segment, reporting a 33% increase in net ton/kilometers and 22% in cars. And also the mineral segment with 13.5% and 29%, respectively.</p>
          <p>The volume transported by Ferrosur during the first quarter increased 5%, moving 1.8 billion net tons/kilometers. Ferrosur increased its net ton/kilometers by 45% and loaded cars by 34% in the metal segments, and by 39% and 27% respectively in the automotive segment, the two segments that performed the best. Our guidance for load volumes in 2011 remains unchanged at 58.5 billion net tons/kilometer, representing an increase of 11% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>ITM's net sales for the first quarter were $383 million, an increase of 18% compared with the same quarter of 2010; mainly from higher volumes in most of our segments, as in the case of intermodal traffic, which rose 33%, minerals 14% and metals 9%. Ferromex's net sales in the first quarter were $305 million, an increase of 16% above the $265 million in the first quarter of 2010. Ferrosur's net sales in the first quarter posted record figures. Sales were $76 million, an increase of 20% above the $63.5 million in the first quarter of 2010, and 7.5% above its previous record.</p>
          <p>Operating cost for the first quarter was $262 million, an increase of 23% year-on-year. This increase is mainly attributable to increases in freight volume, an 11.4% increase in diesel peso price and increases in locomotive leasing, labor and maintenance.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the first quarter of 2011 was nearly $108 million, a decrease of 2% year-on-year, due to an extraordinary other income received during the first quarter in 2010, although 19% higher than the fourth quarter 2010, with an EBITDA margin of 28%.</p>
          <p>Ferromex's EBITDA in first quarter was $83 million, a decrease of 9%, compared to the $92 million in the first quarter a year ago. Ferrosur's EBITDA in the first quarter was $23 million, an increase of 35% above the $17 million in the first quarter a year ago.</p>
          <p>Net income during the first quarter was nearly $48 million, an increase of 16% year-on-year. Capital expenditures in the first quarter amounted to $27 million invested over the first quarter. This amount reflects investments made in expansions and the constructions of new sitings. Our 2011 guidance for capital investments in Ferromex is $330 million, which include the purchase of 44 new locomotives and the completion of the sitings, which will increase track capacity and line speed. This investment amount will be the highest in the history of Ferromex.</p>
          <p>Ferrosur also plans to invest the highest amount in its history in 2011, a total of $66 million, which includes the purchase of another 14 locomotives.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to provide you with an update on the legal process related to the combination of Ferrosur. As we previously announced on May 12, 2010, the Federal Court of Justice on Tax and Administrative Matters, Tribunal Federal de Justicia Fiscal y Administrativa, resolved as approved the acquisition of Ferrosur by Infraestructura y Transportes M&#xE9;xico, a subsidiary of Grupo M&#xE9;xico.</p>
          <p>The notification of this decision to the parties was delayed for several months; and once received, the Federal Competition Bureau contested the decision before the appeal court in Mexico City. However, on March 25, 2011, the acquisition of Ferrosur received final approval, as the First Collegiate Court found to dismiss the appeal brought by the Federal Competition Bureau against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice on Tax and Administrative Matters in favor of ITM and Infraestructura y Transportes Ferroviarios, subsidiaries of Grupo M&#xE9;xico. No further recourse may be admitted against the Federal Court decision.</p>
          <p>Final decision was handed down, allowing the Transportation Division to consolidate Ferrosur's results with ITM, finding there to be no concentration and, therefore, no monopolistic practices, as the Federal Competition Bureau have claimed. With this decision, the Transportation Division will likely obtain highly significant synergies in operating methods and sales.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call to Mr. Daniel Mu&#xF1;iz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rogelio. And I guess just to give you a quick update as far we can regarding the concentration of Southern Copper in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:41) Americas Mining. I mean I'd say a special committee has been working. They've returned with the financial and mining advisors. We are of the understanding that they've made a lot of progress in their due diligence, and we are moving forward once the diligence is almost completed or pretty much completed.</p>
          <p>So, at this point, we have nothing further to report. I'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have. But, really, we are still on the same track that we commented and look forward to announcing something for the next quarter, I hope.</p>
          <p>With this, operator, can we open up the forum for questions and answers, please?</p>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Felipe Hirai with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions. The first one is related to your Rail Division. So you mentioned that you now have the permission to consolidate both Ferrosur and Ferromex. So I just would like to understand what are the plans going forward? If you <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:00) and what's the timeline for that?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on ASARCO. If you could just comment a little bit more also on the timeline for the consolidation of both Southern and ASARCO; if you have any idea when will the committee might issue the final decision? And also, if you &#x2013; given what's going on with &#x2013; in the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project, if you have the ability to look at some other growth opportunities in ASARCO? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Felipe. Thank you for the questions. Can you repeat the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a question real quick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. The first question, Daniel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. I was talking about T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a. Let me answer the Rail Division. Yeah. They're very happy with the outcome as Rogelio just pointed out. I mean, we always mention it and convey to the market that we feel very strongly that we will prevail on course at the end of a day. And, finally, that it happened. So, I mean this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:50) allows us to bring important synergies for both companies, and that we are currently working on and that we're currently evaluating.</p>
          <p>Of course, this also allow us to start thinking in strategic alternatives, and that's where we are now. And I think at this point, it's immature to talk about a &#x2013; any kind of spin-off IPO or consolidation. I think at this point, we're concentrating on obtaining commercial and operational synergies at both operating levels. And that will, obviously, enable us to continue the impressive growth and track record that Ferromex and Ferrosur have had in the past.</p>
          <p>Regarding the ASARCO timeline, I mean as I said, here it's a process that has to be really conducted as an arm's length transaction. So the special independent committee that was formed last year has really devoted a lot of time and effort in a detailed due diligence because the way the structure of the transaction has been presented; i.e., a share exchange under which American Mining Company will be the entity listed in NYSE. After all, they've been conducting due diligence &#x2013; extensive due diligence on both companies; not only ASARCO but also on Southern Copper.</p>
          <p>As far as we understand, we're almost finished &#x2013; or they are almost finished with the due diligence, and we are finished with the due diligence. And we are in the final stage of this process. Unfortunately, nothing to report at this time. So timeline's still very hard to estimate, but we definitely think that probably within the next quarter or the following two quarters, we'll have news for you guys.</p>
          <p>And regarding the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a question, that's the last part that I didn't hear, Felipe. You could just please...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know. My question was really, what are the growth options that you have in ASARCO? So given all the issues with T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a and the current political risk that you could have in Peru, if you could start focusing more on your growth prospects in ASARCO instead of doing that in Peru, and what could those options be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again. Again. Well, I mean I guess this is something in mining around the world. I mean, you have environmental issues. You have environmental permitting. This is what happens when you have projects out there. And that's really why we &#x2013; we see the capacity and tightness in the supply of copper. So, really, one of the trends I would say of Grupo M&#xE9;xico is having three different countries and world-class assets in all the three countries; the United States, Mexico and Peru.</p>
          <p>So this allow us &#x2013; you have a lot of flexibility and focus, for example, as I pointed out in our Buenavista expansions at this point. That's not &#x2013; that doesn't mean that we will not pursue the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project that we pointed out earlier this morning in Southern Copper. This project has been suspended. We're taking just prudent time, given the political atmosphere that this following two months will be happening at Peru. But then we'll &#x2013; carrying on with all of our other expansions. And we are full speed at Buenavista. We are working at ASARCO with expansion plans, with drilling and exploration, as I pointed out. And, I mean &#x2013; and that's it. I mean, I think we're happy to have those options.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question come from the line of Marcos Assumpcao with Itau BBA [Itau Securities].</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello. Good afternoon, everybody. My first question is regarding cash cost. If you can comment a little bit on the cash cost per ton, excluding byproduct? And how do you expect this to evolve in the next quarters? So actually what I want to see here is how much in the cost increase was related to recurring items like energy and fuel? And how much was kind of nonrecurring, given the lower grades? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean excluding byproducts, when you look at it from an Americas Mining point of view, you'll be seeing $2 per pound of copper. That's excluding byproducts. So I pointed out, when you include the byproducts you are at a $0.689 cash cost for Americas Mining; that is Southern Copper and ASARCO consolidated. And the issues that we've really looked at in this cash cost for the quarter was increases in diesel, increases in ASARCO in maintenance and reactors. We also saw, in Southern Copper, some increase as well of diesel and electricity, and so that is really the main issues affecting the cash cost...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how do you expect the $2 to perform going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think there were a lot of a one-shot issues this quarter, particularly, this is affected by lower production. Lower production at both, not only Southern Copper, but also ASARCO. I mean, they're attributable to the lower ore grade. I don't know if you &#x2013; do you want to comment, Oscar or Raul further on this issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that Southern is going to add more production because the grade of Cuajone is going to jump from 0.5 or less than 0.5 to 0.65 in the month of June and about 58 in the month of May. Then I think that we are going to produce at least maybe 50% more because the milling capacity is going to increase that was low.</p>
          <p>And the same will happen in ASARCO. Maybe the grades are not going to jump like in Cuajone, but we expect that we are going to have more milling capacity that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:20) in Mission and in Ray because hardness of the rock and because of the grade. I think that in both and, definitely, Mexico is going to have more production because Buenavista is going to be full production the whole quarter, no, the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add to that. This is Raul Jacob. Let me add to that, that inflation or cost increases related to the Buenavista ramping up were $0.08 per pound in this past quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Perfect. Thank you very much. Very complete answer. Second question regarding the copper production. You guys maintained the guidance of 830,000 tons for the year, which implies, theoretically, that volumes will increase from nearly 180,000 tons to 220,000 already next quarter or for the next three quarters. Can we expect already the copper production to increase in the second quarter to these levels? Or will be a slow ramp up throughout the year, so we will have even a higher number by end of the year, and maybe a lower number in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. I mean I think one of the most important parts, as I say, is the ore grade pick-up in Cuajone, which I &#x2013; Raul, would you please explain again what we discussed on Southern Copper conference call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are having a guidance or a forecast for this year for Southern Copper of 630,000 pounds of production for the year. Obviously, if you subtract this number, the production for the first quarter, we will have &#x2013; we're expecting much more production for the rest of the year. But I will say that on the second half, we will see the positive benefit of this higher production because we're completing the ramping up of Buenavista in the second quarter. And we will have Buenavista at full steam at the &#x2013; through the second quarter; obviously, on the third and fourth. And on the second half of the year, it was indicated by Mr. Gonz&#xE1;lez, we will have also the benefit of having a higher ore grade at the Cuajone operation that will improve production on the second half of 2011 for Southern Copper.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. And again a lot of my operating questions were already answered, so I will devote my time to ask you about the investmenting GAAP. What is started as a Treasury investment, now it looks a little bit more strategic, so if you can give us an update of what is the sinking? And the second is what change for you to now report under AMC, instead of putting the full financials of ASARCO and Southern Copper as you did in previous quarters. Is this an indication of something changing and this is only out of curiosity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Victoria. I appreciate for the questions. Well, let me start with the Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico question. And as we've said, and I'm assuming &#x2013; I mean, this is a sector that we like. I mean, within that infrastructure it's a division that Grupo Mexico would like to grow in, we made several investments and obtained a couple of additional projects as you could see from our earnings report that we put out there in our Infrastructure division.</p>
          <p>Regarding GAAP, I mean, we think this is the way to understand the industry, to get into the sector. We've &#x2013; as we said we like this company, we like their dividend, we like their margins. We think it's within the airports industry in Mexico, the company that has the best diversification in terms of not only tourism but also business airports in Mexico. And that's why we've reached the 20% of the share capital outstanding and we've requested a second board member. That is really where we are now and where we feel comfortable participating in this company. So that's it now at this moment.</p>
          <p>As you know, we are also participating in the Riviera Maya Airport. We are getting ready to present our proposal bid by the end of this month. At the moment, we are only two competitors for this airport and we've been working full steam on this. So this just give you an idea of this sector that we like. That doesn't mean that we're going to concentrate Grupo Mexico's effort on Infrastructure, nor in the airport business.</p>
          <p>I mean, still the strategy maintains to grow organically. mainly our Mining division and keep on growing that we have in the Infrastructure division, as I said concentrating forces now to obtain synergy between Ferromex and Ferrosur.</p>
          <p>Regarding AMC, I mean, now we have ASARCO fully consolidated with us for one full year. So we believe that a way to look at it and because Southern Copper has a different conference call, it's a publicly listed company, to provide you with the way that Mexican division or I mean, Mining division of Grupo Mexico looks like, but happy to provide any details as you require.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I wanted to discuss two things. One, I would like to return to the pace of production growth. So based on your answer to the question, I think two questions ago going from 180,000 tons per quarter up to 220,000, it would be really more measured where this current quarter would be more than 180,000 but would be less than 220,000. And then in the second half of the year, it sounds like it should be above 220,000 per quarter. Can you comment? Am I understanding this correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. No. You are understanding this correctly. I mean, it has to do a lot with pick up of the ore grade at Cuajone, the less stripping at ASARCO. Do you, Raul or Oscar want to add something to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second one is on the Transportation division. What is your ability to pass on higher operating costs, especially higher fuel costs onto your customers? Maybe if you could take us through how that tariff adjustment process works that would be great? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think that the best person to answer that is Rogelio Velez who is the CEO of this division.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have a fuel surcharge in place since November of 2004. And that surcharge recovers the increase of the diesel, basically every three months in the case of both Ferromex and Ferrosur. Every three months, we are increasing half the percentage point. We currently are, in the case of Ferromex, at 17.5% as a fuel surcharge and in the case of Ferrosur at 17%. And it has proven that can recover the cost increases that have been at an average of 0.9% every month for the last 15 to 18 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So going forward, let's say once we get onto the second quarter, assuming that everything else stays the same, that is volumes carrying and oil prices, are we then to expect that your margin will be stronger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think they will be stronger, but not because of the detail but because of the costs in the locomotives. We will start receiving locomotives at the end of this month. We will receive 8 in April and another 22 in the month of May and we will &#x2013; we have already started to deliver back the leased locomotives. So the best &#x2013; we will have a better performance from the new locomotives and we should be improving our mileage significantly in the rest of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon and thanks for the call. Well, my first question is regarding Buenavista. Could you give us more information regarding the status of the Buenavista mine <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:15) do you think that of the production that you are expecting for the second quarter? Also, the second question is regarding ASARCO, if you have any plan to extend the capacity of this company in the short or medium-term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you, Pablo. Let me take the ASARCO question and I'll ask my new colleague <mark type="ph" /> for some comment on (38:32) the Buenavista question. I mean, regarding ASARCO, yes, I mean, we &#x2013; as we have mentioned this company operate in Chapter 11 mode for five years; none of that means not a lot of exploration within the mines, which we've been conducting. We also believe that there is an expansion program that could be implemented. Unfortunately, and based on the transaction that we have propelled with Southern Copper and ASARCO combining under AMC, we cannot provide you with specific details at this point, but we do believe that there is a potential for growth in ASARCO mines as well. Regarding the Buenavista mines, Raul or Oscar you want to comment on this?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now on the Buenavista, our expectation for the second quarter, it's about close to 30,000 tons of copper production. That's certainly contingent of us getting the recovery where it should be and for the second half, about 90,000 tons. The capacity of production of Buenavista it's 15,000 tons per month at full steam, so for the whole year or for the remaining of the year it will be about 130,000 tons, so what we're expecting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Oscar. I would like just to add, I mean, if it wasn't very clear for you all, is that, that finally we got 10 mills that we have at the Buenavista Concentrator working, I mean, so really the mine plants are working at full capacity. It's a matter of doing those adjustments in the recovery of copper from the Concentrators mills, which we're working on. But we're happy to report that as we've announced in the past, we're working at full capacity. Thank you for the question.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I didn't listen to the Southern Copper conversation earlier today, so this might be a bit redundant, but I did want to just clarify issues on T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a. My first question relates to the original guidance on T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a for both 2011 and 2012; I'm referring to the production targets that you gave for those years back in May at a conference in Miami. And I'm just wondering how those numbers would be affected given the delay? And second of all, how much money, if any, you really put into the project so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you. Let me take this one. So I mean, first of all the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a, as you know, there was no production whatsoever in 2011, the project has been suspended. So there the 120,000 tons copper cathodes SX/EW cathode that's just the capacity of the project. I mean, regarding the investment, we invested $434 million. In the morning what our, my colleague was from corporate pointing out is that there is an important amount of the $430 million that were invested in mine equipment that could be used in our current, I mean, our other operations in Peru. And also, for instance, the SX/EW facility that have not, obviously been put in place, could be even some storage at the Buenavista mine. So we're conducting this analysis on what we can use in what other mines. I don't know if you want to add something, Raul or Oscar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add to what you just said Daniel that last year, in May, we were expecting to have this operation up and running by the fourth quarter of 2012; that was contingent of <mark type="ph" /> achieving (42:55) the construction in the first quarter of this year in 2011. Well, when we had the first postponement by the government in March, we indicated to the market that we were expecting it to start operations by 2013, given the delay that the government was imposing to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Oscar and I hope that we still will get this project underway after the political situation of Peru will finish. Then we will start talking again with the Minister of Mines in order to revise our Environmental Impact study that was reactive because of the question that the organism of the ONU mentioned and that we are answering right now. And as soon as we can present it to the government and we hope that the government &#x2013; we are also considering this project again. Then it will take us, like Raul mentioned, until the middle of 2013. And mainly at least $360 million of the $430 million we can use it here in Toquepala, Cuajone or Buenavista if in case that we cannot have the approval of the government of the project. But our first intention is to go ahead with the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And the guidance that you gave back then in May was over 1 million tons by 2013. In the absence of T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a, would you still be able to reach that kind of a level by 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our base case still considers T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a as part of these forecasts, but we have adjusted the production level for getting the million tons later on in time now. We're expecting to have it by 2014.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Well, first of all, I don't want to take too much time on this, but really congratulations on this quarter. I mean, given all the bad news around China and then on the volatility of prices, and then after that the increase in energy prices. I mean, really this was an example of great management, so congratulations. And then I just have two questions. The first one is regarding the Peruvian situation. Do you have any comments on the current presidential elections? I mean, some information regarding the probable scenarios with &#x2013; in case I mean, Ollanta Humala would turn out to be President of Peru? And second, I don't know if you could give us some insight on the composition of the capitalized leachable material. I mean, I don't really get where does the increase come from? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, first of all, I mean, we don't have opinions, nor &#x2013; as regarding the elections in Peru. I mean, we've been mining Peru for many, many years and are confident that regardless of the outcome, there's going to be economic stability and growth and job protection for the mining investments in order to continue to thrive there.</p>
          <p>Regarding the capital efficiency leaching process, I mean, we've standardized all our mines as to start capitalizing leaching material in all our mines and really the idea has been to have, with the same accounting practices, not only the Southern Copper mines, but also we have ASARCO mines. As you know, because the difference will be how much do you capitalize of each mine and that has to do with the amount of copper that you can extract in a given timeframe from each different mine, but the idea is to reflect this so that everyone's clear and that this is totally standardized among our operations.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen. I think we have gone through a lot of the issues. But I was just wondering if you could clarify a couple of points. One, in terms of the realized copper price for ASARCO after adjusting for the hedges, what was that in the first quarter? And secondly, the Mission moly circuit that you mentioned, could you just talk a little bit more about a potential timeframe on delivery and potential size?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, the impact of the realized price has gone down from $4.50 to $4.20; that is the effect of the hedges on the quarter. Regarding ASARCO, that was your specific question. And can you repeat second question, please so I can hear; you broke off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry, just on the Mission moly circuit, could you give us a bit more color on the potential size of that circuit and the timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. That is &#x2013; as you know in the past, there's been recovered molybdenum &#x2013; I mean, previously in ASARCO. Thus, at this point we are estimating 100 &#x2013; 800 tons of molybdenum per year at an investment of $3 million dollars. I don't know if you to add Oscar to the molybdenum circuit issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And if I may ask one more question just to confirm, on the Ferromex the &#x2013; obviously, the overall volume growth has diluted the percentage share of agriculture. Is there any sort of seasonal effect in terms of this being a disappointing season for agri or should we expect agri volumes to remain reasonably stable over the next few years and within Ferromex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, agriculture and actually you might recall that because of the cold weather in early February the most important crop in Mexico, which is in the northwest in the States of Sinaloa and Sonora, 90% of that was lost. That is going to have an effect on our volumes in May and June, but that we are expecting that should be recovered through imports, both from the U.S. and also through the ports. So they will have an effect on us, but we're estimating that will be no more than 5,000 cars. They have &#x2013; we will have a new crop in the State of Sinaloa in the months of September and October and we are expecting to have enough equipment or grain hoppers for that time. It is seasonal mainly for us. The main months have been in the past May, June and July. We will continue to have them, but not as strong as in previous years. But the months of September and October should be strong &#x2013; stronger than a year ago or the previous years because of this situation. Did I &#x2013; did that answer your question?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. My name is Gustavo <mark type="ph" /> Maredo (51:34). Most of my question is political more than about numbers. I'm a little bit concerned about the next &#x2013; of the president election the next year between Mr. Ollanta and Mrs. Keiko Fujimori. I would like to know the future of Southern Peru if Mr. Ollanta is trying to being like the next Ch&#xE1;vez. If you know, if this is possible because Mr. Mario Vargas Llosa is quoting that it will be a catastrophe if Mr. Ollanta could be the next president of Peru. Could you expand more about this election? How would be the future of GM&#xE9;xico in Peru?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you for your question. I mean, as I've pointed out in the scuttle, I mean, we are not in the business of analyzing political situations there. What would be &#x2013; obviously, I mean, we've been mining in Peru for more than 50 years and we're confident that regardless of the political situation there, I mean, what happens in the election, the Peruvian government will provide the legal stability to allow for economic development of mining investments and favorable and legal economic conditions for the growth and development of the company and of Peru, of course. So that is really what we can answer to your concerns. But &#x2013; and there's two months to the elections and let's wait and see, thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes, unfortunately, I have a similar question than the one that was previously asked, because I think most of the operating question were answered. I understand that you're not in the business of forecasting or analyzing political risks. But I want to know if you sort of had discussion with economic team of Mr. Humala and have a sense for what the range of outcome can be in terms of the taxes, the royalty, or windfall taxes. I mean, I'm just trying to understand what the impact will be on Southern Copper. And if you don't mind reminding me, how much of the EBITDA you'd be generating from Peru versus Mexico in the Southern Copper entity? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is really the breakdown of the EBITDAS. I mean, Raul, do you want to mention something regarding taxation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me comment on what the plans of the two candidates are regarding mining taxation. On the site of Mrs. Fujimori, their economic team has indicated that they may consider a change in the way that the royalty taxes are charged. They may change it from being a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:28) to a contribution based on your sales level. That may be changed to a contribution based on operating profit. That's the only change that they have indicated, they believe they could do or they may do. In case of the Mr. Humala party, their plan states that they are considering increasing income taxes by about 10% to mining companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any comments on windfall taxes or increased royalty from the Humala camp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I just mentioned that they want to increase income tax by 10% to mining companies as a way to collect the windfall profit tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Anything else? No? No further sort of clarification?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what they have communicated so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And based on that, how do you see that impacting your plan and your outlook over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't think that it's wise to speculate on these two outcomes because in many cases once you have a new president elected, this person review, the Ferrosur information that access to industry and as a consequence, they may change their mind. It has happened in the past. It has happened with the current President, Mr. Garcia. He indicated that he was going to charge some additional taxes to mining companies and after he took over office and saw how mining companies were contributing to revenues at the government level, he decided not to go ahead with this higher taxation. So sometimes, once in office, the former candidate and new President think about what they said and look at the hard data and change their mind. So at this point it doesn't make any sense for us to make further comments other than stating what is in the candidate's plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last question, sorry, if I may. Then do you &#x2013; do you have any EBITDA guidance for the Southern Copper entity and kind of debt level, would that change at all. I mean, you're still going for the production of almost 700,000, even though the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project has been delayed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance in production is 630,000 for Southern Copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and but for '12, it still remains 700,000 for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that will be adjusted because we are not having the &#x2013; on the last quarter, the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a contribution and we are currently evaluating the Toquepala Expansion project in order to determine if we are going to increase the milling capacity from the current estimate change from 60,000 to 100,000 or up to 120,000. So at this point that guidance will have to be changed. We're waiting for foresee how the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a evolves in order to adjust our 2012 estimated production.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good afternoon, thank you very much. Feel free to answer these questions very quickly given that we are now approaching the end of the call. My first question is regarding the update on any synergy potential from the combination of Southern Copper and ASARCO and also if you have any guidance or estimates on the synergies coming out of Ferromex and Ferrosur, that would my first question. The second question is regarding the strategy on Infrastructure. Going back to a point which you made initially in the call, would you be contemplating any Infrastructure-related investments outside of Mexico, that's my second question more strategically on the Infrastructure business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you, let me answer the &#x2013; real quick. Not only do we believe that there are synergies to be obtained in ASARCO and Southern Copper. I mean, we think that a lot of synergies have to do with geographic proximity, but there are others that we are looking at even between Peru and ASARCO. So unfortunately, details and numbers we'll have to provide after we have more information to give you regarding the transaction. At this moment we, unfortunately, cannot, given the regulation in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Regarding Infrastructure investments, we've been concentrating in Mexico. Really, we are looking at projects very specifically and projects that we believe that have very high IRR and low risk and that we could really pull it off with the human resources and better beliefs of the company. So, we're concentrating currently in Mexico, although, I mean, we have a team that looks at Central America opportunities in the past and have looked at those, nothing to report there.</p>
          <p>Regarding Ferromex and Ferrosur, regarding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:16) facility, you want to comment something, Oscar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have opportunities still, especially in the operating areas, where we have to work on the systems, on the &#x2013; because one company has one system, one operating system and the other one, another operating system. So it depends on how fast we can have the same operating systems, the synergies will be possible. We still don't have a number but we think can be an important number within the two companies.</p>
