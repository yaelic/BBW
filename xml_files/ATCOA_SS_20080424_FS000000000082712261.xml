          <p>Welcome to the Atlas Copco Q1 Results Conference Call. For your information today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Hans Ola Meyer. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and welcome everybody to this first quarter conference call. We have this call for the next hour or so, and then we proceed here in Stockholm to our Annual General Meeting that starts at about 5 O'clock.</p>
          <p>So with that, I don't want to hold you from questions-and-answers session, but just before that I'd like as usual to hand over to Gunnar Brock our CEO of the Group, who will give his comments to this first quarter. Please, Gunnar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans Ola, and good afternoon, everyone. As customary, I'll refer to the power point pictures that you have on the web. I'll quote the numbers, so you at least know where we are in the presentation.</p>
          <p>I'll be rather brief and hopefully give you the opportunity to ask questions. I'll start on slide number three, the highlights. I think we are quite pleased to see that it's another consecutive quarter of very strong growth. Actually it's the highest orders received ever in the group. We do have some rather tough comparisons if we look at the figures for Q1 '07 and also if you look back at Q1 '06 so it's been a tough history to be.</p>
          <p>The good thing is also that we've seen good growth and good performance basically all over the world in all regions and from all business areas. I'll come back to that a bit later but today close to 45% of our orders received are actually coming from what we labeled the emerging market.</p>
          <p>It's also been a very good profit development because we have had like everybody else; we have had that adverse material cost increases. We have had quite some currency headwinds. We tend to talk about headwinds and we've done so for five years and one day we may come back and talk about tailwind, but for the moment it's still the gains task.</p>
          <p>I'll come back to that a bit later and also I'm sure &#x2013; Hans Ola Mayer to give you a little bit of a feel for where it is, because it's both in the transaction side and the revaluation of the receivables end March.</p>
          <p>Slide four, orders up 21% organic growth of 11, it was a revenue increase of 28% and a profit increase of 28% as well and earnings per share that improved by a 24%. I will not dwell much more in that but jump to Slide six where you have the world map and you see the orders received in local currency.</p>
          <p>So we're up 24%, take away 13% and you get the structural growth. The structured growth of 13 and you get the remaining organic growth, which was 11% and as you can see from the distribution around the world it was pretty strong all over. What you cannot see is that towards the organic growth and just to mention some figures; North America grew organically 19% as a company and if you take C&amp;T in North America, it was up 30% and compressor technique was up 13%. So it was quite a strong organic growth as well and in those areas. We may come back to that also a bit later.</p>
          <p>Turning onto Slide seven, what has changed since we spoke at the last conference call is that the increased activity we talked about at that time in the coal industry has gained momentum and we have seen some very good order inflows from the American coal mining companies and in our case, it's entirely for the surface drill rigs. But we also see that in the Australian business, coal mining is gaining momentum there as well. And we believe that this trend is going to stay with us and continue for quite some time.</p>
          <p>Also positively, we've seen the NVI, the motor vehicle industry that has been very anemic for about two years in North America sort of gaining life again and with some very good figures for the NVI in the US particularly. On the then slightly more negative side, we could say that what we did see in the previous quarter in the Q4 of 2007 still is true and that the construction business mainly related to the housing and residential areas is still pretty weak. An interesting point though is, as I mentioned earlier, we had a growth &#x2013; organic growth of 30% for CMT in US and Dynapac actually clocked in US dollars a 15% growth in the quarter, which translates as a good sign.</p>
          <p>If we then move to the South America, which of course is very much driven by what happens in Brazil. It was also a very good month. South America had an organic growth of about 14% and total you could see 29%. And of course, the main engine in that market area is Brazil, which is continuing to do very well in all business areas.</p>
          <p>Turning then to Slide eight; Europe, Africa, Middle East, we've seen some rather good development in Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe, Poland, Russia in particular. We also see good demand from the NVI and manufacturing industries. Mining particular in the Eastern European and, of course, Russia basically has been very strong, and some areas related to residential construction like Spain, some other pockets have been weaker.</p>
          <p>In Africa it's been really a good growth and of course, driven to a large extent by mining demand, but also industrial demand in South Africa has been good. But then of course as you may know, the South African brand has been very much against us.</p>
          <p>And finally, Asia and Australia has been showing some good developments. If I take the organic growth for CMT in Asia, it was 47% up. If I take the organic growth for IT, it was 12, and CT just short of 10. So it's been a rather good growth picture in that area as well. And Australia is continuing to do well.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Slide 10, and there is not so much to talk about more than the positive bars add up to 24. And the momentum is there.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Bridge, Slide 11, you can see that the organic growth in the orders received was about 11 and 18% in the revenue side. As I said it was the highest ever orders received. Currency the bridge is 3%. And if you take what I initially talked about and split the currency exposure into basically two parts. One is the transactional comparison of the average rates Q1 '08 and Q1 '07. It's about 200 million, and then the other close to 200 million negative effect is coming from the revaluation of our receivables in March, which is to be compared to the value of those in December. And of course with the growing invoicing in not only US Dollars but in the South African Rand and Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars, it has of course been a challenge. But I think we have weathered that we very well.</p>
          <p>If you then go to the next slide &#x2013; number 13.  I'm not, don't think I need to talk too much about that I think I go straight to  number 14 and make the comment in relation to the business areas. We had good growth in compressor technique as you know we sometimes talk about Gas and Process being a very project driven business. And if you take away some very large, two large orders in Korea last year during that time actually the organic growth is not eight but rather 12.</p>
          <p>Then we had also fuel information excited installation business, which represents about 1% drop, its installation business connected to medical areas. It's a business that really doesn't contribute much in terms of strength in our supply and it's actually a rather bad business and we do not need to be there. So there we have shared about 1%. So adjusting for that we think it's a pretty strong organic growth.</p>
          <p>Now acquisitions, Dynapac, ABAC and Greenfield are basically going according to plan. We are still not able to supply most of those acquired compressors with our own compressors screws due to our inability of capacity. So that's still drags about 1% point on the EBIT.</p>
          <p>If you then, and I'm not making excuses here I'm just giving the true picture, if you then take the 2% effect of the currency, the one on the acquisition and then the fact that in the revenue the Gas and Process business has in much higher share this year than last quarter. And as you also know that business is it's a little bit less profitable than the rest of the compressor business, that takes away another 0.5% of the margin. So I think allowing for that we are very pleased with how the development has been.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, turning to CMT, we still see some very good demand, although in the construction and housing related part it's a bit slower in US and in Europe. The infrastructure business is very good in most parts of the worlds and that is perhaps why we could record a 15% dollar orders received increasing in US given the otherwise rather bleak construction business in US.</p>
          <p>The Dynapac business has developed well. The effects of our program that we've talked about during our previous conference call is starting to bite and as you can see we did have a &#x2013; an EBIT margin of 9.6%. If you then allow for currencies it would have been rather 11.5. So the program that's being implemented is starting to show effect and we cannot say that everything is home and dry but things are looking pretty much better. And it is going to contribute in the two to three years after acquisition with 15% EBIT. We've said that before and we have every reason to state that again.</p>
          <p>Cost to market did grow extremely well and well over 30% for CMT, which of course is very interesting given the future revenue stream and profit stream from the aftermarket. Then if we try to make the same kind of bridge for CMT as for CT, about 3 percentage points on currencies negative and about 1.5 due to acquisitions. So despite those figures of 4.5 the margin ended at 17%.</p>
          <p>Let me then go to Slide 18 and Industrial Technique. As I've said earlier we've seen some good business volume for MVI in both America and in Europe. Asia a little bit weaker this quarter but seen over the 12 months period it's still very strong. The drop in margin compared to last year is due to a little bit currency but the mix is slightly different. We have more project business than component sales, which has some effect on the margins and then the acquisitions of KTS in Japan beginning of year has added more costs and &#x2013; than revenue so far that we've think that will correct itself as the year goes on. Fair?</p>
          <p>Let's then jump to Slide 21, I don't think I need to read out aloud but what you can see, I think we have been talking about that previously so move to the profit bridges. Neither do I want to say much there. Those of you who have the slides with you from last conference call they flow through after Q4 was 40, here its 41. The difference here to the negative side is IT, and that's weaker. But that has to do with the &#x2013; with what I just mentioned on the mix of products, and the higher rates of engineered installations where things can have an effect of that magnitude.</p>
          <p>So before we come towards the end on the balance sheet I think I can skip that and move to 26 and talk about the cash flow. By and large we think the cash flow was still good, above last year and now we have been thinking or plowing or whatever expression you may use, a bit more then would like into the inventory. We have today substantially along the supply lines a lot of the equipment coming from Europe, US, to South America to Australia, Asia and we have also seen quit some delays in components supplies from our some suppliers. Adding this together it means that the time from starting to buy until we get pay from the customers has been a bit longer. But some of this we will deal with and the work in progress will be reduced and so will the inventory build up. So I think we will be back to more normal levels in the quarter or so. I don't think there is much to say about the previous line 25 of the capital structure, you can read that, it's going down and keeping with the cash flow rate.</p>
          <p>So trying to summarize before I hand over to all of you, I think we have seen some very good demand from being at what we deem to be very high levels. Currency is going to against us, raw material prices have been against us. We have seen something like advantages from business area to business area, but 1 to 2% product cost increase due to these component supply price increases. But we have been able to pass these on to the marketplace and if you have seen our price reach has been a bit higher than that. Under the integration of acquired companies and some supply issues, where we still feel we have a bit of a problem to get components for some of our suppliers. Adding all this up, I think we're pretty happy with what we've managed to contribute during the quarter. So by ending here I've also being late, also Investor Relations are happy to take all your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen and ladies. First question quickly. Just you've mentioned in your outlook statement that the construction slowed down in Europe where you expecting housing construction to be slow in Europe, which I guess, we were all thinking the same as well. And could you just confirm and clarify what you think the impact at the group level is or what the exposure is? I think at the Capital Market's Day you said that housing was less than 10% of your total construction exposures that means less than 2% of group roughly, is that the right calculation? And second question and a lot of companies talking about an Easter impact and your organic order growth was a little bit surprisingly low. Do you think there was any kind of Easter impact on your organic growth number or should we take that at face value? And the third question, it seems of your working capital; I mean that was quite a big outflow. I think you sort of partly explained, but do you think that &#x2013; you said in a couple of quarters it's going to get better. Is it really going to be that long or do you think this is now a permanent level that we maybe at now? I mean, what you have &#x2013; actually have to do in order to get that working capital down and do you think that you can get it all back? It seems the whole dynamics of the supply chain might have changed a little bit now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Many questions, I will be brief. Yes you're right in your estimates of the impact of residential construction. So that's confirmed. Easter impact, well I think, the impact of Easter we will see when we have April and we put March and April together and compare that with last year. But I &#x2013; obviously, there is an Easter impact to some extent. There is also &#x2013; we should not forget that China was standing still due to the snowfall and we had &#x2013; in January and early February, and we had factories that did not get any supply for 10 days to two weeks, which meant that we were not basically able to deliver from those factories. I'm not sure we should say that orders received was surprisingly low. I'm not going to argue with that, Nick, but I think we're pretty happy particularly, if you compare to the extremely good Q1 last year and the year before. And also if you allow for those project orders in gas and process that I'm pretty positive will come. But if they come on one or the other side of the quarter then it's &#x2013; it makes a difference.</p>
          <p>Then thirdly working capital, well some of it is clearly going to be rectified by what I've said earlier. Some of these &#x2013; and type of actions is not only of course getting the sub-suppliers to deliver. It is also when you send a drill rigs from Garland, Texas to Australia. It's a long, long road or it's a big sea, but also we have a lot of product adaptations we have to do when the products come to Australia; safety aspects et cetera and what we are contemplating now is perhaps it may be better to do those at the factory rather than in the market because we're not as efficient of course in the customer's centers as we are in the factories.</p>
          <p>So I think some of it will clearly be taken care of. Some of it may also be a bit of, how should I say, bit of lack of discipline in some areas. And there's a lot of equipment standing ready to be invoiced and shipped and that of course can make quite a big difference. We've seen that before. I think the only lasting effect to end your three questions, I think the only lasting effect and it's not so easy to give you a clear answer is just that, as our customers tend to be located further and further away from our factories and as we are moving components from for instance India and China to our European factories where we earlier had those components supplied from nearby countries this will have some effect on what I would call longer supply line. But I don't think it will have a material effect. I think the cash generation that we have shown in the past, I think, we will continue to deliver pretty well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you feel comfortable with the same working capital to sales ratio that you've worked out for the last few years from sort of '09 onwards again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; I can't see exactly now what the ratio was, but I think that &#x2013; I don't see any sort of real reason barring this little change in supply anatomy, as I talked about. It's of course, you've got shorter payment terms from Swedish and German customers than from perhaps Vietnamese, and surely we know in Japan it's under 20 days like it or not. But I don't see a real reason why we should not be able to do that. And of course when you grow, I think, you all must keep in mind that, when you grow as much as we've been doing, when customers are not happy with the delivery times, your main priority is not working capital. Your main priority is to satisfy the delivery times that apply. Now we have seen a lot of air freights during the last years. Air freights are not cheap, but they have been necessary in order to meet those delivery deadlines. So I feel reasonably or quite comfortable, Nick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just add to the question relation to sales, that is not a ratio that we normally put targets on, but if I take the working capital to trailing 12 month sales it is correct that from March last year, we have a slightly higher percentage of sales, about 1 percentage point higher, but if we compare to the situation at the end of 2007, it's actually almost the same or slightly lower even percentage to trailing 12 months. So the pattern is little bit difficult to read when it comes to what is a good cash flow quarter. So I would definitely support Gunnar's comments in that that the first one single quarter is very difficult to read, and we are here confident that there are certain effects that will be rectified without any doubt.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could help us a bit with the currency effect throughout this year? If you have any guidance therefore for 2008? I'll stop there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It is a little bit of a mouthful to try to keep track. I fully understand that. The 380 effect compared to last years currency rates that we talk about is explained a little bit in the report. And if you are a little bit rough quick analysis on that is to say that a little bit more than half of that, or let's say around half of that effect comes from the average rates in the first quarter last year being more favorable than in this quarter. The other half of the effect is really this, what Gunnar also already eluded to, that we have to revalue the existing customer receivables at period end rates of March 31. And if you have a sharp pool in the quarter, this will have an impact on the profits, clearly, in the first quarter result of this year. And last year in the first quarter we did not have at all that type of effect of this revaluation. So put it in another word. The first part we definitely expect to continue to be negative, which means that the average rate of the second, third, and the fourth quarter last year will continue to be better in our minds than what we see this year. And everything I say is of course taking as an assumption that the rates we see today will stay for the remainder of the year. I'm going back then to how we see that play out.  If we use that assumption, we believe that we will have a negative effect, perhaps not as big, but very close to it also in the second quarter compared to the second quarter last year. But then in the third and the fourth quarter, we see that come down to perhaps half of that impact and again all the time comparing with the same quarter of previous year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Have you changed anything in your hedging policies following a very sharp decline in the dollar and many other currencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have commented earlier, latest at the Capital Market's Day and also in our annual report that we don't have a currency policy, which means that we're hedging &#x2013; I'll say that we're hedging on a regular basis. In this quarter as we wrote in the comment to the &#x2013; in the quarterly report we have some corporate hedges for some currencies, including part of the dollar exposure, et cetera. That actually has limited a little bit the effect in the first quarter. We have some of those hedges are still in place, but I repeat we are not hedging on a regular basis the full exposure, and this of course based on the conviction that over a long period of time it is not in the interest of the company to do currency hedges. And it's just a way of moving effects from volatile currency markets from one quarter to another over a longer period of time, and we don't think that the company's profitability level is such that we have to protect 100% every quarter, so to speak. And that &#x2013; so in some moments the management has the opportunity to do certain specific hedges on certain currencies, and &#x2013; but it is not going to happen as a routine every quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I perhaps just add to that that we have a philosophy here, and that is to let our Business Area Presidents run their businesses on spot.  We don't want them to have any comfort level of any hedges. They have to live in the real world and adapt to the ever changing currencies, and I think this is a very, very good discipline, and I think that's one of the reasons why we've been able to compensate a lot of these headwinds by price increases. They do not have the comfort at all of any hedges, and that's the way it should be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Okay, so frankly in approximately same level in 2Q and approximately half of the level in the second half of 2008, year-over-year would be a good number to -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's probably a good guess with the information that we all have today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Can I ask a very short &#x2013; maybe you touched upon this earlier but I don't know if I understood it correctly, how do you see in your supplies handling the surge in input prices and then well metals in different kinds and then oil and so on? Have they approached you and tried to get it through any price yet that will come in six to nine months do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have had this constantly over the last years with high demands on price increases.  Now we don't, as you probably know, buy a lot of true raw material and machine and manufacture the parts. We do a rather limited business in that area. Most of what we buy are of course components that have been passed in one or two hands and if you have an iron ore price increase of 60% it may add up to a steel price increase of 45 and once it comes as a component to one of our rigs or compressors it is even less. Now as I said earlier we have actually &#x2013; 1 to 2% if I take compressor &#x2013; for instance 1 to 2% cost increases due to all things equal due to increases from our suppliers, now we have been able to compensate that by price increases and  of course we also more and more can utilize our global sourcing we have today in compressor for instance quite a number of hands now India, China and a couple in Europe and also US and Brazil. So we are now able to move components more freely to make what I use to call the business area of currency neutrals so that can whether these currency changes as well as input price increases. We haven't seen much sort of intensifying demands up till now on price increase I think they are there all the time given the what you've seen on the metal and minerals prices and also on coal of course</p>

          <p>Gentlemen, hi. Good afternoon. My question is just about the buyback actually, I had a question on working capital but you've answered it can you just talk about your plans once more I know you have the approval but how certain is it that you will use your full 10% ability to buyback your shares this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I talked, it's to answer the ending of your question it's not the whole certain that we will use the full mandate in any way, the mandate is of course an ability &#x2013; gives the company an ability to adjust the balance sheet and the financing of the balance sheet in relation to the opportunities to acquire companies to grow &#x2013; continue to grow in other words &#x2013; in other ways. So there is no plan per quarter or per months at all, if I put it that way. The view is of course of that the company is generating a good underlying cash flow, but again I underline that as always our first priority is to grow on those investments and acquisitions in growth is always priority number one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps just adding to that besides the &#x2013; the unknown exactly when acquisitions will happen because I know it's a bit erratic.  You cannot plan them all the time.  Besides that I think it is perhaps to set this on the line of your conscience is slightly weak I mean we have &#x2013; we are going to the AGM in one hour's time and asking for that with intention to utilize it. It's not just good to have, I think the intention is, that we should utilize, but to what extend reality will detect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you're deciding whether or not to use this and obviously that gets impacted by potential acquisitions. Can you talk about your balance sheet thinking therefore with regards to whether or not to use it. Obviously excluding any potential acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have answered similar questions in this way before that in previous year we did a major capital restructuring and immediately following that the ratios of our invested nets in relation to EBITDA as well as the absolute level of our equity was in the first ratio a little bit short of two debt to EBITDA ratio and in the other case that equity in absolute value was somewhere north of 10 billion between 10 and 11 billion. And of course, if the company continues to generate profit, restore equity, reduce debt et cetera in the pace we have been doing in the quarters after this capital restructuring. We have the ability of course and a view that we can move the ratios by either through acquisition and of profit investment or by buyback in that range. Today we have a net debt to EBITDA of 1.3 and we have an absolute value of equity of about 16 billion. So if you see that as a sort of span over something at least that's exactly what we have had following the major capital restructuring less than a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's your clear intention to use the permission which you gave the AGM and we've been given the current balance sheet target so you would still kind of aim at one way or another for acquisitions and all buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And obviously this is a mandate that lasts for 12 months and we have a Board meeting more than once a quarter, so obviously this is what Gunnar alluded to that there would be obviously many opportunities. Both to look at what we are doing, talk about what we have been announcing in the quarter that has passed, when we meet the next time and so on and so forth. I think that is the way we see a mandate cash should be used and not as a very fixed plan for the next two or three quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Your statement obviously and you mentioned on the phone about sort of downturn in residential. But when you look through the divisions you're mentioning a downturn in portable compressors in Western Europe and North America. You're also talking about I think weakening for rock drilling in quarries, et cetera. This sounds to me a little bit more than just residential. Can you perhaps just expand a little bit on the outlook? And we also heard for a second question a little bit about the weather impact on your factories in China. One gathers there could be some substantial shutdowns to industry in run out to the Olympics. Do you see if this that something that's likely to affect you later in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll like to start with the last one. I have no idea really whether government will shutdown industries in view of the Olympics, to clear there or so to speak. I think it will &#x2013; if that is to happen, I don't think it will have a major impact on the overall investment. The investment will be made before or after. So, I think on the investment goods like ours I don't think it will over some time it could have if it really happens. But not everything is located around Beijing. On the residential side well the US portable area as you mentioned. There the buyer or large buying group or of course the rental companies and the rental companies have really not been buying much. Now if you look at the non-residential volumes &#x2013; non-residential construction volumes, as is reported we still have an interest in ROC, our ex-rental business. It's actually not that bad, that is and so I think in this case it's more a timing issues of how they are elected to buy portables. In Europe you see the same, we have had some very good orders from some rental companies in Western Europe. So I don't think we need to over emphasize the downside of that. They are always erratic in their buying behavior. The &#x2013; yes, quarries it's not always very easy to decide if what is happening in the quarries, where it ends up a lot of quarries are also of course working for infrastructure. So I don't think that as we can read it there is more to it, than what we say. So that takes care of your question on the outlook actually.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. It's Ben Maslen from Merrill Lynch. Couple of quick question, firstly the Dynapac margin can you just may be breakdown how much that the up tick in profitability was seasonal and how much is coming from the program and maybe because we haven't seen a whole year of that business yet is the second quarter normally more profitable than the first one? That's the first question. Secondly, incremental margins in Compressor and Construction and Mining Techniques still very strong at 40% they've been running at that level for as long as you reported them, any reason that you can't sustain this run rate based on what you see in the backlog and raw material prices going forward? And then finally, just on the acquisition contribution in Compressor Technique it's much lower in Q1 than it was in Q4 and then you said you had some delays in terms of getting components can you just give more clarity on what's going on there and just how quickly you can fix those issues? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Dynapac yes, some of the improvement is clearly due to the measures we are taking but there started to take effect we can now deliver favors from out factories in Germany which we had difficulties to do before we are also getting supply from some European suppliers to our compactors and rollers. So the program is having one effect surely the Q1 is as of course, we all know better than Q4 but what I can say is that our Q1 this year was actually better than the previous owners Q1, which to me I think is pretty comforting because it shows that we are doing something right. Now Q2 compared to Q1 is normally slightly better. But to say that we are experts on this already I think is to go a little bit too far I think we are coming to grips with it. I think the outlook if I may take that opportunity the outlook of having Dynapac as a major contributor to growth and profits and the group is clearly there. So we have this set back of as we talk about many times. Now I think we looked a bit of  six months or something like that but its not much we could do about. The incremental margins was the next question. Yes. I think so I think we should be able to do that. We- this whole reasoning rests basically on our position in the market place and being the number one with the relative market share in most cases substantially, higher than number two with a presence that truly is global compared to few others and with a high degree of new product introductions. Today close to 50% of all our products are coming from products that's- sorry sales is coming from, products about three years and younger. So given that, yes, I think we will be able to show you that and until our race ends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can perhaps a little bit if you ask specifically on the bridge of these acquisitions there and I understand your question because it &#x2013; if we adjust and I'm now commenting Slide 23, for those of you that didn't understand exactly where then was coming from. The column that said one time items and acquisition divestments indicates 6% impact from that and of course we also know that there is a 90 million capital gain in the quarter. So taking that away is a very, very meager percentage held from acquisition divestments. So you are quiet right. The fact is that the acquisitions that we have added being ABAC outlook primarily Mafi-Trench, Greenfield in the LNG business and the couple of other smaller distributors. They have actually contributed with about an EBIT margin of 7% let's say roughly. So what is the rest and well we have also divested rental business. A part of the rental field in Europe and in &#x2013; as we also did in the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year. And as you remember when we had our business area rental it's a very normally &#x2013; a very good EBIT margin, but it of course eats a lot of capital. So that is the reason when we divest that we sort of have a negative effect if you like because they were operating at good EBIT margins. So that's I hopefully explained a little bit why the impact seems very, very low from acquisitions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Could I just ask you to elaborate a little bit on the trends that you've seen in construction. What pockets in Europe other than Spain have you seen any signs of weakness in and do you see any risks in the quarters ahead that this might spread in to a more generally challenging environment for your construction related exposures beyond residential? And could I also ask you about acquisitions if given the capital market turmoil that we've seen recently with equity market corrections if you have. Any greater opportunities or additional new potential candidates to look at when it comes to potential acquisitions for the remainder of this year on the back of evaluations perhaps looking a little bit less demanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me try to answer the construction side. Again, what we mainly see is the residential related. If you look at infrastructure and you also can say if you are from Nordea you just have to look at Norlink here in Sweden. But similar you've got quite some projects in Europe in the infrastructure area and I could very well see this moving even higher if there is trouble in the other area &#x2013; that countries and governments stimulate this part. Then if you go East, then look at Central or Eastern Europe and Russia, it seems to continue with at a high speed. So I think Spain is becoming sort of a particularly much talked about country, because they had such an enormous construction activity when they were a net beneficiary of funds from EU. Now when they are a net contributor of funds you'll see perhaps less money going into construction and that also includes infrastructure in Spain. But for the rest of Europe, I'm not so concerned when it comes to the rest of the world and I'm talking now about infrastructure related not on housing related. For the rest of the world it looks still very strong, Latin America, Brazil, yes, Asia, yes, Southern Africa yes.</p>
          <p>Yes, acquisitions. We have a strategy to try to over time grow about one-third to acquired companies and about two-thirds organically and there is no change in that philosophy. And overtime, it has turned out that way. Yes, you &#x2013; theoretically you could say evaluations are less demanding, but I am not sure we have seen any more vigorous supply or companies to be sold. I think also the other side of that point is that everyone who owns a business believes its worth more than anybody else believes. So they believe they can keep it and sell it at a higher price. So I am not &#x2013; we have not really seen, so we are, we are closing on all the time looking at a number of companies. And as I said we closed one today &#x2013; sorry, we didn't close, we signed one today. And which we did get substantially cheaper, because when we made the deal the dollar was higher. We would have bought it anyhow. But it is a very important company about a 150 million Swedish crowns turn over of boosters and compressors for high pressure oil and gas application. But we are looking at many others. So perhaps some of those companies during the last couple of years we did not buy, because we were not willing to compete with some of the private equity companies that are bolt-on.  Perhaps some of those maybe beyond the blocks, but in that case we will be there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Could you please help us to split the organic order intake within the interior 14%. How much was the construction part growing and how much was the mining part growing. And also remind us of the ratio of the portable business that you referred to during the first quarter and the magnitude of the order growth positively or negative there. Secondly, pricing, very strong pricing in the interior business, any more price increases in the pipeline?  Then I have some house-warming questions for Hans Ola about elimination and profits from discontinued operation going forward. But the first one was the most important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can hardly wait for &#x2013; we can hardly wait for those questions, Johan, right?  Oh, Peder, sorry.  Yes, we had an organic growth CMT of 15% split regionally on 30% in Americas, 47 in Asia, et cetera. We &#x2013; if I say it's a portable, I don't think the ratio of the total sales of portable has changed a lot, because it's been quite good in other markets, although as we said just little while ago it's been erratic in the U.S particularly due to the rental companies. So I don't think it's a portable share of total CMT sales has really moved much.</p>
          <p>How much of organic growth is construction and how much is mining, I cannot really tell you, because one is we don't follow it exactly in that way, but there is a slightly higher share of the total CMT business, which is mining than construction. And if you take away Dynapac as an isolated entity, of course, by far the biggest contributor is mining and not construction. So from that point of view, it's not so important. And as I said earlier, the growth of Dynapac organically has been about flat in the quarter. But as I said also in dollar terms, 15% up in U.S and very good figures in Asia. So it's not easy to give you a better answer than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If there is pricing still in the order book, is that what you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean more of a planned price increases after your clients coming on stream in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and yes. Well, I'll say that is that as I said earlier, our business area Presidents do not have the comfort of hedges.  They live in the real spot world. So they see of course, I mean, our South African colleagues, they have seen the run tumble and most of the production is not in South Africa, although we have drill steel and drill bits in South Africa. So of course, they are very much on the board to move prices and so are everyone else. The currency is the one part, and of course, the spending material price increases or component prices increases being another part. So that you see if look historically, we have been able to even in times with worse currency effect and coupled with the material increases, we have been able to move prices. So yes, we are definitely going to try to maintain the price increase momentum and not absorb the cost increases of the currencies more than whatever is necessary. So and here of course our global positions and leadership is supporting us together with new product introductions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So also a profit for this continued operations, 184 million in the quarter, what's the expectation level that we have jumping going forward also eliminations being quite low in the quarter of 53 million?  I know this is a horrible question, but some guidance please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now when you say eliminations you mean in the corporate costs or what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if we start with that one as I alluded to earlier, in what we report as net corporate costs, we have a positive effect of close to 100 million in from these corporate hedges that offset a portion of the negative currency impact that the business areas report. And that is of course included in the 380 net that we talked about. So that means that it's not a good indication for a run rate of the corporate costs in this quarter. It will probably return to higher number, higher negative numbers than that. That's one part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second one deals with the 184. When we saw rentals, we also went through a quite a substantial capital restructuring within that group, and in those movements of capital, we of course have to estimate certain tax implications of that. And with hindsight now having had an audited year 2007 behind us, we see that our tax provisions were a little bit too high. So hence we release the big portion of those reserves, and that gave an impact of 184 million positive, which is a tax item and it's an item that is entirely related to the discontinued operations of rentals. So hence we didn't want to confuse the continuing business with a very, very positive impact of tax cost in this quarter. So hence it is reported as a discontinued operation. That you can &#x2013; you should not expect that to be repeated in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>But has that anything to do with &#x2013; well, this was obviously very high in the fourth quarter given this, but and then at least I expect that to covert coming into the fourth quarter this year with the lower tax rate, is that a wrong assumption then?</p>

          <p>I think now we have &#x2013; we are running close to the end, we have possibly time for one final question and then we'll have to defer all the other questions to Lindgren, Sune, or myself after this call, as we usually do. So one final question operator, please.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. It's Fredric Stahl here from UBS. I guess a quick one a clarification just on the residential exposure was the roughly 2% exposure you had, was that for the group or for North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was the net effect for the group that comes down the way Nick, I think its was Nick that alluded to it, was by saying that coming from the global exposure, which we in the annual report we referred to between 25 and 30% to construction in general. And then trying to take away from that the infrastructure exposure, which is by far the most important one, and then further on taking off the non-residential construction and so on. We come down to a much lower level if you then add to that that this is a regional phenomenon for that that is how we believe that the couple of percent is really related to the housing market, that that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now when you mention it, can you give me a number for non-residential exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in the same way I mean we don't cut the business in that way. As Gunnar said, we sell our equipments a lot through distributed and rental businesses that in their turn address a wide range of projects. So it's very difficult to pinpoint where the end exposure is. But we certainly know that the vast majority deals with infrastructure related and rather large infrastructure projects in most parts of the world.</p>
