        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for standing by and welcome to the H&amp;M Nine-Month Report Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Nils Vinge. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's nine-month results. The presentation slides are found on our website hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, is with me today and will be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, sales including VAT increased 10% in local currencies, and in comparable units, sales were unchanged. Looking at the nine-month period, sales including VAT increased by 11% in local currencies and were up by 2% in comparable units. So, we increased sales, and we keep taking market share despite continued tough conditions for fashion retail in many markets. We see this as a proof that H&amp;M's strong offering with attractive collections is being appreciated by customers around the world.</p>
          <p>Sales were strong throughout most of the third quarter in June and July. August, however, did not live up to our expectations. This was mainly due to the heat wave that swept across many of our markets in August, primarily in Europe. We saw that weather-dependent items such as heavy-knit garments did not sell according to plan. As weather has normalized, sales have improved nicely. Looking at current trading after the end of the third quarter, from the 1st to the 25th of September, sales increased by 14% in local currencies compared to the same period last year and calendar adjusted. Net sales in the third quarter grew by 7% to SEK 28.8 billion. The strengthening of the Swedish krona, mainly against the euro, our biggest sales currency, had a large negative impact on sales and results in SEK.</p>
          <p>Looking at sales in some of our markets, please turn to the slide 'sales per market'. Germany is our largest market, representing around 20% of group revenue. H&amp;M sales have been good despite a slow clothing market. Our strong sales development in the U.S. has continued. Sales have increased by 27% in local currency so far this year. The U.K. sales have also been strong, with an increase of 13%. We're also pleased to see Ireland with a sales growth of 18%.</p>
          <p>Our fast growth continues in China and Asia. We have 109 stores in China by now, 48 more than a year ago, and we keep expanding. Sales grew by 33% in China in the first nine months of the year. In Japan, following a tough year last year, we're pleased to see that sales have developed well, and we see great potential for H&amp;M to continue growing in Japan.</p>
          <p>Sales development has been good also in our franchise markets.</p>
          <p>Going back to the third quarter, please return to the slide 'third quarter 2012'. Gross profit increased to SEK 16.8 billion, corresponding to a gross margin of 58.2%, compared to 58.6% last year. As you know, the gross margin is a result of many different factors, external as well as internal, together with the decisions we make in line with our strategy to always have the best customer offering in each market.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, the relief in cotton prices had a neutral to positive effect on sourcing costs compared to the third quarter last year. This, however, was partly offset by cost inflation, mainly in Asia, and by a stronger U.S. dollar. Looking at markdowns in relation to sales, they were at the same level as last year, and thus, the effect on the gross margin was neutral.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M's long-term investments continue. These initiatives are aimed at broadening the group's total offering. One example is the new brand &amp; Other Stories that will be launched next year and which I will come back to shortly. In the third quarter, these investments made up a slightly larger portion of sales than in the second quarter, mainly because Q3 is a smaller quarter turnover-wise.</p>
          <p>Over to operational costs, cost control in the group remains good. SG&amp;A was SEK 12 billion in the quarter, up 8% in SEK and 11% in local currencies. The increase is explained mainly by the expansion. In comparable stores, SG&amp;A was up marginally in the quarter, but on nine months, costs were down. Operating margin was 16.7% compared to 17.5% in the third quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>The strengthening of the Swedish krona against the euro hampered profit growth in the quarter. Profit after financial items was up marginally by SEK 4.9 billion. In the nine-month period, though, profit after financial items grew 11% to more than SEK 15.6 billion. Net profit for the third quarter was SEK 3.6 billion after estimated tax rate of 26% and corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 2.19.</p>
          <p>And now, looking at some key figures, please turn to the slide 'key data'. Stock-in-trade was SEK 13.5 billion, an increase of 1% in SEK and 3% in local currencies compared to the same time last year. The stock-in-trade is well composed and at a good level, as you can see on the curve on the next slide. Stock-in-trade in relation to sales were 11.3%, which is a good level also seen over time.</p>
          <p>Back to the slide 'key data', cash flow from current operations was SEK 13 billion. The main explanation for the increase is the growth in profit and the development of the stock-in-trade. Investments in terms of CapEx reached close to SEK 4.3 billion, mainly in new stores over the nine-month period.</p>
          <p>Our finances remained strong. Liquid funds and short-term investments amounted to SEK 13.5 million.</p>
          <p>Now, some words on our expansion. Please turn to the slide 'expansion in 2012'. We added a net of 157 stores in the first nine months of the year, of which 54 in the third quarter. The group had a total of 2,629 stores at the end of the period and of these 2,494 were H&amp;M, 55 COS, 55 Monki, 21 Weekday and 4 Cheap Monday. Of the total, 78 are franchise stores.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M's strong brand attracts customers all over the world, which also makes us an attractive tenant. And, we have been able to sign more store contracts than originally planned for the year. We are accelerating our expansion plan for 2012 to around 300 new stores net from previously announced 275.</p>
          <p>We are growing in all our markets. China and the U.S. are the largest expansion markets this year. We also see great opportunities for expansion in markets such as Russia, Italy, Poland, and the U.K. We're adding five new markets this year. Three of them have already opened, Bulgaria, Latvia, and Malaysia, and H&amp;M has been very well received by customers in all of them. Expansion continues in Southeast Asia. On Saturday, Thailand will become a new franchise market. And, later this year, we will open our second store in Singapore after our successful start there last year. We also see tremendous customer demand and interest in the upcoming opening of the first H&amp;M store in Mexico. It will be a fantastic store that will open in Mexico City's Central Santa Fe later this year.</p>
          <p>COS continues to do very well and is opening in six new markets only in this year. Italy, Finland, Poland, Hong Kong, and Austria have already opened, and customer response have been very positive everywhere. And, in October, COS will open via franchise in Kuwait.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at next year, please turn to the slide 'expansion 2013'. We're looking forward very much to the opening of the very first H&amp;M store in South America in Chile. It will be our first store in the Southern Hemisphere. It will be a flagship store, and it will open at best location in Santiago de Chile in the Costanera Center in the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>Next autumn, we will open our first stores in Estonia and Lithuania. And, in Southeast Asia, Indonesia will become a new franchise market. Expansion continues for our other brands as well. COS has signed for its first store in Norway to open in Oslo in the spring of 2013. Both Monki and Weekday will open in Japan in the spring of 2013, and Monki will enter France with a store in Paris.</p>
          <p>In 2013, we will also offer our customers a completely new and very exciting brand, &amp; Other Stories. To give you a bit of flavor, please turn to the next slide. &amp; Other Stories will be a great complement to H&amp;M and the other brands in the group. It will be launched in separate stores and online in selected European markets in the spring. &amp; Other Stories is aimed at women who love fashion and want to create their own personal style. The brand focuses on the entire look. &amp; Other Stories will offer a broad range of shoes, bags, jewelry, beauty products, lingerie, and clothes in a wide span of prices in the higher-priced segment. This allows for carefully selected qualities and great attention to details. And, just like for all brands in the H&amp;M Group, &amp; Other Stories will offer the best price for comparable products. We believe strongly in this new brand and are looking very much forward to offering it to customers.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. We see significant opportunities for continued growth for the H&amp;M Group, both in stores and online. In tandem with our expansion, we strive to offer our customers the best shopping experience at all times. That includes the development of multichannel. hm.com is one of the world's most frequently visited fashion sites, and our web shop is top-rated by our customers in e-commerce surveys. Online is becoming increasingly important for fashion retail, and market growth is particularly strong for shopping via smartphones and tablets.</p>
          <p>To cater the growing demand for mobile shopping, our H&amp;M shop online will already, as from early 2013, be fully mobile adapted in our existing eight online markets. In parallel, we have also intensified work to roll out online shopping to more markets in the group. These initiatives and as we need more time to prepare for the shop online in the U.S. mean that the launch of our web shop in the U.S. will be moved to summer of 2013. We do this because we believe it's what is best for H&amp;M in total and for our continued successful expansion long term.</p>
          <p>Before we start the Q&amp;A session, a few comments to summarize. So far this year, we've increased profit by 11% to more than SEK 15.6 billion despite tough market conditions and despite the fact that we, in the current environment, are also ramping up our expansion, continuing our work for &#x2013; of making the customer offering even strong, and investing for the future with many new initiatives. H&amp;M has grown to become one of the world's strongest brands, with a business concept and a model that works across four continents and in small as well as the big cities. Today, we have more than 2,600 stores in 46 markets, and the way we see it, we are only at the beginning of our journey.</p>
          <p>We are now happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's Anne Critchlow from SocGen. I've got a question...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sorry, afternoon. I have a question about the country data. In China and Russia, it seems that space is growing well above your total local currency sales growth. I just wondered how you could explain that please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's always a matter of timing, et cetera, and the size of stores, et cetera. So, it does not correspond to the development in like-for-like stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, can you say that like-for-like sales growth is positive in those countries or at least no worse on the average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's &#x2013; again, when you look at &#x2013; just looking at the sales development, number of stores development, you can't make those kind of conclusions because there're so many &#x2013; as I said, it depends on timing. For example, if we opened a lot of stores the last day of the quarter, you get very tilted figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And, then just one more question about the tax rate; I imagine you're expecting your tax rate to drop next year to 22%. Can you confirm that? Are you prepared to give guidance at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's still just a government bill so we have to wait to see the final decision in the Swedish Parliament and then we have to come back when that decision is done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Jorg Nowicki. Please announce your company and ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Jorg Nowicki from TextilWirtschaft in Germany. I have two things. First of all, can you give us an idea about how important the online business is for H&amp;M at the moment, maybe percentage-wise? That's the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for asking. I think we had this question before. It is growing and becoming more and more important in general and also for H&amp;M and thus the investments we do and the ramp-up we do and &#x2013; that we talk so much about it. But, for competitive reasons, I'm sorry, we prefer not to break out the percentages in different channels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second one, you were talking about &amp; Other Stories, and you were talking about the prices so that means that &amp; Other Stories will be more upscale than H&amp;M. Can you give us any idea about the pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's correct that the prices &#x2013; it's in higher price segment compared to H&amp;M and it's a wide range of prices. But, you could very &#x2013; simplify it, say that they start where H&amp;M ends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, All right. And, you will also launch this in Germany, is that correct, next year in spring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We've said that we aim for 8 to 10 stores first year in major cities in Europe. Perhaps some in Germany, but we haven't said that yet. We will see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, it'll be mostly about accessories. Like, accessories will take the &#x2013; will have a much stronger part than in the H&amp;M store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's true that there will be a lot of accessories but also fashion and apparel will be very important. So, it's been &#x2013; it will be very nice and exciting. And, you would see &#x2013; when you see it, you will understand how exciting this is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, All right. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Richard Chamberlain [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Please announce your company and ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Nils. Sorry. I didn't hear that last bit. Hi. Yes, two from me please. First of all, what was the calendar adjustment on the September sales number that you talk about? Was that significant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we try to help the market a little bit. So, if you just look at the first 25 days, there is a calendar effect and we've tried to adjust for that and it's approximately 2 percentage points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>2 percentage points positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so we give you 14 which is adjusted. Otherwise, it would have been 12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay, thanks. And, then the other one is just &#x2013; can you just talk about the strategic thinking behind, first of all, ramping up the store growth? Obviously, with the growth of online sales being so strong, what's the thinking behind that and at the same time delaying the U.S. online launch until the summer next year, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they are not correlated at all. But for the expansion, the revised expansion target for the stores, it's simply that &#x2013; no, entering the New Year, we gave you guidance and we said 275. Some years, it gets more than that and sometimes less because it's a moving target, a lot of stores that we still haven't negotiated, et cetera, and things may change during the year. But we see that the brand of H&amp;M is becoming stronger and stronger. We attract more and more customers, so we've become more and more interesting tenants which, of course, helps us...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, you're getting more approaches from landlords presumably and better rental terms, I would've thought as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the same time, the team, the expansion team we have, the teams we have are very good and they've done a great job. So, it's a combination of these things. That has nothing to do with the online issues that we talk about before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. So, the online issues, is that still getting the logistics organized and fully operational in the U.S.? Is that the main reason for the delay or is it a number of different things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, as I said, it's a number of things. It's a combination of, first of all, yes, the adoptions in the U.S. to the U.S. shop online has been taking longer time than anticipated. That's one thing. But at the same time, as I mentioned, we see that obviously online is going very fast, very quickly, especially, thanks to the fast growth of smartphones and iPads, et cetera. That's why we have intensified the work to launch, and already in the beginning of next year, we will launch this fully adapted e-commerce <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:00).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Already in the eight existing markets, very exciting. At the same time, we also have allocated more resources for the rollout of H&amp;M shop online in the rest of the group. So, hopefully....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; they'll all create more customer value as to the decisions we have taken. Unfortunately, the U.S. customers will have to wait in other &#x2013; until the summer. But as we said, we think that total value, this will be greater.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, it's Jamie Merriman from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is about the growth margin. And in particular, I know that there are a lot of factors like you said, internal and external. But I was wondering if you could give us some idea about the magnitude of the internal versus the external factors in the quarter? And maybe also what you're seeing in terms of price both on a like-for-like basis and on a mix basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's correct that you mentioned that it's both internal and external factors affecting the gross margin and simplified &#x2013; you could divide the factors, of course the external factors is all about cotton, the wage inflation, the transportation, the capacity and also for us, the euro-U.S. dollar relation. And then we have the internal factors, and they &#x2013; as we are having an income statement by function, we include also a lot of other things in the cost of goods sold and not only the FOB price for the goods. And as we said in the report, we are doing long-term investments and these long-term investments in the sourcing organization, the buying office organization in the logistics, they are affecting the cost of goods sold and also accordingly the gross margin.</p>
          <p>But most important is the decisions that we take when it comes to our customer offering. And as we have said before, that's always the starting point to look into, that we have the best customer offering on each market. But we prefer not to go exactly and give a magnitude of each factor. But I think it's really important to understand that the cost of goods sold is including much more factors than only the FOB prices.</p>
          <p>And also, to really be clear that the gross margin will be a result of the decisions both when it comes to the decisions we are taking with the customer offering but also the long-term investments. So, reflecting those, we can say that the gross margin for the third quarter this year is more or less in the range that we planned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the pricing, have you seen &#x2013; I understand you said you had markdowns the same but in terms of like-for-like pricing or was there a mix shift towards lower-priced products within the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We don't comment exactly on our pricing strategy for competitive reasons. But again, our target is always to have the best customer offering. And that's a combination of price, fashion and quality. Sorry.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Fraser Ramzan. Please announce your company and ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Fraser Ramzan from Nomura in London. Just a question about the gross margin, there were some comments on Bloomberg earlier from Mr. Persson suggesting that in the fourth quarter, currency and input cost factors will broadly offset each other. So, presumably, what you mean by that is the external factors should be broadly neutral in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to confirm I had understood that comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. But looking into the cotton, the capacity, wages, inflation, transportation and the currency, U.S. dollar and euro mainly, so theoretically looking, it's more or less neutral for the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's too simplified because it's really based on spot prices. And the reality is somewhat more complicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, internal factors would be an addition to that, i.e. incrementally negative in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What we say is, looking at those five external &#x2013; looking at those five external factors, we estimate, looking at the spot prices, et cetera, that it should be fairly neutral. But then it's &#x2013; when talking about the gross margin for the fourth quarter that will be dependent on our decisions. What we will make for decisions when it comes to our customer offering, that will be then the most important thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. And then one other question if I may, just really coming back to the first question on your tax rate next year, I don't want to sort of come away with a wrong impression. Were you saying that subject to implementation and Swedish parliament you would expect the tax rate to drop to 22%, or would it likely be some smaller number given the &#x2013; not all of your taxable profits are in the Sweden? Sorry, some larger number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You mean the tax for the whole group...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will most probably not be exact 22% because as you said, we also have taxation in other countries with different &#x2013; we are acting in almost &#x2013; excluding the franchise countries. So, it's over 30 countries with different tax rates. So, of course, they will also influence the group tax rate.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Simon Irwin from Credit Suisse. Could I just go back to the gross margin issue and particularly the influence of FX because it's quite difficult for us to work out the lag in terms of the FX? Is it fair to say that the negative headwind that you see in terms of sourcing on FX is worse in 4Q and will be worse again in &#x2013; was pretty similar in 1Q from what you concurrently see? But you're obviously offsetting that with better dollar-buying terms, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's pretty much correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just in terms of the online launches, you've only launched one market since 2007. You appear to be inferring that there will be an acceleration in online launches once you've got this new platform up and running in the U.S. What are you going to do differently that allows a more rapid rollout of online capability going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we just said that we have allocated more resources, which is number one in order to have it happening and make it happen faster. But of course, learning from history, we are reluctant to give you an exact date, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But is there going to be a different structure? I mean, is there going to be &#x2013; are you going to be able to, say, provide e-commerce from one center to a larger number of countries, particularly, I'm thinking of Southern Europe or France and Southern Europe rather than having to put facilities in each market or &#x2013; just in terms of the infrastructure and the way you organize yourself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before going into details, I mean, we all agree that there is a huge opportunity for us &#x2013; in front of us when it comes to online shopping and M-commerce and all of it. But exactly how it will look, we will come back to &#x2013; I mean there is no secret that we are investing a lot in this and we look really forward to have it in all our markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just in terms of the impact of &amp; Other Stories, I think you have flagged already an increase in OpEx this year as you move towards the launch. Should we think about some additional cost beyond what you're putting through this year into next as you go live with this brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Always, when we are starting up a new market for a new brand. It's connected in the initial phase. Of course, there will be investments and &#x2013; but these are really important investments we have to do to be able to be even stronger in the future. So, of course, going like we have been doing the past two years, we have entered 10 new markets. And for sure, it's much more expensive to open one store in a new market than in an existing market. So, there will be, initially, investments and costs connected to new brands, new markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Fine. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys, Chris Chaviaras from Barclays here. Do you have &#x2013; hello. Two questions from me, one after the other. So, the first one on the online, will there going to be any extra costs associated with that or in &#x2013; with the identification of your efforts on launching in more countries this year and next, or the investment has been pretty much done? That is my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There will be investments when ramping up the resources for rolling out the online on all our markets. So, yes, there will be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And my second one actually then would be, again, on the &#x2013; on some longer-term strategic initiatives you've got. Will the &#x2013; since you're ramping up your space expansion, assuming that you are going to launch in the U.S. in summer as you've said and then rolling it towards more markets, would that affect the magnitude of your space expansion going forward, or this 10% to 15% store growth that you have been &#x2013; that you have given still holds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had this question many times, and we say again the answer is no. It does not affect our plans. The way we see it, there's still a lot of potential to open new stores so we feel very comfortable with the 10% to 15% target. Of course then in the very long term, something else, but I mean still many years to come we feel comfortable with the 10% to 15%. And we think that online is a very good complement to physical stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. If you allow me a very technical question, and the last one sorry, <mark type="ph" /> I haven't done that (34:20), when did you start investing about the new concept &amp; Other Stories because you mentioned that in the previous release but when have you actually &#x2013; when did you actually actively start investing for that new concept in terms of the timing and trying to see in the quarters if this is something that you can disclose?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continuously invest a lot not just in the figures, the CapEx figures, we take a lot of costs directly in the P&amp;L, and those are long-term. And we said in the beginning of this year, one example is this new store chain or brand online, &amp; Other Stories. But we also have, parallel to that, a lot of other initiatives going on. It could be also extension of existing categories or new categories at H&amp;M et cetera. So, exactly when we started with &amp; Other Stories I mean it's difficult to say, but I mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the costs and investments then, they come gradually. And, of course, the initial phase then it's more ideas, discussions, and then if we will go further on those discussions then, of course, we start to build up an organization and then &#x2013; so, it's a gradually &#x2013; it's a process.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just going back to the space CapEx question, the 300 stores you are planning to open this year, the pickup from 275, should we assume next year 300 or more than 300 units that you're going to open, or would this year's raised target really just taking some of next year's opening program into this year?</p>

          <p>Okay, great. And just for the rest of South America, are there any countries in particular that you're targeting? And would you try and create a kind of a mass of stores in Chile before moving into some of the other countries in the region, or would you be prepared just to open individual stores as they come up?</p>

          <p>No. As I said, we are looking at many different markets. But that's again going back to what I just said. Most other countries in South America rate much further down in that index I was talking about.</p>

          <p>SEB Enskilda. Good afternoon. Can I ask you, in terms of FOB prices out of China, at this stage when you're ordering stuff &#x2013; sorry, goods &#x2013; where would they be compared to a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer not to go into our FOB prices. And that we want to keep to ourselves for competitive reasons.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But generally speaking, in the market are your prices down or are they still up year on year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nicklas, we try &#x2013; we give you the external factors. Then what we pay is another thing, because that's up to us how we negotiate, et cetera, how efficient we are, and of course, the mix of products and material, fashion, et cetera. So it's &#x2013; yes, sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a follow-up question. I've asked you about a year ago how you're proceeding with a potential switch to use the CNH, the convertible renminbi, as your preferred means of payment, as opposed to the U.S. dollar in China. How is that project, if there is any, proceeding?</p>

          <p>Final question, on the cost side, I suppose you have definitely been taking a lot of ramp-up cost for IT systems, et cetera. And in particular, I am thinking about the SAP installation. How is that process progressing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Two questions, harping back to the gross margin, I'm afraid. Firstly, in terms of the better than &#x2013; lower cotton prices year-on-year and your ability to negotiate with the factories, et cetera, Q3 was maybe a little bit more disappointing than we thought. Is it really the fact that it takes longer to come through? Or has the gain actually been less than you or we originally anticipated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, when looking at the external factors, the cotton prices, of course, they are not following exactly the spot prices. There are delay, of course, in those. So maybe it's too theoretical to just look at the spot prices and think that they will go through at once.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it is no different to what &#x2013; when you were buying the products six months ago, this is broadly as you expected it to be for the period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. But again, we don't &#x2013; it's not that we have six-month lead times on everything. In some cases, we have two weeks. So it's a mixture. And that is why the Excel models don't really work in reality always.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mine certainly not today.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

            <mark type="ph" /> Sorry. (43:20).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, in terms of the second question, it was really &#x2013; when we look at your long-term investments, the gross margin impact is really referred to as it's &#x2013; because it's a smaller proportion of sales within the quarter. So does that mean that the long-term investment is pretty &#x2013; in absolute currency amounts &#x2013; is similar to each of the quarters? It just varies in terms of the impact on gross margin by the sales in that given quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Looking at the absolute currency, it's more or less on the same level. Slightly higher in the first quarter compared to Q2, but not materially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that &#x2013; in terms of year on year, is there much change? Is that a material change year on year in that investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the year-on-year, it's bigger than &#x2013; compared to Q2.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question about the Southern Hemisphere. Obviously, the challenge or one of the big challenges of going to the Southern Hemisphere is having the seasons reversed and having to, therefore, have winter product in summer and vice versa. How are you getting around that? Have you established a completely separate design team or is the same individuals designing summer and winter products at the same time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have developed a very good solution. So meaning that the customers in the Southern Hemisphere will get the latest fashion, as well as at current season. Exactly how we do it, of course, we'll keep it to ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you aren't going to have separate &#x2013; you're going to have product that is only available in Southern Hemisphere at that time of the year? Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we'll follow the seasons, and those customers will be able to get latest trends as well as current season. In some cases, it might be before you see it in the Northern Hemisphere. In some cases, after.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Just three short ones from me. The first one on the external factors, I just wanted to check in Q3 that the external factors put together were neutral on the gross margin. Because reading the report, it sounds like they were slightly positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was slightly positive when looking at the aggregate for those <mark type="ph" /> final product numbers (46:33).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And the second one is, is there no risk of greater discounting over the next few months, given the poor August figures? Or are you basically going to roll over that stock into Autumn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>We're looking at our stock at the end of the third quarter. We are very happy with the level and the composition of the stock. And when it comes to possible markdowns/discounts in the fourth quarter, it's far too early.  It's still over two months to go.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it would most probably start in a range of from 600 square meters up to also a little bit over 1,000 square meters. So it's a flexible concept.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sorry, just one quick follow-up. It's about your dividend policy. Could you just confirm, first of all, that your regular payout is 50%?</p>
          <p>And, then could you &#x2013; just reading around it, it seems like you aim to distribute surplus liquidity. So what kind of factors would be important to you in determining surplus liquidity or not?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. It's 50% as a base rule. But the surplus liquidity, it's also always that we have the financial strength to take possible opportunities. So we have the financial strength to act really quick. So that's the whole idea.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just on the SG&amp;A line really, see that the final quarter is going to see a significant uplift in the number of new stores you're going to open. I'm sure you've got them all signed. But does that mean we're going to see quite an acceleration in SG&amp;A growth in that final quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we have really good cost control, and we'd prefer not to give any forward-looking statements when it comes to SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>But we have good development during the year. The sales during the nine months increased in local currencies by 11% and the SG&amp;A by 10%. And that's also including all the long-term investments that we are doing.</p>
          <p>But we prefer not to go into &#x2013; give any prognosis for the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, I'd like to remind you that part of the costs for these 25 additional stores are already taken in the third quarter because it's ramp-up cost before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In that case, perhaps a second question. Is the opening profile the first three quarters of the year to-date materially different from where you thought it would be at the beginning of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I.e., the number of stores you've opened year-to-date in the first nine months, is that broadly in plan with what you thought it would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Broadly in plan? Maybe <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:11)....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But that's &#x2013; yes, broadly. But as Nil said earlier, when entering a year, we &#x2013; it's really a moving target. So it's not that we exactly can say that will be the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter. But no major deviations to our plans.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. Two questions, please. Firstly, what's your operating breakeven point in terms of like-for-like?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, we &#x2013; it's very difficult to give you exact figure for that. But, I think history has proven that we are &#x2013; have been able to, despite negative like-for-likes, sometimes we've increased efficiency and &#x2013; but the reason why we have target always increased like-for-like sales is of course that there is always a inflation when it comes to salaries and rents, et cetera, in the stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, maybe just marginally positive then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But, as Nils said in the long term, of course, it's important that we have like-for-like growth just because there are an underlying inflation in the OpEx so &#x2013; but the breaking point I think in the long term it has to be a positive like-for-like.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
