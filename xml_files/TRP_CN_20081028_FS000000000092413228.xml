          <p>Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the TransCanada Corporation 2008 Third Quarter Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. David Moneta, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, Mr. Moneta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you today. We're pleased to provide the investment community, the media, and other interested parties with an opportunity to discuss our 2008 third quarter financial results and other general issues concerning TransCanada.</p>
          <p>With me today are: Hal Kvisle, President and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Lohnes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Russ Girling, President of Pipelines, Alex Pourbaix, President of Energy and our Vice President and Controller, Glenn Menuz.</p>
          <p>Hal and Greg will begin today with some opening comments on our financial results and other general issues pertaining to TransCanada. Please note that a slide presentation will accompany their remarks. A copy of that presentation is available on our website at transcanada.com. And it can be found it in the Investor section under the heading Conference Calls &amp; Presentations.</p>
          <p>Following Hal's and Greg's remarks, we will turn the call over to the conference coordinator for your questions. During the question-and-answer period, we'll take questions from the investment community first, and then allow some time for the media. In order to provide everyone with an equal opportunity to participate, we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. If you have any additional questions, please reenter the queue.</p>
          <p>We ask that you focus your questions on our industry, our corporate strategy, recent developments, and key elements of our financial performance. If you have detailed questions relating to some of our smaller operations for your detailed financial models, Myles, Terry, and I would be pleased to discuss them with you following the call.</p>
          <p>Also, please note that we intend to provide a more detailed update on our growth initiatives and future capital program at our upcoming Investor meetings in Toronto and New York in early November. Before Hal begins, I'd like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please see the reports filed by TransCanada with Canadian securities regulators and with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'd also like to point out that during this presentation, we'll refer to measures, such as comparable earnings, comparable earnings per share, and funds generated from operations. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and are therefore considered to be non-GAAP measures. As a result, these measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. These measures have been used to provide interested parties with additional information on the company's operating performance, liquidity, and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hal.</p>

          <p>Thank you, David. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight third quarter results and recent developments in our business. Following that, our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lohnes, will review our financial results in more detail.</p>
          <p>TransCanada's strong third quarter financial results demonstrate our ability to generate significant sustainable earnings and cash flows from our growing portfolio of high quality energy infrastructure assets. For the third quarter of 2008, TransCanada's net income was $390 million or $0.67 per share, an increase of 12% on a per share basis compared to the same period in 2007.</p>
          <p>Comparable earnings for third quarter 2008, of 366 million or $0.63 per share increased by approximately 11% on a per share basis compared to the third quarter of 2007. Funds generated from operations for third quarter 2008 were $711 million.</p>
          <p>TransCanada's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, on all outstanding common shares. Shareholders that reinvest their dividends in additional common shares of the company through our dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan will continue to receive common shares from Treasury at a 2% discount to the average market price.</p>
          <p>I will now expand on some recent developments that occurred in the third quarter. First of all, the Keystone Oil Pipeline. As you know we announced the results for our open season for the Keystone expansion this morning. In addition to the 300,000 barrels per day we previously announced, we secured an additional 80,000 barrels per day for a total of 380,000 barrels per day of firm long-term contracts with an average term of 17 years.</p>
          <p>The significant commercial support we received confirms the value of the Keystone Gulf Coast expansion as a cost competitive way to connect the growing and reliable supply of Canadian crude oil with the largest refining market in North America. TransCanada has begun working with the contractually committed Keystone expansion shippers to optimize the construction schedule.</p>
          <p>With the additional contracts Keystone has secured long-term commitments for 910,000 barrels per day for an average term of 18 years. These commitments represent 83% of the 1.1 million barrel per day commercial design of the Keystone system.</p>
          <p>We also announced today that TransCanada has agreed to increase its equity ownership in the Keystone partnerships from 50% to 79.99%. ConocoPhillips' equity ownership will be reduced to 20.01%. Certain parties who have made significant volume commitments on the Keystone expansion have an option to acquire up to a combined 15% equity ownership in the Keystone partnerships. If those options are exercised, TransCanada's equity ownership would be reduced to 64.99%.</p>
          <p>Let me now speak about recent developments in our Gas Pipeline business. Here in Alberta, TransCanada received approval from the Alberta Utilities Commission for a permit to construct the North Central Corridor expansion, which comprises a 300-kilometer natural gas pipeline and associated facilities in the northern section of the Alberta System.</p>
          <p>In other Pipeline news, TransCanada acquired Bison Pipeline LLC from Northern Border for US$20 million in the third quarter. The capital cost of Bison to construct is estimated at approximately 500 to US$600 million. The Bison Pipeline project has shipping commitments for 405 million cubic feet per day and is intended to be in service in fourth quarter 2010. One of the committed shippers has an option to acquire a 25% ownership in the Bison project.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to work on developing the Pathfinder and Sunstone projects to connect additional U.S. Rocky Mountain gas supplies to our existing pipeline network and to provide customers with access to diverse markets throughout North America.</p>
          <p>On the Alaska front it seems like a long time ago, but in the third quarter the Alaska Senate awarded in favor of granting TransCanada a license to build the Alaska pipeline. The governor signed the bill on August 27, 2008, and we do expect the Alaska Commissioners of Revenue and Natural Resources to issue the AGIA license in late November 2008 after the obligatory 90-day waiting period for the bill to become effective. This is an important step in advancing this major natural gas pipeline project to connect stranded U.S. natural gas reserves in Alaska to Alaskan and lower 48 consumers. We have commenced the next stage of engineering environmental field and commercial work and expect to conclude an open season by July 31, 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Energy business, in our Energy portfolio TransCanada acquired the 2480-megawatt Ravenswood Generating Station for US$2.9 billion, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We are very pleased to have acquired this base load and peaking facility in this critical market. Ravenswood represents excellent long-term value for our shareholders. Its strategic location right in the attractive New York City market, along with its revenue diversity coming from energy sales, capacity, and ancillary services makes Ravenswood a great addition to TransCanada's growing North American power generation portfolio.</p>
          <p>On the Wind front we commenced construction of the 132-megawatt Kibby Wind power project in Maine. The project is expected to be fully commissioned in 2010.</p>
          <p>And finally in Energy, after running the Portlands Energy Centre in Toronto in simple-cycle mode during the summer season, we have returned to the final construction phase and we expect to commission that very important power generating facility in combined-cycle mode capable of providing 550-megawatts of power in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance and the progress we've made on a number of major growth initiatives. We recognize global financial markets are experiencing severe turmoil, however, TransCanada's financial position remains solid. We conducted a sizeable financing program in 2008 and our liquidity position remains strong. It is underpinned by highly predictable cash flows from operations, our continued access to capital markets, and revolving bank lines of more than $2 billion.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to Greg Lohnes, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg will provide more information on our third quarter results and additional information on our liquidity and capital resources. Greg?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hal. Good morning, everyone. As Hal mentioned, earlier today we released our third quarter results. Net income for the third quarter was $390 million or $0.67 per share, compared to $324 million or $0.60 per share for the same period last year, an increase of approximately 12% on a per share basis.</p>
          <p>Third quarter 2008 net income included $26 million of favorable income tax adjustments and $2 million of net unrealized losses, resulting from the changes in fair value of proprietary natural gas storage inventory and natural gas forward purchase and sale contracts.</p>
          <p>Third quarter 2007 net income included positive income tax reassessments and associated interest income of $15 million. Excluding these items, comparable earnings were $366 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter 2008, compared to $309 million or $0.57 per share for the same period last year, an increase of approximately 11% on a per share basis. The quarter-over-quarter increase is due to increased contributions from all segments.</p>
          <p>I will briefly review the third quarter results for each of our business areas beginning with Pipelines. The Pipelines business generated net income and comparable earnings of $173 million during the third quarter, an increase of $10 million over the same period in 2007.</p>
          <p>Of note ANR's net income in the third quarter increased $5 million, primarily due to higher revenues from new growth projects. GTN's comparable earnings also increased $5 million, primarily due to the positive impact of the rate case settlement in January, 2008, and lower OM&amp;A expenses.</p>
          <p>Next, some comments on Energy. Energy generated comparable earnings of $202 million in the third quarter 2008, compared to $156 million in the same period last year. Western Power's operating income was $126 million in the third quarter, compared to $120 million last year, primarily due to an increase in sulphur sales at significantly higher prices in 2008. TransCanada has been selling modest quantities of sulphur on a breakeven basis since 2005. Western Power's operating income was negatively impacted in the third quarter 2008 by decreased margins from the Alberta Power portfolio, due to lower overall realized power prices on both contracted and uncontracted volumes of power sold in Alberta.</p>
          <p>Eastern Power's operating income in the third quarter was $100 million, an increase of $48 million compared to the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to higher realized power prices in New England, increased water flows from the TC Hydro generation assets, lower overall costs per gigawatt hour on reduced purchased power volumes, and incremental operating income of $9 million from the acquisition of Ravenswood which, as Hal mentioned, we closed on August 26.</p>
          <p>In September, the Ravenswood 972-megawatt Unit 30 experienced an unplanned outage as a result of a problem with its high-pressure steam turbine. Although the repair costs and lost revenues associated with the unplanned outage have not been finalized, it is not expected to have a significant impact on earnings as a result of expected insurance recoveries.</p>
          <p>Finally in Power, TransCanada's combined operating income from its investment in Bruce Power of $83 million in the third quarter increased $19 million compared to third quarter 2007, primarily due to higher revenues resulting from higher output and higher realized prices. At September 30, 2008 Bruce A had incurred $2.4 billion for the restart of Units 1 and 2, and approximately $200 million for the refurbishment of Units 3 and 4.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Corporate. Net income from Corporate in the third quarter 2008 was $17 million compared to net income of $5 million in the same period last year. Excluding $26 million of favorable income tax adjustments from an internal restructuring and the realization of losses in 2008, and $15 million of favorable income tax assessments and associated interest income in 2007, comparable expenses from Corporate in the third quarter were $9 million compared to $10 million in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the cash flow statement. Funds generated from operations were $711 million in the third quarter, an increase of $9 million when compared to the same period in 2007. Capital expenditures and acquisitions in the third quarter were approximately $3.9 billion and related primarily to the acquisition of Ravenswood, as well as the ongoing development of greenfield projects such as the Bruce A restart, Portlands Energy Centre, Halton Hills and Cartier Wind, as well as expansion of the Alberta System and construction of the Keystone Oil Pipeline.</p>
          <p>TransCanada's financial position remains sound. At the end of September, our balance sheet consisted of 53% debt, which included our proportionate share of joint venture debt, 4% junior subordinated notes, 1% preferred shares, and 42% common equity. I would note that our debt on this slide is calculated net of cash.</p>
          <p>TransCanada has conducted a sizeable funding program in 2008, which consisted of a $1.3 billion common equity issue in May and term debt issues of US1.5 billion and Canadian 500 million, along with a US2.5 million draw on our Ravenswood acquisition bridge facility in August. In addition, dividend reinvestment plan proceeds are expected to approach $250 million in 2008.</p>
          <p>TransCanada's liquidity position remain stable, underpinned by highly predictable cash flow from operations, as well as committed revolving bank lines of $2 billion and US$300 million maturing in December 2012 and February 2013 respectively.</p>
          <p>To-date no draws have been made on this facilities as TransCanada continues to have largely uninterrupted access to the Canadian commercial paper markets on competitive terms. TransCanada views its bank group as high quality and its relationship with these institutions as excellent. TransCanada is presently seeking to establish a further committed bank line in support of the Keystone Pipeline construction program, and expects this to be in place in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Also in the fourth quarter TransCanada expects to file a new US$3 billion debt shelf, which will supplement the existing $3 billion equity shelf, and the $1 billion capacity available under the Canadian debt shelf.</p>
          <p>That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back to David for the question-and-answer period.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Greg. Before I turn the call back over to the conference coordinator, a reminder that we'll take questions from the financial community first. And once we've completed that, then we'll turn it over to the media.</p>
          <p>A reminder once again that we ask you limit your questions to two, and then if you have a follow-up to reenter the queue. With that, I'll turn it back over to conference coordinator.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. At this time, we will take questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. The first question will be from Linda Ezergailis from TD Newcrest. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a question with respect to the increased ownership of Keystone. I guess my first question is when will the other shippers have to exercise that 15% ownership option by? But on a broader scale, I'm just wondering if we look at the U.S. approximately $12 billion cost of that project and moving from 50 to potentially 80% would add quite a bit more to your capital expenditure outlook for 2009 and 2010, especially by my calculations, that could increase your equity needs over those years by up to $3 billion.</p>
          <p>I am just wondering if you can give us an update and I realize there is a lot of instability in the capital markets, but just give us some of your initial thoughts on first of all, when you might want to put in permanent financing either during or at the end of the project, and how you might achieve that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Linda, it's Hal. I'd open first and then Greg and Russ may wish to answer this. First of all, it's an excellent turn of events for TransCanada to be able to increase our ownership interest in a pipeline that is so fundamentally sound and much in demand by the market, much in demand both on the oil supply end here in Alberta and also by the markets that we're aiming to serve down in the Wood River, Patoka, Cushing and U.S. Gulf Coast areas. It's a pipeline concept that has proven extremely popular with the oil producing community, but also with the oil refining community down in those markets in the U.S. So as in all of our big strategic capital projects, we are aiming to own more of it rather than less of it. And so it's a good turn of events for us to be able to increase our ownership.</p>
          <p>But we do recognize that there is a couple of challenges with this project, one on our side is the financing challenge. And timing is important as to just how quickly we move into the expansion part of the project. But also for our customers, we had very strong support in the open season, but many of those customers have indicated that they have their own uncertainties with respect to the pace of oil development at Fort McMurray and other places here in Alberta. Hence the comment in my remarks this morning that we will be working closely with our customers on the Keystone expansion project to determine the optimal time to go ahead.</p>
          <p>On the one hand we have to make sure the capacity is there when our first shippers need it. But, on the other hand if there is room here for some deferral of some of that construction, that's probably a good thing for all of us. So there are uncertainties at Fort Mac right now, and we do need to be very careful about that.</p>
          <p>But I would remind all listeners on this call that the commitments we've received are binding, they're long-term, they're generally in the range of 17 to 20 years. This is one of the best contracted oil pipelines anywhere in North America. It's a different model that we've chosen to pursue here, highly secure with these long-term contracts. And also of course will be important to us as we move into the financing phase, we have the ability to finance a project that has that kind of contract. And that's often not the case in the businesses that we're in.</p>
          <p>I'll turn it to Russ, here. Russ, I don't know if you'd add any more comments on the path forward for the development of Keystone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add is to answer your first question on the exercising of those equity options, Linda. It'd be early Q1 of next year, that sort of January, February, that we will have those negotiations and discussions. And they'll make their election to exercise or not at that point in time.</p>
          <p>And to Hal's point on the timing, we are having discussions with both our contractors, suppliers, as well as the shippers on finding the optimal way to meet the needs of all the parties. And so we'll have that construction schedule put in place probably over the next quarter here, and then we'll be able to give you more details as time goes on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Linda the financing challenge at 80% is obviously different than it was at 50% and it has to fit into our cash flow profile and our own ability to raise financing. So that's really our motive for discussing what's the right timing to proceed. But, I'd ask Greg Lohnes to offer some additional comments on our financing options.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Hal, thanks. Linda, I will be speaking more to our overall financing plan when we get together for the Investor Day. But, just briefly, obviously they have a large portfolio of greenfield ahead of us. But, greenfield's different than acquisitions like Ravenswood and ANR where you need to have a large sum of money available at one particular date in order to close those financings. So we feel that there is some flexibility in order to time access to the market. We were prudent on the debt side in August and accessed the market in a window for $2 billion of debt. And then we also drew down -- I think it was $255 million on the Ravenswood facility. So substantial debt capacity -- you'd asked about permanent financing and with regard to permanent financing, our view would be to wait till construction's completed, at least at phase one if not of the entire project.</p>
          <p>Obviously it's a large sum of money and we have indicated that we are prudent in the way we finance, and the way we keep our balance sheet metrics and our rating agency ratios in check. We are working closely with the rating agencies and talking to them about our financing plan and have spend significant time with them discussing this project and others.</p>
          <p>We prefer to finance with subordinated capital. And we look at all of our various sources of subordinated capital, which includes mandatory convertibles, preferred shares, potential divestitures, the hybrid market, which we accessed successfully little while ago for $1 billion. So we look at all these various sources. We also look at our LP, and as you know these markets are in turmoil and there are windows and sometimes some of them aren't available, financing at the LP is fairly expensive right now with the high yields that that market has seen on its units. So -- but we'll be prudent and as we move forward we look at all our available sources and that includes common equity if required.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question will be from Andrew Fairbanks from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Hal, I was wondering if you could line out as you see it through the sequence of events for the Alaska pipeline. Do you have a sense for how the process of  firming up that project to move forward or any sense when you might be able to come to a consensus with producers on the shape of the project, the alternative projects, which pipeline they'll end up getting behind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Andrew. First of all, our plan is fairly well laid out in the AGIA filings and the AGIA approvals that we reached with the State of Alaska. The first critical step here is that by mid-year 2010, we will have completed an open season. And there's two aspects to that, one is the formal open season where we invite parties to nominate for capacity for long-term shipping arrangements on the pipeline. And there could be both existing producers in Alaska and those companies that are exploring on the North Slope, we would see potential for commitments from both camps there.</p>
          <p>But, of course the most likely shippers that are going to underpin this pipeline are the three existing Prudhoe Bay producers. And so while the open season is out there, in parallel with that we're also holding discussions with those people in advance for the open season and leading up to the conclusion of that. And that is probably the single most important step in moving that project forward -- are fruitful discussions with the existing producers on the North Slope.</p>
          <p>And many complicated issues there, both in terms of the nature of the shipping commitment, any ownership role that they may wish to take in the pipeline. And we have made it very clear that we're willing to accommodate them in that regard. And they have their own issues, of course, with the State of Alaska; all of those things need to be resolved.</p>
          <p>The other major track and one that sometimes gets ahead of itself in my view on these projects is the regulatory permitting. It's obviously important that we get regulatory permits from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the United States. And in the case of the Canadian section the Northern Pipeline Agency for the portion through the Yukon and Northern BC.</p>
          <p>But, I just emphasize that the commercial arrangements and commercial discussions with the major Alaska producers and any new shippers that might come along, that's really the critical step. So we are commencing work on the regulatory front and we will be devoting a fair bit of time and energy to that but we will be curtailing, constraining expenditures on the regulatory front in a very disciplined way. I just observe that historic projects sometime get ahead of themselves in terms of going down that regulatory path, spending a lot of money when the real issue is sorting out the commercial arrangements and so that's where our focus will be for the next little while.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So then you've begun discussions with the three majors and it would be reasonable to think of that as sort of a 12-month to 18-month discussion period just to try and set those expectations reasonably close to what may well happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I agree with that. I would point out that I have been having discussions with the Alaska producers since I took this job in 2001. So this has gone on for a long time. But, I acknowledge that the pace of those discussions has picked up and is likely to pick up in the next 18 months as we move towards that open season in mid-year 2010.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning everybody and congratulations certainly on the quarter and the Keystone contracts. Hal, if I can, you know, back on the Keystone and actually circling back to Alaska, starting with Keystone, on the ownership shift here, was this a Conoco-initiated move presumably to reduce their CapEx? And along with that, was there any funds paid to Conoco for their, the NPV of their 30% equity stake? And, as you kind of expand that forward does this have any follow-on implications for Denali or the merger of the two Alaska pipeline proposals, if indeed Conoco perhaps has not seen the pipeline as a core business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start out, Carl, and then I'll get Russ to fill in the details that he'll be more aware of than I would be. First of all, on the ownership level of Keystone, we've worked very closely with ConocoPhillips from day one on structuring that project. And, of course, we've also worked very closely with ConocoPhillips on the Mackenzie Valley project. So, we have long history of collaboration with that company and our relationship is very good with them.</p>
          <p>We have discussed from day one, what is the appropriate ownership? And we started out the project 50-50. We thought that as we went through development that was the right place to be, but both parties always acknowledged that at some point in the process it might make sense for a transition to a different ownership structure to occur. I can't speak for ConocoPhillips. I don't know their decision-making process. But, it's obvious that this is a period where all energy companies are looking for ways to reduce capital commitments and looking for additional sources of capital.</p>
          <p>So ConocoPhillips remains very committed to the project. They have retained a 20.01% interest in that. They are working very closely and constructively with us to move the project forward. And they, of course, will be a major user of the crude oil when it gets particularly to the St. Louis area Patoka, Wood River in Southern Illinois. So we saw it as an opportunity that has been cultivated from day one. We've always made it clear to ConocoPhillips that we be interested in more ownership of that pipe. I think you know that our bias is to have very large ownership in these major projects. Sometimes that's there from day one and sometimes it increases over time as we move through construction and into operations.</p>
          <p>So then I'll comment briefly, Carl, on any precedent this may imply for the Alaska project. I think there is nothing particularly directly significant about this, but I think it should be recognized that it is indicative of the good relationship we have with ConocoPhillips. And we've worked diligently with ConocoPhillips for seven years on exploring different ways to collaborate on the Alaska Pipeline Project, and we will continue to do that.</p>
          <p>I'd be optimistic that they would see merit in our way of doing the Alaska project and bringing them on board with our project would be our objective at the end of the day. And, Russ, I don't know if you'd add anything on the Keystone or Alaska fronts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be specific about your question on payment and NPV, there was no payment upfront for the Conoco share. Basically it will be done at -- the equalization will be done at book value. And it will be done via funding over time so there is no immediate payment required today.</p>
          <p>And I would agree with Hal on his comments with respect to producers at the current time focusing on their core business of EMP in a currently capital-constrained environment, which is a great opportunity for us to do what we do which is own and build pipelines.</p>
          <p>And I think the other thing that I guess this shows is that companies like ConocoPhillips' have a great deal of confidence in TransCanada's ability to construct something like this. The reason that they take ownership stakes in these large projects upfront is often to ensure that they get built in a way that meets their needs. And I think in working with Conoco over the last year, we've moved a long way in constructing Keystone to-date. And I think they're confident in TransCanada's ability to execute these projects in a way that makes them comfortable. And as Hal said, we would hope that that would play well for us in our discussions with them to build the Alaska pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then one follow-on, if I could, Russ, probably more, more for you. Just also with respect to Keystone on the binding open season, obviously that's closed. But can you comment on whether there were any further discussions on the spurs to Houston, which I understood could be as much as 50,000 barrels a day. Is it that something that's still very much alive? And if that's the case, how much would something like that cost? And what might be the timing of knowing whether or not that might happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The lateral to Houston is probably in the neighborhood of $300 million, so in the scheme of the project not a large capital expenditure to make that connection. The -- there is couple of shippers that are interested in that lateral. But, unfortunately the timing of our open season and the nature of open season didn't allow those shippers to put forward a proposal. So I would expect that we would have a follow-on open season in the next few months to capture those.</p>
          <p>And as Hal pointed out in terms of our Alaska negotiations or any pipeline expansions that we move on, we tend to try to negotiate with the shippers' present agreements upfront that meet their needs, before we hold the open season and this will give us some time to go to do that.</p>
          <p>And then, further from that there is still some capacity potentially on the system to Patoka and Wood River post 2013, the way that we are going to operate the system. And we may hold another open season; we've had considerable interest in that piece of it as well. So I think you could see at least maybe two more open seasons on the system as it's designed today over the coming months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you give a more detailed attribution of the rough doubling of Eastern Power operations profit during the quarter, particularly given such a small amount of volume was sold into the spot market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, it's Alex. I think primarily the reason for the really good results in the Eastern business is, as you may have experienced or heard, it was a very wet quarter in the Northeast and our hydro assets delivered much, much more energy than we would have anticipated in a normal Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, do you have a sense as to how much that contributed to the earnings during the quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just looking -- on a pre-tax basis it was somewhere 20, 25 million.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>20, 25 million?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And we -- the other thing I would say is we, obviously, we had the Raven -- we had Ravenswood in for the month of September. And the other thing, we just had some pretty good returns from our marketing business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just if I can ask one last question on for Keystone, Greg, have you had detailed discussions with your banks yet for the bank line you want to put in place in the fourth quarter, particularly with respect to the -- just the availability of the size of credit that you are going to be looking for? Is that something where you going to be initiating the discussions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, we've had discussions. We've held initial bank meetings and we have commitments for approximately half of what we're looking for for that facility. We're looking for about $1 billion facility to put that in place, and we would expect that we would be somewhere in that upper end, 800 to the $1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the half that you've been able to secure, has that covered most of the banks in your existing bank group and are you going to be looking for new banks to come in or is that just the timing of people who've committed to-date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more a timing issue. In this environment generally commitments aren't as large as they probably were a year ago. We're confident that we're able to do this facility we would expect within the existing bank group but we do have a number of other banks that have showed an interest who would like to become part of the lender group to TransCanada.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just on the Ravenswood for a moment, the $9 million your basic earnings in the month of September, is that a good going forward rate because you basically have the arrangement in for rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I really don't I think you can use that as any form of a run rate, Bob. That's very much related to the Hess deal and it probably isn't indicative of going forward.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Isn't Hess, the arrangement going on for the rest of the -- end of the year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes it is. Yes, what we earn from Ravenswood in 2008 is a combination of what we would earn under the tolling agreement with Hess, and obviously they are taking all of the fuel costs etcetera. And plus, any amounts that we received through the capacity payments in the capacity market or the capital market. And that ends up being very cyclical or seasonal by quarter, usually higher in the summer quarters, much higher in the summer quarters and much lower in the winter quarters. So as far as going forward, we're not looking to see a lot in the fourth quarter. But, those are the factors that are impacting it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And looking -- just a general question on the Canadian dollar. It's had a little bit of volatility, and two questions I guess on that or two aspects of one, is going forward, what is your exposure to the dollar from an operating basis? And secondly, what would be the impact of given the large capital expenditures that you have in the U.S., is that fully picked up in tolls is there any risks there from swings in the dollar or how have you protected yourself on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, go first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So generally with regard to income we're long U.S. dollars. So we're long about $180 million a year. So we have U.S. income but also U.S. interest payments. So as the Canadian dollar changes, a $0.01 change would have sort of a $1.8 million impact before hedging. We have some hedging programs in place which would roll through our P&amp;L, we run a rolling 12-month hedge program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And specifically on Keystone is the tolls are set in U.S. dollars. So it offsets the increase in cost from a Canadian perspective if you look at that way, that basically it's a U.S. project and the U.S. tolls, or the U.S. shipping is paid in U.S. dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if everything goes to plan, the lower Canadian dollar actually boosts up your Keystone earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will make it larger Canadian earnings and Canadian dollars, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Bob, it's Hal, we don't really place too much emphasis on that. We look at U.S. dollar investments generating U.S. dollar earnings. And the fact that it all gets consolidated in Canadian dollars I think everybody kind of understands that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes -- I was just looking at these things and what they mean to everybody. And so, we had about $0.20 swing in the dollar recently. So to be clear that if I'm saying $0.01 decline I can multiply $0.20 times the 1.8, but then there's some hedging offset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. So that rolls through the P&amp;L because they don't qualify for hedge accounting treatment and we mark those to market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I wouldn't see the full 1.8 in the reported earnings basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you won't.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be offset as to mark-to-market on the out of the money hedges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The hedging will be more lumpy?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Just how do you see your balance sheet metrics on a go forward basis? And I ask the question in part because the turmoil we've seen in the last, call it, two months. And the last time we went through some very industry specific issues, if we go back to Enron collapsing in late '01 and we saw the debt raters essentially change where the goal posts were quite dramatically, forcing a lot of companies to delever in a significant fashion. And that was very industry specific and this a broader deleveraging that we're seeing across the economy right now. What's your outlook on a go forward basis, where your balance sheet will be in a lot of your coverage ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think generally, obviously we are in constant discussions with the rating agencies. We generally keep our balance sheet in the 60, 40 kind of balance sheet. It looks like it's a little thicker on the equity side. But the rating agencies have different methodologies around how they treat certain things on the balance sheet including goodwill. So we work with them with respect to those ratios.</p>
          <p>But generally I think we're in a pretty reasonable spot from a balance sheet perspective. The ratios that they use with respect to cash flow to debt, etcetera, are fairly defined, and we are aware of those and we work with them on it. There are also qualitative criteria. And a number of things that we're doing are very positive from a qualitative perspective. If you read the rating agency reports a Canadian regulated business, which has no volume risk is seen positively by the rating agencies.</p>
          <p>And as you can tell we've been adding to the Alberta rate case significantly. And we have North Central Corridor and some expansions, potentially in the Horn River and Montney areas which are positive from that perspective. And we do obviously have a need for additional debt. And we'll need to look at the subordinated capital or equity markets in order to keep those in line over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then when you think about your business mix and the direction it's going, are you trying to keep a fairly good balance between projects with good long-term contracts like Keystone and a lot of the PPA power plant facilities that you have right now, and really a more merchant or unregulated type business? And what would that divide be and how do you see that divide on a go forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, it's Hal. Well first of all I'll make this broad comment that we are committed to deleveraging. This is been a consistent direction within TransCanada over the past seven years. We've always moved to reduce the amount of debt on our balance sheet and we've argued very thoroughly I think with Canadian regulators for thicker equity on our Canadian regulated pipes. And we are currently sitting at 40% equity on the Canadian regulated pipes, and we'd be delighted to see that equity thicken further. We think that it's a good thing for key infrastructure in North America to be less highly levered and to be as stable as it can be.</p>
          <p>As we expand beyond the Canadian pipeline business, which is no longer the dominant largest business in our company, we do look for assets like Keystone where we have long-term contractual backstop. The power plants, which we built many now in Ontario and Quebec are very soundly financed with -- and have good long-term contracts behind them.</p>
          <p>We recognize there are opportunities particularly in our power business and to some extent in our storage business to create significant value for our shareholders by taking merchant positions in market circumstances, where we're very comfortable with that. And I think our track record speaks well for the astuteness of our people, and what we've been able to do in terms of generating shareholder value, from some of those positions.</p>
          <p>But, the base case always is that we would drive for a less volatile income stream. We particularly focus on the volatility of cash flow and we don't want to suffer significant volatility in our cash flows, and we do continue to move to a less levered balance sheet. We think that's the general trend in North America and that's a good thing, and we are not going to fight that direction. We think it's good for our shareholders too. I'd note that over the past two or three years, we could have reported significantly higher earnings per share if we've been a little bit more adventurous in terms of both debt leverage and also in greater use of LP structures and things like that.</p>
          <p>We have the one LP in the States, which is a very rock solid MLP. And we continue to run that in a prudent manner. We're not big fans of a lot of exotic structures for doing things and I think relative to some others in the industry, we've been pretty conservative in that regard. All of which we think has set us up well to go through exactly the kind of period that we are in now. We raised 1.7 billion of equity in 2007 and we raised 1.2 billion roughly earlier this year. $3 billion of new equity plus significant dividend reinforced -- reinvestment that's been good for our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And I'd also note that our finance group did a great job raising significant depth in August just to make sure we were ahead of anything that might come along and we're obviously feeling very good about that today.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Bruce Power has announced that it is looking at a realignment as it goes in the home stretch of the restart in particular as AECL works on Unit 2. I'm wondering when that realignment might be complete and we can have our picture whether the Unit 1 and 2 restart will be in about a year from now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steven, its Alex. One thing I would say is that we were intending at our upcoming Investor Day to talk a little more fulsomely about Bruce and the restart. So I won't go into the depth today that I will there, but what I would say is that Bruce as everybody know it really is a massive project. And with any of these massive projects, as time goes on and you progress through the construction at the 1 and 2, we are very significantly through the big chunky parts of the refurbishment.</p>
          <p>But, as you go through these large projects, some things go better, some things go as expected, and some things go slower. And really what I think you were referring to, what we're doing at Bruce is we're just seeing certain areas and particularly I think the area that has been the most challenging, as it has really been from the start, is the Unit 2 retubing project and that is the project that is being done by AECL. And we're just seeing the lead unit, Unit 2, going a little slower than we would like. And we're just taking this opportunity to reposition some of the labor force to be more productive as we work through that Unit 2 issue.</p>
          <p>So for example, rather than have people waiting around, we've redeployed a significant number of the labor and the craft onsite to working on other projects that are becoming critical path things like valve refurbishment and some of the commissioning activities that we're getting into.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you. My next question is on Pipelines. Spectra announced that it's holding an open season for, looking for shipper commitments to ship both eastward to TransCanada, as well as westward. Is, are you -- is this a cooperative effort between you and Spectra or would your open season in BC be more in competition with them there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We be more in competition and what we're offering is an integrated toll through the Alberta system and it's somewhat dependent upon us receiving a favorable decision to our jurisdictional application that's in front of the National Energy Board currently. We expect that decision in early Q1, which would dovetail with what we've offered the marketplace here. So basically we're offering is an integrated service, so it wouldn't be a service that's combined with the West Coast open season.</p>
          <p>As you know, we've announced our own open season in the similar area that I think we announced it yesterday, it's on our website, it will run from October 27 through to November 21. And it's a follow-on to the non-binding open season that we held here a few months ago. So I guess we're running them at the same time as the competition and the marketplace will decide which direction they want the gas to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And finally if I may just, a couple of quick comments on the schedule for the open season on Dawn connector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's your schedule there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again we are just assessing what we -- the information that we got back and determining whether or not there is sufficient support to move forward with a binding open season. There is a lot of interest in moving gas that direction as a result of the increased production both in shale plays in the Rockies that want to move gas east. Our system has some advantages in moving that gas east, but there are other proposals in the marketplace, and I'd say that, stay tuned on that one as we move forward and assess what we have. And we'll be announcing our next steps, probably the next three or four months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple questions on the Energy division. First you touched briefly with another caller on Bruce and the Unit 2 retubing, I was just wondering if that's going to be of the remaining costs will that be -- take the lion's share of this cost? And how much is remaining on the costs for the refurbishment?</p>
          <p>And then with regard to the sulphur sales that you touched upon in the comments, I guess how much of the earnings related to the sulphur sales and how much of that should be considered continuing versus one-time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I think which I'll talk about the sulphur one first, because that's pretty simple. The sulphur, I would really think of that as a one-time item. It was about 17 million pre-tax in the quarter. And that -- really what the sulphur block was, it was just a residual asset left over from sale of some previous businesses of TransCanada. And we've really been selling that sulphur for several years, really at kind of a breakeven rate.</p>
          <p>And then in 2008, we all of a sudden saw a massive run up in the value of sulphur. So we took that opportunity to sell the -- basically the entire remainder of the sulphur block. So I just think of that as a one-time item. And then -- sorry...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with respect to Bruce, do you have the total numbers that we've spent? So we're right know at about 2.4 billion on the restart. The AECL contract is basically a fixed price contract. So any slowdown that they have is really -- or any challenges that they've had on the Unit 2 is not really relevant in terms of increased costs. And they would be significantly through their total cost of that retube project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as noted in the quarterly reports it's 2.4 billion that Bruce has spent to-date is at 100% ownership. So our share would be about half that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how much was the total contract for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the total estimate for the project I think at this point is in that 3.4 billion range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good quarter, gentlemen. I have a several balance sheet and credit questions. Maybe I'll start with some fine tune clarity on your foreign currency hedges, which you say are roughly I guess 50% on a roll forward basis. Is there any skew to that like some folks would do 80, 60, 40, 20 or some other relationship to that? Is it just straight 50% month in, month out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It varies just depending on our view of the market. But, it's just generally around that. It's a very small number when you look at the overall scheme of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, it does vary. So you don't have a mathematical formula? Okay, Hal, with TC hydro you said 20, 25 million of pre-tax. That was a difference I presume from normal while hydro levels are on a long run basis for those assets, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think just as an example Sam, I think we hit the sort of 100 year average or 50 year average hydro production for those facilities. We hit that in early September, which gives you a bit of an idea just how productive they've been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's helpful. Going into your gas storage business, reread it, sounds like pretty much you're 100% hedged every which way, when &#x2013; that's just a simple answer to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's a fair statement, particularly for the next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Switching to capitalization and what's on your balance sheet, and what credit rating agencies as you are saying, obviously look at different things different ways. What does your balance sheet currently have for Mackenzie capitalization, Alaska capitalization and all other capitalizations and how are the rating agencies looking at those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't capitalize anything on Alaska, The financials statements disclosed that capitalization, Mackenzie was I think around $140 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the 140 for instance, would those agencies look at that as equity? I presume not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, just a -- I guess this is a point of clarification for bondholders. When you look at your preferences, you talked about preferences for subordinated capital and expectations, as far as getting the bank facility done. As we all know the subordinated capital market is all but gone especially, if you want to do preferred you'd certainly have to pay up a lot to do that. Banks are constricting credit right now, so when you're trying to figure out your ability to get the other half of the facility financed, I guess as we head up into the Investor Day are we going to get a little bit clearer picture than in the past about I guess the timing of capital expenditures and just trying to figure out a little bit more specific sources and uses as we head in to what I would call very uncertain times and then the next 12 to 18 months?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the -- on the expansion, the shippers' share 75% of those costs, TransCanada incurs 25% of those costs and we just adjust the toll accordingly. On the base Keystone, which is the one under construction, once we put the pin in the capital, we share those ups and downs 50-50 with the shippers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The bulk of the pipe for the first phase of the project has been purchased. Minimal amounts have been, I guess we are in the process of negotiating the contracts for the second phase of the project currently. And that was part of the discussion Hal had earlier in terms of timing of those expenditures and the timing of mill space, the timing of contractors, all of those things will play into our scheduling over the next quarter as we sort out when exactly our shippers want this capacity in place.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That seems to be the direction that at least steel prices are moving at the current time and I would expect that mill space and others would follow as well. We're seeing a number of projects across the globe right now being canceled, which has had the impact of reducing demand for steel, at least perceived demand for steel and we have seen those prices come off here a bit.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And then just you know going back to the timefame and understanding kind of the flexibility that's needed now, as we have kind of shifted from sort of an early 2012 to just generally stating 2012, is this something also that can slip into 2013 or is really just a matter of I guess gauging within that one year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have the ability to go into 2013 if that's what they want us to do. And as you see by the drawing, I mean what's critical to them is getting to the Gulf Coast in some time in 2012. The building of the leg from Hardesty to Steel City, the direct leg, doesn't necessarily need to be done in 2012. But, that's not what they what they want to do. So that piece could move into 2013 if that's what our shippers wanted us to do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That last question that was mine as well. But, maybe be a little bit more clear, I think you said that the debt costs weren't as, if debt costs have risen you end up having to swallow that yourself on -- is that on both phases or just one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On both phases.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you said you are comfortable with the  -- any changes there, so that means that they would have no significant impact on your expected return on equity at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've run various scenarios and we don't think it has a material impact on our economics at the current time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're funding more in the shorter term during this particular time. It's a long-lived project. It will carry debt over a long number of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And you said before, before you moved up to the 83% capacity utilization, had given some sort of metrics around what kind of returns you might expect and how much needed to be shipped through spot. Now that you're at 83%, is to achieve your required returns do you have to rely much on the additional spot sales or does the 83% sort of hit your hurdle rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 83% gets us to the low end of our hurdle rate. And actually as you pointed out, obviously initially 80,000 barrels a day is substantial in that regard. We only have on the full system 120,000 barrels a day available for spot. And in sort of our base case economics we only run with half of that spot being shipped on an average day.</p>
          <p>So the difference between an average day -- or the difference between spot and not spot is a matter of about 50 basis points in our return. So at the bottom end of the return ideally you think, of numbers around seven without any spot at all, up to nine with some expansion, and some additional firm volumes on the system. So that's sort of the range that was in that sort of seven to nine kind of range.</p>
          <p>Now that it's tighter now, our opportunity for upside is less because there's less spot volume, but the on the downside as well there is less downside for us. It's a fairly narrow band of return or expected return that we have now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is there -- now we've seen some of these large projects get funded in different ways, is there anything in your contractual arrangements that basically says the equity what you're allowed to capitalize and into the rate base as you're going through construction period is all debt with the equity financing done at the end or is it sort of just no, or uniformly assumed that debt equity balances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no contractual commitment on how we finance ourselves through construction or even post construction. The tolls are set up, a cost estimate and a deemed capital structure, if you will. And how we finance ourselves over the construction period and in the long haul is really up to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And there is obviously a lot of moving parts to this because you're negotiating with a lot of people at this point. Some costs are going up and some costs are going down. But fair to say that sort of where you see yourself today then is that you've still got negotiations and therefore some costs might be offset by other savings?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Bob, it's Hal. I'd just add one thing to that that we haven't talked about today and that's the pace of construction on Phase I has gone very well. The summer season was really critical to us. We wanted to get off to a good start. We set out certain targets on both the Canadian and U.S. sections for how many miles of pipe we get in the ground and how much work we get done on major river crossings and things like that. And I just add to everything Russ has said that the first season of construction went very well. We're a bit ahead of our targets and we're in a good position to get the first part of it done next year.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I'm wondering if you can give me a bit more clarity on the Alaska negotiations? Are you actively offering stakes in the line to the North Slope producers yet or is that still to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Scott, we made it clear in our filings that we're prepared to do that and that's a fairly significant statement. There are other pipelines that we build where we don't offer those kinds of stakes. We're very clear that such ownership stakes would be offered in return for long-term shipping commitments. And working out all the details of that with those potential shippers is as you can imagine a very complicated process, many issues to discuss there.</p>
          <p>So, yes, we are in those discussions today. We have been in those discussions for some time. In fact, we were engaged in those discussions with a couple of the producers before we made our filing. So, this has gone on for a long time. And we hope to have that greatly progressed over the next 18 months so that we'll have things pretty well lined up as we go into that open season in mid 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we simply put to them the advantages of being involved in our project, including the fact that our project is strongly supported by the State of Alaska and that's obviously pretty important. So these are discussions that cover many, many issues. And of course, they're not going to express a willingness to walk away from their project until everything is agreed between us.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Is the strong interest in shippers in the Keystone expansion indicative in any way of a shift in sentiment to get more bitumen process in the U.S. rather than by upgraders in Alberta?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Norval, our message has been consistent throughout this, that if the marketplace wants to ship upgraded crude oil to refineries in the United States, then we're prepared to do that. In fact, our Keystone pipe system would have greater volume capacity if it were shipping low viscosity light oil than shipping bitumen blend. We're there to move whatever the market wants us to move.</p>
          <p>And so I really don't know whether it's indicative of that. What I think it is indicative of is confidence on the part of the producers that notwithstanding the weak oil price, there are significant volumes coming on at Fort McMurray and in other parts of Alberta. And those volumes do have to get to a market. And as has always been the case over the last 20 or 30 years, it's very important to have assured capacity to get volumes out of Alberta and into the end markets. People don't want to be bottlenecked or backed up here into Alberta where they would suffer from a very wide price differential. So holding capacity and having assured capacity to get to high value markets is pretty important to the producer, shippers. We are also seeing significant interest from refiners in the U.S. Gulf Coast region who want to have assured capacity or assured access to bitumen volumes in Alberta.</p>
          <p>And so a number of different shifts are occurring. I think all of that underpins our original thesis going in here that we saw significant growth in all forms of crude oil out of Western Canada, upgraded and non-upgraded. And we saw the most significant and attractive demand location being the U.S. Gulf Coast and some of the U.S. Midwest markets on the way there. And so we have specifically designed the Keystone Pipeline to connect a region of growing supply with a region of strong demand. And so far, that's proven to be a very good idea. That's worked well for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One follow-up if I may, I mean would you now -- I mean with the Gulf Coast wanting all this crude from Fort McMurray, have you now won the battle to supply that market with this announcement today? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Have we what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you won the battle over your competitors to supply that market today do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we see several million barrels a day of potential increased crude oil production out of Alberta over the next 20 years. So we obviously feel very comfortable that we now have a high volume, very low cost, attractively structured system that delivers what producers want to get crude oil from Alberta to the Gulf Coast. But there is much more to come in this and we may well see other tranches of crude oil go to other markets. Enbridge's big system obviously delivers a lot of crude oil into the Chicago market, and we did not want to compete with that. We recognize that's a strong market and they've got a good system. So we choose to go in a different direction.</p>
          <p>As to how volumes move over the next 10, 15, 20 years, that remains to be seen. But I would say we continue to focus on markets that are going to be attractive and stable and that really want Alberta crude oil over the long-term. And in our view the U.S. Gulf Coast is the best place to be, and that's where we are focused. We'll look at other opportunities as time goes forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sorry if you've addressed this already, I am just wondering how much you've seen your debt costs go up on what you're negotiating for on Keystone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the way we're structuring the Keystone facility is as a backstop facility for running a shorter term program in the commercial paper market. So it's really a back up. Certainly if we drew on it we'd have seen fairly significant run up in costs, in the several hundred basis point range. But we've kept the facility short-term in order to keep costs down. Obviously you've seen in the marketplace that longer-term facilities are quite expensive. And then we would plan then as we see the market adjust to deal with extending, amending or otherwise dealing with that facility after the first year. But we would have an ability to extend it out to two if we need to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, so the $1 billion facility is just a one-year facility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With an ability to term it out for a second year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so then you're hoping that you could perhaps renegotiate it then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll be in service by 2009 with the first phase at Keystone. And so at that time we would expect to be in a better position to deal with the balance of the borrowing needs for completion of the facility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's the traditional way of financing in any market, is construction is usually financed with short-term funding and then once construction is complete we put permanent financing in place for the facility. So the current environment hasn't changed our approach to financing. But as you point out, in the short run we've got higher costs than we've had in the past.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask couple of quick questions on Keystone. You mentioned that because of the delays in the oil sands that this could affect the timing of the Keystone expansion. I don't know if I heard you correctly but I think you mentioned a one year delay so that would go into 2013 as to 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean two comments here generally, one, there is some flexibility probably measured in months or periods of maybe 12 to 18 months, where we could see a delay in certain volumes coming on. But I'd emphasize that most of the volume that's, in fact all of the volume that's going to a flow through the base Keystone project and most of the volume that's going to flow through the expansion will come from projects that are already underway today. And these projects are not going to be cancelled or curtailed. These are major investments that people are making and they want that crude oil flowing to markets. And there just may be some delay in their project, but not cancellation or anything like that.</p>
          <p>So for most of the volumes that we are looking at both in the base Keystone project and the expansion, there is no question about the volume coming on. That's why people have been able to sign 17 to 20 year long-term contracts. But it may be advantageous to both TransCanada and its shippers to delay the onstream date by some number of months or maybe at the outside maybe by as much as 18 months, but not an issue where we're worried about long-term cancellation of projects.</p>
          <p>But as we look at expansion of Keystone beyond that, and I'd emphasize that the expansion of Keystone in future years through looping-in more horsepower is really attractive to TransCanada. That's a major driver of long-term value for us. That will of course depend on new projects going ahead. There are number of projects that are in regulatory process today. And no doubt the price of oil will drive the decision by the developers of those projects as to when they go ahead. So longer term expansion volumes are little bit more of a question mark right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to, I mean would that involve the potential expansion to Houston which would take it up to, what, 1.5 million barrels a day? Is that one of the expansions that you're mentioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that ones more driven by that there is existing demand in the Houston area, existing refiners that want access to that Canadian crude oil. So those I would say that lateral expansion wouldn't be related to the kinds of things that Hal was saying. There isn't additional capital that needs to be spent at those facilities to take that crude oil. It's just that those parties weren't able to put in place all of the approvals and those kinds of things necessary to meet our deadlines on our current open season.</p>
          <p>So our follow-up on open season will be shortly after this one. And I would say that if it's successful the delivery dates to the Gulf Coast have probably the least amount of flexibility in them. Just that the leg going from Cushing to the Gulf Coast is something that those refiners want in place relatively quickly. If we do have flexibility, it would be on the upstream portions of the pipeline.</p>

          <p>Thank you. There are no further questions at this time, gentlemen. I'm sorry we did just get a follow-up question from Norval Scott from the Globe and Mail. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>

          <p>Sorry, just one follow-up, with regard to the changed agreement with ConocoPhillips on the equity stake in the pipeline, did you actually, was that an agreement that you came to or did you have to pay Conoco anything or how did that actually work?</p>

          <p>There's no payment to them. It basically is just a shift in ownership. So moving forward we will pick up a larger percentage of the cost and equalize our expenditures to that or true up our expenditures to that 80/20 spilt over the coming years. It will take us quite some time actually to get equalized to the 80/20 spilt.</p>
