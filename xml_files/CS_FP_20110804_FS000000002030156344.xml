          <p>Okay. Good afternoon to all of you, and welcome to our Second Session of the day, on the Half-Year AXA and Half-Year 2011 Earnings Presentation held in London.</p>
          <p>So today, will be presenting Henri de Castries, Chairman and CEO of AXA; Denis Duverne, Deputy CEO; and Gerald Harlin, Group CFO. A Q&amp;A session will follow the presentation. And now, Henri, I'll leave you the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mattieu. And since you all seem to be quite depressed, I just want to start by reminding you what Churchill's definition of success was; the ability to go from failure to the other without losing your enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>Having said that I don't think the half-year earnings are a failure. They are very solid and good earnings. Why so? Well, of course, the net income is quadrupling, but, as you know, I mean we had exceptional negatives last year. We have some exceptional positives this year.</p>
          <p>So, I'd like to focus more on underlying, adjusted and on the trends in the key businesses. Underlying earnings are up 10%. I think it's good news because it's resuming the earnings growth. We had a couple of years of flat underlying earnings or slightly decreasing underlying earnings. They have resumed their growth and you'll see from where it's coming we think it's a robust and healthy increase.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings are up 7% driven, of course, by underlying, but driven also by the ability to realize capital gains. And this is despite the fact that we have mark-to-market the Greek bonds we had with maturity date before 2020. So, solid underlying earnings, solid adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>If you look at where it's coming from basically on Life &amp; Savings, margins are improving significantly, earnings are up 9%. I mean Denis will show you the details.</p>
          <p>The good news on Life &amp; Savings for us is the fact that the selectivity we had decided to implement as part of the Ambition AXA program is working. Health &amp; Protection, which we want to develop are up or is up in APE by 14% with significant margins, 47% margin on new business.</p>
          <p>Unit-Linked despite uneven market conditions is stable, but with good margins. General Account Savings is significantly down in terms of APEs but margins there are thin, kind of only in existence, so it's not something, which is worrying us. It's what we were willing to achieve because it's freeing up capital in certain areas, which you can redeploy in others. So the work of selectivity in the Life business is working.</p>
          <p>Second point, acceleration in the emerging markets, it's working also in the Life business. The fraction of new business value which is coming from emerging markets is growing over the semester.</p>
          <p>Property &amp; Casualty, combined ratios are improving. This is true, of course, for the all-year combined ratio, which is now slightly above 97%. The current year combined ratio, which is the ratio we've been focusing on, is now below 100%. We had a goal for the year, which is 100%. It's already below that for the first half. It's clear that we had less natural catastrophes, but on the other hand, you can see that there have been some very significant improvements on the underwriting area and also on admin expenses. So we think that there we are well on track.</p>
          <p>Acceleration on the Property &amp; Casualty side for the new distribution systems or for the emerging markets, direct is up in revenues, nearly 10%, slightly below the long-term goal because Korea is a market where we had a significant direct operation and price have been controlled, blocked, for a while so this has prevented us from raising prices as much as we wanted, but now it's over, so we think we can do it. Other high growth markets, revenues up 11%. We think it's a good achievement.</p>
          <p>Asset management, it's a more mixed picture. It's starting to be satisfactory again at AXA IM, because flows are positive, investment performance is very strong, and we are, I would say, coming over the turbulence that's created by AXA Rosenberg.</p>
          <p>AllianceBernstein is a more contrasted picture because we still have significant outflows. These outflows are concentrated on the institutional equity side of the firm. The other departments or the other specialties of the firm are growing, but not enough to offset the outflows of assets in institutional equities, and Denis will come back to that.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, very solid, which this time is probably a competitive advantage. Solvency I, Solvency II ratios are quite strong.</p>
          <p>The debt gearing is progressively going down as we state we would bring it down during the analyst presentation in June. It was at 28% at the end of June. If you take into account the Canadian sale, which is not reflected in the half year earnings, this ratio would have been at 26%. So, pretty close to the 2015 goal, which is 25%. So there we think we are in good shape.</p>
          <p>We have, as you know, allocated capital quite actively by selling mostly in major markets, but also the dormant participation we had in Taikang, and reallocating that to emerging markets, and in particular, to the buy-out of the Australian minorities, which has enabled us to control 100% of our Asian activities. And when you look at the numbers of the first half, you can understand why we were willing to buy 100% of these Asian activities.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, first semester well aligned with the long-term goals. And Denis will comment in more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good afternoon, everyone. I will try not to go over each of the &#x2013; every one of the slides, but try to cover the main points. Some of you may have already listened to the call this morning.</p>
          <p>So, on the Group side, just slide 15. We have treated the Canadian operations as discontinued, which means that the earnings of Canada for the first half appear as net income and not underlying. Therefore, if we want to compare the first half of this year to the first half of last year, you have to deduct from the first half of last year the &#x20AC;84 million of earnings of Canada in the first half of last year. If we had treated Canada as an ongoing operation, the growth would have been 11%.</p>
          <p>Moving directly to Life &amp; Savings, and I'd like to go directly to slide 20. Looking first at new business, we said that we were going to focus on Protection &amp; Health and General Account Savings &#x2013; and Unit-Linked, sorry, at the expense of General Account Savings &#x2013; where we don't like the margin as we have currently with the low level of interest rates. This is again what we have done for the first half.</p>
          <p>Growth of 14% in Protection &amp; Health with strong sales across the board, but particularly in Switzerland with a good development on Group Life, where we are collecting market share from the foundations. Basically with markets recovering some, the foundations are now <mark type="audio gap" /> (08:39) the liability so that SMEs can move at no expense to an insurance company and not take the risk on their balance sheet anymore, and they are doing that quite nicely.</p>
          <p>Germany, there was a favorable change in regulation on the health side. U.S. success of our new Indexed Universal Life, not only through our proprietary sales force, but also third party sales force.</p>
          <p>On the General Account Savings, we had a decline of 26%. We continue to have a slightly negative margin because of the very low interest rate environment. And the General Account Savings we had negative movements especially in Belgium, Italy and France. One common factor, which is aggressiveness of the banks on the deposit rates. Then separate factors. France, the threat of the tax reform in the first half. Italy, the end of the tax amnesty last year, so all in all, minus 26%.</p>
          <p>Unit-linked, is down 1%. That's a disappointing element. We have a good margin of 24%. We have strong performance in France, Italy and the U.S. and high growth markets. But in the UK, we had a big pension case last year which we didn't have this year. And, Germany, as a result of the repricing of our VAs, the flows were less significant.</p>
          <p>Nice performance in the mutual fund side; 15% growth. This is largely what is happening in the UK with the success of our Elevate wrap platform and our Architas MultiManager offering. And all in all, our new business margin moves from 21% to 26%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the development of our earnings on the Life side, you see that earnings were down 1% but we &#x2013; you shouldn't forget that we don't have in this first half the last part of the UK Life that we've sold and Australia and New Zealand, which we sold. So if you exclude those impacts, we would be up 9%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the different components of our Life profits, we had a good development on the investment margin not because the margin increased, but because the asset base increased. We had the nice development of recurring fees also for asset based reason. Technical margin improved by &#x20AC;180 million and that's essentially three factors, good GMxB &#x2013; good margin on the GMxB products in the U.S., much better than last year, a negative impact from the earthquake in Japan and a negative impact from the change in regulation in France. And &#x20AC;20 million of that is the reclassification of expenses into a negative technical margin because the tax was changed into a levy. And &#x20AC;40 million of that is that amortization of the &#x2013; I mean a change in &#x2013; following a change in regulations &#x2013; a change in the retirement age which was moved from 60 to 62 last year and we are repricing our corporate Life portfolio to catch up for the additional payment that we have to make for retirees.</p>
          <p>The expenses were slightly up, but we have a big increase in the amortization of DAC, which is basically reflecting the fact that we had an improved profitability in the U.S. We have a strong DAC activity.</p>
          <p>On the U.S. VAs the main change is that we had a negative margin on GMxB of &#x20AC;91 million last year. It's positive &#x20AC;5 million this year thanks in large part to lower volatility. We had earnings &#x20AC;98 million against &#x20AC;4 million last year, but we have to flag that we will have in the second half as we had last year a review of our lapse experience and we could have a similar hit to the one &#x2013; hit of the same magnitude as the one we had last year, which was &#x20AC;97 million as you see in the second column.</p>
          <p>On the Life side, again, you see that more than half of our profit, 60% of our profits are coming from Protection &amp; Health, which grew by 1%, 8% excluding the impact of the Japanese earthquake. We had a nice growth in Savings coming from the increase in investment margin, a nice growth in Unit-Linked coming from the U.S. VA profit improvement.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C side, I'd like to go directly to slide 27. You see that, as we indicated, we're pushing for growth in high-growth markets and direct. We have 11% and 9% growth, respectively, while our growth in mature markets is subdued at 1.2% because we favor profitability over growth. In all regions, we had the nice improvement in the current year combined ratio, in total 3.8%, and you can see that transpiring both in mature markets and in direct.</p>
          <p>The improvement in the current year combined ratio of 3.8 points was obviously helped by a low occurrence of natural catastrophes, 0.1% against 1.7% last year. We strive for roughly 1% impact from natural catastrophes. You see also that we have a lower prior-year reserve development at 2% versus 4.5% last year. We have indicated to the market that we would expect lower prior, positive prior year reserve development. We don't expect to go into negative territory, but we cannot tell you for sure that 2% is the minimum. We know that in this phase of the cycle we have lower prior year reserve developments. All in all, our common ratio improved by 1.3 points at 97.2% and our assets yield was stable at 4.1%, which is quite decent.</p>
          <p>Looking at the price developments on slide 29, you see that we continue to increase prices across the board, overall, 3.5% with the exception of Switzerland, which is a market where our level of profitability is quite high. We have combined ratio in the area of 90%. You can see that in commercial lines, our price increases are starting to stick. We had negative revenue growth in commercial lines in the last two years. We now have, for the first time, positive revenue growth and the most remarkable change is in the UK where our revenue growth is higher than our price increase, which has not happened in a number of years.</p>
          <p>You see also for the UK that on the personal line side our revenue growth is very small in spite of high price increases. This is because we've lost some travel and warranty business, in particular. We continue to gain exposures on the personal lines. In total close to 800,000 contracts in the first half of which half of that in mature and direct businesses.</p>
          <p>In our strategy, we put as one of the three key strategy developments, strategic priorities for AXA increase in efficiency. We show that in P&amp;C for the first half. We said that we would reduce our expense ratio by four points over the next five years and we announced that we would do at least 0.5% in 2011. We've done 0.8% in the first half. Taking out exceptional elements, we have 0.6% in reality and of that 0.2% is administrative expenses thanks to various productivity programs and 0.4% is acquisition expense ratio reduction thanks to lower commission rates.</p>
          <p>Asset Management, I'd like to show you &#x2013; I'd like to comment on slide 33. AllianceBernstein, we had negative flows of &#x20AC;24 billion mostly concentrated in institutional equities as Henri mentioned, AXA IM, you will recall that we &#x2013; that following the coding error that we uncovered last year, we had a settlement with the SEC and announced a compensation to our unit holders in January of this year. So, we continue to have outflows in AXA Rosenberg in the first quarter. It's now, I would say &#x2013; I believe it's the end of the outflows at AXA Rosenberg. We have still &#x20AC;3 billion of outflows this first half, but &#x20AC;4 billion of positive flows in the other areas on the back of very good investment performance.</p>
          <p>And on AllianceBernstein we wanted to show that most of the outflows were in equities and where the asset base has been shrinking quite rapidly. Fixed income is now bigger than equities at AllianceBernstein and alternatives are starting to be a significant asset class and both asset classes are performing quite well both from a flow and investment performance standpoint. Equities, the investment performance this year is mixed and that means that we are probably not at the end of the equity outflows.</p>
          <p>I think that's all I wanted to comment and I now hand over to Gerald. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. So as far as shareholders' equity is concerned, shareholder equity dropped from &#x20AC;49.7 billion to &#x20AC;46.4 billion, i.e., minus &#x20AC;3.3 billion. On the right hand side you have the main elements of this decrease, like the dividend, like the decrease in unrealized capital gains as well the goodwill. In line with the IFRS results, we had to deduct the goodwill from the shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>ForEx movement minus &#x20AC;1.5 billion due to the appreciation of the euro versus different currencies like U.S. dollars, since then that means since the end of June we recovered one-third out of the &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>On the bottom left, you have the unrealized capital gains first starting with equities in dark blue and moving from &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;2.0 billion, explained mostly by the disposal of our Taikang Life stake, explaining &#x20AC;0.7 billion, and in fixed income a decrease from &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. Off balance sheet elements corresponding to real estate and loans, so which are not in OCI; it's &#x20AC;2.9 billion; quite stable.</p>
          <p>Moving to the economic solvency, very strong solvency from 178% to 184%, so reinforcement of 6%, mostly explained by market elements. You can notice that the &#x2013; you have in dark blue the available capital, in light blue, the required capital. The decrease of the available capital is mostly explained by the fact that we don't benefit any more from the minority shareholders of APH, which explains the decrease of &#x20AC;3.8 billion. And the required capital slide, the decrease is explained by Australia as well, &#x20AC;0.09 billion, and as well some market elements for most of the remaining part.</p>
          <p>You can notice on the right-hand side that our sensitivity is very low, in line with our policy, which is to mange almost no mismatch between assets and liabilities so that our sensitivity to interest rates is quite low.</p>
          <p>I won't comment the debt gearing of 28% and we will be at 26% by the end of the year, corrected with the Canadian operation, the Canadian disposal. General account invested assets, no change.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Greek government bonds, and you can notice that the gross book value of Greek bonds investments amount to &#x20AC;1.5 billion. The gross market value is &#x20AC;766 million, which means that the percentage of book value is roughly 50%. So, gross annualized losses is &#x20AC;756 million.</p>
          <p>Net unrealized losses, that means net of policyholder bonus and net of tax, is &#x20AC;247 million broken down between the maturities before 2020 at minus &#x20AC;92 million, which is circled in red, and maturity above 2020 at minus &#x20AC;155 million, so we decided to impair the &#x20AC;92 million, so the &#x20AC;92 million is a hit in our adjusted earnings, so we impair 40%, so the whole difference between the book value and the market value as being there for 40% for the maturities below 2020. And for the other maturities above 2020, it flows through OCI, but on a mark-to-market basis. So, we agreed to participate in the voluntary program of debt exchange, rollover and buyback.</p>
          <p>Next is the exposure to the other European peripheral countries. As a whole &#x2013; and look at the second column &#x2013; as a whole we have an exposure of &#x20AC;30 billion in market price, which is equivalent of 7% of our assets. The gross unrealized gain and losses here is about &#x20AC;2 billion, and the net unrealized gain and loss is &#x20AC;0.7 billion.</p>
          <p>First of all, this &#x20AC;0.7 billion corresponds to sum of the last column is net of tax and net of PB, it's accounted in OCI. It's reflected in our Solvency I and economic capital ratio. And at the same time, I can say that we are comfortable with the PB absorption of unrealized losses since we have large amount of fixed income unrealized gains and you can see it on this slide.</p>
          <p>The first part of the slide is the amount of fixed income assets unrealized gains at the end of the June and the second part is at the day before yesterday, on August 1. First &#x2013; so on the first slide, on the upper part, at June 30, we have an unrealized gains of &#x20AC;2.6 billion, out of which the peripheral countries represent &#x20AC;0.7 billion, and since then, although we had a widening of the spreads of spreading by more than 80 basis points; Italy most notably, 110 basis points, which explains that we moved the unrealized gains from &#x20AC;0.7 billion to &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>At the same time, decreases in the spreads in other countries like France, Germany, Switzerland, U.S. and so on makes that we have &#x2013; we more than offset this increase of unrealized losses with unrealized capital gains on these countries. On a net basis, as you can see, on the right-hand side, we moved from &#x20AC;2.6 billion to &#x20AC;3.5 billion, which is a net improvement of &#x20AC;0.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I don't think I need to make a conclusion. I think we'll directly take your questions. Yes?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Nick Holmes, Nomura. I had a couple of questions on, first of all, European exposure and basically how you do your calculations. I wondered if you could explain with the net position, net of policyholders share, I wondered if you could just give us more color on how you actually calculate that? I mean, Gerald was explaining that you've got the PB and then you've got policyholder capital. Are you taking &#x2013; are you assuming that it's like one for one, or are you assuming that the participation ratio in different countries like the 85:15 in France and so on would be effective? That's the first question, just how you &#x2013; some more information on how you calculate the net the position. Then the second question is, the criteria for impairment. If you could just explain how much is a judgment call and how much is mechanical. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first question first. Your question is about how do we calculate the net exposure. So it's calculated, I would say, on a portfolio by portfolio basis, because, as you explained, in France you have 85%, but we have some portfolio that's 100%, others, which could be lower and so on. So, the 85% is a range, for example, in France. In Germany, you could have it different. So it's done on a portfolio by portfolio basis. So, all the calculation and especially the last slide that I showed you is done on a portfolio by portfolio basis.</p>
          <p>The next point is &#x2013; the question was about what the absorption capacity. And, in fact, the way it works is that the absorption the capacity first. When you have unrealized losses your cash flows are exactly the same, which means that when it's unrealized, you don't have any change in your absorption capacity. So, if you are, on average, at 85, take the example of France, you remain at 85. What could start to be a problem is when you would be in a position to impair or if there would be any kind of default. And there that's why it's so important to look at what are the remaining capital gains on the other countries and on the other bonds, sorry. And <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:06) &#x2013; assets in general. And yes, because you have the real estate, as well as the equities and so on. And the next point is to check, okay, that what is the guaranteed rate. And the average guaranteed rate at the Group level is 2.2%.</p>
          <p>Take the example of France. In France we have an average guaranteed rate of 0.9% only. So that explains why the absorption capacity is so important.</p>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; I'll give you another example, which is Germany. In Germany &#x2013; because in Germany we have the <mark type="ph" /> CFRB (29:48) and in Germany the <mark type="ph" /> CFRB (29:50) itself plus the capital gains could let us absorb and could absorb 25% &#x2013; roughly 25% of impairment on all these states or countries. Just an example, but to tell you that we are quite confident in our capacity to absorb some negative scenarios, but, again, it's important to &#x2013; the example that I gave is in case we're forced impair. We are far, far from such a situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you give us an update on the amount of policy holder capital? Because I think at year end it was a really big number, wasn't it? It was like &#x20AC;10 billion, &#x20AC;12 billion and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but it's &#x2013; in fact it was &#x20AC;15 billion at the end of last year out of which &#x20AC;5 billion corresponding to the <mark type="ph" /> different (30:41) PB on OCI and this remaining &#x20AC;10 billion can be broken down between &#x20AC;5 billion, which are really I would say <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:50) and the other &#x20AC;5 billion, which are some PBs that should be distributed in a short period of time. So it's globally you can take keeping in mind something around &#x20AC;5 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no not much effect. We didn't &#x2013; another point is that we did &#x2013; take the example of the impairment that we booked on the &#x20AC;92 million, that we booked on Greece. We didn't need to get it <mark type="ph" /> up slope (31:27) by any kind of such trigger.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mechanical, that's not the way I would explain it. We had, in fact, two different ways to approach this impairment. Henri indicated where we should apply mark-to-model or mark-to-market. It was a problem with the liquidity of the market and we believe that it was more crucial to have a mark-to-market approach. Mark-to-market meant that we had in fact two different categories of bonds. The first, which were the bonds, which were concerned by restructuring and ones which were maturing before 2020 and the other one. But in both case you notice that you &#x20AC;92 million impairment is calculated on a mark-to-market and the OCI either way also calculated on a mark-to-market. We decided not to apply a mark-to-model for Greece.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So more broadly speaking impairment rules in IFRS, since IFRS is a principles-based system, not mechanical.</p>
          <p>So to take the example of equities for AXA, you know that we impaired in case of a decline of 20% or more than 12 months or more than 20% for six months or any amount for more than 12 months. And this is probably one of the stricter rules and you have companies that impair in case of a decrease or a decline of 40% for three years. So since it's a principle-based system, there is no &#x2013; I mean, it's not entirely mechanic and each company would have its own accounting principles. In the case of the bonds, I believe that a default requires an impairment and we have concluded that there was a selective default in Greece, which led us to impair the Greek 2020 exposure.</p>

          <p>Hi. Yes. Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. Just going back to your policyholder capital capacity, the roughly sort of &#x20AC;10 billion of which you're not going to use in the short term. Is it matched? Question number one is it matched to where you hold the debt that might be under pressure? So if you had all of your positive capital in a fun way you're not holding any Italian debt or Spanish debt for these, that's question number one. Question number 2 is let's say, we go to a period now of macro stressors, we're all very used to and you guys are used to it too. What are your regulators really going to care about? Is it your economic solvency ratio? I mean is that going to be your get-out-of-jail card? And last question, what portion of your liability will be subject to a matching premium if this was to be passed? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first part of your question, the policy holder capital so as you know we didn't &#x2013; we don't keep any price down after the &#x20AC;5 billion I mentioned to you but as you can imagine a significant part of it is in France, for example, which means that it could be &#x2013; in fact, it could be used. I mentioned also that it was in Germany, so we have another way to explain it. It is the sense of your question. It is in different countries, which are not the countries, which are concerned by the present problem</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the regulators is concerned, I mean the &#x2013; I think they are consistent. I mean they are pushing for European regulation with a consolidated solvency ratio. It's what they are looking at. Of course, you have local solvency levels. When you look at the Group, it's at the consolidated ratio that you have to look and if you have an issue at local level you can always, let's say, inject additional resources.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say at the current stage the supervisors are looking at Solvency I and that's the current metric that they are looking at and they &#x2013; I believe that in the countries of Europe, which are affected by these widening of spreads, the supervisors will take extraordinary measures so that their industry is not simultaneously in trouble.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You know this really excellent thing called a matching premium, which is the discount rate you might get in the fall of Q2 rather like the UK style model of discounting liabilities. What proportion of that &#x2013; if this was to be accepted, what proportion of your general account liabilities will be subject to this? It's not going to be a very significant...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, it's not something, which is solved yet, so it's still under discussion, but the principle, if it would be a full matching, it's much more &#x2013; it concerns much more that some type of NBV business and it will be so, it would concern mostly the UK plus Spain as well. So it will be a small part. But I don't want to anticipate the following discussion, so that's &#x2013; it depends on the extension to which &#x2013; our business today, as I said, we don't have any mismatch. So, it's very well matched. But the question &#x2013; and will we see in the following discussions within the next week what's the level of matching that would allow us to use this matching premium. But it's not done yet.</p>

          <p>I'm really sorry I'm being very greedy as I've got the mic, but your Solvency I ratio, bond losses, if they're not impaired just mark-to-market, couldn't we be up to the level of unrealized gains? That's right, isn't it? So on the Solvency I, as the Italian spreads, Spanish spreads widen, we didn't see an impairment because the limit has led to how much?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Tremblay, RBC. Question regarding the cost savings in P&amp;C, so you pretty much have 60 basis points improvement in the enlarged expense ratio year-on-year. But during the presentation this morning I think that Fran&#xE7;ois Pierson made reference to it, 50 basis points is pretty much the best you could do for the full year, that's your target for the full year as well. So should we expect a weaker year-on-year improvement in the second half? Or is that 60 basis point improvement, I mean a large expense ratio in the first half year-on-year pretty much a given for the full year?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>No, I think what Fran&#xE7;ois said was that our commitment for the year was 50 and that we have achieved 60 in the first half. He didn't give a precise guidance for the second half. He didn't say that maximum we could reach was 50 he said the minimum we have committed to is 50. That's all that was said.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. It's a fairly simple question. Where's the new money going when it comes in?

          <p>We are mostly investing in fixed income. And I think I didn't show the slide, but it's in your book. 83% are invested in fixed income and it will be the case in the Solvency II environment.</p>
          <p>What is more interesting is that we have real good opportunity today to invest in corporate bonds. In corporate bonds, today we can invest in AA bonds with a return of 4.5%, which means that, in fact, we can invest today without lowering the average quality and without lowering as well the average investments with them.</p>

          <p>And secondly, could you talk a bit more about the U.S. VA experience? If we get this level of risk-free rates over long periods of times, what is the sort of leakage to earnings each year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So just general comments about how that's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we don't calculate the embedded value at the end of June. What I can tell you is that we handle the conditions. We wouldn't expect or experience any significant difference compared with the end of last year. So that &#x2013; and you can imagine as well, since we are presenting here the economic solvency ratios, that we are using the embedded values. And you can now see that we are better of and that we even improved this coverage ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the U.S. VA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On U.S. VAs, two points. First, from the commercial standpoint, we see that there are still two large U.S. VA players that are slightly more aggressive in terms of features than we are. But the market has come more into line with where we stand. And our market share has stabilized. We saw a positive evolution of our VA sales. We are regaining ground in the third party channels. Our market share is stable around 4.5% roughly.</p>
          <p>And from a &#x2013; what you call the leakage &#x2013; there are two possible sources of leakage from an earnings standpoint. One relates to the hedging results. And here, in the first half, our experience was good because volatility was low. If volatility spikes, we are protected against extreme volatility above 28% because we have introduced tools, which allow us to switch our policyholders from equities to cash. Therefore, we are protected in those extreme cases. But if volatility is between 20% and 28%, we do have a situation where we lose a little bit of money on volatility.</p>
          <p>The other possible source of leakage is from customer experience. And this is the point I flagged earlier. If the situation &#x2013; the economic situation remains what it is, or the financial markets remain what they are right now with low interest rates, our policyholders being much in the money &#x2013; our lapse experience is such that we <mark type="ph" /> go through variable (44:20) lapses, and that's why we can expect that we'll have another hit in the second half of the same order of last year.</p>
          <p>And we might have perhaps a last hit in '12, but we'll be at the point where our assumptions for the most in-the-money policies will be 1% surrender rate, and we don't believe that we'll ever go below that. So I think the leakage there is &#x2013; we are close to the end of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A couple of questions, one specific, one general. A specific question on AllianceBernstein. You said that the strategy update that you expected positive flows in 2012. Are you still confident that will happen, just given some of the comments you made earlier?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the two big black clouds hanging over the sector, one of them is macro, which I guess you can do nothing about, and the other one's regulation. At what point do you think you're going to be able to stand up and say we know enough about Solvency II to start making bold and definitive statements about your balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the second one, on the regulation. As you know, there are two effects to that. First one is the &#x2013; the pronouncements of &#x2013; I mean the Level II directive and the Level III implementation measures.</p>
          <p>The Level II directive will be published in the middle of next year, and so we have to wait for that. That gives us the standards formula. And the standards formula remains important for us even though we will be governed by an internal model because the standard formula gives you some elements of the available financial resources, like the admissibility of hybrid debt and those kinds of things, will be the same as &#x2013; from the internal model as they will be in the standard formula. But we will be governed by our internal model.</p>
          <p>Our internal model is currently in the prevalidation phase with the <mark type="ph" /> ACT (46:39), the French Supervisor, and this prevalidation phase goes probably until the middle of next year. You know that the implementation of Solvency II has been delayed by one year or it's &#x2013; I mean it's now almost certain that it will be delayed by one year. So there is a risk that our model is not fully validated until the end of 2013, so I mean it's &#x2013; I cannot commit to anything final-final until the end of 2013.</p>

          <p>Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Tremblay, RBC. Still on AllianceBernstein, can you please refresh our memories regarding the capitalization of your U.S. Life business? And to what extent the AllianceBernstein stock is a significant component of the capital base? And also if you could update us on the RBC ratio of your U.S. Life business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So as you know today, our RBC ratio is 450% roughly. And it's not so much dependent on the price of AB. A $1 decline of the AllianceBernstein price, roughly speaking, its impact is 2%. So, it's not linear.</p>

          <p>Just on the other black cloud, which is the macro, could you maybe share with us some of the contingency thinking that's going on with the company with regards to what-if scenarios and with regards to low bond yield? You gave one example of you could withstand a 25% impairment on all the <mark type="ph" /> picks (52:36), et cetera. Could you share some other &#x2013; of your thoughts around that book?</p>

          <p>We have given sensitivities as part of the June presentation. They remain valid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure. I was more concerned with a possible tail event, like a 25% haircut on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:04)</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This example that we can &#x2013; let's take the example of AXA France. AXA France, today, the underlying gain. Coming back to my previous example of &#x2013; and I use that as a &#x2013; an average guaranteed rate in France of 0.9%. The unrealized gains on all the peripheral countries amount to &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Unrealized losses.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unrealized losses, sorry. It's &#x20AC;1.3 billion. It's interesting to compare with all the unrealized gains on equity, on fixed income, on real estate. And these, of course, are just below &#x20AC;7 billion, so &#x20AC;6.9 billion at the end of June.</p>
          <p>So you can see when you have such a large amount of unrealized capital gains with &#x20AC;1.3 billion of unrealized losses with no constraint or almost no constraint or very limited one on the guaranteed rate, you are on a safe side. That's another way to explain it. On a large country like France, which represent a significant part of our reserves.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And, <mark type="ph" /> Blair (54:15), I mean we all know we are not the banking sector. I mean we hold the assets for the long term.</p>
          <p>Even if there is a short-term depreciation, which is reflected in the balance sheet, it doesn't mean that we are going to sell the bonds. I mean we can keep them until maturity. I mean as long as we have a breakeven or positive cash flow. I mean if all the policy holders are coming to surrender at the same time, it would be slightly different, but they are &#x2013; I mean look at the balance sheet, what is the resource in terms of cash, in terms of bond in the large countries before having to do anything significant.</p>
          <p>Second, I know everybody's panicking now, but if you look at the macro numbers, Italy is a country with a primary surplus. Meaning that their budget is overbalanced before paying interest charges, and next year their budget will be balanced. So even if next year because there is a growth, which is slower than expected, the budget is not perfectly balanced, it's not a country, which has the sort of burning cash issue. It's a country, which is on its way to stabilize its public debt.</p>
          <p>What's frightening people is the level of the public debt. That's the inventory. But you have to look at how the inventory is growing or decreasing. They have stabilized the flows to a large extent. So, come back.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of our thinking on stress conditions we have an internal way of looking at it, which is -what we call our risk appetite. And so we have on a permanent basis stress tests, which look at four elements by decreasing a degree of urgency. Liquidity, earnings &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; liquidity, capital, earnings and value. I mean I don't think we care so much about value when the stock is at &#x20AC;11.80. So we're looking at liquidity. What's ours &#x2013; I mean we have liquidity contingency plans. The main source of stress in liquidity is derivative portfolios, the various hedges that we have on VA's and the hedges that we have on the Group balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And we are prepared for the most stressful conditions. Capital, the current market situation could put a strain on capital in countries like Italy and Spain. We are well prepared for that and earnings, the &#x2013; as I said, the stress that we can have is related to the U.S. VA portfolio but, as I mentioned earlier in a fairly detailed explanation, we are in a much better position than we were in 2008 for that. So we have gone through this thinking a number of times and we are not particularly worried.</p>

          <p>A couple questions. On the P&amp;C side, where you're talking about 3.5% rate rises or price increases in the mature markets, what's the level of claims inflation to set against that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year, we told you that &#x2013; last year &#x2013; in February, we told you that our claims inflation experience in 2010 was zero. In fact, we had offset the claims situation by claims management measures and the outcome was zero.</p>
          <p>And we had said that we expected claims inflation of above 1% for 2011. What we are seeing in the first half is closer to 2%. We are &#x2013; so this is something we're watching. And it's coming essentially from bodily injuries.</p>

Given, as your share price falls, what is the balance between assessing that against the hurdle rate of investing it in yourselves?

          <p>Yes. Excuse me. Just a quick question. Can you give us a sense of what your economic Solvency 184% would have been a few days ago? You gave us a good sense of what your analyzed gains on peaks come to where. I just wanted to check whether you have an updated...</p>

          <p>It would have been slightly better because as I explained you have plus and minuses, but as a whole &#x2013; it would be slightly better. But, let's say, it would have been the same, so I would not expect any significant move from the present level.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On a slightly more positive note, if we assume the world is still round in 2015, would you agree that one of the reasons that Solvency II is being delayed is that many of the about 5,000 insurance companies in Europe are not ready? Secondly, that many of them will never be ready? And thirdly, that this does provide some pretty interesting opportunity for the largest players within the Eurozone that many of the insurance companies will not be able to exist under Solvency II and that provides you a chance to grow in various ways? Do you think that's correct to look at it like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but I think you probably have a number of small and middle-sized companies, which are not as advanced as the large groups are because the large groups are very advanced. You have to ask yourself also about the degree of preparation of the regulators, of the supervisors themselves. All the supervisors are not necessarily absolutely ready to validate within a short timeframe complex internal models.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There are mechanical factors, which relate to Omnibus II and the time it takes for parliament to adopt those directives in sequence, I think that's the primary reason; the second one being the preparedness of the supervisors. I would add one point to what Henri said on the question of concentration and all that, what we've seen, for example, in France is that the &#x2013; it leads to a concentration in the mutual sector. This concentration will not affect the stock companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The positive aspect is that if this leads to concentration in the mutual sector you can expect that they are not going to fight against each other on pricing and that we are not going to be collateral victims of price wars.</p>

          <p>The bodily injury referrals that you've abolished making, I wonder, what would the chart &#x2013; it follows up on <mark type="ph" /> Andrew's (01:02:31) point about claims inflation, this has obviously been a huge issue in the UK. What is your thinking about the likely developments do you think the industry will follow? Do you think your action is going to have a significant impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So will the industry follow? I think the answer at the moment is no. It seems that competitors are waiting for government to enforce a ban on referral fees rather than take voluntary action. And, perhaps, look upon their own consciences as to whether this a good thing or a bad thing, not just for the business, but for the consumer because, clearly, rates have increased as a consequence of promoting bodily injury claims through referral fees.</p>
          <p>I think there are clear signs that government is minded to ban referral fees. I think we're hearing that from <mark type="ph" /> King Clark's (01:03:33) department. And what we've said today is, okay, that's all well and good, but unless the super profits are taken out of the personal injury law fixed fee structures, which enable &#xA3;800 to be paid, give or take, for referral fee, then the market will find other means of generating the same profits from the same dysfunction in the market.</p>
          <p>I think that, that reform is likely, but I don't know when it will come. I think a ban on referral fees will come and will come quite quickly. I hope that the change to the personal injury fixed fee structure will come soon after that. Without it, most premiums in the UK can't fall and bodily injury will only continue to rise.</p>
