          <p>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Q4 and Full Year Results of Merck KGaA. We welcome the analysts and investors here in the forum and we're happy that you made it here despite some airlines strike. We also welcome all the investors and analysts that follow us via the webcast. So I wish you a steady line and stay with us. In front of you, you see the Annual Report, the Investor Relations release we send out and the presentation chart, including extensive data sheets. Some of the product data we can send you after the analyst call. New in this presentation is an extensive appendix that gives you some additional information and background on our products, especially in the pipeline. You find all the information as well on the Internet and can download this from there. In particular, I want you to have a look at our disclaimer and our forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Today the General Partners and Members of the Executive Board are present. Let me briefly introduce Dr. Karl-Ludwig Kley, Chairman of the Executive Board; Dr. Michael Becker, Chief Financial Officer; Elmar Schnee, Head of Pharmaceuticals, and Dr. Bernd Reckmann, Head of Chemicals. They will give you an overview of the business followed by a question-and-answer session. Afterwards, we serve German cookies and cake and hope you stay with us for a while.</p>
          <p>Yes, Dr. Kley, if you may want to start.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everybody with new microphones. I wish you good luck in handling them, it's not easy. I should mention because Michael Becker keeps kicking us on the free cash flow, we did not invest, we just leased them; so savings all over. My introduction will be relatively short as I presume most of your questions will relate to numbers on which Michael Becker will excel in explaining you. On the pipeline, pharma pipeline, which Elmar Schnee will handle, and on the beautiful bright future of Liquid Crystals, which Bernd Reckmann will explain to you.</p>
          <p>What is left for me? To tell you that the year is behind us, which was quite difficult because we had to manage the crisis, at the same time pursue and follow our strategy. So we were always feeling these two things at the same time, and as I memorize the year and look back, I'm quite satisfied with the outcome, revenues returned to growth. Of course the operating results on a full year basis lags still behind, but this is no wonder in a year when liquid crystal and pigments were hit very hard in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>So putting things together, I'm satisfied &#x2013; we are satisfied, we think we have a good basis for the next year. On a regional basis, the growth, which we have in the American markets is substantial, growth well above 10%. Asia, if you take into account that Liquid Crystals was minus 17 over the full year, the growth shows you how the other businesses performed in this part of the world.</p>
          <p>What remains then as a critical part was because Europe with effects in chemicals, pigments, for example, the automotive industry to some effects, the pharmaceuticals side like the withdrawal of Raptiva or the sale of some of our cardiovascular franchise to Daiichi.</p>
          <p>The divisional growth, you have seen the numbers this morning. So I will not go into detail. I should just mention because probably it will not clear major rule that the decrease of 21% in Consumer Healthcare, in fact is putting it on the normal basis, last year they had special effects for this, in fact it is not a decrease, but just a normalization, which we're seeing there in the result.</p>
          <p>For the two chemical divisions, the recovery has been substantial over the last quarter and I'm confident as we go forward. And to know that our confidence is part of your disclaimer that may be as a statement one can say that. In the pharmaceutical business, Elmar Schnee will elaborate a little bit on the developmental results.</p>
          <p>Forecast, we hit five out of six, that's probably in Vancouve but bring us a gold medal. Here I don't know. One exception which is the Merck Sereno ROS guidance, which has to do with one-offs, which we explained in the course of the discussion.</p>
          <p>The other half of the part of the yearly spend on working on our strategy, chart number eight gives you an overview and the progress in detail. For time reasons, I will not go through it in detail right now, but will be happy to answer any questions you might have as we go on.</p>
          <p>Focus as we go forward, continuing on the ongoing commitment to R&amp;D. We strongly believe that our future is in R&amp;D, be it in Pharmaceuticals, be it in Chemicals, so we will continue to invest in that segment.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to pass on immediately to the number crunching and wish you a good and enjoyable time now with Michael Becker. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good afternoon. The number crunching will start with one &#x2013; how can I get this back? Okay. Thank you. So the number crunching will start with the fourth quarter. As usual, we'll have a look first at the figures up to operating result where cost analysis plays a major role and then go to the profit after tax. The operating result, I will analyze twice, once for the last quarter and once for the full year and there will be some inevitable repetition in that, but I think &#x2013; I hope it's been...</p>
          <p>So we are back to growth in the fourth quarter with 6% and we are also back to quality growth and as such as our steady cost lines are growing slower than the top line. You see that quite easily in the gross margin, where we have more or less the same pace. The gross margin is back to normal level of around 74%.</p>
          <p>When it comes to SG&amp;A, the picture looks slightly different because we have an 18% increase, but it is due to our unusually high level of one-off charges to the other operating expenses to general. The marketing and selling costs really are stable and the administration costs even are down 16%, which is probably very impressive, but that compares to a relatively high level of administration costs in the last quarter of 2008. So the 18% increase is exclusively due to the one-off that we have in other operating expenses and they relate to Greece. Greece, where hospitals, since a long time, in fact for three years don't pay hospital invoices. We still believe that one fine day payment will be forthcoming, but we do not think that that will be happening without an additional retrospective rebate that these hospitals will force on us and we have set aside an allowance for this rebate that we envisage.</p>
          <p>The other provision relates to Venezuela. We started to provide for the expected currency losses related to our Venezuelan business, which are combined of liabilities trade of the Venezuelan affiliate and receivables relating to a dividend payment out of Venezuela. The bulk of this happened in the third quarter, but there was an additional charge to this item in the fourth quarter as we had until the third quarter, provided for 50% devaluation, we now have provided for the free market rate, which is about a 60% devaluation.</p>
          <p>Research and development is going down in the fourth quarter and this also has a basis effect. As an explanation, research and development has sought in the first quarter of 2008. That didn't happen this year. But as you will see, over a year, there is a strong increase in research and development costs at Merck Serono, of course.</p>
          <p>The amortization of intangibles also grew considerably by 42%, which is very unusual, because this is a steady line, because it's a linear depreciation of the purchase price allocation, which happened in 2007 and we have increased intangibles due to impairments at Merck Serono of 72 million, which relate to Puregon and Embrel, the products that are at the source of our royalty income. We have had an estimation of future royalty streams and we had to decrease our previous valuation and the result, we have charged to the amortization of intangibles. So that it is easy to calculate our core operating result, which is operating result plus amortization of intangibles.</p>
          <p>This brings us to a 69% decrease in operating result, which is disappointing of course, but there we are with the one-offs. Core operating result only down by 16% because the amortization &#x2013; especially amortization of intangibles doesn't go in to the core operating result.</p>
          <p>By the way, the first item of intangible &#x2013; group of intangibles that we have created after the acquisition of Serono is now out of the balance sheet and that is the name Serono, which we depreciated in three years.</p>
          <p>This is now the operating result for the full year and a lower growth number because it is affected by the first quarter downturn of Liquid Crystals as well as the trough that we saw &#x2013; the longer trough that we saw in Pigments. Under these circumstances, it is of course very difficult to create a quality growth, where costs grow slower than a declining business. So we have a gross margin of only plus 0.6%. So &#x2013; but considering what we saw price pressure in Liquid Crystal, enormous price pressure in Liquid Crystals and idle capacity in Liquid Crystals and Pigments and still a slightly growth in gross margin, I think it held up well considering.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A also &#x2013; this picture although not as drastic as in the fourth quarter alone. We have a steep increase, but also here the other operating expenses, the one-offs bring the number up quite considerably. If we break it down, then we still have marketing and selling, a year-on-year increase of 6.8%, but it is pushed up by commissions expenses at Merck Serono, where we have two partnerships, one with Pfizer, relating to Rebif, where we have a profit share that is reflected in this commissions and the other with &#x2013; include BMS, Lilly in Japan for Erbitux, which are now pretty big amounts. The commission payment in the total year amount to 92 million and the total selling costs are 144. So marketing and selling is not double, not even double the amount that we pay on these commissions.</p>
          <p>The administration costs also year-on-year went down by 5%, very pleasing, while other operating expenses, of course no comparison, it can be expressed in percentage, went up from 170 million to 373 and the amounts here are slightly different from the quarter, so not everything was entered in the last quarter. We have Greece with 13 compared to 11, here is the full Venezuelan hit of 68 million, litigation expense of 167, and asset impairments of 38.</p>
          <p>The intangibles is same amount as in the quarter. So that brings us to a decline in the operating result as mentioned before 43%, core operating result only 28.</p>
          <p>Next slide is the profit after tax for the full year starting with the operating result and then going down to profit after tax and you can see that we have a substantial difference in the exceptionals that went into last year of 400 million, this year only 28, which was 40 million for Raptiva and 11 million profit out of the sale of our natural products business in Brazil.</p>
          <p>We had already built a provision for the &#x2013; for Raptiva exit of 70 million in the first quarter as is normal for our Company, a generous provision, and we could dissolve 30 million of it, because the withdrawal went a lot better than we had feared.</p>
          <p>That brings us to the EBIT, where the difference is therefore very small, it's only minus 15%. The financial result is better because we have lower debt and lower interest rates, and we have no currency losses in that line.</p>
          <p>The tax rate is very pleasing with 21.6%, the lowest ever at Merck. This was a sort of mirror picture from what happened in 2008, where 25.8 was a relatively high tax rate. You may remember that we said at the end of last year that a prognosis for the coming year was not possible and at the same time of course we had to reflect this in our deferred taxes and our capitalized tax losses. So the deferred taxes were released by 50 million that brought the tax rate to 26%. This has been used, so the losses have been used and at the end of the year because we have a guidance now for the next year, we put the remainder of the deferred taxes back again and that led to this very low tax rate.</p>
          <p>The net income, therefore, is nearly the same as last year. And I think, if we compare the operating result and net income last year and this year, that also explains the dividend, which has been down which we have reduced by 33%. Last year, we had a very disappointing like this year, a very disappointing profit after tax per our standards, but we saw that was down to astronomic exceptions of 400 million. The profitability of the business was fine with 1.1 billion operating result and therefore we thought that the poor profit after tax, which was a measure &#x2013; to good extent, a measure to strength in our balance sheet shouldn't be reflected in the dividend. This year, however, the downturn is the tax rate, the profit after tax is also reflected in the operating result. And we thought that was a good reason to reduce the dividend.</p>
          <p>The key cash flow data shows that some of our measures are without cash effect, therefore the free cash flow is fine and it also shows a good asset management, especially working capital and there the inventory. You see that the working capital was a cash provider this year with 25 million following a 304 million cash consumption in the previous year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures slightly up because of our investment in the biomanufacturing in <mark type="inaudible" />, Switzerland. And you can see under others, the favorable change under others of more than 300 million difference &#x2013; 331 million difference, and this is reflecting that we have in this others now a pretty high amount of non-cash items that, for example, Venezuela and our litigation provisions.</p>
          <p>Another word to Venezuela, we will start this year to translate Venezuela at the free exchange rate in Venezuela. Last year, we had just made a provision for currency losses, everything has remained the same. This year, we will translate every item of the P&amp;L and of the balance sheet at the free market exchange rate. So if 100 of sales, was 100 last year that would be 40 this year because the devaluation effect out of translation is 60%.</p>
          <p>The main item in the balance sheet, there are two items I would like to mention. The first is that we see here the effect of the 750 million-bond issuance plus 230 million private placements. You see that in cash and other liquid funds and in financial debt the difference. And you can see that we use 210 million to underpin our pension provisions as anticipated with cash. This is again a measure to strengthen our balance sheet. We take it that therefore the balance sheet is a bit longer, but the equity ratio of nearly 60% is still extremely good.</p>
          <p>That brings me already to the outlook for the full year. Merck Serono is expected to grow two to five percent. Remember, Venezuela is a very important business class, so you can really see it here. Consumer Health Care, five to 10, so a good growth rate for that business. Liquid Crystals, also five to 10% and you see here the reflection of anticipated more price pressure in that business. Performance and Life Science, three to eight, which is a normal growth rate for that business, and the Group, three to seven percent</p>
          <p>The operating result should grow by 34 to 40% at Merck Serono in the absence of the one-offs that were depleting the result this year, core where the effect was not will only grow zero to 10%. Consumer Healthcare will go down in operating result in line with our strategy to invest in core brands and I will probably have more detail to that. Liquid Crystals with the recovery and full swing 15 to 25% increase in operating result and the same goes Performance and Life Science Chemicals, 15 to 20%. That means the Group would grow by 20 to 30%, operating result in three to 13% core operating result.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll pass on to Elmar.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Michael. Good afternoon here in Darmstadt, good afternoon around the screens. The pharmaceutical sector continued with growth despite headwinds from several areas. We have the economic crisis, we have healthcare reforms, we have strict reimbursement regulations as well as of course generate competition in our cardiometabolic care business. Nevertheless, Merck Serono's revenue increased by 6.6% year-on-year despite the loss of Raptiva, if you remember we had to take off the market unfortunately beginning of 2009.</p>
          <p>The CHC is small, but a very nice business and it gives me pleasure to notice that we are the second-fastest OTC business in growth terms, in percentage growth terms around the globe.</p>
          <p>Now, let's come to Merck Serono. As you can see, the sales growth has been 5.9%, which is the important one. If you take the organic growth we had seen 7.2%, which is slightly more than the pharmaceutical market is growing worldwide.</p>
          <p>We have seen planned commission and royalty income decrease because we see now patents going off country-by-country and this will go on for the next five to seven years. We have seen that R&amp;D expense continues to increase in line with our strategy and they are currently roughly around 22%. And remember, we guided you midyear that we do this because we would like to exploit fully our pipeline.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned by Michael, we have higher royalty and commission expenses based on the two agreements, which we have one in Japan for Erbitux and one with Pfizer in the USA. And unfortunately for the outgoing commissions we have fantastic growth in the two relationships, but of course overall that's a very good news for our Company those who follow our partner.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow has been improved, markedly improved and very satisfactory. We tried hard to control our working capital management. We started by inventories <mark type="inaudible" /> where we can and we heard that there are some difficulties in some of the areas.</p>
          <p>Now let's see what we can do with therapeutic areas. Nearly all, except actually one are double digit growing in the quarter, which I think is a very satisfactory result. If you look on the four top selling biopharmaceutical products they make up 60% of our sales. This sales increase is driven by strong lifecycle management and they are mainly device driven because, Raptiva, Saizen, Gonal-f many of our products using devices for easy application of the patients. And, of course, Erbitux is driven still by our penetration into the first line treatment of colorectal cancer and also head and neck.</p>
          <p>On top of this, we started to have a new launch with Kuvan in HPA which penetrates, or starts to penetrate the market and it's a very focused arena through specialists treating these patients, in this case mainly children.</p>
          <p>If you look on the geographies, we had a very solid performance in what we call the emerging markets and these are the emerging markets in Latin America and Asia where we see double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>If you go now on to Rebif, we see that even in Europe where actually we see price decline in the business. We have been growing 5%, which is everything volume, and if you would maybe make the calculation, I think the volume will be slightly higher because we have seen some price decreases.</p>
          <p>Erbitux, I mentioned, a solid 31% performance and we make true what we said after we had the currency issue that we retained quarter-on-quarter growth and here the fourth quarter was no exception.</p>
          <p>If you look on Gonal-f, a continuous strong growth supported by the launch of new devices as well as the penetration of the newly introduced product, which is Pergoveris. Glucophage is driven by good performance in the emerging markets. And unfortunately Concor is driven down by the last patent expiries which we have in France and some other European countries.</p>
          <p>If you go on to Saizen, which is also supported by our device strategy, and Kuvan, as already mentioned, we had the pleasure roll out several markets.</p>
          <p>Now let's come to more details about our neurodegenerative diseases business. Let me remind you that Merck Serono is one of the clear leaders in the Multiple Sclerosis space. Outside the U.S. in our MS, we are the market leader with our product Rebif. The market leadership benefits clearly from the risk-benefit ratio and eight years experience and a wealth of data, which we can offer to the physicians and to the patients.</p>
          <p>As you know, in MS, today there are three measures, which are looked after in the efficacy of a drug. The first one is the MRI signs, the second one, a relapses, and the third one is no progression of disability, and Rebif is performing strongly in all those key measures.</p>
          <p>This wealth of data is coupled with lifecycle management and we're currently introducing a RebiSmart, which is a similar device as we use in the growth hormones, which allows the patients to inject the drug at places where they could not get to use the pen, for example on the back, I think it does not work all right &#x2013; on the beck and it's also possible to control the compliance, which is very important for the treatment.</p>
          <p>Let's come to Cladribine. We informed you that we will have a meeting and we had a meeting with FDA end of January. And we are fully committed to bring Cladribine in the U.S. fast &#x2013; as fast as you can beck and file with the FDA. It is one of the highest priority, which our company has because I'm very convinced that Cladribine is a great addition to the patients, a great addition to the healthcare providers. And therefore we are confident that this will be the case.</p>
          <p>Regarding Atacicept, unfortunately we had to stop two programs, one of them is in Multiple Sclerosis, where we saw a increased disease activity in the group using Atacicept and we discontinued based on the advice from the Safety Monitoring Board. And the second program, which we will not progress is the RA program where we have seen some activity of Atacicept, but the clinical effect has not been at a level that makes us comfortable to go forward and we'll have a competitive product. Therefore we stopped this development.</p>
          <p>Let's now come to oncology. This &#x2013; oncology of course we had some bad news. We lost the appeal and the irony is that, on the very same day when we lost the appeal in Europe, ASCO put the Erbitux in their treatment guidelines for non-small lung cancer. Since then the other big U.S. Association the NCCN put Erbitux also in the guidelines. And roughly two or three weeks ago, the Italian Cancer Society put Erbitux into the guidelines for lung.</p>
          <p>Now you can quite imagine that we are surprised as you are why we did not succeed in getting approval, as we have a clear positive trial. We are currently thinking what we can do because we are committed to the patients, and I'm very clear that there are patients out there, which would like to use Erbitux, and for some of them, it could be the only drug which we could use. So we have to evaluate how we can go forward in this arena.</p>
          <p>In our clinical development pipeline, of course we have Stimuvax, we have Cilengitide, which goes through Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. And we moved also a new drug the IMO-2055 into clinical development into Phase II and we made some good progress. We still got it in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Now here is the total pipeline. I'm convinced that we have a rich, attractive, highly innovative pipeline because most of the products in this pipeline are new mode of actions. If I would like to highlight some, it's roughly the Phase III development with Rebif because we await the results in this year from the clinical early syndrome, which would enlarge the indication for Rebif, allowing us to penetrate further into the market. Erbitux is still ongoing in gastric cancer and just before I came here I got the news that Avastin failed in this indication, therefore, hopefully being positive is Erbitux would be highly attractive for physicians, to the patients.</p>
          <p>And Stimuvax as you know we have in non-small cell lung cancer and in breast and we launched also some additional programs based on the flex experience that we had there for supporting data to increase the chances that we will also get approval should we have a positive trial. If you look on to Phase II, we have further indication with Cilengitide, which is an integrin inhibitor.</p>
          <p>And if we go as Phase I, I would like to mention the FGF18, which we're quite excited about which is an recombinant human fibroblast growth factor. And what it did so far certainly in animals because we are now in phase I, it has the capability of repair a cartilage tissue and many of you look pretty sporty and after arthritis sport injuries has a lot to do with cartilage injury and so far we cannot re-grow cartilage after a certain age, which starts at 25. So if this would do what it does in animal models in human beings, then I think it would be a extremely attractive drug.</p>
          <p>I would also like to reiterate our commitment to R&amp;D. On the occasion of the merger into Merck Serono, we said that we would like to spend 20% of our revenues into R&amp;D and of course this number will grow as we grow our top line.</p>
          <p>This year, we decided based on the opportunity of our portfolio that the increase is from 20 to 22%, and I also think that in this year, we will be at the similar number. Over the long term, it will increase, we will hopefully go back to 20% and then increase as we can increase our top line. We have to exploit the potential of our pipeline, that's important to us because it's our future, and I believe also for the future in the innovative pharmaceutical arena, R&amp;D spend is essential to be successful for a company.</p>
          <p>Now what are the catalysts over the next 12 months? I mentioned already REFLEX, which is important news for Rebif, which could open up a new pool of patients. We have the cladribine tablets, as I've said, fully commitment, high priority and we're absolutely convinced that we get to expect on track in the U.S. and in Europe, we are on track. So we do expect a opinion from the CHMP in the third quarter this year.</p>
          <p>If we go back to Japan, with the PDMA decision, we see that we have there the possibility to launch Erbitux into first line colorectal cancer in Japan. And we see that in Japan, we have a big market for this and this of course would enhance again the possibility of growth for Erbitux.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have Tesamorelin which is an in-licensed product for AIDS treatment for the effective addition which AIDS patients do get around the stomach in the USA. Despite that the FDA cancelled the advisory board, it was based on a administrative and I think causes snowfall activities in the Washington, DC arena that PDUFA date remains for end of March and we expect to get and action next letter from the FDA for this product.</p>
          <p>Let's come now to Consumer Health Care and you can see that we have the highest growth of any quarters since I believe we have this business with 20% growth. We continue to focus in our seven power brands, which we're doing since two years and we are successful, coupled this with regional expansion and our results getting further into the new emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Higher marketing cost and higher R&amp;D costs are planned. We have a clear three year strategy and this is the last three &#x2013; last year of the three, and by definition therefore we have a lower operating results based on this strategy.</p>
          <p>If you look into the brands, we can see that we have a good growth in our strategic brands and I don't have to go down there. You see the percentage increases, which are very encouraging with the exception of Nasivin. And we had in Russia, our biggest market for Nasivin, and unfortunately Russia got hit severely by the crisis and there we see a clear impact from the crisis. Therefore, Nasivin is minus 16%.</p>
          <p>In the Others, we reflect the Belgium acquisition of Bio-Fyt, which we did earlier in 2009, and we have also quite some successes Cape June, which is actually a product or products, which can be buy in the queue we see buying channel, which is going extremely well and we are very happy to have this business in there.</p>
          <p>With this, thank you very much, and I hand it over to Bernd Reckmann, for the chemical part.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Elmar. And good afternoon in Darmstadt and who are on the screen. The recovery of Chemicals continued in Q4 showing a chemical business increasing by 9% to &#x20AC;504 million Liquid Crystals again could exceed the &#x20AC;200 million per quarter revenue supported by the success of the superior polymer stabilized vertical alignment technology or short, PS-VA, which offers less energy consumption, better price are and reduce the manufacturing cost to TV makers.</p>
          <p>Based on our innovation and our reliability, Merck is clearly the preferred partner for innovative solutions in the display industry. This strengthens our position as technology leader and will help to defend our market leadership. In the PC business, Merck could surpass &#x20AC;300 million per quarter seeing a further recovery of the Pigment business as well as a stable business with our broad range of specialties in regulated markets like food and beverage, pharma and biotech, and the laboratory.</p>
          <p>Coming to Liquid Crystals, Q4 was strong for the display industry; Merck could increase its total revenue organically by 24%. With the increased volumes, we had no cause for under-utilization during the quarter, but unit prices were significantly below last year's quarter resulting in a decrease of the gross margin percentage wise.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D stayed basically on the same level than in the previous quarter, there was some slight phasing issue over the year. We increased research by 3%, reflecting our high efforts to fight price pressure at our customers by additional added value by innovation.</p>
          <p>With &#x20AC;91 million operated results and the 45% return on sales, Merck delivered exactly according to our guidance at the end of quarter three. So free cash flow improved significantly in line with the increased operating results.</p>
          <p>Here you see again the roller coaster of 2009 on a quarterly basis. Recovery after a dip started already in Q2, mainly driven from Taiwan at this time, later followed by the industries in Korea and Japan. But if we mark it along this picture, if you look at the worst quarter, which was Q1 then Merck could deliver a return on sales of 10% still an attractive profitability for Chemical business especially at the bottom of a crisis.</p>
          <p>So total volume over 2009 developed slightly below 2008, however, we had especially in the first half of the year under utilization of capacities and prices, additional costs, diluting our gross margin.</p>
          <p>During the crisis, we also observed a significant drop in display prices in the industry resulting in strong price pressure for our liquid crystal materials going in parallel with aggressive price competition. In this market situation of decreasing volumes, Merck stayed restrictive on prices, we saved our margins and focused even more on value adding innovations like PS-VA. As a consequence, we saw a decrease in market share coming from just about 60, but we are still the undoubted market leader with a market share above 50%.</p>
          <p>PS-VA, the success story of 2009 offers so far unreached performance for TVs with respect to brightness, natural colors, and energy consumption. Major key accounts have switched or are switching to this new technology. It over time may replace classical VA materials. As Merck is the only liquid crystal maker that offers PS-VA, PS-VA will continue its success story in 2010. Combined with a reasonable product flexibility we will defend or even increase our market share in 2010.</p>
          <p>And you see here that the market continues to grow with some compound annual growth rate assumed by 13%, which will translate into 2010 growth around 15%. So it stays very, very attractive market driven by the growth mainly of the TV application. And LCD TVs are the clear winner. Plasma has only a niche position. According to Display Research, more than 75% of newly sold TVs are LCD TVs.</p>
          <p>The area of our LCD displays and that is what you see here on the slides is predicted to grow by 13%. Unfortunately this does not translate directly into the amount of needed LC materials as our customers continuously improve their efficiency and resulting in a situation that they require less and less amount to manufacture the display of a given size. And this single-digit reduction and the ongoing price pressure in the market will reduce the material growth for Merck in the LC business to five to 10% in 2010.</p>
          <p>We are investing around 87 million for R&amp;D in 2009 and this will secure that we stay as technology leader in the market. About half of this investment is directed towards LC materials like PS-VA and succeeding technologies as well as other new display modes. The let latest trend in the consumer TV market is the so-called shutter glasses based three dimensional applications. Three-dimensional displays need innovative LC materials with very fast switching times. Merck is offering a broad portfolio of mixtures suitable for 3D.Although the shutter glasses themselves contains however very, very small amounts of liquid crystals. And besides the liquid crystal materials, you can see here other areas of innovative technologies and adjacent fields in advanced materials where we spend our R&amp;D money.</p>
          <p>Switching to Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals, it's a broad entirely diversified specialty chemical business. Total revenues grew by 1.3% organically, even by 2.4% driven by the further recovery of Pigment sales into cosmetics and automotive industry. The LB and LSS business to the different industries overall stayed stable in quarter four.</p>
          <p>Gross margin was slightly below last year's quarter because of some inventory adjustments and therefore the operating result was also slightly on the level of previous years' quarter with &#x20AC;33.6 million and 11% return on sales. Last year, we had some exceptionals reducing EBIT compared to this quarter and in line with improved EBIT, although the cash flow has significantly improved in the PC business. If you have a final look on the regional distribution, you'll see that our strategy to grow dynamically in Asia comes true. We have seen 14% growth in the Asian market mainly in Indonesia, China, and India.</p>
          <p>We continued to strengthen our position in these areas by the recent acquisition of Bangalore Genei, a bioscience company in India combined with our business makes us now to one of the top two players in the Indian market, as well as with the acquisition in Q3 of a Pigment business in China. Whereas Europe was more or less on the level of previous year, North America was heavily impacted by currencies as well as partially Latin America.</p>
          <p>That's for Chemicals and I'll give back to Michael. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Vincent Meunier from Exane BNP Paribas. Three questions please. The first one is on your dividend policy. In absolute terms, you have decided to cut by 50% your dividend payment this year and I just want to understand why this kind of cuts because looking at the free cash flow, the growth is quite impressive. So there is no need for you really to cut the dividend? And how to predict the future?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Cladribine. Can you please give us more details with regards to your ongoing discussions with the FDA? Do you expect it is likely for you to re-file in 2010? In other words, is it just an administrative issue, or do you have to conduct a new trial?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on the pharma margins. You already said that the R&amp;D budget will be about 20% in the future, so that's not really new. Therefore looking at your guidance for 2010, we understand that the SG&amp;A line is probably the one which will be hit the more, and that due to pre-marketing for cladribine in the U.S. and if it's the case, can you give us some amounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take it in sequence. We start with the dividend. The first case, the dividend was 1.50, and it's now one euro that is not, repeat, not a decline by 50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was talking about the absolute payment in million euros.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why should the absolute payment in euros be less than the dividend per share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the annual report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think that this is the right way to look at it. So the dividend policy is 30 to 40% of the Group profit after tax over longer average of the years. Now, if you consider that we need about 220 million for one euro dividend, then we are out of this range. So we are exceeding the range we have. So what is the difference between last year and this year considering that the profit after taxes to sale. That is down to the longer year average. Last year, we had a very good operating result, it was brought down by 400 million exceptions. Actually we thought that the strength we represented in the operating result during already difficult times justify an increased dividend from 1.20 to 1.50. And that was because the underlying strength that we saw at the time justified that increase because the policy over the longer-term average is that to eliminate these extra and exceptional influences of the exceptional item.</p>
          <p>Now this year you see that the operating result has dropped 40%. No exceptions to justify we will eliminate that for calculation. We still didn't drop as much to go 30 to 40% within that year, but if you take our longer term average we are in that corridor and that's how we came to &#x20AC;1 per share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start on the cladribine in the USA. As is the policy of Merck's we all know, we do not entertain any information when we talk with healthcare regulators. We had a successful meeting with them and we work now diligently and believe me, the pressure, which I put on the organization is sufficient to move us forward. So we don't need the outside pressure. So my people work at the highest priority to get this back on track. Not only for us, but also for the patients, which are waiting.</p>
          <p>Regarding the margin for 2010, of course we have clearly tied the pre-marketing cost of Cladribine both in the USA as well as in Europe to milestones which make us more comfortable as going forward that will have the drag on the market. So, yes, we have some investments in cladribine launch.</p>
          <p>Secondly, when they did not materialize the lung indication, I reported already in the last quarter that we maintain some of the people, and some of the costs which you could not get fast out of the system, which will be used for Cladribine. So we have a peak, which is made not the most efficient for quarter or two, but it makes sense, because you cannot train the people.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, I did mention that we have a good growth in the areas where we work with partners, meaning Rebif in the USA, when it was 28% in the last quarter as well as Erbitux in Japan. From a profitability point of view, unfortunately that's not the most profitable for us, because we share the proceeds with the partner.</p>
          <p>And, last but not least, of course we have heard everything about Venezuela which takes off quite some growth and some return out of Venezuela based on the exchange rate, which we do use and there might be if <mark type="inaudible" />, which is the body which decides to pay the bills in dollars in Venezuela is nice to us, there might be a good upside.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope this answers this...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a moment. Can I come to the cut of the dividend in half. The cut of the dividend in half in the annual report is the dividend paid in that year. In 2009, we paid a dividend for 2008, and 2008 dividend was 1.50, the 2007 dividend, which was paid in 2008 was 3.20, that's the half. We cut the dividend in half last year, not this year. So we paid in 2009 the dividend for 2008 that was half the dividend of 2007 that was paid in 2009. So it's nothing to do with this year's dividend. Understand? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hope this answers your question. If you may switch off your microphone, thanks. Now we keep on with Ms. Miemietz from SG who has recently started coverage. So let's hear what she has to ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually a few financial questions and a few product questions please. In terms of the financial questions, can you give us an indication as to when you might see R&amp;D spend and SG&amp;A spend trending down against the percentage of sales because I think the impression that very much spend that it would be very high 2009, 2010, but potentially trending down 2011, should we move that further into the future?</p>
          <p>I also have a question on the sales reps you have because I believe that you wanted to move Raptiva reps on to cladribine. You are also moving the Erbitux lung cancer reps on to cladribine and potentially Pfizer might co-promote cladribine. So, therefore, I was wondering whether there is any potential to actually reduce the number of sales representatives?</p>
          <p>And my final financial question relates to the way that you actually determine the profit transfer to e-E.Merck. So how does the reduction in the dividend actually &#x2013; how will that play out over the year 2010 in terms of the profit transfer to E.Merck and in terms of the change in liability to E.Merck. I mean, I'll quickly pause before I got to product questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay then thank you for the questions. R&amp;D indeed, it is 2009, 2010, the current expectation I think it will come down to our long-running rate of 20% though that depends how the portfolio develops, I mean, we look at this as a long-term investment and we exploit it at full. And I think if there are some good reasons to exploit it full then we take the decision as we have taken last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding Raptiva, actually we did move the Raptiva reps more into oncology because we waited for the lung launch, so we calculated about the same rate. So we don't have Raptiva reps who moved into oncology for the lung. We trained them unfortunately and kind of we moved them into cladribine and we did reduce reps. But in certain countries to reduce reps it takes you a lot of time and lot of costs and it's not efficient to fire some and then take them on again. So it's better for the employees of course to keep them employed and we use them now in training, some are still on Erbitux colorectal and head and neck, but we still have some overhang, because it's not the most efficient usage of our SG&amp;A currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The profit share with E. Merck, this refers to the holding company of the Merck KGaA Group. The profit of the Merck KGaA is distributed in a way that it is shared 70:30 roughly before taxes. So the profit before tax is 70% goes to E. Merck. And then we deduct the tax for the other 30% and then we either have only dividend or dividend and reserves and profit carryforward. And then the corresponding amount comes back from E. Merck into the balance sheet of the KGaA. That's how it works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Isn't there actually a concrete link between the amount of dividend and the profit share into E. Merck? Are they two separate? Because basically at 70% of pre-tax for E. Merck all the time whereas the dividend is determined year-over-year, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Can I just quickly ask my two product questions? I was just wondering, on Erbitux in gastric cancer, if you have any idea of timeline as to when and &#x2013; when we might get the EXPAND results, if that's going to a press release that's going to be this year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Stimuvax in lung cancer, I was just wondering if you can update us on the accrual status, the number of events that have accrued so far and your view as to when we might expect Phase III interim, the first phase III interim analysis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both trials are event driven. So as long as it takes, that's better for Merck Serono. The EXPAND trials roughly not this year, I think it will be more horizon 2011 to '12. and Stimuvax is the very same. So it's also the interim because both are progression-free survival and therefore we need, unfortunately the events of the patients. So not this year, that's for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't report this and I don't know it because the trials are blinded. So I have no idea how many events are in there or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I hope this answers your question. So we keep on with guys here on front. I would ask Merrill Lynch and then Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. A few question on similar topics. First on Serono margins, can you just clarify how would you think about various provision items for next year, meaning your guidance do you include further provisions for Greece? Could you give us some color on the underlying litigation charge? And are you seeing any further FX provisions for of Venezuela?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you therefore just help us how to think about underlying Merck Serono margins year-on-year, excluding those three items? Am I correct in my understanding of some expected decline on an underlying basis given an increase in SG&amp;A?</p>
          <p>Second question, back to the dividend, just wondered whether the lower dividend this year has in mind of keeping cash on balance sheet for potential acquisitions. I know you've been quoted in the press as talking about targeted acquisitions again.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just wanted to understand what has driven the provision for Enbrel and Puregon, what has changed there in your outlook for the royalty stream on those two products?</p>
          <p>And finally, on Liquid Crystals, can you just confirm whether market shares are stable now or still declining? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will comment on Greece, Venezuela and litigation. We have set aside last year the full amount of switching from the state exchange rate to the free market exchange. So that's behind us.</p>
          <p>As far as Greece is concerned, the attitude may change, that we think if in a year's time the country is even closer to an even worse situation, then we may change our provision policy. But there's nothing in the guidance included that predicts such a development. In the guidance included is, of course, the new method in Venezuela which is translating the business at the free market exchange rate sales-wise, and therefore also margin-wise. But there is a certain balance because the margins of Venezuela are now very small and there is a natural hedge between sales and cost. The costs are also only 40% of what they used to be. So there is a net rate but that doesn't go for the cost of sales &#x2013; the cost of goods, right?</p>
          <p>And I think that is &#x2013; what was it? Litigation. Litigation is something that comes a bit of a surprise. It's difficult to predict that somebody will sue you for a thing that you have done. If you would predict that, then you wouldn't do it, right? So I think there is no difference between our business with or without litigation. We don't anticipate more litigation to come, but there is one which is mentioned in the report, in our annual report. That is the Rebif which is a patent dispute, which is long-lasting and will last longer. The dispute is when the patent payments should stop. And if we lose that dispute, then we will have to pay more every year, and therefore we provide according to the sales. But that has been done in the past, that has been done this year, we've do and done this year. There is no effect on the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Market shares are stable, about 50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that leaves the dividends. The dividend cuts of 1.50 to &#x20AC;1 is about 100 million. And I can't imagine a situation on the acquisition side, just pure theory, where 100 million would do us any good in helping us to do it or do it better or pay more. So 100 million is not an amount that has an influence there.</p>
          <p>And just another thing, we &#x2013; dividend and free cash flow, there is a link. So there is a possibility that &#x2013; especially litigation provisions that we put aside this year, we'll need to pay in the next year. And of course, there is a link in our thinking of dividends between &#x2013; particularly in the free cash flow and having a dividend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just why you've put an additional provision and now what's changed in your thought process on outlook of that royalty stream?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a reflection of the purchase price allocation that we did when we acquired Merck Serono. We allocated value to the products that have the highest royalty stream. Now, it is very difficult to predict what our partners will sell. So what we're using is an average of analysts' estimation of the sale of these products. And these estimations have gone down. Accordingly the valuation of the asset has gone down and we've written it off. It's not a provision. It's a write-off of the value of the purchase price allocation that stems from the first consolidation of Serono.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>We don't guide long-term over a year out, but as I said three years ago in the strategy, I still believe that mid to long term, Merck Serono has the possibility to exceed and grow margins from the current levels. When? I'll leave this to you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Matthew Weston from Credit Suisse. A couple of simple numbers questions to start with and then one little bit more detailed. Just coming back to the first question, can you confirm whether or not you do need a new clinical study for Cladribine to satisfy the FDA? And by my reckoning, Pfizer should have given you its answer as to whether or not it wants to exercise its option to be your US partner for marketing by now. So can you let us know whether or not they will be partnering you or not?</p>
          <p>Regarding Venezuela, a lot of it's been discussed, but no one has actually said how big Venezuela was before the devaluation. Am I right that it's about &#x20AC;100 million of revenue prior to the devaluation?</p>
          <p>And then just in terms of a little bit more detail around this increasing commission level and the profitability of your US business. It seems that the rate of acceleration of commissions paid to partners is growing at a rate higher than the rate of your revenue, which suggests that one of your partners is on an escalating, ratcheting royalty upwards. Is that the case? Is Pfizer basically making more profit that's bigger than Rebif gets in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's just start on the back. The answer is no. There was an escalation but since years we're on the top right.</p>
          <p>But if you look on the growth of Rebif in the US, you see why the commission goes up. We had a 28% growth. In Europe, we have a 5% growth, so you can easily figure out that the commission goes faster than the global profitability of the franchise.</p>
          <p>Regarding Cladribine, I do not wish to make any statement about what is needed for Cladribine in the USA. The only thing what I would like to say is that I'm very convinced that the drug is needed by the patients. We are fully confident that the drug will go on the market in USA, and we work extremely hard, not to say day and night, to get this thing back on track.</p>
          <p>In Europe, this thing is on track, and it's the same information. So we expect a statement from the CHMP in the third quarter based on the very same study, on the very same data, on everything the same.</p>
          <p>Regarding Pfizer, I think I did answer this to start with. And Cladribine, we've answered. I think we're down to Venezuela.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Venezuela, my feel was that this country is, as a business, on its way to euro 200 million. And I see &#x2013; actually the &#x2013; it was 180 million in 2009. So in the plan, we lose about 140 million due to translation.</p>
          <p>It's not that we really lose it, right? You have inflation, which is near 30%, and no adjustment on the currency side whatsoever. You are sort of having hot air. So it's not &#x2013; it's a book loss. It's not a real loss.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Couple of Liquid Crystal questions first of all, please. When do you forecast competition for the PSVA from your competitors, because that seems to be one of the keys to increasing potentially your market share?</p>
          <p>The second question on Liquid Crystals, how should we think of the translation from panel growth to liquid crystal growth? Your shipments, I suppose, beyond 2010. You sort of came back to the 5 to 10% to 20%. How should we think of that going forward?</p>
          <p>A quick follow-up on Cladribine, if possible. I noticed that in your timeline charts for the FY 2010 for the Health Care, for Merck Serono that Cladribine in the US is excluded. Is that from Merck conservatism, or is that sort of a real timeline that we can use?</p>
          <p>And then finally on just some Erbitux-related questions, just wondering what sort of penetration levels we're at for the KRAS wild type in first-line colorectal cancer, and how the product is going in Japan as well? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's no surprise that we don't have a clear indication what our competitors are doing. But as mentioned, PSVA, for the time being, we have patent protection, which will of course continue, and we are the only supplier in the market. We have learned in the VA that, of course, our competitors will look for ways to get around the patents.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we have an advantage, but we're not blue eyed to say this will last forever. So I would expect that we have, the next years, no real strong competition on the PSVA.</p>
          <p>Growth of Liquid Crystals after 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just really how we can go from sort of the display panel growth. So if we can forecast that, how do we translate that back down to your sort of -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think that will not change in 2010 and after. So there was an assumption or prediction of area of growth. And normally, the area of growth could translate directly into material growth of Liquid Crystals.</p>
          <p>That is not completely the case, because we always have a single-digit efficiency improvement in the manufacturing processes of our customer. And for the foreseeable future, this will continue.</p>
          <p>And the rest of the other factors influencing them, of course, depend on the market situation, price pressure, currency impact, changes in market share. But I think you should keep in mind that there is always a subtraction in the growth rate if you go from an area figure to a real material business in cable set-tops.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually our disclosure is much better than I thought. In the annual report, Kuvan is reported as &#x20AC;5.6 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding Erbitux, the penetration rates are not available from any survey or market research information. So therefore, I cannot provide them to you. What I do expect is that we are just at the start of the penetration of the first line colorectal as well as the first line head and neck.</p>
          <p>So there is quite some potential left based on the good data, which we have. And also the fact that I said that at least that Erbitux in Europe, also without lung, has the potential to be a blockbuster before we see some biosimilars entering the market.</p>
          <p>To Japan, we are not guiding by country. But since I want to be nice, I can tell you that my colleague, Karl-Ludwig Kley, said that we quadrupled the turnover in Japan last year, and it was one of the most successful launches of Erbitux in any country.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Cornelia Thomas from WestLB here. Firstly, I've got one question. I'm wondering, on the pricing pressure you are seeing in the Liquid Crystals segment, because if I follow the price development for LCDs on the sort of common market research firms, that looks as if it has stabilized, as if it is not increasing, even.</p>
          <p>So what's going on on the Liquid Crystal side of this? Why is there still price pressure that we're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the display prices, as you may know, have significantly dropped in the first half of 2009. After this, over the last six months, it is more or less stable.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the price pressure on the material suppliers continue because there's always a lag when you adjust prices, because what we also told you several times, we said there's not an immediate switch from a liquid crystal mixture to the next one. So it happens only if there was a new product from our customer.</p>
          <p>So in the new TV, it's a decision point where you switch or switch not to a new liquid crystal mixture. And of course, in preparing this, there will be continued price pressure.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that we don't see that this &#x2013; we don't expect that this level will stay forever. There are a lot of discussions in the industry on investments in China, which would mean additional capacities. So we anticipate that this strong price pressure will continue also in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So are there any more questions? Yes, here in the back.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sy Opterra with Quint. Two simple questions. First is a follow-up to your answer of the very first question concerning the dividend. If you're saying you're paying out 20 to 30% of the adjusted net over a longer range of time, would you please give us a concrete number of years you are building the average with, because giving in guidance without giving a concrete calculation basic is not very useful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the moment, we are calculating the average since 1994, 5 when we went public.</p>
          <p>But we are aware that this corridor is now very inflexible because of the long average, and we're thinking of a different period. We haven't made our decision yet, because don't forget that in 2007 we had this huge profit off the generic sale. And it also sort of destroys our average on the shorter term.</p>
          <p>So it's a bit of difficult thing. But we have a corridor, and we try to stay in that corridor. And at the moment, in the last five years, we have stayed in that corridor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And very easy question to Mr. Launer. When do you think you're going to improve the communication between the investors and the company, instead of leaving a number of questions and unanswered calls on the table, like is happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, you mean that we left here some question on the table, or you mean that during the quiet period, we didn't talk about the numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Communication with investors for us is extremely important. If there's something like that, we would like to take it up. So please give us more details, and I will make sure &#x2013; we all will make sure that, if there are things to be improved, we will improve it.</p>
          <p>So sorry if something was not answered or not answered appropriately. It should not happen and will not happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Holger, I did not forget you in the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Three questions. Holger Blum, Deutsche Bank. The first one is pretty simple, I guess. On Liquid Crystals, you had 20 million in other operating income in Q4. What was it for?</p>
          <p>Second one on Merck Serono. Maybe on the margin. If we say that very high litigation expenses might not be sustainable, and all the other negatives, you're already getting to your targeted profit growth or even a bit more. So how cautious have you been in your assumption with regard to further provisions for litigations and the more or less unexpected items we've seen in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then a third question, a more strategic question. When you started, Mr. Kley, here, I remember your introductory words about less volatility in the business compared to the airline industry, what you appreciated. I think that is still the case.</p>
          <p>But what has changed since you have started? I guess there was a bit more of volatility than anticipated. Maybe some targets like consumer healthcare, a billion of revenues, and then the margins are still opportunities which are lying ahead of you. So maybe if you can share with us how your strategic thinking has evolved over time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other operating income in Liquid Crystals stems from currency hedges.</p>
          <p>As you know, when we think that we have an unfavorable currency development, we hedge our planned cash flow streams up to two years ahead, and we did that in dollar and yen.</p>
          <p>And this is something that should have a mirror in the sales. So what we lose in sales by translation, we gain with a hedge. Sometimes there is a gap when we have very favorable hedges.</p>
          <p>And in the case of the yen, we have an average hedging rate of 140, and which is still, even with the now much stronger yen, a good exchange rate, but in the last year the difference was pretty much higher. The yen was not at 122. Last year, it was more into 30s and at some stage even at 160.</p>
          <p>So that is the source of the income. There are still hedges there, so that also will stay with us going forward, but of course not endlessly. So if you take a long-term view at our Liquid Crystal margin, you should gather in mind that that is an income that is not there forever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the margin development of Merck Serono, of course, at the start of the year, we are not pushing the boat out totally, so we tried to make it narrow, as we did this year, as the year passes by.</p>
          <p>Secondly, litigation absolutely not planned because we can't. That's coming out of the blue. And if you look into the US on my peer companies, most of them have some decent, unfortunate litigation expense, which I call this extortion scheme introduced by the US government for affiliated promotion. And the risk we cannot judge. They come or they come not, but I hope they don't come in for 2010. So there is nothing planned in there.</p>
          <p>And of course, we talked a lot about Venezuela. You heard the turnover. So if we get the payments there at the current official rate, not the market rate, the official rate, of course there is upside. But since we are conservative planning and going to do what we tell you now, that's how we did it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It may be a little bit too early for looking back. I am now three years in the company, and I don't feel old enough neither in the job nor in years to look back already.</p>
          <p>What we have is we defined a strategy, which we've presented to you, I think, in 2007, in rough terms. We have, after successful years of restructuring, adjusting the portfolio, been doing the last two steps quite early in my tenure, in 2007, with the sale of generic and the acquisition of Merck Serono. And what we're currently doing is persistence following the strategy, which has a number of details. Elmar Schnee was talking in 2008 extensively the measures which we took in R&amp;D of Merck Serono, the portfolio review, the portfolio adjustment, and the new organization.</p>
          <p>We have done a lot of internal measures to bring the company forward, which are not visible in the market. We have also had some failures, not only those visible, but also some invisible. And you mentioned the Consumer Health Care business. We had two acquisition targets, which we were following very closely, and I was extremely confident to close one of those when I mentioned the 1 billion, and it slipped through our fingers in the last minute.</p>
          <p>So we are following the strategy as it was defined. We had to be a little bit slower last year because of the crisis, which required a lot of interaction. But at the moment, no change in strategies that we presented in 2007 and the following years. It still holds true.</p>
          <p>I think if I would be re-elected, you should have a look back after five years, if that's agreeable to you. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very happy that we not only have analysts in our forums, so I'd like to ask one our key shareholders to raise questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the nice wording. Habil Letora from Allianz Global Investors.</p>
          <p>I have just one brief question, maybe coming back to the boring situation of the dividend. Dr. Becker, you mentioned that there's a close correlation in dividend to operating result. And the first question I have is that to operating result or to core operating result?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be whether there may be the risk of a wrong or misleading signal to the market by cutting the dividend to such a large extent because a couple of shareholders look to the dividend in a kind of reflection. And if you say that the dividend is correlated to the operating performance of the company, then you may indicate that this company is in a real operating trouble, which is not reflected at all in my view, for example, by the free cash flow. Maybe you can help me or us a little bit in understanding your thinking behind that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The real trigger is the profit after-tax, not the operating result. What I was indicating is that because we are using an average of the profit after-tax, that we can allow exceptionals to be disregarded in the influence on the profit after-tax. And then we reflect the underlying strength of the company represented in the operating result &#x2013; that is, by eliminating the exceptionals. That is the consequence. But the main indicator is the profit after-tax.</p>
          <p>The second is that if we have a drop of the profit after-tax, like we have seen it in our earning power since 2007 or 2006, 2007 even, then we need to reflect that in the dividend. The dividend is to reflect the profit after-tax in the first place. It is softened, and there is a new relation by using the average, but the earnings power on profit after-tax level is the indicator. It must be reflected in the dividend.</p>
          <p>And as I said, the free cash flow that we have is not the first indicator, but it is something that where we have to keep an eye on. And if the free cash flow is under threat, then we will also have to bear an eye, as the same way we bear an eye on the dividend profitability. So if we have a dividend quota of about 1.5% or 1.4%, that's fine. If it falls below 1%, that's not good enough. It goes below &#x2013; beyond 2%, that is something that we would regard as very high. So that is a measure how we judge the dividend being high or low, with comparison to other factors. Okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin Possienke from Rabobank. Just two questions. One on Stimuvax. Maybe you can give us an indication what makes you confident with this product, given the difficult history of tumor vaccines, which may not be surprising, because you have to work with extreme immune deficient patients. So what biomarker program did you employ? Which one did you choose to optimize your patient population?</p>
          <p>And the other question on Stimuvax, why haven't you chosen prostate cancer? Because that's the highest expression of mook one. Is there any reason?</p>
          <p>And the third question, on operational costs, can you update us on the operational costs for Liquid Crystals? How much is variable? How much is fixed? And on fixed costs, maybe one question, how much of the fixed costs do you feel can be adjustable over a three-year period of time, and how much of the fixed costs cannot be adjusted over a three-year period of time? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Stimuvax, mook one is expressed in most of the tumor types, so that's number one. And there might be some small difference, but the differences are not big.</p>
          <p>Why are we so confident and why are we in lung and in breast? We have a brilliant Phase II trial in lung, where we have seen a 13-month survival benefit of Stimuvax-treated patients. We have seen at last year's ASCO that there are patients coming out of this Phase II trial with stage three lung cancer being alive after five years or three years. These are small numbers, granted, but you have never heard this before.</p>
          <p>And, secondly, we have, from a sister compound, which we had before in our portfolio, Theratope. We had some breast information out coming of a Phase I/Phase II trial, which has not been significant, but the trial was not powered to be significant.</p>
          <p>So we have quite a wealth of information at our disposal which makes us confident that Stimuvax is biologically active.</p>
          <p>Regarding the cancer area, absolutely right, it is high risk, and most of them failed. But liquid crystals, we did also research 100 years, and we found maybe after 92 years, some brilliant application, and everybody else gave up.</p>
          <p>So I'm not saying that Stimuvax is similar to liquid crystal, but I think there is some good evidence which makes us confident that this drug might work. However, it is clear that the risk is higher than for a normal Phase III oncology trial, and this we have taken into account in our portfolio management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow-up on this one? Did you choose a biomarker for this trial, or didn't you, in order to stratify the patient population?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a sort of dissemination of patients. I don't want to say what we use. But, yes, the patients are stratified to a certain criteria. In general, we have now &#x2013; with most of our programs in clinical development, we have an associated biomarker research program. I think that's absolutely necessary to go forward, to be successful in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the question to operational costs and ratios, I ask for your understanding that, as we already share a lot of detailed information on this business, in contrast to two other competitors, which we have in this very tough market, we cannot go too much in detail in this.</p>
          <p>Let me answer it from the other end. Of course, the price pressure is some &#x2013; out of the reality of this industry and of this business, one way which I stressed in the presentation how to fight is by innovation. The other way is, of course, by continuous cost reduction.</p>
          <p>And there a lot of initiatives in place. In 2009, we have initiated additional, very ambitious initiative, which besides the ongoing reduction in the variable part of the manufacturing costs, also will impact over the next year, significantly, the fixed cost part of our manufacturing costs.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a follow-up question <mark type="inaudible" /> common sense question. You used to be at only 5% of total costs to produce a panel with liquid crystal. Is that correct? And you had a brilliant market share as well, and your quality of the business was also without doubt.</p>
          <p>So where does the pressure come from? That's what I don't understand. Why do you want to risk to go to a competitor with lower quality to give 1% of the total cost to produce a panel. I don't see that. Maybe you can explain this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe you can accompany at the next meeting with one of our top management guys at the competitor. Of course, in times like this, and you see the development of the consumer prices of TVs &#x2013; they fight for every per million of costs &#x2013; of total costs of the TV. So I think this argument no longer really counts.</p>
          <p>There are basically three elements. One element is there is a strategic issue. The strategic issue for our customer is they don't want to be completely dependent on one source. So therefore, strategically, they go for seconds, and some of them for thirds. I think that was the reality in the last years. We have explained it several times, and therefore there is also a maximum of the year, of the market share, which you can expect.</p>
          <p>Secondly, our competitors have learned. So the quality is there. In new, high-tech applications you find today, I would say 100% Merck. But if the product's mature, then the material of our competitor does make the drop, and depending with what efforts the competition enters the customer account, this puts the scene, what is the request from us. So it's not complete in our control, despite the fact that it's still less than 5% of the total manufacturing cost of the display.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it looks like there are no more questions. Oh, for sure, the famous last question. I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions, please. One is on Cladribine in the EU. I understand it's so all very sensitive when you're interacting with regulators, but can you give us any information as to why you are so confident it's in track in the EU &#x2013; i.e., information that would make us feel that whatever the reasons are that the FDA refuse to file cannot crop up later in the EU process and basically lead to a serious delay in EU as well?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, just finally, for me to really understand your dividend policy in the last few years, could you clarify to what extent you have been taking into account the past profitability i.e. since '94, the respective current year and then your view of the future. Because if I understand correctly, actually your average profitability since 1994 has been quite key to determining dividend. So that would imply that last year would effectively have been out of policy because obviously your overall average hasn't come down by 33% or has your view of the future changed since last year. I'm still a little bit confused as to where the cut is exactly coming from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The confidence from Cladribine has one single source, CLARITY, to try the pivotal Phase III trial, which we have. And if you listened to the opinion leaders, a very prosperous entity, if you listen to patients, you go into social media, you can see how this oral drug treatments get awaited. The clinical trial has been in each of the measure. Is it secondary or is the primary end point highly significant? There's not one measure which was not significant. The efficacy benefit ratio, I think, is very advantageous against other products which are out there. On top, it's oral.</p>
          <p>And if you would think about &#x2013; if you have to inject yourself every day, and you do this until the rest of your life, ten, 20, 30 years. And now &#x2013; and you would start to find not any more places where you can do this because you have so many injections, you get now a treatment possibility, which stops your relapses, stops lesion in your brain and stops disability. That means that you go fast and losing your independence. And you can take a pill which five days in January, five days in February nothing until next January and you are treated and you don't have severe side effects, I think that's a fantastic proposition. And that's the reason why I'm confident that this drug would come on the market.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clarify, the EMEA doesn't have any kind of process like the FDA where they either file or refuse to file. So you can't be 100% sure that the EMEA will not ultimately see the same problems as the FDA whatever they may be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The EMEA does not have the same process, but they can refuse files as they did previously. But there is not the 60 days that they have to, but they did refuse files. Secondly, as Erbitux has teached us, you cannot predict what these authorities are doing. But nevertheless I'm highly confident that Cladribine will make it on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, to the dividend again, the average is just the straightforward average. There is no weighting in the average, and we only look back. So we take the current year and we determine what the reaction of the dividend towards the result should be and then we check that if we do this reaction, we stay within the corridor or not. And this is just a 15 year's average now. We need to show that that's clear. We don't know how. And we don't look forward and say, what do we expect in future?</p>
          <p>So the average means that we can go beyond the 40% in any one year as long as we stay in the corridor. We have paid out more last year. We will pay out more this year. We are about the 40% in the year, but we stay in the corridor, in the average. That's there.</p>

          <p>Apologies, Markus. Dr. Schnee, just one more question, in answer to your comments on CLARITY, I think we all agree that the data was excellent, but the FDA also has a rule which historically has been set in stone that you need two clinical studies. Now, your argument has always been that you had a pre-discussion meeting with the FDA and CLARITY was deemed to be enough. That's hence why we're asking the question, do you need another study. And unfortunately, we're not getting an answer. But can you at least reassure us that the person at the FDA who gave you that initial guidance that CLARITY was sufficient is still imposed on the committee in the FDA, and therefore, it is potentially possible that CLARITY is enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rest assured, the person in charge of this is still working at the FDA, absolutely. And I know him.</p>
          <p>Secondly, actually, it's not entirely I think true what you're saying. There is no cast-in-stone regulation on the FDA that you have to have two pivotal Phase III. There is actually a rule within the FDA under which circumstances a product is admitted to the market with only one Phase III. It has to be a very severe disease. There has to be not a lot of treatment options and so forth. So there is flexibility on the FDA side. But you never can say what at the end, as I tried to allude over the European file with Erbitux, it was clear cut for me. But it changed somehow the rules, but I'm confident. It's a brilliant drug.</p>
