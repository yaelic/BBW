          <p>Thank you very much. You are more than welcome to this presentation of Nordea's First Quarter Results. We will basically follow the same procedures as every time, which means that the CEO and President of Nordea, Christian Clausen, will kick-off with presentation of the report. After that we will open up for a short question session on the overall questions with Christian and after that we will split the group into two with the analysts and investors welcome down to Nordea at Halden to ask questions to Fredrik Rystedt, CFO; and Ari Kaperi, Chief Risk Officer of Nordea.</p>
          <p>As always, this press conference will be broadcasted on the Internet, so please when you ask questions state who you are and who you representing your questions. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning and welcome. I'm proud today to be able to present another solid quarter for Nordea. And the key messages today is that our strong business momentum continues. We have more customers, we do more business with the customers and we gained stronger relationships.</p>
          <p>Our strong platform and our relationship strategy delivers. We are taking Nordea into the New Normal, as I also addressed last time we were here. We will ensure that we can maintain our business momentum and we will focus on our returns on capital, capital efficiency and cost efficiency.</p>
          <p>So let's start with the numbers. We have strong results. Total income is at record level. We also have profit before loan losses at record levels. We have some extra reservations under loan losses this year for a special Danish situation with the deposit guarantee scheme and risk adjusted profit is also up at a very high level.</p>
          <p>Let us dive into each line; and first, the total income is at record level, as I said, a very strong business momentum and we have more ancillary business with our customers.</p>
          <p>The net interest income level is stable. We have a very solid trend in customer areas. Deposit volumes and margins are up. We also have some lending expansion. We have some demand from small and medium sized companies across the board, but we have limited loan demand from the very big customers. The very big customers do have a lot of cash. They finance themselves, and those who don't, they typically go to the capital market. That's very good, because we also have a very strong presence in helping our customers to the capital markets. Our household lending is also up. It's up 4% annualized in Q1. It's a lower level than we saw last year as expected.</p>
          <p>The main reason for the lower net interest income is however that we have too fewer days, so I'm looking forward to a quarter with a lot of days and we will go up. Also, the reason is that we have increased funding cost for our liquidity buffer and we have reduced the interest rate risk in our treasury operation, in essence that means that we have prepared ourselves for increasing interest rates.</p>
          <p>Net fee and commission remains very strong. I mean, there is a lot of seasonal effects in this line. We know that in Q4 &#x2013; Q1, so only 3% down is a very strong number. And we see the asset management area continued to increase its commissions, received very strong forward looking sign in this area with 89% of all our funds beating their index over the last three years. High level from Life and Pension and we also have a strong lending commission.</p>
          <p>Also our fair value result is strong. It's up 8%. The underlying customer business continues to deliver, but we also this month had a very strong trading environment and strong results in Group Corporate Center.</p>
          <p>Expenses are down 6% quarter-on-quarter when we adjust for the FX effects and one-off gains. And in general, the expense development is exactly in line with our expectations. We have a very large currency effect with translation of Swedish krona into euro has a significant effect on expenses around 4% per year.</p>
          <p>Net loan losses remain at a low level. It's 22 basis points; it was 23 in Q4. But we have in this quarter &#x20AC;67 million reservation for the Danish Deposit Guarantee scheme, which had to bale out a number of depositors in Denmark after Amagerbanken went bankrupt, and we have to bare our share of that burden. In the Baltic, we see some write-backs.</p>
          <p>In general, I'd like to say that the credit quality is improving and the leading indicator for that is, of course, our credit rating migration. So, as you can see from this slide, our ratings are migrated upwards in this part of the cycle as expected. So we have a higher proportion of our exposure at high ratings and a lower proportion at low ratings, so the whole credit quality of the book is actually continuously improving and we expect that to continue.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans are slightly higher. That is very much due to technical reasons, also this part of the cycle when we identify individual loan losses and we use some of the general provisions to do those reservations, then for technical reason the impaired loans go up, because we have no loan volume we impaired when we do general provisions, and then we'll do individual. We actually have a loan volume which we impaired, so we should not put too much emphasis on that number.</p>
          <p>The capital position is very solid and we have our Tier 1 ratio coming up to 10.7. We have managed our risk-weighted assets slightly down this quarter. We optimized some areas, as I mentioned, to improve credit quality and then we have showed that we have lower volumes in international network, as you may remember, that was one of the reasons for the increase in Q4.</p>
          <p>In general, we generate very significant amount of equity every quarter. And as you can see here, over the past years, we actually on average generated more than 9% free equity after dividends and rights issue. So, of course, it's a very strong part of the story, meaning that we can actually ourselves generate the capital we need to increase the capital level further, if we think that is necessary. Right now we think this level is the right one, but we have the freedom to actually do and put it where we want to.</p>
          <p>The custom acquisition trends continues. It is quite amazing that we continue this huge inflow of new gold and private banking customers. These are the upper segments, the customers who do all the business with Nordea. They have a lot of products. They get a fantastic service, the best possible service, 360 degree advisory meetings. You should it out one day. It's a very good experience and these customers come in, it's actually now on average 6% in 2007 and it continues through the quarter. A very strong value proposition, which clearly have the effect that customers are seeking on Nordea on these higher segments.</p>
          <p>Also on the top segment, the large corporates, we have a strong development all over the Nordic area. We have, on the slide here, the number of lead relationships, particularly in Sweden, which is growing up dramatically. A lead relationship from a large corporate is of course a bank who gets the bulk of the ancillary business, which makes it a very interesting relationship.</p>
          <p>Over the past year, as you can see, we have not expanded lending that much to the large corporate, it's actually more or less unchanged. But as I said, the large corporates have funded themselves on the capital markets or by their free cash flow, and therefore the equation we have here with revenues up 14% and lending unchanged is a very strong one generating and very strong return on equity on this segment.</p>
          <p>I will now move into some comments on our platform and our starting point for the future. And the relationship strategy is unchanged, it keeps delivering. We are penetrating our top segments, the key relationship customers, and we are building efficiency. You have seen this slide before. And we are building this platform, most of our investments is actually into creating a very strong platform for the future, which can handle more business, more customers, more activity at a lower cost level.</p>
          <p>And this comes in infrastructure &#x2013; IT infrastructure, administrative processes, offshore senders, the platform for risk management and so on. It goes from a number of our product platforms, our integrated savings operation throughout the network, our multi-channel offering very much, the net bank which is a driver towards taking physical manual transactions out of the network onto the net. It's very much getting scale in cards and payments, which is a huge area for Nordea.</p>
          <p>And of course it also comes in our distribution capability. We are building the future distribution network, as I mentioned I think last time, and even the meeting two times ago where we are building a new distribution from advice branches and service branches and they are producing very strong results. We do more customer meetings per employee in the advice branches and we do more transactions per employee in the service branches, and the customers are happy. So this is a very strong story and we will continue that.</p>
          <p>We're also working on our area, risk management area, towards large corporates, our market products, risk management products in corporate finance. So we are building a platform and this platform is indeed delivering quite interesting features. It delivers increased customer acknowledgement, it delivers clearly improved market positions, it delivers productivity and efficiency, it delivers low risk and it delivers strong finances.</p>
          <p>Let me give a few comments on these five headlines. The first one with customer acknowledgement, these are just a few examples of how we measure this. First of all, the total customer satisfaction on the top is going up. Our gap to peers is significant now. We have a significantly more positive customer satisfaction than our peers.</p>
          <p>Lot of our rankings are going up. I only took one here, which is our equity trading ranking, which is moving up according to our strategy we invest in this area. Our lending market shares on household and corporate is up. Our private banking market share is up. Our assets under management grow in this period of time, grew by 21% compared to peers which is significantly lower.</p>
          <p>Our capital markets income relative to peers is also growing. We're now making three times the best peer in income in our capital markets area. Our premiums in unit-linked is growing up and actually I could continue, but I will instead continue with productivity and efficiency, which is also key and we have also here seen a very strong development of our efficiency, business volume per employee is up, income per employee is up, income per customer is up and the manual transactions in the network, as you can see down there, is down and that is of course key. So we do less transaction in the network, which is super-important because then we can use our network for talking to our customers, advising them which is of course key to having a better relationship.</p>
          <p>The platform is also delivering a very strong risk management, and this slide I've shown every time, and the reason is that this show how we have managed our risk through two cycles. We defined our risk appetite many years ago and we have effectively managed through, especially the recent big cycle in a way where we have kept our expected loan losses average over the cycle. As you can clearly see, we are within that and now we're below the line. We had a few quarters, as you can see in 2009 where we're above the line, but this risk appetite is one that we have designed which is in line with our capability of generating income.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the numbers in 2010, the net loan losses represent a fairly modest proportion of our profit before loan losses around these &#x20AC;900 million. So this is what we could afford. This is what we every quarter could set aside and then we will have enough reserves to manage through the crisis.</p>
          <p>Even in the worst quarters, in the middle of 2009, that figure was only &#x20AC;1.5 billion and with a profit before loan losses of &#x20AC;4.5 billion, we never even came close to a situation where the losses impaired our strong profit. This is a very strong picture and I think it shows the stability of Nordea in a very strong way.</p>
          <p>We're also delivering our long-term targets. We have the long-term targets is doubling risk-adjusted profit in seven years. It's to be in top league on ROE in Nordic area, and it is to be in top quartile on shareholder return.</p>
          <p>First, the line on doubling risk adjusted profit, we are slightly below the line, as you can see, and the reason is mainly the low interest rate level. Actually our underlying figure shows that we have delivered underlying the 10% growth per year in terms of customers, transactions, income in a number of areas, but with very low interest rate level, we are slightly behind also the funding cost and so on, but we have delivered underlying. So we're quite pleased with that and as you can see the lines are approaching each other.</p>
          <p>On total shareholder return, we are one of very few banks in Europe, which have actually delivered shareholder return throughout this period of time. Most peers have not done that.</p>
          <p>In ROE, we have also delivered. As you can see on the blue bars, we have in every single year been well ahead of the Nordic peers' average. Also for the total period for 2007 to 2010, we're way ahead on the Nordic average, and we're even ahead of the best peer on average in this &#x2013; not on average, ahead of the best peer in this period of time. And the reason for that is, of course, that we have increased our profitability in the period.</p>
          <p>If we look at the slide at your right, you can see that the reason why our return on equity comes down is of course mainly that we run the bank with much more equity. The Core Tier 1 ratio has of course gone up. We also still have some loan losses which we didn't have in 2007 and there is more tax. But most importantly, our pre-provision profit is up by more than 4%. So we actually increased the underlying profitability level of the bank with 4% or more than 1% per year. And that's quite amazing and without that we would have been a much lower level on ROE and maybe much closer to what we see in general in Europe.</p>
          <p>This is a very strong starting point. And of course, we need a strong starting point, because we're all entering into the New Normal with new regulation. The new regulation requires banks to have much more capital, much more liquidity buffers and much more long funding.</p>
          <p>You can say, the amount of raw material for running a bank is simply going up. We don't know exactly the levels yet. We just know it's a lot more capital and we think the Core Tier 1 capital is actually probably between 10% and 11%, maybe even 11%, so the capital rate was probably higher. The liquidity problems are huge. They are probably in the order of magnitude we have here. And the maturity of our long funding needs to be prolonged.</p>
          <p>So, the amount of resources needed to run a bank is going up. Of course, it's key to be able to buy those resources at a low price to fund yourself at a low funding cost to attract capital at a low capital cost. And the key to be able to do that is a higher ROE, a high return on capital. If you have the high return on capital, you can attract funding at a low cost, capital at a low cost and so on. So this is key going forward, and therefore, we are also focusing on the return on capital going forward.</p>
          <p>We have delivered on the return on capital. We are actually among the very best &#x2013; very small select group in Europe with a high return on capital today. As you can see, it's not going up, but that's really because in this period of time as we saw we have also attracted more capital. And we also have a higher funding cost coming into the equation. So actually we have already mitigated a lot of the new effects, but more will come. It's our assessment that the best European banks will be moving towards 15% ROE. And we want to stay in that league where we already are, so we are committed to take the necessary steps to improve our ROE to maintain in that group of banks.</p>
          <p>And this means we have to improve our capital efficiency further and we will take steps to do that. We will focus our resources on that and we already started it, you already saw it in the Q1 report, but there are number of things we will be doing. We will, first of all, hopefully soon get our approval on our advanced internal rate based model. We have delivered the application to the FSA. We will get the answer later this year hopefully, but maybe will be early next year, it takes some time.</p>
          <p>We will be working on a number of efficiency areas where we optimize the use our risk-weighted assets, which is of key &#x2013; of course, key to the amount of capital needed. We will mitigate a number of areas where we see the new regulation require more risk-weighted assets and we will simply need to sign this capital intensive solutions and we are doing that. And we will, in a number of areas increase RWA efficiency covering processes, sourcing of data, collateral and other methods.</p>
          <p>And of course, we will, going forward, also focus on producing capital-light products. So we use as little as possible of this experience &#x2013; expensive raw material. And of course, we also have to be more cost efficient. We already have done a lot here, as you can already see. A very strong starting point actually with our strong platform, but we will keep doing that and we will also reallocate a number of resources to be more efficient in our initiatives. So, more supporting efficiency and profitability rather than growth, we have already created this huge platform and that will, of course, keep delivering growth. So we will gradually manage the cost increase level down during the second half of this year and going into 2012 reflecting this higher cost efficiency.</p>
          <p>We're also changing the organization today in a separate announcement, we're doing it. We are combining all the elements in the value chain into organizations. We have now for four years worked in the value chains, I explain it many times, where all the elements in the value chain come together in delivering to the customers.</p>
          <p>We are now organizing among &#x2013; along three main value chains, where we put everything, the customer responsibility, support units, product units, IT development and other areas into one value chain. So we get direct accountability over the capital, the risk-weighted assets and the cost efficiency. And that we think can improve our efficiency.</p>
          <p>In doing that, we are changing Group Executive Management also now. Peter Sch&#xFC;tze have taken this occasion to leave the bank. After 40 years in the bank, Peter has of course been instrumental in creating Nordea, integrating Nordea as we know it today, and had made a great effort, and we all like to thank him for that.</p>
          <p>We are announcing two new GM members, Torsten Hagen J&#xF8;rgensen, who is today Head of Group Treasury, will take up Group Operation and other business lines; and Peter Nyegaard who is today heading up Capital Markets will be Chief Operating Officer in the Wholesale Banking area. And you see their smiling faces here. I'm sure they will be a strong contribution to our top management.</p>
          <p>So, the key messages today, we are continuing our strong business momentum. We see that in the numbers and we are really pleased to see that our relationship strategy delivers. It will also continue going forward.</p>
          <p>We have built a strong platform, as I demonstrated. It can handle more customers and more transactions in a more efficient way and that is really delivering and it will also be delivering into the future.</p>
          <p>And we are taking Nordea one step further into New Normal. We will maintain our business momentum, of course, that will focus more on our resources and investments into capital efficiency and cost efficiency, and thereby producing a higher return on equity.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks from now.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Christian. And we have two different groups in this conference. We have the journalists and we have the analysts. And as I said before, the detailed interest of the analysts will be taking care of &#x2013; to very prominent number crunchers, Fredrik and I later on. But we will before that give you the opportunity to ask questions to Christian both from the journalist group and the analyst group, of course, before letting you dig into the fantastic world of numbers later on.</p>
          <p>But if you have any questions on the more broad picture, we have reserved some time here.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> Finland. Yeah, Handelsbanken told yesterday that they see the situation in the capital market being actually worst than four, six months ago. How do you &#x2013; how would you describe the situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not say that it's worst, but still think the capital markets are reflecting that risk premiums are there and reflecting still some uncertainty in the future and we all know the problem about Southern Europe, and sovereign debt and so on.</p>
          <p>I think that the capital markets are also reflecting on the new &#x2013; the need of raw material and banking capital and funding, which is of course scarce resource and that resources we need to use more going forward. So, I would say, there is a certain bad trade zone on where banks will have return on equity will be able to attract these resources in a good way and others will not in the same way. So I think it's more a concern for the future. Actually I think our access to the market has improved in this period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we had, I think, one question over there and one there, I have seen you wave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. Two questions if I may. First on the new normal plan. I realize that you have not finished that yet, but you state that you expect to communicate when things clarified in the regulatory space. When is that? When do you expect things to be clear enough for you to make statements on return on equity and other metrics? So, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one, on cost growth. You indicate that we should expect cost growth going down later this year and into 2012. If you dare to give us some kind of number around that, what we should expect for the rest of this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On cost growth, we will gradually manage it down. We are running our initiatives and we'll reschedule some of them, reprioritize some of them and we also will have some concrete actions to take out some efficiency. So we'll manage it down to a lower level continuously during the second half and into next year. I will not give an exact number, because you will remember that number for a very long time, so I will not do that right now. But we will come back to a number of course.</p>
          <p>The new Normal Plan, I think I'm already explaining quite clearly. We are of course working with it. We already implemented part of it. You see in Q1, part of the RBA reduction coming in. You also see some efficiency figures. So we are already doing it, but we're taking a number of steps and we're working on that. So I think we're giving a picture. We're even hinting at the targets which could be in a New Normal plan by stating that we think the best banks in Europe will be around 15 ROE. And we have aspirations to also stay in that group of banks with very high ROEs.</p>
          <p>The reason why we cannot be 100% precise is of course that we don't know the capital ratio. And you know very well, it's been discussed what the core capital and the total capital ratio should be, and in this very country a very high number around 15%, 16% has been mentioned. Also in other countries, we know that G20 will express their views on the capital surcharge on systemically important banks later this year.</p>
          <p>We know there is hard work going on in the Basel Committee around liquidity ratios and the stable funding ratios and these things. So it will be clearer, but when we indicate these numbers, it is of course because we think that it will probably settle around those levels I mentioned here. So I think the plan is pretty open, all the very detailed elements are more, I could say, an execution issue for us exactly what we're going to do, but we have long list of initiatives, which we are executing to get there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had a question, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just if you could give us a broad overview on the margin trends, the lending margin trends, in the various Nordic countries. One of your competitors expressed some kind of margin, lending margin concern in Norway, as an example, yesterday what you see there, but also in the other countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The lending margins, we have reported small increases, more or less unchanged I would say across the board both on household and corporate. We have a situation where the competition among the large corporate customers is very strong, so their margins are fairly low for new business. But in general, margins are I would say a bit uncertain right now, because everybody realizes that the cost of funding the lending is coming up.</p>
          <p>So, obviously there is an upward pressure in margins. When we will see that materialize also depends on when we actually see the new regulation coming out. So I think, if anything, the margin level is stable, but it should at a certain period of time be going up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is this between the countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not on the corporate side in reality, we are still repricing some corporate lending from years back to a higher level, but new lending is sort of lower level. I think that's across the board. There is differences on the household sector, because of the differences in the mortgage system and things like that. But in general, it is more or less the same picture, the margins are stable across the board, and some technical issues in Norway which we can come back to later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I think we have a final question over there unless someone else will come up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I have two questions. Firstly, again coming back to the New Normal plan, can you give an indication how much you expect that to be driven by capital efficiency and how much is cost efficiency in terms of increase in the return on equity if it's a fairly even split or if there is any differences? Also in terms of timing, not only when you can disclose them, but how long time do you think it will take to implement it, this is a five year plan, two year plan or if you can give &#x2013; at least give any indication on that would be very helpful?</p>
          <p>And the second part I wanted to touch upon was the asset quality in Norway, where you had some larger exposures that had problems during the first quarter. Is there asset quality getting any worse, how is the rating migration doing in Norway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the split between capital and cost, I cannot give you that. We don't know it precisely but both will deliver. I think, to get to at higher ROE, not to mention the level of 15, you have to use all levers that exists that will not be easy. I think very few banks will actually get there on a normalized level. So that's the first thing.</p>
          <p>The second thing is the timing. It's not a five year plan for sure. But I would rather say, the timing will be that we are more identifying this top group of banks with very few banks who can actually deliver that and we will be in the same pace as them, so it depends a bit on when the cost of this new regulation kicks in when we actually do that, and therefore it's &#x2013; but it's considerably shorter than five years, of course, but we will get back to that later on.</p>
          <p>At this point in the cycle where we are below our average loan losses over the cycle, there will be quarters when loan losses go up a bit and quarters where they go down a bit. In individual countries, it can be because of two large customers having problems in a single country like we have seen in Norway, which is no big secret. And then it moves up in one quarter and probably move back again in another country and another thing will happen. So now we will see fluctuation in loan losses. It's not possible to make structural explanation on loan losses when they're below the average over the cycle.</p>
          <p>As I said, our credit quality is improving. Credit migration is positive that points towards better credit quality and of course by definition, it therefore points toward lower losses in general. But there will be quarters in one country or in other country where you see individual companies are having problems.</p>
          <p>Of course, the world economy is not 100% out of the bushes. There are still sectors which are struggling and so one &#x2013; and therefore there will also be individual companies struggling in this aftermath of the cycle. The only structural explanation on the loan losses we had &#x2013; we gave today that we are somewhat higher still in Denmark. This could gradually coming down &#x2013; the underlying loan losses in Denmark, but the aftermarket of the cycle is tougher in Denmark. And then we have the special one-off in Denmark.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Unless there is someone who has a final question, I'll then conclude that this question session is over. So, first of all, journalists, I am constantly bugged by Helena changing the position, changing corners, but Helena knows exactly where the journalists are and supposed to go. And analysts are welcome again down to Nordea at Halden.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for this meeting.</p>
          <p>We'll start with a very short in-depth description of the report going to net interest income, the capital situation, the credit quality and then we'll open up for questions. So, Fredrik, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodney. We'll just have some, as Rodney said, initial comments on some of the details on the results. So, let me just start by saying, we continuously had a good business activity in pretty much all the segments, however, it was a solid quarter in that respect, as Christian has also presented.</p>
          <p>You can see from this slide that in the early part of 2010, we had a slight decline, and as you actually are aware of, this decline was very much largely due to other things than &#x2013; other things than customer operations. They're largely due to decline in market and treasury operations in the early 2010. And pretty much since then, we've had a stable growth in the underlying customer business and that trend has actually also continued in 2011.</p>
          <p>Net interest income. It has been also here, a stable development, although you've seen a slight decline. And let me come back to that issue. Generally, volume growth is limited, as you have seen. And we have a slight or more or less flat development on the corporate side, but also there it's a two tier development, put it that way. The very large, and you can say, also cash-rich customers in the CMB segments actually have experienced a low demand in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Cash richness is one of the issues, but it's also an extensive use of the capital markets which we are also, of course, a big contributor and advisor on the capital market. So it's &#x2013; from a P&amp;L perspective and capital perspective, that's not a bad development. But from a loan growth perspective, we see a fairly low demand in that area, whilst the small and medium continues to be good and actually picking up some momentum.</p>
          <p>Household lending continues to be growing, but it's interesting to know that the annualized growth rate is now roughly about half of what you have seen in 2010 and also part of 2009. Another couple of explanations in here, I think, I'll show you that in the next slide, but it's worth noting. We have fewer days and we have increased cost for the liquidity buffer and funding cost. Let me show you this in more detail.</p>
          <p>If you look at this bridge, it is actually quite interesting to note a couple of things. First of all, the volume, as you can see is, the contribution is slightly negative. This is now because overall lending is actually shrinking, in fact it is growing, but it's a mix issue. So what's actually growing slightly is, of course, the more low margin household business and what is basically flat, or even in some countries, contracting somewhat is the high yielding or high margin corporate business.</p>
          <p>You also clearly see here, the margin is continuing to do well on the deposit side. We've had some positive gains also from the lending side. But the majority of the decline or the more than the majority of the decline, of course, in net interest income has to do with basically treasury. And there are two reasons for that decline very much as we have expected for the year, there are two things.</p>
          <p>The first one is that we have adapted our liquidity risk framework. So now we're using an LCR type approach. We are LCR compliant in the framework. We're still not using the definition of the assets within the LCR definition, but we are using now a longer timeframe and funding for our liquidity buffers, so a more resilient liquidity framework that we're now applying consistent with Basel III recommendations. So, that's one of reason which is basically meant an extension of the short-term funding.</p>
          <p>The other major reason is that we have overall also extended our short-term funding, and that is of course in anticipation of higher short-term interest rates as we go forward, both in the euro zone and in the other currencies. So we are basically now positioned more neutral in terms of the interest rates on the funding side in the short end, whilst we were before much more shorter funded in that end. That's basically the reason why together with two banking days fewer, that's the reason why net interest income is lower.</p>
          <p>Interest rate sensitivity, as a consequence, of course, we are now less sensitive to higher interest rate in treasury. We were more neutral. Therefore, the total net interest sensitivity, net interest income is more sensitive to 100 basis points upwards, and of course that's only consistent. So what has actually changed here is the &#x2013; see risk in treasury. And that of course is something we deem as possible as &#x2013; or positive as we now see short-term interest rates increasing further as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Just a quick couple of words on the risk-weighted assets. Christian alluded to it in his speech, but it has resulted in a higher Core Tier 1 ratio and we have a slight decline in risk-weighted assets as you can see. So, credit quality is of course part of that story, very small growth impact or zero as you can see on the slide. And you will remember from the previous presentation we did in Q4 that we had an exceptionally high amount of commitment in lending from the international branches where we're 100% standardized, not IRB. And of course we don't have that this quarter. So that contributes both in terms of Core Tier 1 and of course also in lower risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, important, we are working quite extensively with risk-weighted assets efficiency. We did that also last year. We had approximately about &#x20AC;5 billion or so in risk-weighted asset efficiency last year and we're continuing this trend. So, Q1 was approximately 1.2. And as you can see, that actually contributed also in terms of the Core Tier 1 ratio. And the largest contributor increasing that ratio to 10.7 is, of course, the profit being generated.</p>
          <p>And this is something that also Christian touched upon, but it's pretty obvious. We generate a lot of capital and exactly where the Core Tier 1 ratio will end up in the future, of course, will be subject to everything that's going to be more clear to us as regulatory environment is presented as we go forward. But &#x2013; what this goes to show is with the strong capital generation we have a large flexibility in adapting to the Core Tier 1 ratio that we see fit given regulation, and of course the business model and the capital cost that we want to have.</p>
          <p>So with those words, I will leave over to you, Ari.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And some words for credit quality. I could say that this Q1 repeated more or less the pattern we have now seen more or less in the past two quarters, so that's still the overall quality of our credit book, i.e., average ratings, they are improving. But still there is tail of this type of problem customers but we are booking new provisions and then those provisions are usually the risks we have covered earlier with collective provision. So, the collective provisions are coming down and retail provisions up, and then there is this kind of overall improvement on the average credit quality.</p>
          <p>If you start from this rating migration, here is just a slide showing that what happened in our corporate book in terms of rating, ratings in Q1. So that one observation is that the rating activity in the first quarter is quite low. So that we re-rate it around 10% of our corporate customer book in Q1, that's quite natural because tender activity is picking up, especially this quarter Q2. So when we have the first financials and then see better how the corporate are doing. So then this is a very crucial quarter in that way this Q2, and when we see that &#x2013; what is the direction. So that out of these 10% over re-rate the customers 6% are operated, but still 4% down weight. So this is also indicating that there are still a tail of customers who are in problems.</p>
          <p>All in all, as Christian showed in his presentation that the amount of high-rated customers that we say, we may end up by high rated customers those who are investment credit companies in external rating agencies. That's 72%, 73%, so that is a very high portion in our book.</p>
          <p>And then here you can see what happened in our loan losses, so that this net figure you have already seen in &#x20AC;242 million, then here is &#x2013; the yellow bar is that new provisions, longest provisions for new customers, there is also the &#x20AC;67 million of Amagerbanken, but &#x20AC;325 million was provisions for new individual loan losses, and then we made reversals on earlier made both individual and collective provisions of &#x20AC;150 million. So, the net figure was &#x20AC;242 million.</p>
          <p>Which is excluding this Amagerbanken as you had 22 basis points so that we are still below as we have been now in few quarters of our risk appetite. It's still even that the sources of these loan loss is more or less the same as it has been in few past quarters. Still we see &#x2013; you can see in the lower chart, you can see that what is happening in Denmark so that still there is a quite stable flow of SMEs, especially SME companies where we see that we have to make loan loss provision.</p>
          <p>And then, in this quarter, there were two individual weaker cases in Norway. So that excluding these weaker two individual cases in Norway, Norway we have been at zero more or less. So that's indicating that what was the impact. But as you can see in new European markets, which covers Baltics, Poland and Russia. Actually it was reversals so that the net loan losses they were positive, Sweden more or less nothing, Finland are very low so that it was Denmark and Norway. This flow over new individual provisions in Denmark, that will come down sooner or later, that's for sure. But it's very difficult to say that when does it come down, so that we didn't see that being in Q1. Still the rating migration that was one question in previous session, that is improving in all countries, so that &#x2013; that's of course strong message even in Denmark, even in Norway, so that is indicating that there is very low likelihood that the losses are up in those countries. But when they are coming down more than this remains to be seen.</p>
          <p>And then this lower chart shows that, okay, this is what is now happening in our total allowances, so that now we are moving loan losses from these collective allowances, which we have made earlier when we have identified this type of riskier portfolios to integrate to our loan loss provisions when the see the customers importance, but the total figure more or less unchanged. And that is explaining this increase in impaired loans, so that when we impair. When we make a loan loss delivery to our customer that means that we impaired the total lending before that customer and then that is visible in this slight increase in our impaired loans, whereas when we have booked these collective provision, then there has not been any kind of impaired loan attached to that provision.</p>
          <p>I guess that covers my opening remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, number crunchers. So, please reopen up the floor for question. We'll start with Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So it's Andreas H&#xE5;kansson from Exane BNP Paribas. And two questions. First it's on NAI. We saw the rate hike from the ECB in the beginning of the quarter. Could you tell us a little bit about the timing of the positive impact? And if it's still 80% of the now &#x20AC;540 million that's related to ECB rates?</p>
          <p>Second question is about Denmark. We see that the smaller Danish banks, which leaves basically two or three bigger ones, none of them has access to funding at all today which could, of course, create very big problems for them. Do you see an ability or risk that the Government of Denmark's going to have to introduce a new, full blanket guarantee, with the obvious big cost for the banking system and yourselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start with the ECB part. Of course it's &#x2013; 80% is not the true number. If we start looking at where we actually have our sensitivities, of course, to a large portion in the transaction account, so it's approximately &#x20AC;25 billion, out of which 40% in Finland, and now they're roughly about 20 in Denmark, so it's about 60 of that portion, right? And of course, that is fully impacted by ECB or at least the Finnish part.</p>
          <p>Then in addition, we have the distribution of our liquidity buffers and other interest rate sensitivities on the savings account, which is actually evenly distributed. So, it is not &#x2013; maybe 80%. We have basically 25 roughly or so in Sweden, another 10 or so in Norway and the rest is largely to be rate impacted, so that's roughly the figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give some comments on this last question. Of course, there's a positive news in Denmark and related also to Danish Banks, but the situation is not getting worse. You're right so that there are still banks which are in problems how to get their funding and all that. But I tend to believe this type of natural solution that those banks, they have to restructure their business model taking down their, let's say, volumes of lending so that they don't need so much wholesale funding. So that they are becoming where they started from this type of savings banks funding their, let's say, assets usage by deposits.</p>
          <p>What happened there was that exactly those type of banks started to take in a lot of wholesale funding in 2005 and '06 and started to accelerate their lending to the real estate projects and all that. And that accelerated also these problem in Denmark. So that I still see that there is opportunity that they are restructuring themselves, so it may mean some consolidation, it may mean even some future defaults, but &#x2013; and then of course who knows what the Danish Government is doing. Of course they are very closely following up the situation. But I think that this positive development starts to be visible then, probably what's the reason for them to react in more severe way. But this is just my, as you can understand my personal thinking, not any kind of thorough analysis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on that. I think Danske Bank recently said that if interest rates rise by 100 basis points, house price in Denmark will fall by another 12 percentage points. And given that 20% of the households are already negative equity, we are still looking at the complete different situation in Denmark to that in Nordic countries. So I assure that we actually can't see an increase in provisions in Denmark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said that, for example in our case, most of you saw that we have this &#x2013; our amount of collective loan loss provisions is now 750-roughly-million roughly. Most of that we have anyway allocated to Danish book, because we see this so that this so that definitely there will be still defaults, and also in the household side. But we think that actually, I believe, in our case we are provided whatever happens. So that you're right, so that there will be new problem cases, that's for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thomas and then Mats.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question about your NII analysis there. You're talking about more &#x2013; lending more or less expanded, but increased funding is not yet moved out of the business areas. Doesn't that mean that in the next quarter you'll report negative margin development into the operating units?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but what we actually &#x2013; what we have done is that the funding cost per se, typically we don't take interest rate risk in our lending book, right. So of course we have an internal funds transfer price. And the spread cost &#x2013; the total spread cost between Q4 and Q1 is actually unchanged, which is &#x20AC;3 million difference, so it's very, very small number. So, we actually haven't picked up in terms of funding cost.</p>
          <p>However, in treasury, we have also risk mandates. So, as I alluded to before, we have been positioned a little within treasury risk mandate. We have been positioned towards low short-term funding rates and that's the result that's basically treasury is not the funding operation. That's basically purely treasury risk taking, so to speak. We've been there for a long time, and now we have become more neutral in the treasury operation. So it's not related to the customer operation as such. The customer operation is basically neutral in terms of interest rate risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That kind of leads into my second question about Group Corporate Center. You're talking about that group funding reduced interest rate risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, does that mean that the NII level in Group Corporate Center is something which you'll get used to. This is kind of the New Normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is going to be lower as you have seen now and we have made an adaptation and become more neutral. That's one part of the story. It's the short-term part of the story. But of course, also as longer-term interest rates also move, we can also pick up higher yield for the liquidity buffer. So, whilst you are right in the short-term, it's not necessarily the long-term story in line with higher interest rate, you also yield more in the liquidity buffer, so it's two sides of that coin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any reason to expect some of that to be also for items of fair value, like it was in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a good quarter for treasury and for Group Corporate Center, that's the fair thing. But generally, we do generate good profits in items of fair value in treasury. So, of course we hope to offset part of it, yes.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mats Anderson at Cheuvreux. When you showed us the picture here about reducing risk-rated assets, one of the points you made was that you have been scaling down your international exposure. Could you discuss that a little bit, why you're behaving that way and what you see here in the future? I mean, your strategy there, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start. We are not scaling down the business in international process, because that's &#x2013; in our model that's standardized approach and that's very risk-weighted, asset-heavy approach. We are, of course, then going through the portfolios in high detail to take out this kind of unused committed lines towards customers, which have been there for ages and nobody has used them. It's this kind of cleaning the house and also then, then of course when there were big new deals, for example, for certain customers, where we can in a way think that we'll have to look those, to simply those big deals then we can choose at our entity than these international projects, things like that. But that is not any kind of indication that we would start to take down the business activity in the international branches on the contrary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe to add a lot of the commitments in lending down out of international branches is related to the customers we have in the bank at large. So, in Q4, we had an exceptionally high volume, that was actually done out of international branches, but they could be done out of any place in the bank, because that is basically Nordic customer to a large degree.</p>
          <p>And the second thing, you may wish to add here is that of course this is a model issue over the longer period of time. We should be of course using our internal models also in the international branches, and we will do that over the longer perspective. So, this is more a model issue than anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is exactly going to that category, what Fredrik said that those customers, also financial institutions which we have in international branches may have originated in the Nordic countries. And then, of course, we have to evaluate always that where to book those transactions we are doing with those customers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first of all, I think it's a very relevant question, because it's not an exact science of what is the level. And of course it will depend on all sorts of things that we have alluded to here in terms of capital levels and Core Tier 1 levels, et cetera. So, it is a difficult estimate, but we believe that it's an over the cycle kind of measure that's where the top lead banks will or likely to be. So, it's a rough estimate, but of course that level is going to be easier just to assess we know a little bit more going forward.</p>

          <p>Yeah. I think this is a very good question, Hampus, because the components of this question was also raised before, what is what? What's cost? What's capital? What's everything? I think there are three components that we're actually looking at. And if you think about it, going from 12 to 15, let's just that take that Nordea as an example. Of course, it's not difficult to calculate what does that actually mean in terms of net profit? What does it mean in terms of pre-provision profit? So, if you just do that math, you would approximately come to some sort of number of &#x20AC;1 billion or so in pre-tax profit. And &#x20AC;1 billion is approximately 20% of our cost structure and taking out 20% of the cost structure is not likely to lead to sustained income level.</p>
          <p>So, the question, is this going to be done purely by cost? No, of course not; it's not going to be. Is it going to be done purely by risk-weighted assets? No, that's not possible, because it would indicate a 25% decline. So, of course, it's a mix of all the three components; it's both income, it's cost and it's about capital efficiency. And finding that balance is exactly what we're trying to do to maintain the strong momentum we have in the income side. And of course here the interest rate increase is that we're looking that going forward is part of the equation together with all the other initiatives.</p>
          <p>And you mentioned specialty pricing, I don't think its realistic to assume that we can assume whatever cost that has been already coming in terms of funding cost and of course future capital cost whatever, we can not just do assume that everyone sits still and we'll just price that into the market.</p>
          <p>So, pricing is of course not the solution only. It is about cost in capital. However, it's extremely important that we are good at doing pricing and understanding what is the cost of a product? What's the profitability of a customer and how do we price ancillary versus lending et cetera. So, pricing strategy and price consciousness and maybe discipline, if I should put it that way, is one of the components, but not all of it, far from all of it.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Rickard and then Magnus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions on the funding side. You issued &#x20AC;12 billion of long-term funding in the first quarter. Could you remind us as your maturities during 2011 and if you plan to continue to issue at this pace throughout the year? And if you could give any indication of how much it impacted NII this quarter and if you expected to continue to impact? And finally, of this &#x20AC;12 billion, if I understood the text correctly, &#x20AC;4 billion was covered and &#x20AC;8 billion in unsecured. And we sort of have two camps in the market currently that you split between both senior secured and covered. And one bank reported today that is only doing recovered, so if you could give your view on that issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think gladly do that. The first question is basically about redemption. So we have about approximately &#x20AC;15 billion or so this year in redemption. So, given that fact you can take from that we have actually pre-funded quite a lot. We have been very active in the first quarter and it's not about that level for the rest of the year. So, of course, it's been very heavy in the first quarter. And the reason is basically that due to many factors, we're not necessarily positive on this spread cost for sovereign debt reasons and also to different things, so we have utilized the moment of Q1 to be very active in the funding market.</p>
          <p>Now we've done a lot of senior unsecured and, to a lesser degree, covered bonds. And the rest of the funding for this year will be much focused on the covered bond market. And of course here, as we talked about, quite a lot last year, the Norway more than &#x2013; in Norway and Finland and new cover bond programs with the core element. So, we are able to use that platform together with the strong Swedish and of course the Danish programs to continue to issue.</p>
          <p>So it's a very, very good funding situation for us. And we have been very active in the first quarter. You should not expect that activeness and much more focused on covered bond going forward.</p>
          <p>Your last question was relating to the net interest income and actually alluded to quite briefly. It has had an impact, as we saw, in treasury. There is an impact on it, but it is not huge. So, the spread cost is actually quite small, is only &#x20AC;3 million as I mentioned before. So it's not been very, very significant impact on NII this quarter. It has an impact but not huge.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a lag impact into the second quarter, maybe into this...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Not, not major, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then, we move to Magnus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a follow-up on the risk-weighted assets where you say you expect to mitigate, the negative effects for new regulations by number of factors. Just how much do you expect the transition from IRB foundation into RBA advanced, what kind of impact do you expect from that on your risk-weighted assets?</p>
          <p>And secondly, do you expect to offset roughly all depository impact on risk-weighted assets by these measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not given system information on our estimate did impact on this. Advanced, IRB, I guess. So &#x2013; of course it's not so clear cut that what type of approval and provisions for approvals that the banks will get under this circumstance, if so then therefore it's meaningless to give any kind of figure. But of course, when we're doing that we expect that that's a positive impact.</p>
          <p>Then weather our plans is RBA efficiencies and optimization is planned to cover all the additional needs coming from new regulation in a way that also remains to be seen. We have not did any kind of specific targets, but of course that is the direction we are thriving at, because we see lots of this type of and not only easy wins are this kind of efficiency, so that we just see that we are able to track all collaterals we have and take down this unused credit limits and all that which is easy.</p>
          <p>But then of course, the main impact that will come then that how we for example, start to alter our business models to create more and more ROE. And then you have already seen that during the start, if you saw our corporate Nordea bank in figures, so that various different examples and although lending and also risk-weighted assets have been stable, actually a little bit even down, but of course the rate in migration. But the total income has been 14% up during year-on-year level. And as that is definitely in a way that of our model also to go forward, so that we are not especially in that segment targeting for any kind of lending fully gross risk-weighted asset grows. We're trying to let's say be as efficient as possible like with ROE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just being specific about those just grow to a new normal that is supposed to have to take less than five years. But, do you foresee any possibilities you have actually have seen net reductions either in capital or in costs over this period or is it just that we'll grow lower than the top line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we alluded to and also Christian said, it's a little premature to give exact cost or risk-weighted asset or capital targets at this stage. We'll be back with that later when things are somewhat more clear. We have initiated a lot of actions and we're working with lot of actions, and that's why its easy for us to be able to say that we will manage our cost growth down going forward both in 2011 and of course also 2012. So, exactly if we're able to reduce cost from a total level, we'll be back to those comments.</p>
          <p>Capital generation, of course, will &#x2013; of course if we succeed with what we are set out to do will be strong. So, exactly how we will manage our total capital as we go forward, it's also something we will have to come back to. I think one of the three requisites of actually even understating and being able to calculate that question is to understand what should the capital policy be like.</p>
          <p>Now, we are 10.7 is that where we need to be or is it 11 or is it 10.5 or 10, again it's still very difficult to say. So those kinds of questions relating to capital usage and of course also capital distribution is something that we have to come back to when things are more clear.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When will it come back about the cost guidance, because that's irrelevant of whatever Basel and other authorities come up with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure, of course, and as I said, we will come back later &#x2013; later in the year, but we are &#x2013; we've given you pretty much a pretty good hint here and saying we will manage our cost growth clearly down from where it is today so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So you introduced a new, old US target maybe?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The old US target may come back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is an old target. That obvious that's key, I mean we want to maximize the difference between the revenue growth and the cost growth, that's obvious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's part of that calculation, that balance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. And as we show before, we have a very strong business momentum and it's key not to lose that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it should be pretty well. I mean, even on the capital side, I mean I guess it's quite clear that if you want to be conservative of Nordic bank at 12% Core Tier 1, that should be adequate, even whatever we have to say and so on. And you should know very well what kind of internal measure we can do, how much you will improve that ratio by those measures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we have a good knowledge about a lot of different things. Of course we know roughly what the mathematical impact or mechanical impact, put it that way of Basel III and of course CRD III. We know that and we have a rough &#x2013; reasonably good idea on what we can do in terms of capital efficiency in a number of different things.</p>
          <p>So yes, we are fully aware of what we can do, and of course, what &#x2013; part of that story is the strong equity generation that we are capable of, so that's &#x2013; there are a lot of things we do know. I think we also know roughly what we can do and the balance between cost and of course income. So there are a lot of different things, but it's extremely important to strike the balance between income, cost and the capital efficiency side.</p>
          <p>We don't want to lose the customer momentum, we have gained a lot in terms of customer recognition, customer CSI and of course other good parts of our business that the platform has generated. So we want to maintain that and find that balance. And of course, as we are more knowledgeable ourselves on exactly the detail activities, of course, we will report that to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should not be too focused on the Core Tier 1, per se, and the regulation because obviously, we have a much bigger balance sheet than the Tier 1 capital. And for us it's important that we optimize the balance between all kind of instruments or from core equity, CoCo's, Tier 2 instruments whatever, so we basically have as low a WACC as possible, that's the overall target. And then perhaps the regulation is not the hurdle, it could be other things as well, which we don't know. Jan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Couple of questions. First, on a high level, what would you see as the main drawback if the Nordea legal entity moved to Finland? What would be the main drawback with that or would you say that as a completely impossible outlandish move, given what we see today of course in the regulatory environment? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is detailed one thereon, the way you account for the private equity investments and the Pandora stake, et cetera, have you changed that this quarter in any way, so we have seen reduction, you had a 20% discount on your market value on that investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me first ask &#x2013; try and answer the question of Finland. It's not a subject that we're discussing where to sort of put our domicile. This is not an active discussion or even analysis that we're making. It's more of a general statement that we are of course a truly Nordic bank in the sense that we're evenly or more less at least or evenly distributed between the four Nordic countries.</p>
          <p>So, the domicile is not of a great importance for us. It's not &#x2013; it's not the topic of the year. The only &#x2013; and there has been statements made by of course the large shareholders that we can place the domicile of the Group wherever it's most attractive for the bank and for the shareholders. And of course that's a very valid statement.</p>
          <p>But it's not an active discussion or even a full process that we're going through. We're not looking at that. And of course, one of the very significant reason for not even being able to answer the question is basically we don't know what the future of the Danish regulatory framework or the political future in any of the Nordic country. So it's not a debate that we're &#x2013; it's not meaningful to even have that debate. We are domicile in Sweden. We expect to remain domicile in Sweden unless there are very, very clear advantages for the shareholders to do something else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question, we haven't changed the way of looking at alternative investments or private equity type of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have not disclosed at this juncture, so that has not been disclosed before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did that specifically on Q4 because we have this very exceptional movement in the fair value relating to Pandora as you will recall, and that's an investment part of XL3 which we happen to be the owner also, but we are not owner of Pandora. So we are normally not disclosing any sort of valuation principle to discount. We typically maintain always a conservative estimate of our possessions in that part and we have not changed that.</p>
