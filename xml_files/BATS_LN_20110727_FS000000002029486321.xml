        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I'm Nicandro Durante; I'm the Chief Executive of British American Tobacco. And with me this morning is Finance Director, Ben Stevens. Also, in the front row, there are a number of my colleagues, including Richard Burrows, Chairman; and John Daly, Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>This morning, we will be talking you through the half-yearly results, after which there will, as usual, be an opportunity for people in the audience to ask questions. And a warm welcome to those of you who may be listening on the conference call or watching via the webcast.</p>
          <p>The headline numbers don't always tell the full story, so we'll focus on the organic development, adjusting for one-off charges and the like. Our reading of the global markets, excluding China, the U.S. and India, suggests that the volume declines we have seen in recent years are now moderating. Industry volumes are down a little over 2%, which is an improvement of the 3%-plus declines we have seen during the recession years.</p>
          <p>Our volume, both reported and organic, was down 1%, which implies continued share growth. Our top 40 market volume share rose by 60 basis points. This also implies that our mix has continued to improve, and this is reflected in our organic premium volume, which rose 0.3%, while below premium was down 1.6%.</p>
          <p>The Global Drive Brands and our innovation strategy are the key drivers of mix improvements. With GDB's growing 11%, they now account for 31% of group volume. Group revenue rose 2%, but on an organic basis at constant rates of exchange, revenue grew by almost 7%, largely driven by continued good pricing momentum. The situation in Japan was also a factor, which I'll cover later.</p>
          <p>Adjusted profit rose 12% with all regions contributing to these good results. Organic growth at constant rates was 11%. The group operating margin improved by 340 basis points and Ben will comment on this later. Adjusted earnings per share rose 10%. The difference between the 10% increase in adjusted earnings per share and 12% increase in adjusted profit is mainly due to a higher tax rates. The income and dividend has been increased by 15% to 38.1 pence in accordance with our practice of paying out one-third of the prior year's total dividend. These are good numbers and we are on track for another very good year.</p>
          <p>Returning to the Global Drive Brands, the 11% growth followed the continued rollout of innovations, particularly capsules, re-lock packaging and nano king-size super-slim format. There were no significant contributions from brand migration to these results. Dunhill grew volume by 1% with good performances in Brazil, Taiwan, Russia, Romania and the GCC, offsetting the share loss in South Korea following the recent price increase.</p>
          <p>Kent continued its strong performance from Q1, up 16% in the first half following the strong performances in Japan, South Korea, Russia, Romania and Ukraine. Capsules volume continued to grow and Nanotek volume was up 10%.</p>
          <p>Lucky Strike volumes were up &#x2013; 8% with gains in Spain, Japan, Brazil, Germany, France, Italy and the Americas, with Click &amp; Roll driving volume and share gains. More recently, Lucky Strike has been launched in South Korea to compete with international brands in the 2,500 won value for money segment.</p>
          <p>Pall Mall grew 14% with a number of markets driving growth, in particular Pakistan, where it more than doubled its volume. This has helped to offset decline in Mexico and Spain.</p>
          <p>Looking at the volume and revenue in more detail, we saw  organic volumes ahead 14% &#x2013; ahead 1%, sorry, in Asia Pacific; down 5% in Americas; marginally down in Western Europe; and marginally ahead in EEMEA. Higher volumes were recorded in a number of top 40 markets, including Pakistan, Vietnam, Poland, Romania, Egypt and Nigeria. Japan showed a sharp increasing volume due to disruption of domestic production following the tragic events in March. The additional Japanese volume accounted for 0.5% movement on group volume.</p>
          <p>Organic volume declined in the Americas region due to declines in industry volumes in some key markets. Revenue, however, in both constant and current terms, remained strong.</p>
          <p>Western Europe saw a very slight overall decline in organic volume, with growth in Romania and Poland offset by declines in Italy and Spain. Our volume share in the region grew by 0.5 share point. Although reported revenue was down 12%, organic revenue, adjusting for the loss of Gauloises and the sale of Lyfra would have been flat at constant rates.</p>
          <p>EEMEA reported a 7% improvement in revenue at constant rates on the back of a strong pricing and improved mix.</p>
          <p>Each of the regions contributed to the group's 11% growth in organic operating profit. In Asia Pacific, the strong performances from Japan and Indonesia were partly offset by lower profits in Pakistan, South Korea and Vietnam. Pricing in Brazil and Mexico were the main drivers behind the Americas 9% increase in profits. The strong performances in Germany, Switzerland and Romania were partially offset by declines in Denmark, Italy and Spain.</p>
          <p>Organic profit growth in Western Europe was 2%. Profits in EEMEA saw good performance in Russia, Middle East, South Africa and the absence of the currency restatement in Uzbekistan, which affected half one last year.</p>
          <p>Looking at some of the markets in more detail. In Australia, industry volumes were impacted by the steep excise increase last year. However, profit improved due to pricing, cost savings and the favorable exchange rates, despite last year's strong first half following excise shocks in Q2 2010. In Japan, following the tragic events in March and the disruption of domestic production by Japan Tobacco, the management team did a remarkable job in air-freighting shipments to supply retailers.</p>
          <p>This resulted in an increase &#x2013; in a significant increase in volume and in share during the second quarter, although we expect Japan Tobacco to recover a substantial part of its share in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In Korea, we led the price increase at the end of April, the first in over six years. Volume and share were impacted because the profit increase &#x2013; the price increase was not followed by all competitors. Profit was down as a result of lower volumes and higher marketing spend.</p>
          <p>And in Brazil, higher pricing, an improved product mix and favorable exchange helped increase profits, with share gains continuing in the premium segment.</p>
          <p>In Canada, profits improved but volumes were impacted by rising illicit trades, particularly in Ontario, where we have a higher market share.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, industry volumes declined sharply as a result of excise-led price increases. Market share was flat on last year, but profits improved, driven by pricing and lower operating expense.</p>
          <p>In Italy, our market share has stabilized. However, despite an improved product mix, coupled with a price increase and lower costs, profits decreased as overall industry volumes declined.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, profits increased in Germany, France, Switzerland, Romania, Poland and the UK.</p>
          <p>In Spain, market share rose strongly, driven by Lucky Strike and Pall Mall. Industry volumes were lower, following the excise increase in December, and profits deteriorated following the price war that began in May.</p>
          <p>Market share grew in the majority of EEMEA markets. Russia continues to perform well, with higher volume, profit and market share. In South Africa, we strengthened our market share and volumes were higher which, combined with exchange rate benefits, resulted in good growth. Despite the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, this area continued to perform well with an increase in volume and share.</p>
          <p>Turkey continues to suffer from illicit trade post the 2010 excise increase and competitor pricing. However, both Pall Mall and the recently launched Lucky Strike performed well, helping to offset volume losses in the tail brands. Profits continue to be impacted by lower volumes and price reductions, despite an improved product mix and cost savings.</p>
          <p>That brings us to the end of divisional review. I will now hand over to Ben.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nicandro, and good morning, everyone. For the benefit of those still wading through the earnings release, can I draw your attention to the appendix on page 37? There you'll find a reconciliation of reported revenue and profit from operations to the organic movements at constant exchange rates. This appendix should answer many of the questions asked at these presentations.</p>
          <p>As mentioned at our 2010 full-year presentation, we're now focusing on margin expansion rather than gross cost-saving targets. This is obviously notwithstanding the fact that cost savings are a major contributor to margin expansion.</p>
          <p>The near 7% growth in revenue and 12% growth in operating profit have seen the group's operating margin rise from 33.7% to 37.1%. On an organic basis, the growth was an impressive 1.9%. I'm pleased to note that each of the regions have reported improvements in operating margin.</p>
          <p>Let me caution you that the operating margin for the first half is invariably higher than the year as a whole. The phasing of marketing and other spend tends to be weighted more towards the second half of the year. The sale of the Lyfra distribution business in Belgium and the loss of Gauloises Blonde in Germany have also enhanced Western Europe's margin.</p>
          <p>Excluding these businesses, the region's underlying margin would have risen from 32.9% to 33.3%. On an organic constant currency basis, group operating margin would increase from 35.2% in the half year of 2010 to 36.7% in the half year 2011.</p>
          <p>I'm confident that we'll comfortably reach our 35% margin target this year, one year ahead of schedule. With continued tight control of costs and further cost-reduction initiatives, we aim to increase the group operating margin as we've done in recent years by 50 to 100 basis points a year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the income statement. Adjusted profit from operations grew 12% to &#xA3;2,760 million. Restructuring costs were relatively low, &#xA3;40 million and mainly related to factory closure and downsizing activities in a number of markets including Denmark, Poland, Italy and Turkey, and the continued integration activities in Indonesia. Unadjusted profit from operations grew 18% to &#xA3;2,691 million.</p>
          <p>I'll cover net finance costs on the next slide. Associates were 38% higher at &#xA3;329 million. For the purposes of the adjusted earnings per share calculation, the adjusted contribution from Associates is &#xA3;9 million higher at &#xA3;315 million, which has been affected by the weakness of the U.S. dollar and Indian rupee against sterling. The adjusted profit from Associates was up 8% in constant currency terms. Profit before tax was 22% higher at &#xA3;2,787 million.</p>
          <p>Net finance costs were marginally higher at &#xA3;233 million, with lower gains on derivative contracts largely offsetting higher investment income. The underlying tax rate, based on an adjusted profit, is 31.4% against 30% last year. This is higher than our previous guidance of 30% to 31%, due to a change in mix of profits, decreases in income arising in the UK, increases in some statutory tax rates and an increase in the effective tax rate in Brazil. My guidance for this year is now around 31% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Profit for the period rose 21% to &#xA3;2,006 million and the non-controlling interest charge rose 5% to &#xA3;136 million. The adjusted earnings per share is 96.1 pence per share, an increase of 10%.</p>
          <p>The two key drivers of adjusted earnings per share growth were operating profit, which was up 11%, and the higher effective tax rate reduced earnings by 2%, with all other drivers broadly cancelling each other out.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow rose &#xA3;202 million to &#xA3;2,104 million, reflecting the growth in the underlying operating performance. The growth in cash flow was offset by higher tax outflows of &#xA3;198 million, largely due to higher taxable profits, timing differences and a tax credit received in 2010. Also, another &#xA3;32 million in dividends were paid to non-controlling interests, mostly in Brazil and Malaysia. All of this resulted in free cash flow of &#xA3;956 million, 4% below the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Dividends paid to shareholders rose 13% to &#xA3;1.6 billion. The share buyback program that bought 13 million shares to date at a cost of &#xA3;335 million, of which &#xA3;317 million have been paid out by the 30th of June.</p>
          <p>And finally, net debt, which has increased from &#xA3;7.8 billion at the start of the year to &#xA3;9.3 billion at the 30th of June. Apart from the net cash flow already explained, there's an adverse foreign exchange impact of &#xA3;332 million due to the weakness of sterling.</p>
          <p>That's the end of the presentation, and I'll hand back to Nicandro for some final remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ben. In summary, we are on track for another good year. Our growth strategy's delivery, constant organic revenue growth at 7% reflects improving volume trends and continued good pricing momentum, despite the order skirmish here and there.</p>
          <p>We are achieving share growth driven by our Global Drive Brands and the roll-out of innovations across all four regions. The productivity element of our strategy's delivery was evidenced by the continued improvement in operating margin. We are pursuing some acquisitions and recently announced a deal in Colombia. And looking further out, we have set up Nicoventures to explore new nicotine technologies. And those of you who saw our R&amp;D facilities in Southampton, you have seen the fascinating work we are doing harm reduction.</p>
          <p>So, let's start with your questions. Please remember to state your name and firm for the benefit of the webcast.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, can I start with--? Yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Erik Bloomquist, Berenberg. Japan was really a big help in the first half. Could you comment on the outlook in the second half and in particular on your outlook for the underlying volume decline in Japan? And secondly, I was wondering if you could comment on Turkey and in particular what the actual share loss was and what the mix now is between the international brands relative to the Tekel brands. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, the first question is about Japan and how the second half is going to play in terms of volume reduction. And the second question is about Turkey and what the size of the share losses we have there, and the size of our international brands in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Regarding Japan, if you look at the first quarter of this year, what we saw is that after the price increase in October last year driven by an excise hike, we saw a decline in the market playing around 17% to 18%. If you remember, at the beginning of the year, BAT was talking that our expectations was between 15% to 20%. So it's moving according to &#x2013; to expectation. So this is the &#x2013; this is what expect that's going to be Japan in 2011. Of course, when you look at the volume by players, it changes a lot because of what we saw with these tragic events in Japan in the second quarter. So, this is Japan. I hope that I answer your question.</p>
          <p>Regarding Turkey; Turkey, the share losses in Turkey, if I remember well &#x2013; I think that I have these here. We have lost this year against last year around 3 share points, still. And our international brands in Turkey, our market share in Turkey is around 24%. Out international brands are around 11.5%, so almost 50% of the portfolio nowadays.</p>
          <p>And of course, we are trying to strengthen our portfolio, looking at sustainability of the business for the mid, long term. We just launched innovations behind Kent, Kent Switch, which is performing quite well, so we are growing the premium segment, although from a low base, but we are growing. So we are growing the right segment.</p>
          <p>And we launched Lucky Strike in the mid-price, which is doing very well. But it's early reading, because we have this &#x2013; this launch it happened 10 weeks &#x2013; 8 weeks ago, so it's too early to say. But the first readings are quite good. So, we are building the portfolio for the future. And I believe that you have a turnaround in Turkey in the coming two years, two to three years, similar process that we went through in Mexico that's bringing results right now. Yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. Two questions, I'll just follow-on on Japan firstly. Can you give us a feel for what your average share for the first half in Japan was and what it is currently? And the second, a question on Lucky Strike. In Western Europe, I've been used to thinking of Lucky Strike as a brand in the mid-price or below premium and in the Cantos interview, Nicandro, you referred to its very good performance in the low-price segment in Spain. I note that it's only about $0.10 now above Pall Mall. Has the positioning of Lucky Strike in Western Europe changed and can we expect in markets where it's still &#x2013; is in that mid-price territory, like Germany, to see Pall Mall adjusted downwards over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first questions about Japan and asking about our share and I think that's mainly due to the out of stock situation that we saw in Japan. And the second question is about price positioning in Lucky Strike and focusing on what I said in the Cantos interview, which I don't think that I said about low-price there, but I'll cover this.</p>
          <p>Regarding Japan, our average share is &#x2013; I think that's very difficult to look at the share in Japan from the shipment point of view. Because there are a lot of movements after the price increase in terms of stock levels, inventories and things like that.</p>
          <p>What I like to read is the off-take share in the convenience channel that covers 65% of the market and this is a very good reading, because this is consumption. It's not shipments. Because when you go to shipments, you see big difference; four or five share points in a given month just because inventory. So I like to look at off-take share convenience. That's a good reading when you have a normalization of the market, you can say so without all these issues. You see that there is a good relationship between convenience share, off-take share and shipment in a longer period of time.</p>
          <p>So convenience share for BAT Japan in the first &#x2013; in April, May and June, which were the months most affected, we had 20.8% in April, we had 18.7% in May, and you have 16.2% in June. So the second quarter, we have 18.4% share on average. I have to say that we left 2010 with 10.7 share points in Japan, and we were growing the first quarter of the year before the &#x2013; tragic events that we saw in Japan. So it's very difficult to differentiate what's just out-of-stock situation, what's share growth. It's just a word of caution here. But we were growing before that. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question about Lucky Strike. Well, Lucky Strike has been positioned below premium throughout the world. That's the situation. It happens everywhere in the world. So we don't have many markets in which Lucky Strike is positioned in the same price point as a brand like Dunhill that's a premium brand.</p>
          <p>So it's below premium; depends on the market, the elasticity in the market; depends on the price point is in the market. It can be moving towards premium or a little bit lower than premium. So it's the situation in Japan that &#x2013; Japan, basically we have a low-price brand, and then we have mid-price brands and premium brands. And Lucky Strike is exactly in the middle. It's what they call the medium-price brand.</p>
          <p>But overall, what we see around the world is below premium is the position of Lucky. I don't foresee &#x2013; I don't see &#x2013; that we are going to change our strategy, as you said, in Western Europe. No, I don't see anything like that for Lucky Strike. I think that we have the brand position where it should be. Yes? Roger?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is to Ben. Looking at the P&amp;L, Ben, I've noticed that the raw materials and consumables line &#x2013; the value, it was substantially lower than last year. So, I was just wondering if a bigger crop in Brazil resulted in better leaf costs, or was there any other factor -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you have to look at the organic costs. This is the schedule at the end of the announcement, because in there you've got all the raw material costs from leaf for the last year. So, I'd guide you to look at the difference between revenue and operating costs in the organic constant currency schedule, and there you'll find the costs are growing quite normally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:17). A couple of questions. First of all, the &#x2013; I think, a couple years ago, we were set with the end of the factory restructuring move towards more in terms of implementation of better working capital. The costs of restructuring would start to decline a bit. But the restructuring costs certainly on a cash basis still seem to be quite high. And I was wondering whether we should expect those to decline over time.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just regard to the &#x2013; we've obviously had a significant roll-out of the sort of capsule volume. Can you actually quantify how much of volume these days is capsule-related and how that's grown in the last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have two questions. The first one is about the costs of factory restructuring and if it is going to decline over time or not. And the second is the cost of roll-out of innovations, especially capsules. Ben?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, should I do the factory costs? The exceptional costs coming in from factory closures have gone down, and we have closed &#x2013; the major restructurings have already been done. That doesn't mean there aren't any more factories to close, there are still a couple more that need to be closed.</p>
          <p>But the major factory restructuring is done. We see a sort of temporary lull in adjusting items at the moment, but you've got to remember after that, there are still other initiatives to improve our operating margin. So we've got the implementation of our target operating model. There'll be exceptional costs related to that. We've got one SAP coming in, so there'll be some write-off costs of existing software as a result of that.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't envisage a substantial reduction in adjusting items going forward in the next four or five years, but you are seeing a sort of change in the nature of them from the factory closure and restructuring-type costs to the next phase of cost reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will a lot of those be non-cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Some of them will be cash. Some of them won't be cash; I mean some of them will be writing off things like existing software, but there will be cash costs in there in terms of, say, redundancies as we move people into shared service centers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the costs of capsules, in terms of rolling out of innovation, I wouldn't be able to precise to you what's exactly costs of capsules and we can work on this after this conference call, but let me -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The percentage of volume in capsules?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah &#x2013; yes, what I can tell you is that costs are coming down, because as much as you roll-out capsules and roll-out of innovation in our portfolio, because of the volume, costs will come down. But I think that if you look at, in terms of contribution &#x2013; the contribution, we believe that is positive. So, capsules do not add cost; although it does not hurt our margins, because through the capsules implementation we grow volume and in some of the case, we take prices up.</p>
          <p>An example of that, in some of the markets such as Korea, we are taking prices up. So the benefit in margin is positive. So we are rolling out innovation, not with the objective of &#x2013; have additional volume. It's just to have a better margins, and this is happening. So it's very difficult to precise to you the additional cost in capsules. We can work on this to you, but I've been saying margin terms is positive.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Martin Deboo from Investec. Two questions, one on the margin now and one on working capital. Nicandro, you've cautioned that the second half was traditionally less progressive on margin than the first. That effect last year wasn't that big. How would you expect this year to play out? Can you give us some color on that? And the second one, Ben, is working capital is quite well up at the half year, so the implication is working capital base has grown. Why and what's the outlook on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me take both those. Margin's up at the half year, which is good news, obviously. But our spends, as I said in the presentation, isn't evenly spread between the first half and the second half. If you go back to the organic margin for last year, you'll find that the half year margin was about 1% higher than margin was for the full year. And I don't expect it'll be substantially different this year. So margin for the full year will be lower than margin at the half year. But we're still confident of hitting the target this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of working capital, working capital always grows at the half year because of the leaf purchases we do. And you're not really seeing anything unusual in working capital this year, simply just the higher cost of leaf coming through the balance sheet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Adam Spielman from Citi here. Two questions, or maybe three, depending how you count them. Just very quickly, can you say how your market share in the T-40 markets are doing &#x2013; don't have to give any figures? Can you just say how that's moved? That would be lovely.</p>
          <p>Secondly, perhaps more importantly, volume trends seem to be improving. I was wondering in the next 6 and 12 months, looking forward, you would expect those volume trends to continue to get better. And as they get better, do you think the very strong pricing mix that we've seen will continue or do you think it will ease off a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question is about how is our market share in the top 40 markets and the second one is about volume trends in the next six months and the third one is about pricing mix with the volume trends changing.</p>
          <p>Looking at the market share in the first six months, Adam, we grew in the top 40 markets, 0.6%. Last year, there was &#x2013; we were growing 0.4%. You have to consider that the points has been influenced by Japan. If you take Japan out of these numbers, then Japan influence is around, I think, that's around 0.2%, 0.3%. So, it's almost half of that.</p>
          <p>So we're still growing market share strongly and in the top 40 markets. Look at the volume trends; first half of last year, we are talking about a little bit over 3%. Overall the industry declined outside China, U.S., and India. And this year, in the first half of the year, we are talking about 2%, so it's improving. So the rate of organic decline is moderating.</p>
          <p>How do I see this playing out for the rest of the year and for the following? As we said in the May Investors Day, I think that's very difficult to predict how the volumes are going to play, because at the end of the day, it's all about the economy. So the economic recovery in the countries, unemployment rates and everything related to that. So it's very difficult to predict.</p>
          <p>What I can say is that our expectation is that &#x2013; this moderating terms of &#x2013; this moderation in terms of decline will continue. But with what rate is very difficult to predict, so I wouldn't be able to answer that in the next 6 months or 12 months.</p>
          <p>Regarding pricing mix, we have a very good pricing momentum. And as you could see, our mix has been quite &#x2013; our pricing mix has been quite solid. I'd like to point out that mix has been an important component, even more important component for BAT, because it's all about the strategy that you are driving. As I said during my speech, we are growing volumes in the premium segments and decline in the sub-premium segments, what improves the mix. So, Global Drive Brands are growing 11%, most of them, more in the premium segment than anything else. So mix has been a very important factor of that.</p>
          <p>I believe that if you look at short term, of course, the second half probably is not going to be as strong as the first half because, obviously, you have the timing of the price increases during the year. And as you saw in the last year, in 2010 or in 2009, usually the first half in terms of price mix is a little bit stronger than the second half. So I think that if you look at the last five years, price mix has been around 5.5% to 6%, so it seems a good number for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow up on that? Are you able to say what price mix would have been somehow excluding Japan, because Japan is such a strange situation, both in terms of the magnitude of the price rise and the strange volume effects?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think Nic had asked me the same question as we did a quick calculation outside. I'm come out at rough sort of 6% rather than the 7.5% we've got in the half year, but that's a pretty rough estimate.</p>

          <p>Thank you. With respect to margins in your guidance, you've changed your margin guidance from 35% by 2011 &#x2013; or by 2010 &#x2013; I'm sorry, 2012, and you moved it forward again this year. You said it will be a little bit more than 35%. What changed in order for you to have a better margin performance or should we just read that you guide very conservatively?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think we're comfortable we'll hit the 35% margin target this year. But I did caution people that the second half won't be as high as the first half, of course. I think it's a &#x2013; as we said at the presentation before, the objective is really to grow margins by 50 to 100 basis points a year. And I'm confident that we can continue to do that.</p>
          <p>Some years we'll do better, like this year. Other years, we won't do quite so well. Sometimes you get the mix effect coming through as well, so constant currency margin growth is not quite the same as current margin growth as well; but between 50 and 100 basis points a year. I've been sort of toying with whether to announce a new margin target, but I think 50 to 100 basis points a year and multiply by the number of years you want and you get the target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question relates more to a year ago. Your margin guidance for '011 was 150 basis points below what you would likely hit. My question is what additional costs &#x2013; did you accelerate cost savings? Was there differences in the business versus your expectations? So maybe just trying to understand why are you overachieving so much relative to what you told us a year ago on the margin front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, Japan makes a difference in terms of the extra volume and profit coming through from Japan. We're driving pretty hard on cost savings, obviously. I think when you get a situation, say, in Western Europe where you've got pretty tough price competition, that focuses the mind on taking costs out. And also remember, we've restructured the businesses from before we announced those original margin targets; so selling Lyfra was a help, that was a lot of turnover and hardly any profit; and the phone cards business in Brazil as well made a difference.</p>
          <p>So, it's a part of sort of corporate restructuring; it's a part of responding to aggressive price competition where we find it. And it's partly just the ongoing cost reduction process.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank again. Can I ask a question about Korea? With regard to your own pricing initiative in Korea, one of your competitors said last week, something along the lines of, nice try but the timing is wrong. Have you taken a decision yet to pull prices back down? And are you hopeful that you might persuade the government to put in train a more progressive excise policy which makes price increases in the future more likely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me talk about Korea. That's a very hot topic at the moment. We took the prices up in Korea because we think that's the right decision; it's the right thing to do, not only for BAT but for the industry. We haven't seen a price increase in Korea for more than six years. And I &#x2013; we don't think that is sustainable.</p>
          <p>Costs are going up, costs of doing business are going up, and we didn't think that was sustainable. The whole BAT strategy is about driving value. It's driving innovation. So we think that it can take our brands up, and we think that we can gain market share with that.</p>
          <p>What's happened in Korea? As soon as we took the price up, as expected, we lose some share in the beginning. So if you look at the first two weeks after we had taken the prices up, we lost 3.5 share points in Korea. Since then, the good news is that the share has been stable. So what we are doing now is driving our innovation pipeline in Korea with several launches behind our Global Drive Brands, Dunhill and Kent.</p>
          <p>We just had one innovation come into Korea 10 days ago, and we have some others coming over. So, the point &#x2013; and also, we decided to approach the 2,500 won segment with Lucky Strike, which I have to say that after two weeks, the reading has been outstanding, has been excellent. So we have good expectations about the brand.</p>
          <p>So our expectation is that we are going to recover the share, making more money, which looks very sensible. So this is the situation in Korea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you also need to remember that consumers equate price with quality in Korea. So there are risks of taking prices up in Korea. But there are also risks of not taking price up in Korea.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Spain, in your press release, you've called it a price war yourself. Could you maybe give us a little bit of your reading on Spain, has it stabilized? What is the scope for actually boosting the profitability in that market &#x2013; market from the current levels where it appears that the players are happy with the price differentials? And, you don't look &#x2013; maybe they're not happy. And then what are the risks of similar price wars or price skirmishes happening in other markets, if the players want to reposition brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, <mark type="ph" /> Nico (43:37). Regarding Spain, that's the question. Yes, we have a price war in Spain. The industry is &#x2013; the profitability of the industry today is lower than last year, the end of last year. So, it's just some way to go in terms of pricing to be at the same point that we were at the end of last year. You have to consider that you are not price leaders in Spain. We just have 12% market share, despite the fact that you have a very good performance on the back of Lucky Strike in what I call the mid-price segment.</p>
          <p>So we are doing well in Spain. We are growing volume. We are growing volume, we are growing share. We are growing profitability, from our base, of course, because we are not big in Spain. So we had this price war. The prices went back. And what I can say from the BAT point of view, we think that we have our brands positioned where they should be. So we are happy with our price positioning in Spain. I cannot talk about what the competitors think about their price position, but I have to say that we are quite happy where we are today, that's the first point.</p>
          <p>And I think that your point is about price war and how is the risk of this spreading to other countries around Europe, for example. I think that's going to be very difficult. And one of the reasons that we have the price war in Spain is because this excise system is almost 100% ad valorem. So the government pays part of the costs of a price war.</p>
          <p>So, we don't see &#x2013; we don't have the same excise mechanism in other countries in Europe. It's very difficult to have a price war when you have a high specific and the industry pays 100% of the bill. So we don't expect that is happening everywhere else. What's the next steps in terms of Spain? Well, as I said, we are not price leaders. We have to see what the competition is going to do. But as I said, industry profitability now is not &#x2013; is still at that same level that it was at the end of last year.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; that's &#x2013; I think that's the very question for them. It's not a very good question for us. I don't know. What I'm saying is that we cannot, with 12% market share, lead again a price increase. Don't forget that at the beginning of this year, everything started when BAT decided to take the prices up. We took the prices up in Spain and the response from the competition was not only to go back to the old price but went a little bit further.</p>
          <p>So we have no intentions to lead the price in Spain. We are not leaders in terms of price in there. We just have 12% market share; it's a good question to ask for the competition.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the case of Australia, as you probably have heard about, the government is keen to introduce plain packaging in 2012. It has sent a bill to the parliament and the parliament has refer to the Health and Aging Committee, which should analyze the bill, and you have 60 days to come back to the parliament with your recommendation. That should be in September. And if everything goes to plan according to the Australian government, it can become law at the end of this year. And it will be implemented in the middle of next year.</p>
          <p>It's very clear, our views about that. We don't think that the plain packaging in Australia is going to work. We don't think that's going to reach the public health goals that the government has set for themselves. And we will do everything we have in our reach, including looking for legal avenues to safeguard our assets, is everything that I can tell you about that.</p>
          <p>In terms of other countries, you have to consider that the majority of the countries around the world, in their constitution, they protect intellectual rights and property. And <mark type="ph" /> you (48:05) safeguard ours. So it's very difficult to talk country-by-country here, but we'll do everything that we have in our power to show to the governments that plain packaging does not work, and you have unintended consequence, such as increasing illicit rate. So we hope that you have our voices heard in Australia. We will do everything we can to submit our views to the committee in order to show to them how we see that's going to play out. Adam?</p>

          <p>A follow-up question, on innovation. Can you say roughly, you are rolling out capsules across the Global Drive Brands in multiple geographies. I was just wondering how far we are down that process? I mean, have you basically taken it &#x2013; to 80% of the brands in markets you want to take it to? Is it &#x2013; I suppose, how many more quarters have we got for this process to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is about rolling out of capsules. As I said at the beginning of the year when you have the full year's presentation, and there was a question about what's going to happen with innovation. I said we have a health pipeline of innovations still to come, but it's still a lot of work to do in order to roll out the current pipeline of innovation. So we have work for the next two to three years still &#x2013; answer your question. Some big markets still do not have capsules. We just introduced in places like Turkey, in Russia, in Brazil.</p>
          <p>But an innovation like capsules, it takes some time to mature and because this is not a promotion, this is a long-term strategy in terms of drive innovation. So as soon as we have capsules in a place like Russia, you take one year, 18 months for the consumers to understand the proposition and it start working. So there is a long way to go. I think that the next two to three years we have our hands full with rolling out capsules, re-lock. But you have some new stuff coming out in the market in the next, I hope, 18 months to 24 months as well.</p>
          <p>So a long way to go, it's just 12% of our -</p>

          <p>On innovation, Imperial rolled out a slide pack which is quite unique and I can see how consumers want to play with it. Are you seeing that product taking shape from your brands in market ways &#x2013; in market way that has been launched?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to answer a question like that, because it's not about what the competition does with innovation. Let me start by saying that when the competition announces innovation or announces a &#x2013; new developments for their brands, to be &#x2013; this is good for the industry, because then we can play with innovation, then we can play with brands. We don't need to play with prices.</p>
          <p>So we think that's good. But how this is going to play out, it depends a lot what we are going to do in the markets elsewhere with our brands at the same time. If the competition comes with innovation and we don't do anything, we don't do any innovation and we just sit and see, of course, you have an impact in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>But usually at the same time they introduce their innovation, we introduce ours. And we think that we have a much powerful &#x2013; much more powerful pipeline innovation, and I think that from the consumer point of view, I think that we have a better proposition. So at the end of the day, we &#x2013; we'll keep growing share, even when they roll out their innovation, because we roll out ours. And I think from the consumer point of view, ours are more powerful. That's our belief. It's for the consumers to answer the question.</p>
          <p>Okay. Can I have a final question? We are running out of time, or everybody's happy. Yes?</p>

          <p>Just a question quickly on Dunhill. A bit of a slowdown from the first quarter. Was it just South Korea, or were the other markets simply maybe weaker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The answer is that was just in South Korea. South Korea is quite a big market for Dunhill. And I have to say that Dunhill is probably the brand that grew everywhere in the world, with exception of South Korea. Because of the relevance of the South Korean numbers in the Dunhill numbers, you saw a small growth of 11 &#x2013; 1%. But the brand has done extremely well across the world, in places like the GCC, in places like South Africa, and Romania, everywhere, even in France; it's doing very well in Paris. So the brand is having an outstanding performance. And as I said, it was a conscious decision that we took in South Korea. We don't like to lose share, but it was a conscious decision, even though the brand is growing.</p>
