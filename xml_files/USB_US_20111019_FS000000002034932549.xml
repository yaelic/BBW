          <p>Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern time through Wednesday, October 26, at 12:00 midnight Eastern time. I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter 201 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared marks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that there are forward-looking made today during the call, and they are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.</p>
          <p>I will now the call over to Richard.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. I'd like to begin by saying that I'm very proud of our third quarter results. Our company achieved both record earnings and record total net revenue this quarter, along with positive operating leverage year-over-year and linked quarter. And we accomplished these results while facing the headwinds of a very challenging and uncertain economic environment.</p>
          <p>I'd like to point out a few of the highlights from our third quarter earnings, which are detailed on page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1.273 billion for the third quarter of 2011, or $0.64 per diluted common share. Earnings per share were $0.19 higher than the third quarter of 2010 and $0.04 higher than the prior quarter. We achieved record total net revenue of $4.8 billion this quarter, which was 4.5% higher than the same quarter of 2010 and 2.2% higher than the second quarter of 2011. Revenue was driven by growth in both net interest income and fee income.</p>
          <p>Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5%, or 4.5% excluding acquisitions. And we realized linked quarter total loan growth of 1.7%. Once again, we benefited from strong growth in average low-cost deposits, with balances increasing by 23.2% over the third quarter of 2010 and 4.7% over the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Credit quality continued to improve, as we posted a decline in net charge-offs of 10.4% and a reduction in nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, of 6.9% on a linked-quarter basis. Our capital position remains strong, as we continue to generate significant capital each quarter through earnings. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.1% at September 30 or 8.2% using anticipated Basel III guidelines, while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 10.8%. Finally, we repurchased 13 million shares of common stock during the third quarter. As a result, we returned 45% of our earnings to shareholder this quarter in the form of dividends and buybacks.</p>
          <p>The five-quarter trend of our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on the left hand of slide 4. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.57%, and return on average common equity was 16.1%, significantly better than the 1.26% and 12.8%, respectively that we reported last year.</p>
          <p>Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right side of slide 4. As expected, this quarter's net interest margin of 3.65% was lower than the same quarter of last year and the prior quarter. And Andy will discuss the factors that led to this change in a few minutes. As I mentioned at the start, we achieved positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis, leading to an improvement in our third quarter efficiency ratio. Our 51.5% efficiency ratio for the third quarter is consistent with our expectation that this ratio will remain in the low 50%'s going forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 5. As I previously noted, our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. Our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III guidelines at September 30 was 8.2%, well above the 7% Basel III level required in 2019. We have not yet received final regulatory guidance as to the amount of capital we will be required to hold as a systemically important financial institution, our SIFI buffer. Given our current capital levels, however, we are confident that we will able to meet those guidelines through internal capital generation once they are established. In the meantime, we will continue to return capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, eventually reaching our goal of returning 60% to 80% of our earnings.</p>
          <p>Average total loans outstanding increased by $9.7 billion, or 5% year-over-year and 4.5% adjusted for acquisitions. Significantly, new loan originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled over $46 billion this quarter, compared with approximately $37 billion in the third quarter of last year, representing a 25% increase in renewal and new activity. Specifically, total corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased by 16.8% year-over-year and 5.8% linked quarter, indicating that we continue to gain customers and market share, and we are well-positioned to meet the demand for loans once our customers are more confident in investing in their businesses as the economy recovers.</p>
          <p>Although you may think of our middle market and large customers when discussing new commitments, the numbers also include our small-business lending. We just announced this week that U.S. Bank has set a new company record for SBA loan approvals, with a total of $630 million for the SBA fiscal year-ending September 30. This represents a 123% year-over-year increase in loan approvals for our company, and SBA loans are just one piece of the small-business lending that we do. In fact, our branches grew non-SBA small-business average loans outstanding by over 12% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Total average deposits increased by $32.7 billion, or 17.9% over the same quarter of last year. Total average deposits grew by $6 billion on a linked-quarter basis, or 2.9%, with strong growth in corporate trust, consumer banking, and wholesale banking over both time periods. Our customers continue to hold historically high levels of cash, viewing our bank as a trusted, safe place to turn. Additionally, recently published FDIC market share data indicates that our company grew deposits significantly more than the U.S. markets as a whole. U.S. Bank grew deposits 15.8% between June 30, 2010, and June 30 of 2011, compared with the 6.8% growth rate for the total U.S. market, confirming that we have definitely increased our overall deposit market share.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 7, the company reported record total net revenue in the third quarter of $4.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% over the prior year's quarter and 2.2% over the previous quarter. The growth in revenue can be attributed to both our balance sheet and fee business lines, all of which have benefited from investments in many growth initiatives made throughout the downturn of the past three years, partially tempered, of course, by the impact of recent legislative and regulatory actions.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 8 and credit quality. Third quarter total net charge-offs declined by 10.4% from the second quarter of 2011, while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 6.9%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improvement in both measures.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 9. As the graph on the left illustrates, early- and late-stage delinquencies, excluding covered assets, have continued to improve overall and are actually returning to pre-2008 levels. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that the trend in criticized assets was also positive this quarter. Both of these statistics provide us with assurance that net charge-offs and nonperforming assets will trend lower in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>With those statistics in mind, please turn to slide 10. You can see that we recorded a provision for credit losses that was 78% of net charge-offs in the third quarter. This compares with the second quarter, when we recorded a provision that was 77% of net charge-offs. The continued improvement in our credit quality once again supported a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. But the amount of the reserve release was $25 million lower than the previous quarter. The reduction in the amount of the reserve release reflected the fact that the net charge-off levels for several consumer loan categories, particularly credit card and auto loans, are beginning to stabilize. The underlying quality of the wholesale loan book, however, is expected to continue to show incremental improvement in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Andy.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard. I'm going to take just a few minutes to discuss some of the details behind our record third quarter results.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 gives a full view of our third quarter 2011, compared to the prior quarter and the third quarter of 2010. Diluted EPS of $0.64 was 42.2% higher than the third quarter of 2010 and 6.7% higher than the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 lists the key drivers of the company's third quarter earnings. The 40.2% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a 4.5% increase in net revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 3.8% increase in noninterest expense year-over-year. Net income was 5.8% higher on a linked-quarter basis. This positive variance was the result of a 2.2% increase to net revenue, and a favorable variance in the provision for loan losses, both of which more than offset the 2.1% increase in expense quarter-over-quarter. With the exception of the $150 million reserve release, our third quarter results did not include any notable income or expense items that would have impacted the comparison of our year-over-year or linked-quarter earnings.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 13. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $147 million, or 5.9%. The increase was largely driven by the $34.4 billion, or 13.6% increase in average earnings assets, as well as the benefit from strong growth in low-cost deposits. The growth in average earning assets was driven by predicted increases in the securities portfolio, a higher cash position at the Federal Reserve, and an increase in average loans. The net interest margin of 3.65% was lower than the same quarter of last year due to the expected increase in low-yielding investment securities and the higher cash balances at the Fed.</p>
          <p>On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $80 million, the result of an $8.7 billion increase in average earning assets, and a 2 basis points decline in the net interest margin. The net interest margin was lower than the prior quarter due to the expected growth in lower-yielding investment securities, as the company continues to add liquidity on balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The investment securities portfolio at September 30 totaled $68.4 billion, and we expect the portfolio to reach $70 billion by year-end. We also expect to maintain the investment securities portfolio at or around that level for the foreseeable future, given current Basel III liquidity retirements.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 14, you can see more detail behind the change in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew by $9.7 billion, or 5% year-over-year. Excluding covered loans, which are slowly running off, average total loans increased by 7.6% over the third quarter of 2010. As indicated on the chart, the increase in average total loans was principally driven by solid growth in residential mortgages and total commercial loans, the latter of which grew by a very strong 11.9%. This was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in average commercial loans, and the growth has been improving each quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, the 1.7% increase in average loans outstanding was primarily driven by the increase in commercial loans, which grew by 4.6%, as well as residential real estate loans.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 tracks the growth in total deposits over the past five quarters. Average total deposits grew by $32.7 billion, or 17.9% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, the growth rate was 13.2%. On a linked-quarter basis, average deposits increased by 2.8%, or approximately 11% annualized.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 provides more details about the changes in noninterest income on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Noninterest income in the third quarter of 2011 was 2.9% higher than the third quarter of 2010. This variance was driven primarily by growth in payments revenue, deposit service charges, and commercial products revenue. These positive variances were partially offset by lower trust and investment management fees, principally the result of the sale of our long-term asset management business late in 2010, and mortgage banking revenue. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $25 million, or 1.2%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of higher payments revenue, deposits service charges, and mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by lower trust and investment management fees.</p>
          <p>Deposit service charges benefited this quarter from the rollout of our new checking account redesign, as well as higher transaction volumes, while mortgage banking revenue, which increased by $6 million linked quarter, reflected a strong increase in application volume, partially offset by the unfavorable variance in the net charge in the MSR valuation and related hedge.</p>
          <p>Recall that the new debit card pricing guidelines went into effect on October 1st. Under the new pricing, we expect to see a reduction in debit fee revenue of approximately $75 million in the fourth quarter related to this pricing change, which is consistent with our previous estimate of a loss of $300 million on a full-year basis based on our current portfolio and growth assumptions. As we have noted in the past, we expect to mitigate approximately one-third to one-half of the reduction in revenue related to all regulatory changes by modifying our checking account products and pricing, many of the changes to which are in process and partially reflected in the numbers this quarter. We do not, however, have plans at this point to assess a debit card fee.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 highlights noninterest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $91 million, or 3.8%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to higher compensation and benefits expense, occupancy, investments in affordable housing, and other tax-advantaged products, and an increase in professional services, primarily due to the foreclosure review project. The expense related to this project, about $25 billion per quarter, is expected to be in our run rate for the next few quarters, or until the foreclosure review is complete. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by $51 million, or 2.1% due to compensation, professional services, and marketing and business development expense. Finally, the tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis was 30.4% in the third quarter of 2011, equal to the second quarter of 2011, but higher than the 25.9% in the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 is included to provide updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase-related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. Note that we do not participate in the private placement securitization market. We expect mortgage repurchase activity to continue to moderate lower over the next few quarters. Our outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balances at September 30 was $115 million, compared with $123 million at June 30.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back to Richard.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I'll call your attention to slide number 19. To sum it up, we had a very good quarter. We grew both loans and commitments, and the overall credit quality of our portfolio continued to improve. We had excellent deposit growth and gained deposit market share. We grew both our balance sheet and our fee-based revenues and attained record total net revenue. We realized positive operating leverage and earned record net income. Our capital and liquidity position remains strong and growing, and we were able to return 45% of our earnings to our shareholders, and we once again achieved industry-leading performance metrics. All of this despite the challenges of a difficult and uncertain economic environment, further demonstrating the value of our company's diversified business model, prudent approach to risk management, and sound growth strategies.</p>
          <p>We're a bank. And we're proud to be a bank. On one hand, we're managing our business through a difficult and complex environment, which includes a fragile economy, increasing regulatory oversight, reputation risk, and competitive pressures. On the other hand, we're providing our customers &#x2013; consumers, small businesses, large corporations, institutions, and government entities &#x2013; with the products and services they need to achieve their own financial goals.</p>
          <p>We're in this together. And we're trying to strive to do our part. Not at the expense of others, but for the benefit of all our constituents, including customers, employees, communities, and shareholders. Our company has created momentum. By adhering to the disciplined business strategy and investing through the cycle, we've adapted and will continue to adapt to this changing environment with a focus on the future. We're positioned to win during a difficult and strong economic time.</p>
          <p>This concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill, and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.</p>

          <p>Hi, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of quick questions. Richard, we obviously saw pretty good across-the-board improvement in credit quality, and as well the delinquencies declining more than we're seeing with peers, which I guess is what gave you the confidence for your fourth quarter statement. How do you look at that in terms of increasing the pace &#x2013; or keeping or increasing the pace &#x2013; of reserve recapture from here? We're seeing a lot of banks that recaptured a lot of reserves in prior quarters and are actually slowing that down. You guys, on the other hand, are speeding that up. I'm just sort of wondering how you're thinking about that in your head. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ed. First of all, we're kind of &#x2013; we were last to kind of come into this, because our credit quality was better from the beginning, and so we probably never hit any kind of a peak. We're actually &#x2013; are starting now to come back down. So, I think we'll declare last quarter &#x2013; Quarter 2, the quarter before this one &#x2013; as probably the peak of reserve release at $175 million. But you'll still continue to see reserve release because we're not yet at our sustained credit-quality levels that we said over the course will be 1% in total charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Having said that, you'll note that we have a map that goes along with the development of our total loan loss provision, which includes a kind of a forward four-quarter arithmetic around what's happening to consumers, which is actually showing some stability now, reaching that point. And on commercial, it's much more lumpy and therefore, we kind of take it at 90-day increments. So, that's why we're comfortable that the consumer portfolio continues to show improvement with the delinquencies, forecasting improvement in total charge-offs, but that will continue to kind of slide &#x2013; soft landing, if you will &#x2013; into something more steady over the course of time. But commercial and commercial real estate are still lumpy and higher than they will be over the course, which also tells me we're not yet where we need to be.</p>
          <p>Going further, as I've told you before, we think this is about a 1% net charge-off over the course company, primarily because we have such a significant credit card portfolio. And I do predict that we will go below 1% in total charge-offs before we come back to it as we kind of over-swing as the economy will take to us that point. I've been pleading with the regulators and the accountants to let us as banks not miss this chance to soften the impacts of counter-cyclicality and allow us to determine what our over-the-cycle minimum level of loan loss provisions needs to be. And don't ask us &#x2013; don't force us &#x2013; to go beyond that, so that we all have to start building back loan loss reserves a couple years from now when we swing back. I'm not getting a whole lot of resonance, by the way, on my plea, but at least I'm still out there asking for it.</p>
          <p>But you can see this company is moving down toward the 1%. It doesn't happen in one quarter. You'll see the steady pace we have is probably what you could estimate over the next few quarters, and so reserve releases will continue until we hit that point where we think we've got a sustainable level of loan loss reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then to follow up, you talked about getting to that 60% to 80% total payout ratio in terms of buybacks and dividends. Is that something &#x2013; I know you got to go through the next round of capital assessments with the Fed, but is that something that you hope to get to as early as next year? And what is the kind of &#x2013; along with that, what is the kind of range of dividend payout ratio you're hoping to get to for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's a lot in there in there, right? As you said at first, I have to go through all the prescribed gateways to get what we want, but what we're going to be asking for in our stress test for the CCAR, which will happen at year's end, is an increase to our dividend that stays within our committed 30% to 40% and moves beyond what was last year's first CCAR test of maximum 30%. But we're going to stick with that 30% to 40% as a range against what we think is a reasonable forecast of earnings for this company. And of course, they'll put it against the very tedious stress test, which we do ourselves, by the way, and we can withstand a lot of stress.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, we'll let the other 30% to 40% move up as we do the buybacks, and we'll seek additional permission, although Andy will tell you here in a second, we have plenty left in our current permissions. And then what's left over, Ed, we put back into the company &#x2013; 20% to 30% &#x2013; in the form of organic investments, which you've all allowed us to do over the last few years, and/or acquisition opportunities that follow the same kind that we've been doing over the last few years.</p>
          <p>The only difference between now, and what we said, I don't know, five years ago was it used to be 80% to shareholders and 20% to the company. Now, we've given it more 30% to 40% of buybacks. 30% to 40% of dividends, and 20% to 40% of what could be investments that we don't want to miss through this challenging time. But I hope to get to 60% to 80% as soon as I can. And I suspect that if I were left to my own devices, I'd get there a little faster than I'm going to be allowed to, but next year would be a good target, and we'll see how close we can get.</p>
          <p>Andy, you might just cover a little more color on the remaining stuff.</p>

          <p>Right. So, Ed, we are at 8.2% Tier 1 common Basel III and above the level, Ed, in fact, that we think we need to be without the specificity of the SIFI yet here. So, yeah, we do expect to get back to that level in 2012, and we still have some buyback capacity remaining here in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. That's really helpful. And then just finally, any outlook in terms of the &#x2013; short-term outlook in terms of the net interest margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Ed, this is Andy again. So, the margin decrease on a linked-quarter basis was entirely due to our securities purchases. And on a year-over-year basis, it was entirely due to our securities purchases and the cash position at the Fed. You strip those two things out, and we were basically flat. So, we expect to continue to have securities purchases here into the fourth quarter, getting to that $70 billion, probably in the neighborhood of $3 billion or so. Simple math is every $1 billion is a basis point. So, I would expect the fourth quarter to be somewhere between 3 and 6 basis points down, depending upon the cash levels and the securities that I just talked about. And &#x2013; however, I would also say that I would expect net interest income to be up, just the same phenomenon you saw this quarter, which was margin was down, but net interest income was up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Ed, I'll add it to that. History lessons for everybody. Not that you asked for it. As you recall, about a year ago, we were given guidance by our regulators that our capital was quite sufficient and quite strong as it would relate to the Basel III levels of total common, but at the same time, we were given a nod that we needed to move up on our liquidity preparation to have this balance sheet more fortress ready. We've done that, and we're actually quite proud of it. And I don't think you've heard us ever even indicate it as a problem for this company to achieve, during which time we've been doing other things. We're glad we did it. I think the timing was quite good. I'm glad we're virtually done with that liquidity build. I think you'll see that there's a good, strong balance sheet with much more liquidity than before, and I'm glad we did in the last year when probably it was more financially beneficial to do than to have to start it now.</p>
          <p>So with that as the backdrop, we really positioned ourselves in every single way with belts and suspenders on being a very strong company, able to basically handle any kind of downturn that comes along. With that, we're hoping we'll get the permissions from the Federal Reserve to be recognized for that and allow us to move forward.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Can I ask a couple questions on cards, I guess, first? There's a lot of concern as the industry starts to grow again yields will get competed down. And your card book is up. It looks like it's up a little bit more than normal seasonality if I'm reading it right. But your yields are up as well. And I'm talking on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is there anything &#x2013; I guess what's driving the yields higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The yields have a little bit to do with the revolve rate, Brian, and then a little bit also to do with the reserve for credit there, which is improving on the interest margin. So, you think about the interest reversals as a reserve establish, and as credit gets better, that reserve gets better. So, that's a little bit of a factor. I think if you strip those two things out, the margin would be relatively flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess going forward, is the old 9.2% to 9.3% the run rate, or is the new 9.6% the right run rate to think about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit's going to depend on the revolve rate on a go-forward basis, but I expect it to moderate down just a bit, because, again, we did see some improvement in that reserve component that improved the rate this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you referenced the 1% normalized charge-off rate for the company, which &#x2013; at least when you first presented it back at the investor conference a year ago now &#x2013; had a 5.5% credit card charge-off rate. Do you still feel like that's the normal level, or &#x2013; obviously we're going to be below that for a while here. Is there some argument that the new normal for cards is lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're certainly not a 5.5% credit card. Right now, you see us in the mid-4%'s in the credit card. And I think that's probably the kind of sustainable level you can expect. It will bounce up and down, depending on number of days in the quarter and seasonality of spending trends, but I think you will see of course, all of our portfolios &#x2013; they're at the high quality. We don't have anything, but prime in our portfolio. We have some joint issuances with people like Kroger, and we have some co-branded cards with REI and others like that, but they perform very, very well. So, Brian, I think you'll see us over the course have 4%-ish kind of a credit card charge-off, but we'll continue to grow that book, and it does affect the total 1%, because it's a fairly significant part of our total charge-offs, but we think that's the right mix and probably right quality to go after. And we're not going to get greedy and try to reach further back and change the underwriting that we have under credit cards as the world gets maybe a little bit better. We're going to stick with our old knitting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I'll just add, remember the 1% was more of a through-the-credit-cycle type number. So, it's not at any given point in time, and now we're a fairly stable unemployment. So, that's why we're seeing the good results right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I could ask one last one on the same theme. I mean, just the overall competitive environment in cards, as well as the data you get to see from a spending perspective in terms of the health of the consumer &#x2013; how would you characterize both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would tell you &#x2013; I was looking for Bill. I thought he was going to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would tell you that we've got a couple of things that give us insight to the consumer behavior. They, first of all, Brian, are &#x2013; they're husbanding cash on the deposit side, and they're very, very careful using their money on the credit side. So, we expect to see same-store sales be a pretty good proxy for the kind of increase we'll have in balance sheet as the season starts to heat up for the holidays, and then they'll pay it back down. People are using their cash before they're using ours, so that's why you'll see kind of a moderate use of credit cards.</p>
          <p>But our insight says that those that are creditworthy are actually pretty comfortable with their ability to use the charge card and to pay it down pretty quickly. And we don't have anybody in our portfolio that isn't creditworthy, because we didn't have them in the first place, and anybody who's on the margin, we've since charged it off and haven't underwritten anybody new since. You won't go to your mailbox and see a ton of U.S. Bank direct mail. We do a lot of this origination through our direct customer contact through branches and call centers and online. We deal mostly with customers we know or have other relationships. And if we do extend it, it's through these partnerships with other very high-quality companies that we've earned a sense of trust.</p>
          <p>You may have seen the other day, we introduced a new idea with REI where a customer can go into REI, make application for a credit card online, get approved while they're in the store, and use the actual transaction as a credit line. Those are the kind of customers we'll deal with. But we will only deal with them at a very high credit quality level, so that we're not reaching down to try to grow the balance sheet at the risk of putting some less-prime customers on in the future.</p>
          <p>So I think you'll see &#x2013; what you see is we're a nice trajectory. Everything in our company, all &#x2013; is going to be a nice, steady, slow, methodical recovery down to that average of 1% credit charge-offs over the course. And you'll see us sit there for quite a while, because we're going to continue to underwrite at that level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, maybe just to clarify the commentary about the capital return, last year the Fed said requests for dividend payouts north of 30% would be given extra scrutiny. Did they give any informal cap last year on the total return, that that should be limited to 50% or anything like that? You noted that you had done about 45% this quarter, total return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. John, they did not. Last year, in fact, buybacks were silent. The entire issue last year was a maximum 30% for what we included as common and preferred dividends, which as you recall &#x2013; which is why we wanted to leave a little room and didn't go right to the top. We haven't gotten any new guidance since then either, but we have had permission to move forward on our buyback plan, which is obvious because we've been doing it. So, that kind of came inter-test.</p>
          <p>And now as the new test comes forward, I don't have any guidance on what they're going to propose. But given that they've let us get up to that 30% on dividends and approved us to do some actions on buyback &#x2013; everything we did this quarter was within permitted bounds, and 45% is the result, but it wasn't a target. It just happened to be what we got to. So, I'm hoping that our current performance and our future stress-test guidance will give us permission to at least go from this point now forward from 45% and up toward that 60% to 80% that we spoke of with Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do those approvals around the buybacks that came subsequent to the dividend approvals, was that kind of a quarterly thing, or is that just, "Okay, you can do this for the rest of the year"?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a full-year view, John, so we had a full-year projected buyback plan, consistent with capital ratios that we set out in our plan, and that was approved as part of the overall CCAR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, John, what happened &#x2013; each company did it different, because the rules were so vague last time. And I'll give just you an example. We put a proviso in our stress test plan that said if, and when we get to a certain capital &#x2013; Tier 1 common capital level, without any of us knowing what the SIFI buffer would be &#x2013; in fact, a year ago, I don't think that phrase was even out there yet &#x2013; but if we get to this point, then do we have permission to begin the buyback if we never go below that stated level? And that was the proviso that said yes. And as it would turn out, we actually got to that point sooner than we thought, and we asked for permission to move sooner than we originally thought, and we got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So this was kind of the interim test, but it had to be kind of set up as part of the structure in the first round. And so lesson learned is we'll make sure we set a lot of options for us to negotiate with them in the second year once we pay off the CCAR in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, got it. That's very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a question for Andy on the NII. Outside of the impact of securities purchases, how have you been able to keep the NIM pretty flattish at a high level amid this kind of low and declining rate environment? What are some of the puts and takes that allow you to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, first of all, the margin on the loans has been relatively stable the last quarter. We had seen a bit of a decline in Quarters 2, compared to prior quarters, but it's stabilized a bit. Second is we still have some room on the deposit side of the equation, across both wholesale and consumer deposit pricing. We've moved down a little bit, consistent with the marketplace. We're still in the middle of the pack, but we had a little room there. Third is we continue to have &#x2013; we have had and continue to have opportunity in terms of debt maturities, and then the reissuance of debt. And we'll continue to see that in 2012. And so all those factors are part of the equation that gets me to that sort of 3 to 6 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe one for the professor. Bill, what do you make of the flattening out of the home equity delinquencies? And some other banks are kind of &#x2013; sound a little worried about mortgage credit double dipping and kind of turning in home equity &#x2013; charge-offs maybe going up. Can you give us your view there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, this is &#x2013; there's definitely a little seasonal pressure this time of the year. So, that would be normal. I mean, ours stayed pretty flat. We're further and further away from kind of the originations that took place pre-'09 &#x2013; or pre-'08. And so we continue to work through whether it's modifications or just attrition of the older portfolios. So, that gives us some confidence that we'll continue to see improvement. It'll be modest going forward, because they're &#x2013; obviously with the home prices the way they are, there's still a fair amount of pressure on those old vintages. But we have good modification programs that we employ for all the products. So.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, this is Richard. In the OMG category, don't forget we had this amazingly high-quality credit portfolio for home equity. I mean, if you look at anything, we didn't grow a lot in the first half of the 2000s. It was home equity. I mean, for our size, you had to say, "God, where were you guys? Because you weren't growing it that fast." We did it through people we knew, and our customers are primarily people that we have other relationships with. And our seconds, in many, many cases, follow our own firsts. And the people where we followed someone else's first, they're underwritten at very conservative levels.</p>
          <p>So that is &#x2013; of all the portfolios, it's probably our best, most pristine portfolio. In the original stress test of April 2009, our numbers were so low in the forward view, they asked us to take the next bank's &#x2013; next number, because they couldn't model our number being that low. So, it's a point of pride for us that we have really high-quality home equity, and our branch originators understand that we will only do those kind of home equities. So, you will see very little volatility and risk as it compares to our peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Two questions, one on Durbin and then one on commercial real estate. On Durbin, you mentioned that you expect to be able to offset about a third to a half of all the regulatory issues, including Durbin. I guess I'm just wondering, over what timeframe, and how much of that is in the run rate? You mentioned some of it was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. Okay, so let's do our setup here. We think that those three categories were the Reg E activities, the CARD Act, and now Durbin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for that total, we're expecting to achieve a 30% to 50% recovery. We're right now, Betsy, at 30%. That's in our numbers today. To get to 50%, I'm going to take all of next year. And the reason I'm going to do that is because we're not going to rush to judgment. We're not going to make a mistake here, and we don't have to. And so right now, I'm making something very clear. We will not get that $75 million that we started &#x2013; the quarterly loss for Durbin &#x2013; beginning this month. We're not going to try to hide it back this quarter or even in the first quarter of next year. We'll start working our way toward different ways of charging for services that customers are willing to pay for. We've got a great laboratory watching a number of banks that have been doing the debit fee, and we'll learn whether or not that's inelastic or elastic. We'll find out if customers complain and move or just complain. We'll take all that in time, and we'll make our decision, but over the course of now to the end of next year, we will have achieved 50% of that total cost of loss, but it will take the rest of the year to get the extra 20%.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's &#x2013; so it's about a billion in total for all three, and so you're talking about that $200 million or so incremental.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on your slide deck, you talk about commercial real estate obviously with all the other asset classes in credit quality on page 25. So, I just wanted to see if we could dig in a little bit to how you're managing down the commercial real estate portfolio in terms of the NPLs there. I mean, obviously you had a big improvement in construction NCOs this quarter But when I look the last couple of quarters, the NPL decline in commercial real estate looks like it's coming down pretty similarly, a little bit less than the net charge-offs in that asset class. Is this just something you'll charge off, and that's how we're going to get down the NPLs over time, or is there something else going on that could accelerate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, it'll stay lumpy going forward, but it's on a downward &#x2013; overall downward trajectory. I mean, the overall construction book continues to climb. I think it's down 20% approximately year-over-year. So, as we &#x2013; the portfolio, the higher-risk construction book, continues to attrite, and as we work through the different deals, either we'll do loan sales or take the charge-offs and just otherwise resolve the assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and is the current run rate of about $100 million or so decline in NPLs Q on Q what you would expect to continue or -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at, there's a charge in there, and it's going to be lumpy, but overall it's on a downward trajectory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then could you also talk a little bit about the performing TDRs? You indicated that that was due to accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But maybe give us some color about whether or not you're dealing with them differently because of the accounting or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't deal with anything differently because of the accounting. I mean, there were two things we did. Historically, we really only looked on the commercial side at those over $5 million and tagged them whether they were TDRs or not. Now, we basically go down to zero. We have basically some formulas we run against the below $5 million to identify TDRs. And then we used to use internal rates for determining market rate, and now we use an external benchmark, which is a little bit higher, so, but it doesn't change how we handle customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And they're all performing? You don't have any nonperforming TDRs in this asset class?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there are definitely nonperforming TDRs, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But those have no impact, because you're already doing a 114 on them.</p>

          <p>Hi, Erika.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Ed's question. You seem very conservative with your tone with regards to reserve release, but then when you were answering John's question, you were very confident in the strength of your underwriting. I guess, is what's missing in the equation in terms of what's driving your conservatism the continued uncertainty in how the economic recovery plays out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is the math. I mean, we're at 130 &#x2013; what are we at? $131 million. And we're going to be at 100 basis points. So, as you start to slide into that new run rate, you don't have that much left. And so I hope we actually get to the point where the reserve release ends. It's the only thing I don't like about our numbers, because it's not sustainable, repeatable, and consistent. So, it'll come down, just like a nice, slow slide into home plate. I mean, it's just going to be steady and methodical, and eventually our loan losses will equal our charge-offs, and we'll be back to normal. I just hope it's actually sooner than later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And just to follow up on the margin. We saw an 18 basis point compression on commercial yields. I guess in terms of looking forward, do you expect a similar level given what you're seeing in the pipeline, given what you're seeing in terms of pricing, or do you think it'll be a little bit lower from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this is Andy, Erika. That decline is really a function of the decline in rates overall in the marketplace. So, when I talk about spreads, I'm talking about both the rate on the loan, as well as the funding cost in that loan, which stabilized a bit in the third quarter. So, on an absolute basis, it's down because rates. On a relative basis, it was down a little bit up through Quarter 2 and stabilized a bit, and right now I see stabilization.</p>

          <p>Hey, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Paul.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, how you doing? Thanks. Hey, on the mortgage banking side, it's one of these areas I think you've been growing market share in, even though it's relatively small. But with Bank of America getting out of the correspondent business, is that something you guys are taking a look at? And secondly, can you talk a little bit about what type of mortgage loans you're putting on your books? I don't know if you answered in the beginning, but &#x2013; we've been running around this morning &#x2013; just what type of loans you're portfolioing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, first, I'm going to answer your second question first. The loans that represent the majority of the increase are in two categories: Number one is a product called Smart Refinance that's originated in our branches. It's a refinancing product for high-quality, core customers that come through the branch. The second category would be prime jumbo loans originated through our mortgage banking group, so these are not Freddie and Fannie qualified, but again, they're high-quality loans. And then that Smart Refinance, I would note that the term of those is probably in the neighborhood of 15 years or less. So, they're not long-term, 30-year mortgages. That's the principal area.</p>
          <p>In terms of the mix of businesses and the way we originate from a retail and correspondent basis, I would not see a significant change on that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Smart Refinance, what type of yields are you giving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I'll go from a spread basis, because that's how I think about it things. And it's in a neighborhood of 200-plus basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>200-plus basis points. And most of it's 15 years or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's 10 to 15, yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the other issue, on your deposits, a lot of the banks are collecting a lot of deposits out there. Can you talk about where that's coming from? Is it mainly coming retail or through your business relationships?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Paul, it's coming everywhere. So, first on the consumer side of the equation. We have a number of products, SMART Savings, and a number of different products that have allowed us to gain market share. Richard talked about that. You saw the FDIC data that indicated that. So, we are absolutely gaining market share on the consumer side of the equation. On the wholesale outside of the equation, it's additional cash being held by corporations as they strengthen their balance sheet, additional market share. And then finally, on the corporate trust side of the equation, we continue to build that book also, and that is adding to our deposit categories, particularly DDA. So, we're seeing it across all three categories: corporate trust, wholesale, as well as retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on a percentage basis, is it a even mix across &#x2013; a third, a third, a third? Or is wholesale like 50%, 60% of it and consumer 20%, 30%? Just on that mix shift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so wholesale is the majority of the increase. Wholesale and corporate trust is the majority of the increase that you see in DDA balance, which is a big piece of the increase. And I would say the remainder is sort of 50/50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hey, thanks a lot, gentlemen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Moshe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, great, thanks. I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about, given your comments about credit quality, particularly as they stand in contrast to some of the larger banks being a little more conservative, are there areas in which you think you're going to be taking even more market share kind of over the course of the next six to 12 months from a loan perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're taking it now. You'll see it in the wholesale side, and it'll be all the way from small business to middle market up to corporate.</p>
          <p>Starting backwards, corporate banking, as you know, we are getting &#x2013; over the last few years since we've really established our national corporate banking capabilities, we've been getting a lot more bites of the apple. We've been invited into more syndicated deals. And now, over the last year we're now leading a lot of deals and leading syndications and playing the lead partner for these companies, which is a big step. And then as you might have thought through this, the international banks are now not typically showing back up at the same level they were when there's a renewed syndicated deal, and so we're not only invited in, but we're invited up. And so we're finding a lot of market share gain in deeper relationships and more customer &#x2013; more position with customers that are really very impressive, like corporate &#x2013; a top Fortune 100 kind of customer.</p>
          <p>The middle market, they really seem to appreciate the quality of the balance sheet. They like our top ratings. And those companies are sophisticated enough to know they want to put their money and get their line from a bank that's really safe. And we've been invited to do more business with them, and particularly non-credit businesses come along with the loans that we've had, and through Bill's good work we've taken higher positions on hold levels for customers that we really feel good about.</p>
          <p>And on small business, we've been growing that, Moshe, like in anywhere &#x2013; 9% to 12% in origination year-over-year, whether it's SBA or business lines or business loans on the small business side. And we're getting a lot of new bites at the apple there because the company's focus on small business in the last two years has been wielding a lot of benefits by changing the course of what used to be a bank that did small business when it was available to kind of weeding relationships now with small business and then getting all the ancillary, deposit, and fee businesses to go along.</p>
          <p>So it's going to be anything wholesale. You're going to see it. It's in our numbers now. We're going to see it even more in the future. And I'll just recap by saying the opportunity presented by some of the international banks deciding to change their posture is going to help a lot in the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one other kind of separate question. And that is, I think when we've talked in the past, there have been some thoughts about acquisitions outside of the banking space, and it's been very quiet there. I mean, what can you tell us about the environment? Are there conversations, are there things we should be looking for? And what are your areas of focus in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you mean outside of the traditional, like -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Traditional commercial banking, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. For us, it's &#x2013; that &#x2013; you just quoted corporate trust and payments businesses. And you'll see more of what you've seen so far. We keep looking. We'd love to grow those two businesses, the best capital use or low capital users. They're great fee businesses. The cost of entry is almost zero for those who aren't in it, and those of us who are, it's a scale business. So, we're not slowing that area at all. We're not seeing perhaps as many deals to show you.</p>
          <p>But it's not for lack of looking. And if I have my way, you'll see continued branch and small bank deals. You'll see continued corporate trust deals. You'll see portfolio purchases. And you'll see opportunities for us in the payment space, which might include more mobile banking activities. So, what you see is more of what you're going to get, and we're going to do our best to keep filling that pipeline with those kind of small deals that come together in a nice way in the end.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow-up. How much of the commercial growth and the growth in commitments was driven by the wholesale or large corporate business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, a big part of it. And that's probably the reason why I started &#x2013; I mentioned to Moshe's question backwards. Let me just say that, as I look at the traditional wholesale &#x2013; which is the larger middle market, corporate, and commercial real estate &#x2013; our line of credit continues to grow. Our utilization is pretty flat, but it's only in fact, a little bit down because we keep growing commitments by more and more. So, on a book of about $70 billion of commitments for those larger corporate side, we grew in linked quarter $4.1 billion in commitments. So, $70 billion going to $74 billion.</p>
          <p>The loans themselves went from like $17 billion to $18 billion, up about $1 billion. So, we continue to have nice growth, 4.6% on that book linked quarter on loans, but a 5.8% linked quarter on the same book for commitments. So that also says people are positioning to be continue to be ready for something when they're ready, and we're getting robust business across the board.</p>
          <p>I would say, if I had to split down the large CRE and the large corporate versus the middle market side of it, it would probably be two-thirds/one-third, so it's really happening at the corporate level, at the highest level, most.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to follow up on a comment you just made, you talked earlier also about the confidence of customers, and how utilizations are relatively flat, and you think you need confidence to lead to stronger balance growth. I'm just curious if you could give us some maybe qualitative stuff on what your customers are saying, and how much of an issue is the confidence question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. One of the stories at U.S. Bank this quarter would be that most of the new opportunities in corp wholesale banking is driven primarily by refinance activities. And if we were only refinancing our own customers, there wouldn't be any balance sheet growth. In fact, there might be margin deterioration. But the best proxy I have for you is we are bringing in other people's customers, and refinancing new credits for us &#x2013; someone else's credits for them &#x2013; at rates that are sufficient enough for us, based on our cost of funds, to be good. And so the majority of it &#x2013; it doesn't matter, which of the categories I talked about &#x2013; has to do with refinance activities and coming to us.</p>
          <p>It can also be in the form of a refinance and us getting a higher bite of the position or in fact, leading the position. So, by far, Jon, that's the majority of what we're seeing here. It is really market shift.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, it's customers who are either in M&amp;A, and we're getting a bigger piece of that because more often than not our customers on the M&amp;A side of the transaction &#x2013; or in many other cases &#x2013; we've got good ag businesses in the community bank, and we've got this small business growth I talked about that kind of fills in the rest of the gap.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Question is, when you do your Basel III calculation, and you're only taking out from 8.5% to 8.2%, are you giving yourself any credit for the better than &#x2013; performance under credit that you actually can get a positive impact, even though a lot of the legislation says we're not supposed to eventually get that? But are you giving yourself any credit for that as you go through that calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No is the short answer. Because that's Basel II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And our constraint is actually Basel I/III. Our Basel II numbers are actually higher than our Basel III numbers, so I don't get to use any of that credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on what we're seeing in the commercial growth, as we're seeing really less access to market, less competition from alternative providers of this. As part of the &#x2013; what we're seeing, especially with your commercial loan growth, just &#x2013; maybe the first sign of what may be a new paradigm for banking that the pie may be smaller, but we're going to get a bigger piece of it as we see business start to come back.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I just think your positioning in the commercial side, that's the first place we're going to see it, because they are refinancing going on, and as they move back into the banking system, you're getting the benefit of that. Eventually, that'll roll down to the middle market, I guess, and also, some of the &#x2013; even closer to smaller business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Moshe &#x2013; I mean, Marty &#x2013; that's right on. In fact, when I just told the numbers back to Jon and Moshe, I mean, our utilization of those larger customers is like 24%. I mean &#x2013; and we just keep building more customers, and more opens-to-buy. I mean, when the recovery hits &#x2013; and it will &#x2013; I can't even tell you how much we have in terms of opportunity for our loan book to grow without adding one more new customer because we're adding so many that are positioned eventually to take and use our balance sheets.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, guys. A follow-up question just on securities yields and deposit pricing. I know you talked about these &#x2013; expectation for slight margin compression. But I was just wondering, underneath the purchases first on the securities side, the pieces that you're adding for liquidity, can you just give us some color on what's going on underneath in the securities yields? And do you expect that to hold up as you continue to reinvest going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, Ken, we are &#x2013; first of all, I should highlight, we ended the quarter at about $67.5 billion, and we mentioned in the notes and in the call that we're going to probably end the year at $70 billion and sort of be in a holding pattern then because we're going to be very close. So, the level of build that remains is not significant. So, I'll start there.</p>
          <p>Secondly, from the purchases, I would say it's about two-thirds or three-quarters fixed, one-third or one quarter floating, and the fixed is probably just around 2%-plus and the floating's probably LIBOR plus 1.35% to 1.40%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. All right. That's helpful. And then secondly, the all-in deposit costs and the all-in liability costs were stickier for you guys, relative to a lot of other banks. I know you talked about the ability to continue repricing the right side of the balance sheet lower. Can you help us at all think how much is left, either in deposits, or what you're doing on the deposit side? And then also remind us about what you may have benefits from in terms of lowering the long-term debt costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say a good deal of the deposit pricing opportunity is reflected in the third quarter. There might be a little bit more opportunity, but I would not call it significant. We have between $7 billion and $10 billion rolling off over the next 12 to 15 months on the debt side of the equation that will offer us additional opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is that &#x2013; so a lot of banks are talking about the ability to reprice the entire deposit complex lower. Obviously, with your interest, checking, and money market, savings, at 14, there's not much more you can go. But can you give us the amount of kind of where your go-to rates are on the CD side, and what the roll-off of the CD book is, kind of like you just did with the debt book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The CD book does represent a repricing opportunity, both on new CDs, as well as renewals. But just from the &#x2013; and you can see the math in terms of the balance sheet and income statement. It's not a significant component of what changes on a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. You've talked a lot about your market share expansion and the commercial loans, but 20% annualized growth in commercial loans &#x2013; how comfortable are you with the credit quality of the new loans? I guess there are a couple hung deals in the syndicated loan market this past quarter. I didn't see your name associated with that, but you're seeing some signs that everything's not as good as it had been. So, I guess I'm asking about the quality of the new loans, what you're seeing in the market overall, and if you plan to continue that pace of expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the quality of new loans is excellent. Right? So I mean, we're very selective about how we go after the large corporate customers. So, I mean, these are companies we know well. We can provide a full suite of services. And you're right. We don't have any hung syndications.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And which geographies are these loans in? I mean, you've been consistent for the last two years saying you're expanding, you're going to gain market share. You are. Is that more in the Midwest? Is it Southeast? Where is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Mike, if you compare back to a few years ago, though, it's the out-of-footprint, because we didn't have it. And now it's quite robust for us. But in market, we're growing there, too. It's just that the net new &#x2013; if you take a couple-year horizon &#x2013; is really coming outside the 25 states because of this national &#x2013; gone from regional to national corporate bank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And of how much of that &#x2013; say two-thirds of the growth came from wholesale. How much of that would be international? I mean, capturing share from the international banks, which are all pulling back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>No, no, no, no. Yeah. You know what I mean. In other words, some international bank compete in the U.S. market. They're pulling back. How much of your growth might be attributed to that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys. NIM obviously held up a lot better than we've seen at other banks. It seems like you managed the surge in noninterest-bearing deposits better than some. How sustainable do you think that increase is, that $10 billion increase in noninterest-bearing, since it's in the wholesale and corporate trust?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Matt, first of all, I think you're right. Our treasury group works very closely with our consumer group and our wholesale groups in terms of pricing, and we really try to target those solid customers and really try to work with the customers in different alternatives. So, we're not pushing customers away from the bank at all or charging them.</p>
          <p>Second is, I do think that the growth that you were seeing reflects a little bit of the fact that the corporations are very strong right now in terms of their own particular balance sheets, and are not yet choosing to invest those dollars. So, we probably will see some decline in those over time.</p>
          <p>The final factor I'd mention is that, as you know, there's unlimited insurance in DDA till the end of 2012. So, certainly, in this environment, that's a very safe place to put your money, and that may change once the unlimited insurance changes at the end of '12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then just totally separate topic. One of the interesting things that's probably going to happen in the next several years is some movement in the payments business in terms of how customers and corporates pay. You've got obviously these changes in the debit card fees. You've got &#x2013; mobile payments is probably going to take off at some point. There's stubbornly high unemployment. So, there's a lot of government transfers.</p>
          <p>Can you just talk about &#x2013; obviously you're in a lot of the areas of payments. Can you talk about some of the new products that you have, or are working on, or some of the themes that you think you will benefit from over the next &#x2013; not necessarily the next six, 12 months, but a little bit longer term, maybe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. But six, 12 months as well. Two categories here. One is your consumers. And our mobile banking, online banking, capabilities are at the top of class. And I've said a number of things about this company over the years, and a few years ago you never said "U.S. Bank" and "innovation" in the same phrase, and now you should put us at the top of the class. Because we have spent a lot of time and energy with that Enterprise Revenue Office and building a whole new set of &#x2013; suite of new ideas and new ways to move money, because we're in the business of moving money for corporate payments for 20 years. And now we've extended that capability, and I'm putting money behind getting amazing talent and amazing skill to get this kind of mobile banking in the top-of-class, and you'll see amazing things in the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>Back to corporate payments. And the thing we haven't talked about much, but I'm so glad we have it, 20 years ago, the legacy of this bank started a corporate payments business, which is huge government provider of card-based payments. It's a huge kind of sophisticated way of treasury management on steroids and moving money along before it was going to be popular, paperless. And all that continues to grow and expand in terms of the capabilities we have.</p>
          <p>And by the way, Matt, the cost of entry there is too high for &#x2013; there's only four or five of us in this space. So, this corporate payments world is going to become very robust for us. Customers are going to get smarter and don't want to move anything that they can't see in a nanosecond. They don't want it on paper. They want to have the next new idea. So, while we'll appeal to customers, we're going to be able to get even further ahead because of our starting position with corporate and commercial payments. So, I'm totally jazzed about both of those, and I'm glad you brought it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's obviously a revenue opportunity from this, but as people use banks differently, as banks have to charge customers differently, does this make you think about the expense base differently? We've seen one bank who was going to be very aggressive in expanding its branch network, talk about maybe toning that down a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're more kind of complete and haven't had as ambitious expansion. But just as you look out the next couple of years, you're going to be doing business differently, and I would think that might mean some reallocation of costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. Not really. We kind of like where we are, and I think we can handle just small nuances to the way we spend our money. The branch network's probably going to go 25 to 50 branches net a year. And, oh, yeah, that's exactly what we've done for the last 10 years, so it's nothing remarkable. We have a disparately large position in what we'll call grocery branches and on-site corporate and public location branches in the same god category because they are growing well. They're exactly what customers want, the hybrid between be where I need you to be, but I don't need the same old-fashioned branch with marble columns.</p>
          <p>And I'll say over the next few years, you'll see &#x2013; like everyone else &#x2013; we're going to take the branches we do have, make sure that they pass the test of being locations for which more than check cashing occurs, and we'll probably remodel them in a way that makes them much more attractive as a point of destination for conversations and private discussions. But, yeah, pretty much what you've seen &#x2013; we're not going to make much of a change in course because we kind of like how it got us here, and we don't have anything we need to either retrofit or back out of because of having been too excessive in the last couple years.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. Richard, you've spent a lot of time over the last couple of quarters talking about the investment bank and the gains that you've seen there. I'm just curious as to what the trends were in the investment bank this quarter relative to underwriting volumes and things like that. Obviously, the market's been pretty weak for underwriting, but at least in terms of your line of business numbers, it didn't look at if the wholesale banking, commercial, real estate numbers were down all that much. So, if you could just provide some color there, that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just say, a lot of the businesses I thought you were talking about were our fee businesses where we provide the guidance and trusted support to our wholesale clients, which is growing very nicely, especially since it started from zero two years ago. So, for us, it's icing on the cake. And there may be deals that we're not showing you yet because they haven't come to market, or they didn't come to market yet. But we're now in conversations, and the folks that we have in Charlotte and New York are at the top of people's call lists, as it relates to providing services for any kind of underwriting or the high-grade activities.</p>
          <p>In many cases, that does derive more business on the balance sheet for us, but primarily, Matt, it's going to be our fee businesses you should look at that really derive kind of the benefit of that. And I would say it's in inning three as this company is growing this business and growing a respect and a capability. The talent is already there. We're ready for the phones to ring, but the market will find us as it continues to heat up. And, Andy, you might put some numbers around that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I would say that if you look at the commercial product revenue line, which is where the majority of that fee revenue lands &#x2013; our high-grade bond business, our municipal underwriting business &#x2013; I think, in all cases, we're building and taking share and building our &#x2013; moving up on the league tables. And I think you should continue to expect that. You are correct that the third quarter was down a bit in overall activity, but we were up because we continue to gain share. And I think once the activity starts to become more robust, we're going to move even more in those tables.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Matt, I might add lastly, not unlike the conversation we had on the wholesale loan book, this business is going to be benefited by the foreign banks' decision to retreat from some of those &#x2013; participations in some of those levels of involvement. So, this would be another place where we'll see, I think, robust benefits next year that are just starting to show up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes sense. And if I can, just a follow-up question on the commitments. You mentioned that commitments are growing a little faster than loans. I'm just curious as to the trend in the pricing of commitments, if that's gotten substantially more competitive over the last couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It kind of flattened out a little bit. I mean, we did see year-over-year pricing come down 25, 30, 40 basis points. But third quarter, basically said it's still uncertain environment out there, so people are still willing to pay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would add, as this recession gets older and as people kind of start thinking through what's worth it to them, we are prepared to compete on price &#x2013; I've always said that, and I'll say it again today. We're not having to use it as much. People have more and more than value than even I expected them to ascribe to our ratings, and to our balance sheet strength, and probably now our multiyear commitment in following through on things we promised. So, we're actually not having to spend as much as I'm willing to spend to win a high-quality deal, because they're actually coming to us saying, if that's a fair price for the quality of our relationship, I'll take it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, just a question on the CCAR exam. Richard, am I correct in assessing sort of the color of your comments relative to the 2012 exam versus 2011 as maybe the regulators being not quite so prescriptive this go-round versus last time? Maybe because of familiarity with the whole process, but also because we're a bit further away from the challenges of 2008 and 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what you heard was my aspirations that I'm right. Honestly, I don't have any insight except the way they've treated us during the year, the way we continue to communicate well, and my hope is that that distinction will be recognized. I don't have a fact set, and I really won't know till we do the second &#x2013; you know, we don't even have two points to connect. We have one test and tea leaves to read. But so far we're prepared to perform well in test, and I'm hopeful that the teacher will give us a high grade and let us move on to the next class.</p>

          <p>Hi, Nancy.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a small-picture question for Bill and big-picture question for you, Richard. I'll ask the small one first. Bill, the impression is that credit standards have changed dramatically on the consumer side over the last few years. Could you clarify whether that is indeed true at USB and just sort of maybe give us your sort of average FICO on the consumer side now versus where it was in maybe 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I've said this before. I mean, in terms of U.S. Bank and our underwriting, if you look at our cards or autos, our underwriting really did not change a lot. I mean, in cards, you have to make adjustments in a downturn based on region and stuff like that. But basically straight prime books. The one area that did change &#x2013; we changed along with the industry &#x2013; was the 100% financing of a home, which we did some of that in our finance company. And we do some of that on our home equities. So, backing away from 100%, we still do 90% home equities out of our branch. But &#x2013; so that's the one area where there was a change at U.S. Bank, and obviously, even bigger changes in the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the average &#x2013; we do disclose on our residential mortgage and home equity originations. They're in a schedule that we hand out. And those FICOs, I think they're in the 760s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Richard, the question for you is this. I think it's recognized in the banking industry that you're one of the CEOs who has pretty good relationships with the regulators &#x2013; i.e., you're not out there yelling at them or insulting them in public. So, I would ask you, I mean, what do you see as sort of the general relationship between the banking industry, and its regulators right now? And do you see any &#x2013; where are we in this sort of whole new regulatory revolution or evolution? Do you see any new initiatives that are going to be coming down the road at us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nancy. That's a big one. Let me say first of all, we have a handful of people that are still in appointed or unconfirmed positions. And that is worth starting at. Because until the comptroller, the head of the FDIC, are finally, confirmed, and until the CFPB is finally, appointed, you don't get the same kind of definitive answers, and you don't get the same kind of definitive progress on things when people are watching progress, but not necessarily setting long-term objectives. So, I think we're a bit &#x2013; I'd say I'm frustrated by that, because I'd like to have a better sense where the endpoint is so we can all start marching toward that. But directionally, we all know where we're headed.</p>
          <p>I would say if you take a look at the Dodd-Frank, 20% of the whole activity hasn't even &#x2013; has only been slightly accomplished. 80% even yet to be defined. You get things like SIFI buffers, we're sitting in wait wondering what will be called, and what the number will be. We're eager to know whether or not there's going to be a standard coming out of this CCAR test coming up that we just mused about here not knowing. So, the uncertainty is everywhere.</p>
          <p>But I'll also balance it by saying &#x2013; and so it's been that way for three years. I mean, we've been operating under uncertainty for a long time. We've been operating under a difficult economic environment for a long time. And so I think the answer to your question is, nothing's getting more clear or progressing very fast. But our ability to now understand that it's not going to happen fast and our willingness to accept the fact that we have to make up some of the answers until there's a final one, is probably much higher. So, I believe that my peers and I are still frustrated at the highest level that we don't have better guidance, but we're not &#x2013; in most cases &#x2013; frustrated or surprised by it. We're now managing to kind of a new normal and understanding it will take quite some time.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, until you tell me I can't do something, and it's not harmful, and it's good for your customers, and it seems to be line in line with good regulatory behavior, then we're going to do it. And we'll wait and find out if they want us to change that later, but we're not sitting on our hands waiting for guidance on how to run the company. We're just trying to be a little more watchful. So, I'd say because it's old, and it's not that different, we're probably more balanced in our view and probably not as surprisingly frustrated we would otherwise seem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was an announcement last week or a report that the CFPB is going to start examining mortgage servicers for hidden fees, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you expect that you will get targeted in that? And do you expect that then they're going to go from mortgage servicing to credit cards, et cetera, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't. I don't. I'll tell you why. I think the CFPB is still a long way from being configured, and in fact, I don't have a CFPB person assigned to me yet. So, we have no CFPB evidenced at U.S. Bank. And so until that time, the OCC and others will continue to watch over what would be consumer regulations, and we'll watch it ourselves. But I think when it comes to things like mortgage, there are so many other entities looking over that topic, it would be surprising if the CFPB picked one of their first things to get in the middle of would be something that someone else is working on. I think from talking to Raj Date, it's clear to me that they're going to stay pure on &#x2013; focused on transparency, disclosures, customer clarity, on all products &#x2013; could be mortgage, too &#x2013; but credit cards and mortgages to start, but it won't be intrusive or redundant to things that are being done in the more provocative sense of servicing rules and foreclosure exams and things like that. I think they're going to stay pretty pure at first.</p>
          <p>What we all really want more than anything is that we want them to appoint someone so that the non-bank entities can be brought into the same umbrella of oversight that we all share, and I think that's the most important thing we should look forward to. Which is why I've always been a supporter of the CFPB, because I think it brings more guidance to a level playing field than it does additional work for those of us already doing it.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I think in the past you guys have sort of downplayed the idea of buying credit card portfolios &#x2013; I mean, sorry, commercial real estate portfolios. Seems maybe you've softened your stance on that. Is that just because there's a lot of weak players out there and you might be able to get something at a good price?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't softened our stance. We typically pretty much not to want to underwrite stuff that big, and that important, and know where it came from and know our customer. Not to say we wouldn't find one we might like. But the more recent deals you saw, we took a quick look and said "not for us" and moved right along.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's critical to us to know who we're doing business with. That's not the space where you just buy indirect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and we're not desperate for asset growth. And I mean, that in the nicest way. We're simply not looking to go buy other assets because we have a balance sheet issue. We can handle where we are now, and eventually, gosh, I can't wait till these lines of credit get used, and then we're going to be very, very pleased that we didn't over-encumber ourselves with loans that we didn't know.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you, Tiffany. I just want to thank everybody for their continued interest. I'm really proud of this quarter. And we've always said we want to focus on consistency, predictability, and repeatability. I call it my CPR. And I think we're getting close to consistent. I think we're getting close to predictable, and I certainly think we can keep repeating this kind of clean and unjaundiced performance of just doing business the old-fashioned way.
