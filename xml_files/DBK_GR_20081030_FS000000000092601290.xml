          <p>Ladies and Gentlemen. I am Maria, the operator for this conference. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2008 Analyst Conference Call of Deutsche Bank. Please note that for the duration of the presentation all participants will be in listen-only-mode and the conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Wolfram Schmitt. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Maria. Good morning from Frankfurt to Deutsche Bank's third quarter call. With me is the CFO of Deutsche Bank, Stefan Krause, who will take you through our numbers, which we have released this morning.</p>
          <p>So you-- by now you should have copies of our earnings release, the financial data supplement, the full interim report hopefully and the set of presentation slides which Stefan will use. After his presentation we are, of course, ready to take your questions.</p>
          <p>It goes without saying I have to point you to the forward-looking statements we might make in this context to our cautionary disclaimer in all our documents.</p>
          <p>With that Stefan, I would like to hand over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Welcome and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm certainly very pleased to host this analyst call this morning and as you all know I couldn't have picked a better quarter for my start. So let me walk you through this set of slides that we put out into the presentation and then after that obviously if you should I'll gladly answer all the questions you may have.</p>
          <p>So on the first page, on page three, we've put out some highlights and I think it's important to walk through those. But mainly describing the situation in a natural -- in one sentence is, yes, at Deutsche Bank our P&amp;L continues to be under pressure, but our capital and funding situation are very strong. And I think it's very good news as we move through this crisis.</p>
          <p>Also because there are some questions on the dividend we accrued, &#x20AC;2.25 in the first half of 2008. That means we used that 2007 payout rate. But obviously as we have seen this changing environment, we did not accrue anything further in the third quarter of '08. But there was no reversal of accruals made, to just be very clear.</p>
          <p>And again as you know, according to German corporate governance we decide our dividends and dividend policy in January and the Board will make then the proposal to the Supervisory Board then for decision at the AGM.</p>
          <p>Our income before taxes, as you saw, was positive 93 million. We absorbed within this markdowns of 1.2 billion and it does only include a very minor gain on fair valuing own debt, as you know we have consistently not used that option. If we would have used it to the extent that some of our industry competitors made, our pre-tax profit would have been be more than 2 billion.</p>
          <p>We had a net income of 414 million including a tax benefit of 321 million. Our diluted EPS was $0.83. But we are very proud of that we did achieve Tier 1 ratio of 10.3%, which is above the newly issued target of 10%. Our leverage ratio is at 34 per our target definition that I will cover later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Our total assets are slightly up by 2.1 trillion. And as I will disclose later, primarily due to movements in the exchange rates and in some derivative values. And it was partly offset by a managed reduction of &#x20AC;103 billion.</p>
          <p>And on the liquidity side, we continue to have a diversified unsecured funding of 521 billion. But which is not a concern to us because 86% is covered mainly by deposits or capital market instruments. So only 14% is short-term money market funding and it's covered by a liquidity reserve. So a very strong position in that area.</p>
          <p>If we turn to page four, we had in the third quarter,  a brief brief summary, I'm sure that you see the comparison to the previous year and the second quarter year here that net revenues are 4.4 billion after markdowns of 1.2 billion, as I said, to our non-interest expenses. I will come to that in a moment.</p>
          <p>We have an EBIT of 93 million. We had a net income of 440 million in our pre-tax ROE, if this number even means anything, it's certainly 1%. In the comparison of the third quarter, there are some between Q3 2008 and 2007, there are some special effects that I will cover later.</p>
          <p>And on the tax issue, obviously we here had somewhat the situation that as you know we looked into our tax rate mix, geographic taxes mix, as result of where our profits occur. And based on the fact that we couldn't accrue any more on an annual basis, we had to release the accrual that we did so far on the tax basis. And we applied our tax rate mix to the Q3 result and that resulted into this net income increase of 440.</p>
          <p>On page five, I think there we have highlighted the usual topic that we've covered throughout the last quarter and that has been the main issue as we move along this crisis, so we have further reduced our main exposures, the decline in fair value exposures and the leveraged finance business. And to even a lesser extent, CRE, partially reflect the reclassification of assets out of fair value into the loan category.</p>
          <p>Here you also find the breakdown of our markdowns of 1.2 billion. So our leveraged finance which has what we call a carrying value of 22.5 billion. Out of that we transferred to the banking book 8.1 billion, so we have 9.2 billion now in loans.</p>
          <p>Our legacy exposure remaining at fair value is therefore 11.9 billion, so exposure remains, but our susceptibility to further markdowns is certainly significantly reduced. And on the CRE, now our carrying value is 9.7 billion and we transferred 1.3 billion into the banking book.</p>
          <p>If we turn to page six, group-wide revenues are 4.4 billion in Q3 of 2008, which is down 14% versus the prior year quarter. This year's third quarter versus third quarter 2007 is certainly impacted by some trading losses as you've seen, in exceptionally tough conditions, which we will describe in a few moments. The already alluded to markdowns of 1.2 billion. And we had lower revenues in corporate investments mainly due to the lower disposal and so again were 0.5 billion -- 0.4 billion excuse me. And we had also weaker revenues in the peak end of 0.5 billion driven by specific items that I will explain later. Our year-to-date revenues are down by approximately 20% before markdowns.</p>
          <p>On page seven, we talk about our non-comp expenses and they were essentially unchanged year-on-year despite the numbers being quite differently, the increasing compensation and benefit on third quarter 2007 included partial reversal of performance-driven compensation after a very strong 2007. So we just wanted to remind you that that was happened in the previous year. So we have some reversal effect in the previous year numbers.</p>
          <p>We also had in '07 VAT reimbursement, which was significant, of approximately 140 million in '07. And we had some significant releases from litigation provision of about a 100 million last year. So when you compare both numbers, you have to take these numbers out of the '07 number.</p>
          <p>We also had some specific items in '08. These are charges related to the agreement to repurchase our Auction Rate Securities from customers, which impacted the '08 number by about 60 million. And we had a reclassification of RREEF infrastructure investment, which added about 40 million to our operating expenses. So adjusted, if we were to take out these different effects, the ones in '08 and the ones in '07, our general administrative expenses are more or less in line with the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>So let me move on to some key current issues that I'm sure will find your interest. And certainly the first one is the impact of the IAS 39 reclassification. And as far as we are concerned in our evaluation that we did it's -- this finally removes a difference between IFRS and US GAAP. And therefore make our books more comparable to US GAAP treatment of these assets.</p>
          <p>We would -- in those cases where we would be prepared to hold to maturity assets where there was either no liquid market or where the intrinsic value is not represented correctly by dislocated market. We have done this reclassification.</p>
          <p>So accounting in this sense is now catching up with our true business intent that we have now in this volatile market. To be also very clear, it is retrospective to July 1st. So we certainly were not forced to take markdowns that we did not believe we needed in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So the basis for the key assets that we reclassified, it's about 8.1 billion of levered loans, it's 9.5 billion of assets in consolidated asset backed CP conduit, previously classified as AFS, and other assets originally acquired or originated with the intent to security.</p>
          <p>So as you see on the page, the impact we have, I think I don't need to go through all these numbers, but we have shown you what the impact would have been if we would have accounted with the previous, in our view, not so correct treatment.</p>
          <p>If I move on now to the balance sheet issue that we discussed also in our last conference call, our balance sheet size increased by 70 billion. And here we disclosed the single effect to show you that we have worked in reducing our balance sheet, but regretfully based on some of exchange rate and derivative valuation movements, they worked against us.</p>
          <p>So the FX movement that you saw is primarily to the strengthening of the US dollar and based on the fact that about half of our balance sheet is US dollar denominated, pushed our balance sheet by -- up by total of a 133 billion between the financial assets and other assets.</p>
          <p>We have this increase in derivatives by 38 billion at market valuation and we have an increase in our pending settlement balances of about 30 billion. But as disclosed here that really managed reductions as you see were the 103 or 154 respective of managed reduction that we did. There was -- and the IAS reclassification impact of about 25 billion more or less that we also <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>I will move on now to page 11, and as we talk about and move into one of the concerns you have, which is our leverage situation. We always like to start at our balance sheet and when I described here we really also, always to start on the business model that Deutsche Bank has, to really say that there is a significant difference between our US GAAP balance sheet size and our IFRS balance sheet size.</p>
          <p>And on this chart we have shown you how this reconciliation would work with applying US GAAP on DB results, results in significant netting of the following positions. As we show derivative by 564 billion, Repos by 62 billion and pending settlements by 74 billion. And therefore our total assets would only 1.361 billion on the US GAAP compared to this over 2 trillion under IFRS <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So therefore if I turn to the next page where we now compare our total assets to our major peers. DB on a comparable basis, we can really say we are on the middle of pack. Whereas on risk-weighted basis, we are below our peer average. And that's why we continue to believe that risk-weighted assets is the right measure for measuring risk, which is what we intend to do when we look at balance sheet, because it really takes the business mix out of the comparison.</p>
          <p>We do have a different business mix than some of peers and that's why risk weighted assets comparisons really are more helpful in terms of comparing us and the risk carrying in our balance versus our peers.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to page 13. And this is the second effect that we always like to make everybody aware, when you do these calculations on how the true leverage and therefore risk situation is with Deutsche Bank is that our results only include fair value gains on own debt of 146 million in the quarter. And since January 2007, our disclosed benefit on the asset is 255 million, which is a very minor.</p>
          <p>On average our peers have benefit of more than 2.7 billion from fair value gains on own debt. And if we would have elected to same accounting treatment, we would have increased our pre-tax profit in the quarter by more than 2 billion and to compare the number to year-to-date, about 6 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's move therefore to page 14 and here for the first time we now show what we called our leverage ratio and describe our leverage ratio and target. We've now provided also a definition, so we clearly understand what we talk about and what the definition is.</p>
          <p>So our methodology behind our calculation of this, as you know, we will base it on pro forma US GAAP in order to really now achieve a comparison because some of the leverage ratios that we have seen out there are not truly comparable on an FX comparison.</p>
          <p>So this number should now provide you with the right number to be compared. So it is based on pro forma US GAAP. And also in order to make it comparable, we have added back the fair value addition on old debt, which results therefore in a leverage ratio in June of 38. And at the end of September, we were at 34 and as you know we have issued a target of 30, which we will commit, we will achieve by the end of first quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>So we by the way believe that we have made progress towards our leverage ratio target, but definitely looking into the current market environment  we've really stepped out now out, stepped up our efforts to really attack our balance sheet size because I think that will be Deutsche Bank's way to achieve this. 30 will be more on the side of the balance sheet size reduction and on any need for product capitalization.</p>
          <p>So let me now go into the segment results and I think I can cover this fairly quickly. So I start on page 16, with CB&amp;S in summary. Performance was substantially impacted by the described markdowns of 1.2 billion. We had a positive impact from IAS of about 800 million with losses obviously on prop trading related activities of 1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>And that obviously, as you know, we had in general lower market activity particularly in origination and advisory. But as you know, third quarter traditionally, last year was an exception, but third quarter traditionally our weaker quarter in the calendarization of the year.</p>
          <p>Especially in the CB&amp;S, we have committed and we committed to further de-leverage the business. And we certainly will cut into some of our asset base and we will recalibrate certain businesses within our CB&amp;S businesses.</p>
          <p>And now let me go into some of the respective businesses and trading debt. We definitely had a very challenging quarter. The third quarter included markdowns of some 700 million and trading losses of some 900 million in our credit prop business.</p>
          <p>So revenues in foreign exchange money markets and interest rates products were a record by the way for the third quarter, as we saw very strong client flows and favorable positioning. So there are good news and bad news we've seen in this business.</p>
          <p>On page 18, as we move on, Sales &amp; Trading equity has been impacted in -- by losses in equity prop trading of about &#x20AC;384 million. Additionally, obviously we faced continued increase in correlation and significantly higher volatility which affected certainly our derivatives businesses.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, our prime brokerage business benefited from continued client migration towards our platform, the famous flights to quality that we've observed in the markets over the last couple of weeks and months.</p>
          <p>On page 19, we cover Origination &amp; Advisory, revenues of new business were down significantly -- in significantly weaker market and we also absorbed few markdowns of 467 million on our leverage finance exposure despite the fact, also here we have some good news to the bad news, we have -- the markets are pretty weak but our market share has significantly improved. So we continue to be as successful as you can be in current markets in this area.</p>
          <p>Page 20, we cover our stable businesses. And again, we clearly stand by our strategy even and I think that it's verified in current markets, that we will continue to build up stable businesses. And even during these exceptionally disrupted markets in the third quarter, our stable businesses did perform very well. Also they were impacted by some exceptional items. We had some losses on seed capital investment. There was some support to money market funds. On the year guidance, there were some charges related to the reclassification of some RREEF infrastructure investments.</p>
          <p>Now we talked about and you are familiar with the Auction Rate Securities settlement charge that we had to take. And therefore adjusted for these specific items, the pre-tax profit would have been &#x20AC;714 million.</p>
          <p>So now let me go through these businesses quickly one by one. I'll start with GTB. It's really a success story that continues, a truly unbelievable success story. We have seen continued revenue and profit growth driven by the growth in trade finance and a flight to quality in cash management, which have continued to strengthen and further develop our GTB business.</p>
          <p>If I move on to page 22, to our Assets and Wealth Management business performance certainly was impacted by lower performance in asset-based fees resulting from the current market environment and specific items that I already alluded to, the losses on seed capital investments, the money market fund injections that we inevitably had to do. Inevitably, also as I mentioned, has been affected by money market fund outflows, they amounted to 11 billion in Q3.</p>
          <p>I think that the market effect that we've seen with many in this area based on insecurity, but on the other hand after all this government action we have seen this now ease down.</p>
          <p>Then we certainly have these charges related to the reclassification of our -- of this RREEF infrastructure investment and I think we had also to take the auction rate securities provision in our PWM business. But also here some good news, there is strong net new money inflows of 6 billion in the third quarter in PBM.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to page 23 and to go into in our PBC business and it's really good to see that we have a very resilient top line despite a decrease in brokerage, which was on other hand mitigated by the launch of some successful portfolio management campaign.</p>
          <p>Our provision for credit losses reflects the growth strategy in Poland on the one hand so we had to take some additional charges there. But also we had to take some additional charges due to the weaker credit environment in Spain.</p>
          <p>So despite the difficult market conditions we gathered net money of 3 billion for Q3 and 10 billion year-to-date, mainly driven by more deposits that we've been able to gather, which in this time and age is a good thing to have, and we have been able to grow our client base by some 237,000 added new customers.</p>
          <p>Page 24 briefly describes our corporate investment and our results reflect gains on the sales of Allianz and lender shares that we did. However, these both gains are significantly below the previous year quarter, which also included a positive mark-to-market impact on our option to increase our stake in HuaXia. As you know in 2008, we only had 1 million impact from HuaXia in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>So let me move on now to the last part of the presentation to our risk capital and liquidity management. And let me start with our Tier I ratio. Our risk-weighted assets by the way, as you see in the chart, were mainly up due to foreign exchange effects. And again, to discreetly remind everybody, we have increased our Tier I target to 10%. The reason management team of Deutsche Bank decided to do that is that, as we look into the current environment, we thought it's got to intensify our capital and to be prepared for the upcoming months. And currently we do believe that with the Tier 1 of 10% we should be fine to survive the coming months and quarters.</p>
          <p>That's why we increased it and definitely we are also proud that we already overachieved this target. But as you all know, we have the ex -cise issue in this number, which some of it we will need in Q1 '09 in relationship to the acquisition of the stake of Postbank. But we believe in this 10% ratio even after Postbank, certainly we will commit to achieving this Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>On page 27, let me give you some insight into our funding situation. And we've here highlighted the unsecured funding base. On the liquidity side, we really can say that, as you saw on chart, we now only have 70 -- a position of 75 billion, which represents 14% of the unsecured funding base in total. Of this 75%, we really can say that the largest part, 86%, is covered by deposits or other capital market instruments, so it's not a concerned to us.</p>
          <p>And on the remaining 14%, which is a short, it is really completely covered by our liquidity reserves. So that I can really say we are, in the Board of Deutsche Bank, it's not at all concerned about our funding situation. I think definitely we continue to add strength there.</p>
          <p>Access was consistently strong throughout the quarter. Base concentrated in the overnight through the end of September and early October. Term availability has loosened in the past two weeks, helped by the steepening LIBOR curve.</p>
          <p>We are very -- we were very conservatively positioned in early September before this crisis intensified. And we consistently are putting cash into the market, therefore able to absorb stresses such as <mark type="inaudible" /> bank draws.</p>
          <p>And a term availability has now improved, we have reestablished our early September positioning on a night-to-night basis. And therefore, I think we continue to -- that we are in a strong position in terms of our funding position.</p>
          <p>And we move on now to page 28 where we discuss and provide some information about our provisions. And the provisions in our CID business were impacted by the move of the trading book assets to the banking book, the IAS 39 effect. Obviously, and we've disclosed this view separately, we've shown you that we've been -- had to take 72 billion in this reclassification effect. It's about 36 million for the European mortgage book. It's 31 million for our senior counterparty relationship. And it's about 5 million for the US leveraged finance portfolio.</p>
          <p>And in the PBC section I already told you that there the main two effects are the increase in business in Poland and there were some credit quality that we observe all over the place but it's significant only and material only in our Spanish business.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to page 29. Problem loans were up a 164 million for the quarter mainly due to 164 million of new problem loans reflecting the IAS 39 reclassification and also our coverage ratio impacted by a technical effect relating to this reclassification.</p>
          <p>And so I think therefore I will be at the end of prepared remarks and I'm looking forward to any questions you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>The first question is from Mr. Rohr. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, very good morning. It's Michael from MainFirst in Frankfurt. It's, just few questions from my side, please. First of all, if you can tell us what you expect as the fair value impact on the acquisition on Postbank in Q1 and probably detail a bit how that splits into the option and potentially the stake and the fair value adjustment on that one. Another question is on the dividend, you accrued 225 in the first half and now it's probably nothing. So if you can just give us an indication of what you expect for the remainder of this year, if we can expect a 225 dividend for the year or probably something lower than that. And a final one would be on your statement with regards to potentially take off of the German rescue package? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Michael. Thank you very much for your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the fair value of Postbank question. We will probably not account fair value for this position -- for the transaction. So therefore I think that there will be no fair value impact in that sense. The accounting treatment will be value in use and that we would just have a different treatment on that. On your dividend question, it was clear that the reason we decided to accrue versus prior year is that, as corporate German covered governance, our view is we will make this decision in January of '09, what our dividend policy will be overall. So the best thing normally is you accrue the previous year dividends, you accrue for it, that's I think the best way not to give any indication to take any early decision on what your dividend policy will exactly be. But obviously we now notice as we moved into the second half of the year and we look at how that has developed it would have been unrealistic to accrue for a 450 dividend. So we just decided in Q3 to stop dividend to accrual. It's very difficult to make a judgment how Q4 will now look like. It's therefore also very difficult to make an assessment where our dividend should end up being. But we know that a 450 dividend would have not made sense. And again in January the Board will then make a proposal to Supervisory Board and for decision at the AGM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everyone. Just -- can I just pursue this line about capital? You've obviously always made a virtue of the fact you haven't taken fair value of your own debt. But I noticed on page 44, you now include the fair value own debt in your definition of the leverage ratio, which you have updated since you presented it three weeks ago. So, four quick questions.</p>
          <p>The first is, I understand that the core leverage ratio that the US broker dealers now have to hit is about, is over 5%. They do include the fair value of own debt, but their ratios are 5.5 to 6% compared to maybe your 2.7. So question one is if you feel the US definition's appropriate, why don't you feel that 20 times, around 30 times is appropriate?</p>
          <p>Okay, question two is that, on the other hand, UBS Credit Suisse and we understand Barclays do not include the fair value own debt in their Tier-1 leverage ratio. That by implication would mean your Tier-1 leverage ratio is about 2.4 or about 41 times gross leverage. So the second is, if you are going to viewed more by European pay group, to what extent does that concern you or concern the rating agencies that you'll be now at least 10 or 11 notches higher than the target for the other European banks.</p>
          <p>Thirdly would be, to what extent have you discussed this ratio with the German regulators? Is it -- some investors I think will understand that the view is slightly pick and mix of US and Europe since you first presented it.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, your ratio obviously does somewhat flattered by the capital rates for the Deutsche Postbank. You also said by Q1 '09, you want to reduce it. I just wonder why you are so, dogmatically you don't to raise capital in the view of what is an extraordinary challenging environment and obviously which was a very tough quarter also for you as an investment bank. Would it not be, is there not a case at least to say, that it actually may reduce risk and actually put you on a slightly better position to win market share and actually take share in a very challenging market? Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. And I think you're at the heart of the big issue that we have been seeing over the last couple of months. This is endless discussions about comparisons of this leverage ratio. And to be honest, we have tried for a long period of time to explain to the market the differences. And to be honest with you, we have given up to some extent because we have seen that in most of the comparisons that are done between especially -- and we constantly get selectively, we get compared against sometimes the US peers, then we get compared against the European peers. Always the kind of find the hair in the soup type concept.</p>
          <p>And to be honest, if we go through the process, I would first say we are, continue to committed to our Basel II Tier-1 definition, that's what our regulators care about. That's what we manage business towards. We have increased the target to tell the market we're well capitalized and we don't know where the target for business model like ours will be over time. That's -- we have a discussion on the regulation side. We will wait if there's any change coming to that, but at this point, we feel that a 10% ratio is a good ratio to have. So that's what we continue to manage our business towards. That's what we continue to discuss with our regulators. And we have not changed anything on that definition and continue our current definitions and accounting practices towards that Tier-1 ratio.</p>
          <p>On the second time, but then when we look at our balance sheet issues, that's the one you exclude from your commentary. Or you look at our -- this prevailing of debt issue, we have to recognize that we are very often compared and we were compared with leverage ratios of 50 and leverage ratios of 45 and so on versus peers to 30 and this was not apples-to-apples comparison. So to be honest, with providing you this definition, we're trying to come as close to what we understand the competitive environment to be. Now again, this may be a good number, but it's still, it's not the best and not the perfect number, we'll admit it in a minute. And that there is obviously definitions that you could look at and differences you could at. And the biggest definition that regretfully the total balance sheet leverage ratios don't take out is the difference in business model. That's why we like Tier-1 key ratios as a market comparison because they take out the business model and exactly your question you asked, you compare us against plain and pure breed investment banks, which we're not, okay. And therefore, your comparison numbers just don't comply.</p>
          <p>Let me -- why don't you compare us to the other German retail banks, as an example. There our leverage ratio looks I think pretty good and our Tier-I ratios look pretty good. So we see this endless discussion on how to compare and I can only say we believe and I really give you this assessment that we are well-capitalized. That we have been able to access capital markets when we needed them, and we will not do stupid capital issuance when they are costly in our minds, we don't need it or we don't want to be driven to this situation. And that if you do -- if you now take all the possible comparisons, and that's what we tried to point out in the chart, I think we're in the middle of the pack as far as our total leverage balance sheet situation. And also, on our Tier-I, we are also in a very good and strong position. But I think we would really like to end this endless discussion on comparisons because at the end we should go at the bottom of it, which is we're trying to measure risk and risk protection here. And we can only say that we feel very comfortable with the position that we are in.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Well, thanks for as much. I do think in the States that the, it's pretty clear post the broker deals between BHCs, it is now a Tier-1 leverage ratio rather than a gross leverage. So maybe that's something we can talk about offline because I think it is clear that that is now the European and the US standard, which is, is still somewhat different from what you put in pack, but we can talk about it offline.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi. First of all, could you just talk about your CDS gain against your loan book; I couldn't find that in your statement, maybe I missed that. And your fixed income number underlying was very strong, a &#x20AC;2.5 billion ex any write-downs, markdowns, prop trading. You talk about favorable market positioning, could you just comment on how much that could be in that number? And how we should look at that number going forward, if you could talk a little bit about trends? Lastly, if I could just maybe add one more. You talked about recalibration of this CB&amp;S business; I would be interested about capital movements between sub-divisions in the investment banks. How do you see your investment banking business changing over two, three years considering the decline in the structured credit and equity structured business?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks Kian for your question. We're trying to find you the numbers here. That's why, let me maybe go first into this issue of what you called the recalibration of businesses. What we mean with recalibration of business is that we happen to do looking at the current market situation, but we really mean we will -- we are taking a look at the balance sheet as the individual balance sheet position. Certainly, we'll cut or limit balance sheet. That's what we mean with it when we talk about recalibration. We will look at expenses and we also look at the resources deployed in these businesses. And certainly, as we've seen this significant market movement, we have to do some adjustments there in terms recalibrating some of these businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Does that mean that capital in the investment bank could be reduced on an absolute basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not capital. First of all, our view was that to reduce positions and exposure and put cap on certain balance sheet sizes, not necessarily capital reductions. Okay. So, your other questions were the fixed income?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, all I can say in these uncertain times in terms of predicting how this will be on a forward basis, very difficult to predict. We're happy to see this strong. But this has been, as I've tried to outline in your presentation, the story alone. We have this good news, bad news. Sorry, we have -- we continue to have some good underlying business, good underlying performance as well as bad one. So, will I endeavor to make a forecasting here, probably not? I shouldn't be doing this in these times and ages. And on those numbers you requested, it looks like we'll have to get back to you after the call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You might wish otherwise, but I'm afraid that's how it is. You're asking us to rely on the US GAAP equivalent asset figure. So I wonder if you could -- could you give us a pro forma for what that'll look like at the end of '07 and for 2Q '08, that's my first question. Second question, if you're relying on the, on a notional gain on your own debt for this new leverage ratio target, why don't you book it in your accounts? If intellectually you're saying that's the right thing to do, why don't you book it in and then we know it's an audited number?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's -- number one I don't know if we have this number here now with us, so we might have to provide you this number so -- we may have the 2007 number so...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>After the call. But on the other discussion, again, we believe that we shouldn't  evaluate our own debt. Okay? But as we have seen, all the ratios out there not, when they do the comparisons and when we see the write-ups about Deutsche Bank arguing that we are not well capitalized, that we especially don't have the severances. They don't, all these comparisons don't take out our specific business model, don't take out this inflated, if you so will, balance sheet that we have under our IFRS accounting. And they don't take out any comparison to our peers the fair valuing. So we've decided to provide a comparable number.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget -- and again I stand by what we say, we will continue to manage our business through risk-weighted assets that we believe, and it's the right method to use to assess risk. And we'll continue to manage our business to Tier I and we'll continue not to fair value our debt because we don't believe it, it will come back. We don't believe it's a true economic value you should be looking into and therefore the fact that in one number here, just for comparative purposes to make it easier for the market to understand where we really stand, we do this clean-up. It just doesn't mean that we necessarily believe it and therefore I don't believe that we should be accounting for it to be very frank and honest. But if everybody else is doing it and we are just getting hammered in the marketplace negatively and we have not been able to put that point out for the understanding, we need to put out a number that is in our mind the best number we can produce now to try to help you. To make your jobs better, to make and try to help you maybe, to put out this comparable number. So that's all we can really -- I can really say to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just to be clear, I think you're making a fair point about the distinction on the accounting and on the gains on own debt. So it is a fair point, and I think as you say, it will help us if you keep disclosing that number so that we can at least look at it comparatively.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Matthew Czepliewicz, HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. So it's a question about your IAS 39 reclassifications. If I just run through the numbers quickly, I guess you had 8.1 in leverage finance, 13 Commercial Real Estate, 95 in consolidated CP conduit assets reclassifications. And then miscellaneous was the other. And it's an open-ended question but it is, how much scope for interpretation or discretion is there in these new guidelines? And do you feel that you could have been more inclusive or you're more selective than you needed to be? In other words, looking ahead how much further scope might there be for a kind of almost retroactive application, a more intense application if need arise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Thanks for your question, Matthew. And I think I absolutely understand your concern there because it is something that's changed. It is something and that was also one of our concerns. It hopefully doesn't lead to perceptions that this is something where you now have a wide open door to do whatever you want. So it is important for us that there was no -- there is really no big room for interpretation. And it's the same, number one on our accounting policy rigor and the same auditing rigor was put onto those or told it had to be done in a very short timeframe. As you know, this change was just announced in this month and we certainly didn't have a whole lot of time. But I can only tell you that we really put in all the -- we put in the DB accounting policy. We decided on how we select those assets and we've had this fully audited. And it was implemented with the same rigor we had in the approval process of it, that we implemented it very strict because I do -- the CFO of Deutsche Bank absolutely share your concern that this isn't hopefully misused in terms of giving a lot of flexibility. And that was our guiding principle.</p>
          <p>Now, it doesn't have and that, one of the concerns that you raised is retroactive. Let's not forget that the retroactive nature to this July 1st was only for this quarter and close. That doesn't exist anymore. In the future, if these circumstances and the criteria for reclassification are met, then we will have to reclassify at the current value at the date of the transfer, which therefore obviously then at the end doesn't have that similar impact it had in Q3. That will remain a one-time impact we've had.</p>
          <p>Now what we did when we selected these assets. We, number one, there were two criteria we very strongly look at it, is did the business intent really change. Is it really the business intent was a real change business intent, or is the original intent, for example, to trade, to continue to trade certain positions in the near future for example just to hold them for a brief time and then trade them again. If that criteria was met, the business intent is really to hold them now. Because for example there is dislocated market, there's no market activity going on. That was first one.</p>
          <p>And then we had an end criteria, so that wasn't enough, just the fact that we were trying to -- that the business intent changed, but we, second we definitely wanted to say that the quality, the intrinsic quality of that asset was not reflected anymore in any fair value markets that were available.</p>
          <p>And why is that important to us? Because that's where we go back to say, the effort, what we've done now is a more proper treatment. Number one, we're aligned to what the business intent is, and number two we have -- we will not force the business to sell assets at a value way under the intrinsic value of this asset. I think it was the valid biggest criticism under the past IFRS practice. And that to some extent, we had to accept that increased some off the market downturn that we have seen in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>So therefore, I can only tell you, it was a strict process. It is -- we have very strong guidelines on it. We have it audited by KPMG. And this one effect we've had in Q3 will not repeat as we move on, as we go further. We will classify assets differently, fine, but they will obviously not be at the P&amp;L impact immediately.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Could I maybe ask one follow-up to that and I don't know whether this question actually makes sense. But of the assets transferred, is it possible to give us kind of an average duration of the portfolio given the intent to hold now.</p>

          <p>Just quickly on two areas. First one on the prop trading losses both in the equity and the fixed income business. If you can give us any more clarity or color on what the reason and the cause was for those, whether there were any particular single exposures so we can get comfort that those should not be recurring. And also whether it's prompted any change at all in your risk appetite, whether we should expect a lower capital allocated towards this type of proprietary activities going forward and hence any impact that could have on revenues. Secondly just to clarify on the Postbank situation. So should -- should there not be any impact on Deutsche Bank's capital position from the change in the share price of Deutsche Postbank, either through the option or through the stake as such. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank You. Thank you, Chris, for the question and you can assume that we did expect this question to certainly come up, and it was -- it is also for us. As you know, our global market business model, we've always consistently emphasized this management of basis risk rather than the assumption of outside exposure to market direction, both in our customer phasing and designated prototype components. So we know what our view on this strategy was, as we communicated to you. And obviously we also have to see looking back that this strategy now has generated superior profitability for several years and really allowed us to escape the worst effect of the global financial crisis in the year-end to August of '08.</p>
          <p>Now what has happened however is that basic relationships and again this unprecedented disruption in the weeks since the Lehman Brothers fight for bankruptcy. And this collapse of a major prime broker and custodian of this hedge fund community caused a sudden and affective withdrawal of capital from this sector, as you know. Funds facing rising margin calls and growing investor redemption, in our view, were forced to liquidate relative value positions, driving certainly, as you know, valuations of formerly well-hedged positions to all-time lows.</p>
          <p>While we've made every effort to reduce risk that was possible, the result of this market disruption was profoundly negative, particularly for our designated prop trading groups both in credit and equity. So at the end, a strategy that has worked very well for the bank -- in what we call normal markets and even worked well in somewhat disturbed markets, is now the latest market hits, didn't work well anymore. We have to admit that.</p>
          <p>So therefore we have now targeted to and are currently working on consistently cutting our risk exposure and reducing our capital commitment to prop trading and we could continue to do that. And therefore we basically -- and that's what we say are reacting to these substantial losses that we're suffering that we know that we have to recalibrate this business. I gave you the definition of what we call a recalibration of this business, that we both look in terms of cutting assets, looking at our cost in this area and also re-deploying our resources.</p>
          <p>So our equity prop trading group is composed overwhelming of convertible arbitrage and equity long-short strategies. Now our credit proprietary trading unit is mostly a credit-related value group. Unfortunately you see these strategies again have performed particularly poorly since Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on September 15 and that's certainly for us also new development and that's why we've taken management action to restrict and correct this.</p>
          <p>On your Postbank question, we will have no impact on capital before the expected closing on Q1 anyway.</p>

          <p>It will not be in. And we will have obviously an expected impact in Q1 of about 62 basis points, that is related us to the fact that we will have to buy the stake. And as you know we went for the capital raise in the last couple of weeks and...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's unrelated to the share price. And the impairment question, again we will use this value-in-use concept. It's not a fair value concept. That doesn't mean by the way that there will be no impact. We will have to prove that the value in use of the business. Yeah?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we will have to do an impairment test on Postbank at that point in time. Now the good news and I think that's what we also got out of their Q3 conference call, is that their underlying business model continues to be strong and continues to be performing. They have been hit by also extraordinary effects so the value-in-use concept will obviously be determined by how well their underlying profit is and how realistic their ongoing business plan is as you look into it. And at this point I will venture to say, Postbank continues to have our support. We are very, continue to be very interested for strategic reasons in that stake acquisition and at this point we didn't see anything in the business model that would cause us to be concerned of suffering significant impairments.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Allow me to come back to the capital point. Basically, I'd like to know what could actually trigger a change in your thinking. Would it be significant losses? Would it be if it was imposed on you? What could make you take a different view on whether you need a capital strengthening? And the second thing is related, it's regarding this leverage ratio. The way you describe it, it looks as if this was a number given to the equity market to please people and to lower their risk in terms of definitions used. Is this being looked at by rating agencies, by a regulator too, or is this basically just a number for us? And if I strip out -- if I assume the gain on own debt would revert back over time, could you nevertheless comment which asset categories are subject for reductions and what could be the potential P&amp;L implication? Because if this was rather a soft view or a soft target given to people to please them, achieving this might have significant implications for your profitability. If you just could comment on that area too. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Philipp, thanks for your question. And you put a nice spin to it, but I really like to take that spin out of it because it was not to please people but it was to provide a comparable number. I think we have an obligation to you and to capital market to disclose and to give you the right numbers. And -- we have tried to initially describe the differences and we thought that this difference will be taken into account when making the risk assessment Deutsche Bank. And regretfully we have to observe that they are not being taken into account.</p>
          <p>So to some extent that's why we put out a number, and yes -- to answer very clearly I said this is the number that we've put out there to address market concerns. Yeah, it is not a number that we need to -- to be honest in the discussions with our rating agencies, it's not the number we need to in discussions with any of other constituencies because they understand the risk-weighted concept. They understand the differences in our accounting, and they at the end assess the risk situation of Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>And we are a bank with a Tier-1 ratio of 10% now. You can find a few ones that are above 10 and that you can find lots of them well below this number, and what we want to say is that we are at this point not concerned. Now you say what could trigger a change in view. To be honest, we don't believe at this point that we need to further capitalize the business, nor do we believe that we will be forced into, because anybody looking into the numbers will understand that the issue and that's something we agree with you and that's something we certainly took away from this discussion is we need to attack our leverage situation from the balance sheet side of the equation, not from the capital side of the equation. And that's why we wanted to make a strong commitment that we are going to do it.</p>
          <p>Regretfully our initial efforts for this quarter, which resulted in a cut of this 103 billion in assets, were taken away by foreign exchange and derivative valuation and increases in our balance sheet. So we regretfully couldn't proudfully show you reduction on the balance sheet at this around. But the issue and the focus of the management and we have given targets out to businesses in order to reduce balance sheet size. And that's mainly, if we look into the risk aspect -- if we look back into the crisis, we had some positions, we have to admit, that in their size were just too big of what we may and should have had in such a situation and that's something we took away. So I think the answer to the concern of the market on this leverage ratio in Deutsche Bank is related to our balance sheet size. And therefore, we are very committed and that's why we put also this number out as a commitment and we will continue to -- when you talk about what Postbank will mean to our Tier-1, yes of course, we will have an outflow there. But at the same time we expect to reduce our balance sheet size and reduce risk-weighted assets with this as we move along.</p>
          <p>So that's kind of where we would like you to look at Deutsche Bank, that's the task at hand. And that's, I think there's a strong commitment of the management team to achieve it and that's why we are concerned, saying that we don't need to change any views or anything will trigger our change of views as long as we continue this process of reducing our balance sheet size.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what will be the areas -- which areas will be reduced on the balance sheet because if we -- if they gain on own debt reverses over time, your target still implies a significant reduction. You obviously attached a timeline to it today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have -- I will not go into the single individual areas because that's work in progress that we are doing. But what I will give you because there is some concern that if we now go into further reductions, it will also cut significantly into profit. And I will tell you, we do have some areas in our balance sheet that the marginal rate of returns is, it's not there where it should be. And therefore we don't think that these sort of cuts, by the way, that we could even increase also the quality of our profits by reducing and cutting into some of these assets. Two-thirds of our assets are fair values. So we have a large group of assets to be able to look at.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'll try to be quick. One question is on your risk provisions. Did you change your expected loss forecast? And if so, maybe you could give us the new expected loss number that you have? And secondly, you've been pretty adamant about not taking up sort of like capital injections from the government, but maybe you can comment on the term funding guarantee, whether or not that would sort of like apply to you, particularly in the context of sort of like the competitive landscape in you. But I mean, if you are not taking it up and others are, then obviously you have different funding levels versus your competitors going forward. Maybe if you can just shortly comment on that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the -- to be honest, on our risk provisions, no, there is no change. And there's no change in target now, unchanged. We had a little technical effect due to the 39 reclassification. It's a mathematical effect, that's why the coverage went down. But if we were to take out that mathematical effect that re-class shows we would be at comparable levels and to previous -- to the previous levels and there is no real change. And the model itself is completely unchanged. So no change to report there.</p>
          <p>Let's go back to this discussion on what would that be a competitive disadvantage. We feel there will be a competitive disadvantage if we undercapitalize and people have concerns of such thing and there would be a competitive disadvantage if we had funding problems. And I think, on these two issues we have tried to outline that we feel very comfortable where Deutsche Bank at this point in time. So that was -- that's really I would leave these comments at that. I think we have no concern and as we move along we don't fear a competitive disadvantage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if I can go -- come back to this, I don't -- this is what it means of like funding needs small sort of like the spreads at which you can fund in the market vis-&#xE0;-vis sort of like the government guaranteed funding for other banks. Wouldn't that put you sort of like at a competitive disadvantage, not with regards to sort of like the funding that you need, but with regards to the spreads at which you can fund? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's something we have to continue to monitor and see, yes, we've seen some negative development in the last couple of days. But it's also eased down again somewhat. So we'll have to continue to look into it. And at the end we believe that the funding cost will be determined on how we have perceived this then as an individual credit and as we move on and continue this process to reduce our balance sheet and therefore proves that the bank continues to have strength that certainly our TDS's will go back in line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just in two areas. On the risk-weighted assets and the market risk-weighted assets, which are pretty stable, could you just talk about what you think could happen post-incremental risk charge coming in on deposits too? But more importantly how what you've done on the reclassification could affect risk-weighted assets? I don't know if it means that you wouldn't have so much of a problem on market risk-weighted assets going forward because you've moved them out or what's going on credit risk-weighted assets as a result. And a just second area, just costs, if I look in investment bank the costs are again pretty low and it looks like you're passing on the prop losses and write-downs to your staff relative to others. I mean could you just talk about how you see bonuses panning out and your attitude toward how much pain you're going to pass on to your staff? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start with your risk-weighted assets. Number one, the reclass, of course, had an impact on risk-weighted assets of about 2 billion. Additional risk-weighted assets that were generated through this approximately 25 billion of assets being reclassified. And on the risk-weighted assets, now you're absolutely right, that was a change we expected in the market. And we have done some testing on it and we would believe that in aggregate this would mean an approximate of about 50 billion in additional risk-weighted assets by the year 2010-2011, just to give you a size number of that impact. Your other question was on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the attitude to cost, particularly in the investment bank. <mark type="inaudible" /> bonus approval looks very like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the bonus investment. As you have heard, bonus news on Deutsche Bank, we are cutting all over the place. And definitely, it's something that we just acknowledge the current performance situation of the bank and I think -- we think it's fair and acceptable that we need to reduce bonuses. But we also have to be realistic. We are in a competitive environment. The only thing that will help us to drag our business and continue strengthen business out of this crisis is we need good people that develop profitable business and generate revenue.</p>
          <p>So we will not do anything that really harms our platform. And therefore, this is a balancing act that we are working through. And certainly, it is, that will be, as we move now into the end of the year, a very challenging question. We need to protect our platform. We need to keep the people that can help us to continue to survive this crisis as well. We need to honor their good performance. That's because we have -- as of positive fact in the paper, we have lots of parts of the bank where we have exceptionally good performance right now. And therefore we need to certainly honor them.</p>
          <p>But we also have acknowledge the group and shareholder situation right now. And therefore that's the balancing act, so that's why, as you know, we've taken at least the decision at the management levels of Deutsche Bank. We'll forego the bonuses because I think we have to accept the responsibility for running the business and accept the responsibility for running business in difficult time. But -- at a individual level and the individual business level, we have to make very cautious decisions because we understand the competitive environment.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Could I just double-check what you said about risk-weighted assets? So is that basically the 21 billion goes to 71 billion approximately.

          <p>The answer to your question is, yes. There was exactly the intent to get it as close as possible to a comparable number. So in order to support your analysis and your views we have a number that is truly comparable. We have been working it. We have refined but there was no big, to be honest, we had -- I described in my presentation, the balance sheet part of it. We described the fair value part of it. These are two material part of it but in equity there is not a substantial difference.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Stuart Graham, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Hello there. I have two questions please. Sorry-- coming back to capital again. Your 10% Tier 1 target, if I look at your peers, the US and Swiss guys, the guys that you put on slide 13 who I guess you regard as your peers. They're all much higher than 10%. I think the average is 13.7. So a 10% target would put you at the bottom end of that peer group range. I just wanted to understand, are your saying they're overcapitalized or are you saying you've got a better business model and that's why you're to be at the low end of that. That's the question one.</p>
          <p>And then question two is on the IAS 39, the two points you made about has the business intent changed and is the intrinsic value not there. The fact that you give us a very precise figure of what it would have been, hadn't you changed it, shows you can quantify the value of these assets. So clearly the factor is the intrinsic value you don't believe is there. And I wonder if you could maybe just talk us through how you actually come to a view on which assets are correctly, intrinsically valued and which assets are not. If you could just talk us through that process? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Let me start on your 10% -- I must -- it's quite interesting how we see this because it's a relative question. And now I would ask back a question to you. What is the right number for right now? Not too long ago we had a large -- long discussions that many banks were overcapitalized and this is not even two years ago. Yeah? So the question really comes back is the assessment that we have to do, what's the right capital? Is it now -- will it now be 10%, will it be 15%, will it 13%, et cetera. So you can compare it, yes, you can say that where we are, but we do many comparisons.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the mix of our business model between -- whilst the investment -- if the average is 10.3 and if I look at what our peers on the retail banking side, for example, on the stable businesses, on the slow business side have versus what the investment banks have, and we've take an average out of it. We feel comfortable with the 10% right now. Yeah? Even in our market comparison. Do we have to improve this situation? Would it be wise to improve this situation? That's exactly what we're saying by saying that we have to reduce our balance sheet size and therefore getting to a better ratio. And that's certainly the commitment of the management team that at this point in time, with this market volatility, with that amount of risk out there, it is a good idea to continue to work on.</p>
          <p>So -- at the same time we're saying we're not uncomfortable with the position we are on right now. At the same time we're saying we're continuously working on it to further improve it. But what will be the right number? We don't know yet. But in our business model as compared -- don't forget the mix that we have between, for example, a large retail bank operation and the investment bank, we just feel comfortable, if you were to average what's out there in comparable basis that we at this point are certainly fine. But we will continue to work on it.</p>
          <p>On the IAS 39, I think you -- I mean it's good -- we quantify it because we wanted to give you a fair disclosure. How good is that number after qualification? Well, it's subject to the same unavailable market prices that are out there. It's subject to the same questions that you would -- should probably raise on the level three assets. How good are your parameters that you use? Yeah? So you probably, if we put out a number, you would have questioned are your parameters okay and is this number correct one? It's the best number we have based on the information that we can and we did want to provide a number as clear cut as we could to give you a sense of what the impact is.</p>
          <p>But could you challenge this number and could you question whether these are the right parameters that we use or not <mark type="inaudible" />. So to say that this is an exact number and therefore to say that we do have a value for these assets would be turning the arguments around from the backside in my mind. We just wanted to give you an idea of what about this valuation difference would be or could be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I appreciate that. Thank you for the number. My question was more -- in that process where you're looking at positions and you're saying, okay, we think that's an intrinsic value, we don't think that's an intrinsic value. Can you just talk us through that very fine line between how one position could get picked up as okay and one position you could say that's not intrinsic fair value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we &#x2013; it wasn't really an asset, it wasn't a position by position analysis and it wasn't a step by step process and at the end it was business judgment. It was the discussion with all business partners to come to this judgment. Are these positions judgmental? Yes certainly they are, to some extent, but at the end our business judgment of what we believe, what the intrinsic value truly can be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. Firstly, on the leverage finance book. You're currently valuing your book at $0.88 on the dollar as I understand it? JPMorgan has marked its book at $0.71 cents on the dollar, Credit Suisse below $0.75 on the dollar, SNP, LCD Industries are in the high 60s. How would you account for such a large difference and if so can you provide some more color? And secondly, on the capital question in my perspective your core Tier 1 on a pro-forma basis with Postbank looks to be something like 6.9%. Banks with much lesser dependence on investment banking are aiming for 8 or higher? Is core Tier 1 something that you care about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let's start with your markings on the leverage finance book. Again, after the reclassification according to IAS 39, we have 11.9 billion left, of which 10.5 billion are unfunded. And they, only to describe to you what's in this portfolio and they basically represent two main transactions. And that's why our valuation principle is based on looking into those two main transactions. That's why we don't really look so much into overall. Or I think, it's not helpful to look into overall portfolio averages in that sense and compare them because we know exactly these two transactions, we know them exactly and we value them individually. And it comes out to be this portfolio average we have. And that's, I think, we're finally marked with it. And I think, there is no more to say to that. I think that, our project is correct and finally we should not apply a portfolio aspect to it.</p>
          <p>And on capital, of course, we continue to be believe on core Tier 1, -- but obviously Tier 1 is the figure that we manage towards, Tier 1 &#x2013; hybrids are available to protect us against losses as well. But of course, we look and we have to look. In turn, it's certainly good to know there's a system in place that we have to look <mark type="inaudible" /> limits on core Tier 1. But in our view, what are we trying to achieve here is, managing risk and managing the exposure of the bank. And therefore, I think, it's the right thing to look at all the instruments available in case of substantial default. Okay.</p>
