          <p>Good afternoon. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the UniCredit Second Quarter 2011 Group Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Federico Ghizzoni, Chief Executive Officer of UniCredit. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good afternoon everybody, and welcome to our presentation. So let's start as usual with the executive summary and then we will go through more details flipping through the slides.</p>
          <p>So the first half net profit is &#x20AC;1.3 billion nearly double year-on-year. Second Q net profit, &#x20AC;511 million, it's minus 33% quarter-on-quarter but is three times better than the second quarter '10. The performance has been affected principally by the impairment of Greek's bonds portfolio for a gross of &#x20AC;135 million, net &#x20AC;105 million. And the result comes from revenues down quarter-on-quarter reflecting trading income that is back to a more normalized level versus the peak of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Costs up 1.7% mostly due to seasonal trend we will see later on. It's worth to remind that net of bank levies, year-on-year, we have a decline of 0.5% and loan loss provision that are dropping 21.5% quarter-on-quarter driven by the impaired loans stabilization. Cost of risk is down 24 basis points with all division and region improving.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet structures remain very solid. Leverage ratio is below 21. We have an encouraging trend on asset quality with the decreased impaired stocks in Germany and Austria, deceleration in Central and Eastern European and stabilization in Italy. Good news is about the coverage ratio that is increasing for the second quarter in a row.</p>
          <p>Finally, funding plan, it has been almost completed, leveraging on diversified sources by geographies and type and we are now ready to pre-fund the run off of 2012. Core Tier 1 ratio 9.12%, 6 basis points higher versus previous quarter, mainly through a retained earnings.</p>
          <p>Let's now going now through the slides, page five, is the net profit -- operating profit. As you see, I said already, the net profit is down 37% quarter-on-quarter. Result, as I said already, affected by some one-off principally Greek's bonds portfolio impairments but also the new IRAP that has been increased as you know for which we had &#x20AC;15 million increase this quarter and &#x20AC;15 million that goes back to the first quarter. Year-on-year, it's an increase of almost 100%. The net operating profit is decreasing quarter-on-quarter mainly due to the trading income that is back to normalized level.</p>
          <p>Net operating profit, we see revenues declining again mostly due to trading. Costs up 1.5% mostly, again, driven by seasonal trend in particular we have invested more than previous quarter in marketing. Remind also the campaign we have started in May, and loan loss provision declining 21.5%.</p>
          <p>It's worth to see that Central Eastern Europe including Poland is increasing net operating profit quarter-on-quarter, but also year-on-year, so we have a good trend out there. Revenues, revenues as I said down 6.8%. Trading, we talked already we are down also in term of fees and commission 3.3%, we will have -- that I would like to explain more in detail, net interest income almost stable, again, also in term of revenues, CEE and Poland growing 2.1% quarter-on-quarter, 5.2% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Let's now to look to the various component, net interest almost stable. As I said, there is an increase of 0.5%. This has been positively influenced by some let's say, one-off in CIB in Germany. This is a good result because we have to absorb an increasing funding cost and we have not yet been able to fully register, let's say, our numbers, the increase of Euribor that will kick in finally completely during this current quarter also due to the time lag, especially in Italy, that you have to expect by law in implementation of the repricing.</p>
          <p>Volume is substantially stable. There's a positive trend in Central Eastern Europe. Deposits are growing 1.2%, that considering the present market condition is positive news. Fees and commission, as I said, the trend is negative, is minus 3.3%. The major contribution comes from investment commissions that are down due to the present market condition with individuals, and particularly not interest to invest, but to stay liquid. So, this has influenced the results. Transactional banking as well for the same reason is declining. Poland and CEE, once again, in the opposite trend with an increase of 4.6% quarter-on-quarter and 4.1% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Operating cost increased 1.7%. But, as I said already, if we do the comparison year-on-year and we take away the bank levies that we booked for the first time in 2011, would have been a reduction of 0.5%, and particularly stable the cost of labor, plus 0.4%. The other cost, as I said already, driven up mostly by seasonal effect, so they will go down during the current quarter.</p>
          <p>FTEs, we show declining of 117 quarter-on-quarter. In reality, it would have been higher, precisely 550, because for the first time, we have consolidated some small companies that were not consolidated previously except, obviously, for the cost but not for the FTE. So, the real drop is 550 people, of which 300 is coming from GBS and big offices, the difference from business. It's important to note that if we normalize again year-on-year, we have a reduction of 2,840 people. So, very positive, I would say, very positive trend.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk, cost of risk is down 21.5% quarter-on-quarter. The decline is confirmed also year-on-year as we have 23.4% is as you see is a good trend in all divisions and geographies. Then we will enter more in detail explaining by geography and division what's going on, but overall, the cost of risk is in a positive trend and we think is sustainable.</p>
          <p>Asset quality, we still see a slight increase in term of gross impaired loans, but the speed is much less compared to the past. The coverage ratio is increasing for the second quarter in a row and this, I think, is a very good positive trend. As I said, the improvement is evident in all geographies and particularly, we see Germany and Kazakhstan declining in term of stock, so improving. CEE is stabilizing. Italy, marginal rate of growth is declining. The coverage is up everywhere.</p>
          <p>This slide, page 16, is quite important. It shows that the net addition are constantly declining. The red line is the annualized cost of risk, is below 100 since December '08. So, it's the first quarter that we are below 100. And in term of, let's say, net addition and gross addition, we have reached probably the best level since three years.</p>
          <p>So the trend, as you see, is in the right direction and, as I said, I think is sustainable. Important also these slides, as you can see, considering inflow, outflow, the reverse ratio is improving, is improving constantly quarter-after-quarter we reach 73%, so is another confirmation that the quality of the asset is improving. Moving from 69% to 73% is a good result.</p>
          <p>Also, slide 18 I think it is quite important also to understand the net interest income result. The slide is giving you an information about the average growth in term of loans that has been in the group 0.7%, but because we tried to move the portfolio to the best rating classes starting from the beginning of the year, as you see, in front of an increase of the loans of 0.7%, the best rating classes or the first four grew almost 14%, substantially that we have seen a shift from the lowest classes to the best rating classes. Clearly, this has impacted a bit in the capability to reprice in the first part of this year, but I think that it was good to move in this way the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Significant progress has been done in Italy. As you see, Italy grew average in terms of loans 5.1%, but the best rating classes are increasing 33.7%, so it's a big change. Germany declined 1.8% in terms of loans growth, but increase of 5.9% in the best rating classes, and finally Austria minus 2.3%, increased 1.9%. So, this effort to reshape the portfolio versus the best client is proving to be so far successful.</p>
          <p>I would not go through page 19 is the walk to the net profit. I think we have already seen these numbers. I remind once again that the impairment on Greek bond portfolio, &#x20AC;135 million gross, it has been positively offset partially by the revaluation of the Moscow Stock Exchange done in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now to the balance sheet structure. Nothing special to underline except the fact that in term of leverage ratio we stay below 21 and to remind that the tangible equity per share is above &#x20AC;2. Page 21, again, balance sheet structure, most of this cast not too many changes. So let's say in terms of securities issued, financial investment is stable, a slight improvement on the net interbank position, but again, in this market can change any time, so nothing special also about in this slide.</p>
          <p>Finally, funding page 22, as I said, we have decided some months ago to anticipate our funding plan. We can say that 85% has been realized up to -- at the end of July. So 85% of the original &#x20AC;32 billion realized. If we go to Italy almost 90% of the funding plan has been completed, this give us some confidence looking the future, give us the possibility to start thinking should the market allow to start to pre-fund also the need of 2012. But again, I would like to leave as a main message that 85% of the total group has been done, 90% of the Italy has been done equivalent to 20 &#x2013; Italy was &#x20AC;27.2 billion, 90% done.</p>
          <p>In this slide, I will not comment too much as just to give you a precise &#x2013; a more precise idea of the capability of the group to get funding through various geographies. We put down Italy, Germany and Austria in different forms and different maturities, so you can see that the price is very different Italy versus Germany, Austria et cetera. This can give you an idea of the average cost of funding for the group that definitely is lower if we compare only credit to other Italian banks</p>
          <p>Capital, page 24 -- sorry risk weighted asset substantially stable &#x20AC;445 billion, not too much to signal in this slide. We have an increase in markets, mostly due to the new AMOD implementations, so is due to regulation and same for operational risk. 37% of the risk weighted asset in Italy; 32% in Germany and Austria; 24% CEE and Poland, so pretty well diversified.</p>
          <p>Page 25, capital position. As I said already, core Tier 1 is growing from 9.06% to 9.12%. Retained earnings are 0.08%, a partially offset by risk weighted asset that counts for 2 basis point. So the increase is lower than what we have seen in the first quarter but if we consider &#x2013; remember correctly year-on-year is 71 basis point of increase.</p>
          <p>Then 26, page 26. We have put down two, the slides about Italy, specifically about Italy. As you know, we are working a lot on the Italian side to improve the performances. This is Italy commercial banking. If you look, the last column to the right, you will see that all arrows are green in term of increase of revenues, declining of costs, gross operating profit, LLP and so forth and clearly profit before taxes.</p>
          <p>The second column, so the first is the year-on-year -- the last is year-on-year growth. The column in between second half 2010 is the growth from December. As you can see, this speed is increasing in term of revenues is 8.3% increase versus 3.3% year-on-year, same in term of LLP, same in term of gross operating profit and so forth. We have the increase operating cost but this, as I said, is explained by the additional investments in marketing campaigns. So it's driven by business reason in order to push the Italian business. Year-on-year should go again close to zero.</p>
          <p>Cost income is definitely improving to 55.4%. And this is the trend let's say in term of volumes. As you see, even though the economy is growing only 1% in term of total loans, we are growing 2.3%. So we are gaining market share and the lending to net -- to non-financial corporation even out to 3.6%. This is a good news because despite of the difficulties in the market, the bank is able now, thanks to a better, let's say, liquidity position to keep going on, on the lending side and to gain business and customers. The exposure &#x2013; the expected losses are &#x2013; is declining for both CIB and SMEs, small business and SMEs.</p>
          <p>So let's conclude our presentation here. Let me say that, as a message, I will leave the fact that diversification is definitely our point of strength with CEE and Germany performing very well. Asset quality is improving. Management is fully committed to the turnaround of Italy that is one of our main targets.</p>
          <p>In this moment, CIB is repositioning itself, focusing more on capital management and with a very strong risk approach. Sorry cannot read an email, anyway the &#x2013; exactly the last point was the cost, cost for which we have a total commitment in term of reduction, but not just in term of cutting cost, but in term of working mid &#x2013; mid-term to structurally reduce the cost of organization of the group. So the impact will not be immediate, but also to be seen in the next two, three years. In other words, we are fully committed to improve our profitability despite the fact that we are living through very challenging market conditions.</p>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. And now, we are ready for questions. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Marcello Zanardo of Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I am kindly to ask -- each analyst to ask no more than two questions each in order to allow everybody to ask questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Glad to see the beginning of a turnaround in asset quality, but I'll leave this question to my colleagues. The first question is on the net interest income. Just a detail, if you could detail the one-off it must bear in the presentation didn't yet find it from the CIB and mainly to give us an idea what is happening in each of them? I mean, we see it's good that you are gaining market share on the loan side. We saw a system growth of 6% as of May. I think it was fueled mainly by the smaller banks because yourself, your big peers were in cutting mode up until recently.</p>
          <p>And also if you could tell us on the pricing side, you said that the Euribor increase is going to kick in later on. But most interesting for me will be if you could comment -- sorry if it is a bit long, but it's the same topic. What is happening on the competition, the deposit side, retail? Are you seeing people switching from the current account into the government bond? So just to have a flavor how these dynamics will influence NII? And yes, in the past, we used to ask the sensitivity 200 basis point increase in interest rate. Unfortunately now, I have to ask that to a 50 to 100 bps increase in bond yield. If you have any kind of sensitivity, I know it might be difficult, but internally what this is going to do to your NII?</p>
          <p>And then on the plan and you've been deferring any decision on capital to more clear rules. What is your flexibility if year-end comes and unfortunately, we are still in very volatile markets and Italian banks' share price is very depressed. Do you have the flexibility to defer to better times, any kind of action on a possible capital increase that you've been deferring, and what are your shareholders telling you in the conversation that you have? How feasible is that or will you be forced with the plan to do something to your capital? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try to answer the first of your 72 questions. You were supposed to ask only two, but you managed to cascade down to several ones. So on NII, you were asking which are the impact on NII and which are these one-off. To give you the three main drivers for this quarter for the NII, which has been almost, say &#x20AC;20 million delta quarter-on-quarter mainly due to a positive effect due to an agreement with a specific counterparty in CIB, which unfortunately, has been offset by market activities, which are almost in line while the markdown coming from deposits due to higher margin have been partially offset by they replicate our hedging strategy due to higher rates and higher cost of funding.</p>
          <p>Also due to the fact that, as pointed out by Federico, we accelerated and anticipated our strategy, also we did while <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:51) our pre-funding. The volume had a positive impact on our NII, but margin not yet materialized due to the time lag still lagging behind the level, which is clear and with our volume developments. So, these are the three main elements which have contributed to the NII and we leave to Roberto about market share and --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as net interest income in Italy, what we have been seeing has been, on one side, improvement in the markdowns with Euribor going up. That in the short-term, we also saw instead a compression in the markup. Moving forward, we expect net interest income, however, to be impacted by a few elements. On one side, we've been going for improvement in the overall quality in terms of ratings of customers, as Federico has pointed out earlier on.</p>
          <p>The second element we've been working quite a lot also in doing a remix or doing more short-term lending than long-term lending; short-term lending as you know carries with both a higher spread as well as a better possibility for repricing, as well as clearly, let's say, a lower risk other things being equal. And the third and very important element, we're working on the repricing. From this standpoint two, three comments I could make.</p>
          <p>On one side, there has been a first action of repricing that we started in May and that, as you know, because of Italian law typically has impact entering into the P&amp;L approximately 60 disasters, so we should be seeing in July, and we are now working on an additional maneuver. To give you an idea, also in terms of new lending, we have now increasing quite significantly the prices on new issuances and, for instance with mortgages, we started the year at approximately 141, 150 bps, the current warehouse of new mortgages being issued then in the next weeks is more in the range of 181 to 190 basis point.</p>
          <p>In terms of the deposit side, we've been seeing in this first six months some slight increase in the competition levels. While I cannot really say we've seen major changes or major shifts in customers' attitudes, you know quite well, that retail tend to be quite low in reacting to phenomenon. So, while there has been a little bit of increase in the purchase of government bonds, the side deposit base is absolutely intact, and also we keep distributing quite well our own bonds even in these days, that is summer days, we have a bond issue out and in five days we already booked for &#x20AC;470 million of new bonds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As finally, about the business plan, what I can say is that we are clearly working on our business plan according to the original timetable. So, the idea was to come last part of the year with the announcement of the plan. We are conscious that the market is very volatile, so we have also the flexibility eventually to change our timetable. I never talk about capital, but for sure in the business plan we will have capital management actions that will be clarified to the market and explained to the market for sure. We have determined that to keep improving and growing our core Tier 1. With shareholders, we don't have any problem, we have an open discussion with them and shareholders will accept the plan that we propose.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Ronny Rehn of KBW. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, sirs and ladies, of course. Two questions from me. First, how is the short-term funding availability, when you look in the interbank market, commercial paper, have you seen any change over the last four weeks in either pricing or short of maturities available?</p>
          <p>And secondly, there was some comments earlier from Luigi in Poland, that you might be looking at acquisitions. Sort of, how real is such a scenario considering minority impact from Basel III over capitalization of <mark type="ph" /> Dachau (30:50), et cetera? And how much work have you done on potential targets, since there is definitely some available? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting from Poland, you know, the position of <mark type="ph" /> Dachau (31:10) is very well capitalized. They have a core Tier 1 that I think is close to 18%, so naturally the bank considering also debt position in the country is looking for opportunities, we don't have in this moment anything under discussion. And I will say that the bank must look for opportunities. So if they will come and they will fit, from an investor point of view, the banks and multiples will be acceptable because it's obvious that price is very important in this respect, we will analyze it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About liquidity, liquidity is available in the market. It's very, very short, but available. So I, while on CD/CPs we see the constant decline we have seen from the second half of the last year and they are going down but I would say that we don't see the market, the liquidity in the market is there. And I don't see any stressful situation wholesale market different topic at the moment due to this spread can be tough, so I think that on the short, liquidity is there.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Giovanni Carriere of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My two quick questions is the first one if you could give us an update on the CASHES, whether you are going to go ahead with the restructuring or not and what eventually have you sold in terms of the coupon?</p>
          <p>And the other one, if you could just simply expand a little bit more on the very good performance on provisions in Germany. Obviously, we have some write-backs what exactly happened there? Is more one-off in nature or is it a signal of something more important at work? I saw that most of the provisions are in global transaction banking that I struggle a little bit to understand? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding CASHES, as you know, we started a couple of months ago, the restructuring. Then we stopped because we got the draft of the CRD IV, draft that now we try to understand. So we have stopped for a while, the restructuring. We have to discuss with regulators what exactly is the content of the CRD IV <mark type="audio gap" /> (33:51) and what to do. So in this moment, the restructuring is still I would say, pending. Let me now ask Marina who will now add something more in term of details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>So, we are entitled to restructure the instruments from our Board of Directors, so we would like to better understand the final contents of CRD IV, which has been published. But, as far as we understand, the approval process is only at the very beginning, it still has to be approved by the European Parliament and by the European Council. And so, we need to understand if the core Tier 1 treatment will be preserved by the current draft of the CRD IV. Based on this, we will take the next step and we'll decide if we go ahead with the restructuring.</p>

          <p>About Germany, I will say that the good trend in term of quality of the portfolio is there. So, we have seen good performance in some quarters now. Clearly, the result of the second quarter where we have a negative cost of risk is not repeatable probably in the next two quarters for this year, meaning that we had a number of write-backs, items to write-down that came all during this quarter, real, by the way. So I think that it will go back to a level probably in line with the first quarter. But, let's say that the quality of the portfolio is good and the positive trend is definitely sustainable. So, the speed that will not be the same in the second quarter, but definitely, we are not expecting problem in Germany.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. My two questions, first of all, the performance of cost was good in my opinion and I wonder if it's feasible to keep cost inflation around 1% or even below 1% even in 2012? Or this is too optimistic given that your already good performance in 2011?</p>
          <p>The second question is on asset quality in Italy. Loan loss provisions were flat quarter-on-quarter but we are seeing clearly a sharp slowdown in activity due to the austerity plan and the financial turmoil. And we're seeing also some troubled situation like the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:42) and so on. So, my question is do you feel confident to see an improvement in asset quality in Italy going forward or, let's say, for the time being is it still an open issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for asset quality in Italy, just a few words and then we'll ask maybe CRO to comment more. Just to give you an idea, if we stay with the reverse ratio of Italy starting from first half '09, we start with 42%, 47%, 67%, 66% and 75% is this quarter. So, there is underlying portfolio in term of quality is improving. Then on the other side of the coin, we have accelerated restructuring of some customers and done additional provisions. So, the 140 basis points comes from a portfolio that's improving, but some extra provision done because we have accelerated the restructuring.</p>
          <p>Before passing the ball to Karl Guha on cost, cost by far is one of the maximum point of attention for us. So, for 2012 and further also in the investment plan this will be, obviously, contemplated. As I said, for me it's important not adjusting down the cost cutting exercise, but it's important to work as we are doing on structural reorganization of the business model in order to have long-term benefit in term of cost. So the target is, for us, quite important and aggressive and we will work for that. Karl for Italy, do you want to add something more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a shame you don't want to talk about Germany, but we'll focus on Italy. Italy, the headline number gives you actually a little bit of a mixed picture. I think you need to go one layer down to understand what's really going on. If you compare it to the last quarter, which was &#x20AC;902 million, this quarter we have roughly &#x20AC;896 million, it's broadly the same.</p>
          <p>However, the big difference is that if you're looking into the operating part of the business, last quarter was almost entirely is the &#x20AC;902 million, included stocks that was coming out of the operating business, the so-called Bancone. What you do see this quarter is a big contribution from large single names to be precise, the tune of &#x20AC;163 million. So what you're likely to see in terms of your question, the future is that we don't expect sort of a miraculous sort of improvement in Italy, but it will be a steady, continued improvement. So, if you look at the performance of the performing portfolio and you look at the rating migration within that, that's very solid and all going in the right direction.</p>
          <p>The best indicator of that is effectively when you look at how much is moving from performing to non-performing, so the actual marginal rate is almost flat down. And then if you look at within the non-performing categories, the four categories that you have as per Bank of Italy classification, the first two are very, very stable, the first two categories being past due and restructuring.</p>
          <p>Not restructuring, the restructuring profile, but the category in itself. And the last two, namely in <mark type="ph" /> Cali and Sofferenza (40:21) there is, I'm afraid, a time lag effect, credit lag effect, which will by definition lead to a deterioration and therefore in terms of managing your expectations. This is the part that is going to -- in the mix, going to have the higher proportion going forward from the performing and the rest is what you will continue to get. But don't expect miracles, it's a steady sustained improvement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. The first question on the margins, and then I &#x2013; you have quite a big size of let's say short-term fund referring to the interbank and to the repo around &#x20AC;85 billion overall. Did you see any significant increase in the cost over the last month, where basically the sovereign crisis pick up, and what is your sense, what should be the increase of the input on the NII going forward, so looking at Q3.</p>
          <p>And more in general on the NII, given the cost of funding is either <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:40) is going to stay probably there in the near-term, you mentioned the benefit of the Euribor and the repricing you're doing on the loan. Do you think it's safe to assume that as things are turning today a base case for the Italian banks is the situation over the next couple of years, so flat margins and low volume growth?</p>
          <p>And then last question on the fees, there is significant drop in fees particularly in Italy but in different division as well. I guess it's mostly a consequence of the focus on funding and on issuing retail bond. So I was wondering if this is a trend that you see for the coming quarters ending up in a net fees line that is going to be significantly below 2010 level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the short-term funding, we have not seen a significant increase in rates in the last few months. We are not short-term ahead of the curve, so while for sure it's a completely different topic, the wholesale market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, I will say that on the funding side, clearly, we will see an increase. I think that but maybe the spread of the cost will not stay at this level, but if it will go down, it will go down progressively. So. we have to adjust ourselves and measure progressively to this level. I would like to remind only for us that we have a kind of blended funding, as we said, the increase of spread is touching Italy, it's not touching the other countries. So it's an Italian phenomenon at this moment.</p>
          <p>On our side, that was good to anticipate the funding plan, so to complete more or less the funding plan by July, because it puts us under less pressure now. I would like also to remind that we have never really started a deposit war, and so our deposit base has not been stress, the retail bonds in Italy, but in the Group as a whole, I think we have 8% of the total TFA, so we have not pushed too much in this respect. On the lending side, clearly, first of all a confirmation that we are not so much under pressure is the fact that we have not given any indication to any of our bank to stop lending. So, we don't see in this moment real problem in this respect.</p>
          <p>On the lending side, Italy in the repricing face more time because as you know by law the famous <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:39) you must explain to the customer why you want to increase, you sent a letter, you wait 60 days then you have made another 10 days of technicality. It takes minimum 70 days to implement repricing. This is why the first effect will be from this current quarter. The previous amounts as I said during the presentation, we've had a lot focus on the quality of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So moving acquiring let's say, new customers in the best rating classes. So repricing for the stock &#x2013; for the stock is in implementation, for the new &#x2013; the new lending clearly, we apply a different pricing. And looking to the future, that I think for sure if the level we stay as it is today, the lending side will be affected so the volume will not grow too much, it would be important to see how banks can &#x2013; let's say, reprice. But for me, the equation is very clear. So if the customer accepts the reprice, fine. Otherwise, we will not lend. In the sense that it doesn't make sense to lend under costs. This obviously, put pressure, has been said in the previous question on the cost side that is important to recover space that maybe you lose on the revenues &#x2013; on the revenue side.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. Based on the recent answer, you already partially answered to my questions, but to recap, I was wondering, if on the one hand, this lending growth you experienced in the last quarter is the beginning of a trend or at least it's something that you can expect based on the fact that in the past, UniCredit and your main competitors deleveraged whereas smaller banks were still growing loans. And nowadays it seems like due to funding troubles, local banks are in a much more difficult situation. So it seems that from a perspective point of view, this could be the right time for gaining market share. And so my question is, do you expect such a trend to start from now on?</p>
          <p>And the second question is from a stronger start from July, you were already able to begin the repricing process. So I would like to know what has been the feedback that you received from your clients when you were proposing the increase in the cost of the line of credit. And if it's possible, I understand it's difficult to share a number, but in general can you give us an idea of how much is the repricing you are asking on average to your client base taking into account that in a single month or as much as it means &#x2013; as it means the spread versus the bond increase by 170 bps in all the amounts? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay the repricing, I will then ask Roberto to reply in the case, it's not too sharp because clearly where the market is moving, we have to keep moving as well. And the reaction of customers &#x2013; okay no customer exactly when you see an increase, but I think that customer in this moment are in the case happy to see a bank still there and they're still doing lending in the market like this one is important. Going to the lending book, let's say, we are focused on quality, as I said already. I think we are in the position to grow through quality now because we can select our customer.</p>
          <p>We have also different approaches. We'll ask maybe Jean Pierre Mustier to explain about CIB new policy, new strategy. It is focused a lot on origination, but also distribution, so we'll ask maybe to make a comment in this respect.</p>
          <p>So overall, we see an opportunity again to grow, obviously, with volumes that cannot be outstanding because the market is what it is, but to grow through quality. So maybe Roberto for the repricing and then Jean-Pierre on the CIB strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the repricing, one important element to keep in mind is that borrowers in Italy never enjoyed in the last 50 years of this low level of interest rate. So while clearly they are not so happy, at the same time, the amount in price is not making big life change in their profit and loss account. Their interest expense as a percentage of sales are quite low on an historical perspective, that's very important.</p>
          <p>In terms of our match, our repricing, well, clearly the repricing to customer is not something that can happen based on the dynamics of the last 24 hours in the market, no, it is something that you do after their, let's say, consolidation or whatever is the increase in the cost of funding. Well, to give you an idea, currently we're in the range of considering an &#x2013; actually working on an overall increase close to 1% of the spread to lending customers. And these can be applied to a maximum of &#x20AC;70 billion being the total stock of short-term lending, which is the lending on which it's possible to reprice without a contractual change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the CIB side as far as the corporate accounts are concerned, we have a relatively large book as you know of more than &#x20AC;200 billion. What we are doing now aside of the shift towards higher rating client as Federico mentioned is to make sure on one side that's we can sell down on our credit exposure for loans which can be sold on form of syndication. And to generate new business, where we can manage final take which is relatively under control and relatively low, so that we can turn more business with the same use of risk-weighted assets. So going forward, what we want to do is keep risk weighted assets stable and make sure that we can turn our balance sheet more, which means that we will keep providing funding and credit to our clients while being able to generate more business and insist as well on the cross-selling.</p>
          <p>For our clients which have less access to capital markets, for smaller clients, we are looking at values alternative with the factoring side, with the leasing side in order to get a specific guarantees on the loan we extend, and then potentially by doing that we might as well see whether or not we could put in place some securitization, which can help us well on the funding side. So, all in all, we are confident that we can keep developing the activity with our clients under constrains risk-weighted asset but still making sure that we can offer credit to them while keeping very strict with guidelines.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can already see that, we have in terms of risk-weighted assets, we have under CIB side expanded our loans by &#x20AC;5 billion this quarter and the risk-weighted assets were actually down because of a specific number of actions, so I think the &#x2013; we are already making sure that we push such activities and I think that in the course of the third quarter and fourth quarter we are going to be a more and more active in terms of syndicating more the business we do with our clients.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Only one question. You provide lots of details about the net interest income and margin evolution. So I was wondering if you can give us the big picture here. I &#x2013; what is that the management expect for the group net interest margins going to be over the next few quarters or say over the year or so? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I say the &#x2013; in this moment, the market is extremely volatile, so it's not easy to foresee what will be the stabilization. So if we look outside Italy or Central Eastern Europe, obviously positive trend in all geography, most of them. Germany, when we have &#x2013; Germany, we have in term of lending, we have a situation. It is a bit opposite versus SIFI. In other words, the companies are not taking loans. They are very cash rich. So their volumes at this moment are in the decreasing trend rather than opposite.</p>
          <p>So coming to the question, I think that net interest should be more or less stable or slightly up, but slightly up to year end. For 2012, I am expecting a growth, but for sure in the lower range of the double digit, let's say. So I would be happy to see something, let's say, in the range of 4%, 5%. But first, before making any forecast, it's better to see how the market and when the market will stabilize because really in this situation is a guessing rather than making a serious analysis is too volatile. When we will &#x2013; when the new level will be found, or we'll be better in a position to understand the trend.</p>
          <p>Again, for a bank like us, the best thing, this is also an opportunity by the way because I think that with our capability to fund, thanks to the geographical diversification, we can get good customers and good business. The market is challenging and difficult. So mild the growth, but to be verified as soon as the market will stabilize a bit.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Two very quick one. Capital in SIFI and normalized level of provisions. On capital, you built only six basis points this quarter versus 40 last quarter. The question is, how much more room do you have for risk-weighted asset mitigation? And which brackets do you expect to end up within the SIFI regulation?</p>
          <p>On provisions, where do you actually expect the level of normalized provisions for the group to fall once you would have completed the actions that you're undergoing repositioning the portfolio and the cycle, economic cycles will have stabilized? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding SIFIs, my personal expectations &#x2013; so we don't have any specific information. My personal expectation is that we should be: the best scenario, 1%; probable scenario 1.5%. So let's say around 8.5%. Assuming that the information they are circulated in these days, so they are correct. So substantially in between not in the lower basket, but not in the higher one, but in between, then this level of 8.5% I mean this can be achieved through &#x2013; for shorter organic growth in the sense that if we take the consensus for retained earnings. 1st January of 2013 and we consider the effect the Basel III plus mitigation action, we are already that lag are substantially, and the question is maybe another one if this level is enough or not, but per se, is not, it's a major problem to reach what pressure really will be the request coming from SIFI's strength or through organic growth.</p>
          <p>In term of provision, okay, through the cycle, yes that &#x2013; if we'd ask maybe Karl, he's more pressurize than me. Obviously, what we are expecting is in any case a positive trend for sure in the foreseeable period of time in Germany and Austria. I think, as well that Central Eastern Europe, we continue to improve. In Italy, that's it has been already explained for sure, 140 is still too high. We think to go down, but I will ask Karl to may be a bit more precise than myself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to that question, I would like to give in two parts. In the short term, I wouldn't say that this quarter in itself is indicative of what you should expect, because I think the reason is Germany &#x2013; and I think the German provision level this quarter looks almost too good because of the releases. You cannot account on this one after releases. So the trend overall short term will be a continued improvement and probably be range bound, but it &#x2013; don't &#x2013; so just to be clear in terms of managing the expectation, next two three quarters, don't expect this quarter multiplied by three or four times, I don't know whether you've asked that or not, but if that's what you're implying the answer is no. I think it is at a slightly higher level, but it will be ranged bound.</p>
          <p>If you're looking at it through the cycle, for a firm like ours where the diversifications and the mixes, I think it's reasonable to expect that we should be in the mid-70 range through the cycle. But I'd &#x2013; I'm not sure that that spot is exactly what you're asking, but if that's the question, then it's in the mid-70s.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a few questions on my side as well. Going back to funding, what is &#x2013; we all know these are the best, but what is the current condition actually stay and stay for longer, what is spread &#x2013; especially for Italy, which I know is only a part of your business, stay at this level. What sort of actions can you put together on the longer term to either re-shift the balance sheet, how much repricing do you really think clients can take? So how &#x2013; would you be thinking on this is now that hopefully a worst case scenario, but it's not unlikely that that's actually may materialize, and then in fact, stay for longer. On funding balance sheet, what are your concern &#x2013; I know that short-term liquidity we just heard it that it seems to be still okay, what do you worry about? What do you watchfully monitor?</p>
          <p>On the question perhaps for Mr. Mustier, you just mentioned that you are in a &#x2013; focusing more on higher rate clients. To what extent do you actually find that challenging, given that some other larger European banks, take Deutsche Bank, the BNP, for example, may be benefiting from it all in lower cost of funding? Where do you find other challenges in trying to move into those brackets of clients? And one very last question for Mr. Guha, NPLs in Italy, I think that the rate of increase is a little bit better, but actually the NPLs are still building up. And how long do you think it will take until we still &#x2013; we see some peak? And are you concerned that government putting together this, talking in measure, higher spread will actually mean that NPLs continue to go up longer? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the &#x2013; we'll take the question about if &#x2013; what will happen if do we stay at this level. So clearly, if we stay at this level, you have to consider different actions and possibilities I think that repricing is the most obvious one. And for us, any lending activity anyway has to be connected to quality of customer. So repricing can work maybe with a low level customer so we'll see how long it can work for good customer. For sure at this level of today as we continue for months, I think is difficult to reprice entirely on customers. Well this is a quite abnormal level in my opinion, not linked fundamentals.</p>

          <p>Of Italy, but if this is the worst case scenario, I think that partially is repricing. For sure we have to take care and to focus a lot on the funding gap that we have for Italy. So this gap has to be reduced, in which way, through a number of action, including eventually also disposal of some assets. And so the major risk that you can face in situation like this one is I think coming to your question the funding gap presently that we have in Italy.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that we have very prudent liquidity policy. Our time horizon is still around 100 days, so we have some space for maneuver. And then looking to the P&amp;L, for sure, we have the cost side that will be managed properly. But it is clear that at this levels, it is &#x2013; as we said abnormal, if this will continue for months or for quarters, you'll &#x2013; it requires internal reprice as extraordinary activities can be managed only through repricing. This is quite obvious. And there was a question for...</p>

          <p>When you actually mentioned &#x2013; I'm sorry, when you mentioned funding gap for Italy. Are you referring to your total loans in Italy versus deposits or simply the term of funding and just to be clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know in Italy, we have &#x2013; the loan-deposit ratio in Italy is higher than in the other region due to the business we have in Italy. And due to the fact that the cost in Italy higher versus our other liquidity center, and we are suffering more in funding our Italian center rather than the other one. But again to underline again, what Federico has already stated, we are concerned and you are asking about what is the main worry for us. We see an increase in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:05:42) which for sure have an impact on our wholesale and as well on our network funding. But we have also to underline that our cover bonds are trading inside B2C and our &#x2013; the funding spread in Germany and Austria seems they are remaining stable, so there is no concern about these centers.</p>
          <p>So, we &#x2013; it's also difficult today to estimate under the current extreme situation and volatility to project which are going to be the cost in the future months. But again, the diversification we are benefiting from the different liquidity center is such that we have comfort that we will be able to afford the second half of the year. And as we have done in the first half of the year, we manage to accelerate our funding plan to complete, I will say almost, the whole funding plan at cost, which have been only slightly higher, perhaps it is the one we are projecting at the beginning of the year.</p>

          <p>To remind also that we manage every month internal stress scenario with the CRO and with respect to the CFO. Stress test scenario gives you the more, say, dramatic and what we see in the market today. So, we have a set of action that eventually we can decide, obviously not easy but should on this become reality. There is no alternative. The stress test scenario had been very useful in the previous months to drive us to the decision of anticipated funding plan because we were expecting something similar to what's going on in the market. Jean-Pierre?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the CIB side, first of all, I think it's important to look at our business mix. And we offer today 30% of our loans only to Italian clients, and the balance being to non-Italian clients, German, or Austrian provision of theirs. So &#x2013; and we fund the loans which are extended to non-Italian clients, and most of them are booked within HVB, and then we fund them on our German funding curve, which as we have seen from the delivery of what we fund is quite in line with what could be the funding of our major competitors.</p>
          <p>So I would say that outside of Italy, we don't have any negative impact of the funding cost. In fact, we are quite competitive. And there the issue for us when move towards higher rating client is to make sure that we gained a fair market share of side business compared to our loan market share. Today, we are below our fair market share, so we are not trying to do more than what we should be doing. What we want to do is gaining our fair market share, and we can do that as for the cash management side, for the hedging and the capital market activities. Capital market activities, we have today are an extremely credible fund size, and which we keep developing under the capital market side for instance.</p>
          <p>Going back to on the 30% of our corporate clients in Italy, then it's &#x2013; actually we do have a competitive advantage against Italian banks, because our overall funding curve in Italy is below other Italian banks because we have more diversified funding. And compared to other large banks activity in Italy, I would say that the clients overlap is somewhat limited. And the larger clients do actually do not do so much bank funding, they use backup lines and of course the issued capital market business, where they can fund lower than any other banks actually.</p>
          <p>So I don't think that as far as hedges side is concerned, the move towards higher rating clients is something which penalize in terms of competition. I think that on the opposite, it will allow us to have a better cross-selling. We choose clients which offer more exporting business for instance where they will use more foreign trade services, more hedging, ForEx hedging, and more questioning for us. And as such, I feel that the current environment could be seen as stretched, but I think we can &#x2013; are able to turn it as an opportunity.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Domenico Santoro of Nomura. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate actually that you answer to this question because I suppose there is a very low visibility. But just two final questions, the first one is on the credit quality because you mentioned before that the improvement, let's say, in Germany is going on, is continuing, but there was clearly some one-off in the second quarter. But when I look at Italy, there is still a huge stock of gross number, where gross impaired loans, which is &#x20AC;46 billion. And you mentioned before actually that there is still some loan loss provision, which actually due to the reshuffling the gross impaired loans from a watch list to non-performing loan. So I was just wondering whether there is actually you had any managerial actions in order to reduce the stock going forward.</p>
          <p>We actually read about some non-performing loans disposal, and maybe what is the state of the art there? Again on the capital because this is the first question that actually investors ask us about UniCredit. Before you mentioned that probably UniCredit is going to be in the middle range, probably over the global, for me a surprise, 1.5%, and you might be able to get the 8.5% just by earnings retention. If the request from regulatory gets a little bit more extreme in terms of capital, would you be able actually to sacrifice one of the piece, let's say, of your group in the future in order to get some more capital? In two years, so let's say, how shall we look at UniCredit going forward in terms of structure? I know that Eastern Europe right now is the main driver of actually your earnings growth. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Karl, maybe first part about the risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start first by clarifying one point. We didn't shuffle any portfolios. So I will &#x2013; maybe there is a misunderstanding, so we'll answer that in sequence. First Germany, your question about Germany, the point of our Germany is that this quarter's numbers are influenced by releases from provisions because of improvements of settlements or whatever reason. The number of different reasons, which have caused the release, which is taken in to be a negative provision, i.e., a net release, this is not sustainable. It's one-off. If you look at the underlying asset quality and therefore the loan loss provision that we booked against that, that's a stable and a good trend. Don't expect any material improvements on that because it's already very low. So I think it will be in that level and we'll continue in that level.</p>
          <p>Coming to Italy, the point about Italy is the following. First, if you look at the performing versus non-performing. The performing portfolio is actually continuing to improve. And I think the mix is changing within the performing portfolio because the focus is on better rated clients. And as you know, under advanced, we also take provisions on performing portfolio, the so called generic provisions. These are clearly influenced by the improving trend within that portfolio.</p>
          <p>The second question is the migration from performing to non-performing and the marginal rate of transfer from performing to non-performing is almost flat. It's not quite flat, but almost flat and it's been declining. So, this is the most positive trend you can look for in terms of what's happening in the portfolio and what does it mean in terms of provision.</p>
          <p>And third, your shuffling comment was not about shuffling, but if you look at the Bank of Italy classifications, there are four categories as you know: past due, restructuring, <mark type="ph" /> elenco degli (75:35) and sofferenza. The first two are very stable, meaning that how should you look at that? Only one way, that is stabilizing and, in fact, it's getting better, it's not getting worse. But <mark type="ph" /> elenco degli (75:47) and sofferenza, the last two classes, there is always a credit lag effect as time wears on.</p>
          <p>Some of the same names that have been sitting there get worse, because they've been worked through and so on so forth. So, this will come continue to contribute to the loan loss provision numbers. And the last point that we made earlier and I will clarify again, the mix in the loan loss provision in Italy is going to change because of the contribution. Loan loss provision is a function of both that it contributes in the performing part as I mentioned earlier, that will keep going down because of the improving part. But the contribution from the restructuring, large single restructuring part will continue to be there. So, therefore, in terms of net-net on Italy, expect sustained improvement but no miracles. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This was actually the reason for my question considering that you have used stock watch list, the non-performing, is there any managerial action actually to reduce the stock in order also to, let's say, as most of it <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:15:53) from the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. By definition, we are working on it. We have a very large restructuring team that's actually working and dedicated to it. That is &#x2013; sorry, Jean-Pierre, you want to make commentaries? That we will continue to do. So, it is something that I'm not sure I understand your question fully.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's one of the many options we have in terms of selling some assets we can look at it, we can continue to do restructuring. But it has the full focus and attention of the organization. It's a critical part of the transformation program for Italy. So, it is absolutely on our radar and is something that has been for a while. It's not a new thing on the game.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the second question, if I can make a joke, I should invite you to the presentation of the business plan so you will have all the answer. Now, I think about the SIFIs point, when I said 8.5, I was referring to what we can expect will be the indication coming from FSB. It's what we are reading in the papers. I'm not saying that this would be the optimal level of capital. Then we know that also look at regulation, can ask something different. This was just an expectation purely related to SIFIs. We see in the case for us, again, rather than waiting or just waiting for this indication. We are trying to understand our sense. First what is the optimal level of capital for us and we try to reach that level?</p>
          <p>The question about selling or not piece of the group, let me say that the plan that will be built up among others also with the maximum focus on capital optimization and the risk-adjusted return. So, it's clear that business that will not contribute enough will not get for sure capital. So, we'll focus capital on business and geographies that deserve capital, based on our expectation. Then when you talk about small disposal is not an issue. You talk about big piece of the group, yet that the decision require much more deep financial understanding, may be better to increase capital rather than selling something valuable for the group. So these are all analysis ongoing and again we will be more clear, when the plan will be presented.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry. I was just looking at your provision sequential evolutions quarter-on-quarter, am I right in thinking that basically more than two-third of the job in loan loss provisions from the first quarter actually comes from Germany, either in the CIB business or in the Retail Network business where you are both in a net write-back position in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding your cash flow generation. Can I ask what kind of dividend provision you have made in the calculation of your cash flow generation for the second quarter? Is the eight basis point improvement net of the dividend accrual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, yes, Germany has been a major contributor, but not the only one. The other big contributor has been CEE. If you look at relative to the past, there is a sustained and continual improvement in fee. The point is that, it is still high in enough itself, but it is &#x2013; for that region it is a material improvement. So, to the bottom line, at the end of the day, both have contributed materially. And also I have to say that Italy net-net, if you compare to last year, is down quite a bit, so you have to put that in perspective.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. My question regards the improvement on the Greek bonds, the &#x20AC;135 million, can you please tell us what evaluation you applied to this? What assumption is behind this improvement? Then I didn't catch the one-off in the net interest income from CIB. So I didn't touch the number. And finally, Mr. Ghizzoni, in May you were saying it was comfortable to &#x2013; with the consensus that 2.9 billion net profit for this year, you confirm these. Half of the year means you expect the second half to be on the same level.</p>
          <p>And then very final question, I see the number of branches is going down. Can you please give us, say, an idea of the traffic of clients within the branches or what is going on there, what is your commitment to the franchise, the physical franchise of the bank? Thank you.</p>

          <p>About the Greeks, okay, Marina &#x2013; it's very technical, we have &#x2013; I will ask Marina to explain because we have applied our internal, say, mark-to-market model, but I think it's good if Marina goes to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say, we &#x2013; let's say our portfolio, the AfS and the held to maturity altogether amount to &#x20AC;535 million, and this is the pre-maturing scope for our impairment. On this portfolio, we recorded &#x20AC;139 million, i.e., &#x20AC;105 million &#x2013; sorry, &#x20AC;135 million, i.e. &#x20AC;105 million net impairment, which is approximately 25%. We are applying a level three, which means that we are applying our internal model and we are applying a discount rate in line with the one recommended by IIF, which is 9%.</p>
          <p>The reason of applying the fundamental model seems that we have &#x2013; we think that there is no enough liquidity in the market today to go for the mark-to-market. We are going to disclose in our accounts the level of impact we would have had in June using the prices in June and you will see that the amount will be slightly higher, so &#x20AC;50 million higher net, which is not a material difference. But we have taken these stands and we went for the model since we don't believe that the liquidity of the market is adequate to perform a mark-to-market evaluation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just another point here because as you know in the market, there was a bit of a confusion how to impair these bonds. Some banks have done mark-to-market impairments. So, apparently impairing more than what we have done. It is, in any case, questionable because what many banks have done they've impaired the books for the bonds, but only for the maturity up to 2020. The one that is suggested through the proposal. I was not considering let's say, good, this approach because clearly if you impair, you impair the old books. If not, you don't impair. But you cannot distinguish 2020 and up to 2020, because Greece is Greece anyway. So we decided to go through the system explained by Marina.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an indication anyway, if you would have impaired, we would have done &#x20AC;214 million. That means a net difference of &#x20AC;50 million, more or less &#x2013; &#x20AC;210 million &#x2013; sorry, a mistake, &#x20AC;210 million instead of &#x20AC;135 million. Net would be a difference of &#x20AC;50 million net. We've done again &#x2013; we've taken the other choice also because I think that we have to be consistent with the proposal coming from Brussels. I think that if this will go through, we will be fine. If we not go through, probably the impairment would be much higher than what is the supposed mark-to-market 30 of June this year. So we try to be consistent with the package proposed and we have impaired the old book.</p>
          <p>Then about the consensus, the last consensus I have seen a couple of weeks ago was &#x20AC;2.591 billion, not 2.9. So based on the forecast</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was May. In May, it was &#x20AC;2.9 billion and you were saying &#x20AC;2.9 billion, I'm comfortable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm going to say. Yes, I was coming to that point. It's true that they said &#x20AC;2.9 billion. At the time, the concessions was this one. Now it's &#x20AC;2.6 billion. Clearly, we were not expecting for sure the bond &#x2013; sorry, the Greek effect and we were not expecting this sharp and tough movement in the market.</p>
          <p>In term of one-off CIB, Germany is &#x20AC;143 million gross &#x2013; sorry, revenues. And about the branches, I think that there is no problem, no negative reaction from customers. We are totally committed to our network. We are now going through a reorganization of the network that will empower even more our people on ground. We simply closed branches because our branch is mostly overlapping with other one, so it's a cleanup. That doesn't mean that we are pulling out from Italy or from region. And then keep in mind that in term of transaction done in branches, multi-channel keeps growing. So today, 70% of the transaction are done outside the branches. So it is important also to keep the level of the branches at the same &#x2013; at the needed level, not to have an excess branches &#x2013; or so to have excess of cost.</p>
