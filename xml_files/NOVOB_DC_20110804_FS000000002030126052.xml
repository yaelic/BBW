          <p>Thank you for standing by ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Novo-Nordisk Q2 2011 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and from us, welcome to Novo-Nordisk conference call regarding our performance in the first six months of 2011 and an updated outlook for 2011.</p>
          <p>I am Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo-Nordisk. And with me I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer; and present are also our Investor Relations Officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release and the slides that will be used for this call are available on our webpage novonordisk.com and as mentioned the conference call will last approximately one hour and the presentation of the agenda is outlined on Slide number 2. The Q&amp;A session will begin in approximately 25 minutes. Turn to Slide number 3.</p>
          <p>As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, see the earnings release and the slides that we have prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Also note that the conference call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available on our website after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to Slide number 4. We're satisfied with the performance of the first half of 2011. Sales increased 11% in local currencies compared to the same period in 2010. The key sales drivers have been Victoza and the modern insulins.</p>
          <p>The solid sales performance is realized in a challenging economic environment in the first half of 2011, health care reforms are impacting sales growth negatively by approximately 3 percentage points. We've also made significant progress within our development pipeline with three new phase 3a programs initiated since the last quarterly announcement including IDegLira, the fixed-ratio insulin/GLP-1 combination; Vatreptacog alfa, a fast-acting recombinant factor VIIa and our N9-GP, a long-acting recombinant factor IX. In addition we have initiated two phase 3a trials with liraglutide in obesity.</p>
          <p>In our conference call in May, we announced results from the Degludec and DegludecPlus meta-analysis confirming that Degludec was associated with statistically significant and thus confirmed overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia than insulin glargine, in phase 3a programs for Degludec.</p>
          <p>At ADA in June, we showed further details on two weeks Degludec phase 3a basal-bolus trials. Further clinical claim studies showed that Degludec has a low intra-patient variability and a half life twice as long as insulin glargine. In July our pre-filled insulin device FlexTouch was approved for use in Europe with NovoRapid and Levemir.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financials, reported operating profit grew 13%. The financial outlook for 2011 is improved, and we now expect sales growth of 9% to 11% in local currencies and operating profit growth of 15% to 19% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to Slide number 5, where we go through sales development in the first half. Victoza continues its strong performance and modern insulins continue to grow at double-digit percentage points. In the first six months of 2011, the biopharmaceutical franchise was growing at 5% compared to the same period last year. Diabetes care represents 75% of overall sales while NovoSeven and Norditropin represents another 13% and 8%, respectively. Victoza was the prime growth driver with 65% share of growth in local currencies followed by modern insulins with 41% share growth. Sales of Victoza reached now DKK2.3 billion and the performance reflects the steady penetration across key markets including that of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and France.</p>
          <p>Sales of NovoSeven increased 5% in local currencies, sales growth was primarily driven by International Operations and Europe. Sales in North America declined slightly compared to the first six months of 2006 due to market dynamics and the impact of the U.S. Health Care Reform. Sales of Norditropin increased 4% as measured in local currencies, the sales growth was driven by Japan and Korea as well as International Operations.</p>
          <p>Novo-Nordisk remains the second largest company in the global growth hormone market with 24% market share measured by volume.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide for an update on the regional split of our sales. In the first half of 2011, all regions contributed to growth measured in local currencies. North America was the main contributor with 51% share of the growth measured in local currencies, followed by International Operations and China, contributing 22% and 14%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in North America reflects a solid performance of Victoza and continued market penetration of the modern insulins. The sales growth in the first half of 2011 is negatively impacted by 6 percentage points due to the U.S. Health Care Reform adopted in March 2010.</p>
          <p>European sales grew 3% in local currencies, driven by continued solid performance of Victoza and progress for the portfolio of modern insulins. Sales are negatively impacted by health care reforms implemented during 2010, especially those in Germany and in Spain. Sales within International Operations increased 17% in local currencies. The key contributors to sales growth here are the modern insulins, NovoSeven and Norditropin. Sales <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:30) in China increased 22% in local currencies. The main contributor to growth was sales of modern insulins, especially NovoMix, while human insulins continued to add to the overall growth in this region.</p>
          <p>Sales at Japan, Korea increased 7% in local currencies. The effect of the March '11 earthquake in Japan is estimated to be neutral to sales in the first half of this year. Turn to slide number seven for an update on the market situation. The global diabetes care market continues to show double-digit annual growth. In the last years, value growth have been around 9%, with injectables growing around 14% annually. Novo-Nordisk continues to expand its leadership position within diabetes care now holding 24% share of the global diabetes care market.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the global insulin market. Global insulin volume growth remains about 6% driven by strong growth in International Operations and in China. In the United States, we see a growth rate close to 5% measured in volume, primarily driven by the basal and the fast-acting insulin segments. An increasing share of global insulin volume is sold in Novo-Nordisk growth regions, which are North America, International Operations and China constituting 56% of volume in May 2011, compared to 50% ten years ago.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. The MAT growth rates for Novo-Nordisk's globally insulin sales has decreased to 8% as a result of the 4% growth in the first half of 2011 measured in local currencies compared to the first half of 2010. The decrease in the global insulin sales growth rates was primarily related to health care reforms in the United States and Europe impacting the MAT growth rates with almost 2 percentage points. Increased competitive pressures in Europe, Japan, and the United States impacted the MAT growth rates negatively by approximately 1 percentage point.</p>
          <p>Human insulin growth was further negatively impacted by the loss of the Wal-Mart contract in the United States and by discontinuation of Mixtard in the U.K., those two events impacting the MAT growth rates by approximately half a percentage point. Combined, the events described impacted global insulin sales MAT growth rate negatively by more than 3 percentage points, corresponding to more than 6 percentage point of the insulin sales growth rate in the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Despite a lower growth rate in the first half of 2011, we expect to see growth rates come back to historic levels as the impact of health care reforms, the Wal-Mart contract, and loss of the Mixtard discontinuation are fully reflected in the base numbers assuming no additional major health care reforms.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for further discussion of the U.S. insulin market dynamics. We have maintained our leadership position in the U.S. insulin market with 41% of the total insulin market and 37% of the modern insulin market measured in volume. Since the beginning of 2011, we had seen an impact from the loss of three managed care and Medicare Part E contracts especially in the fast acting human insulin segment. This has lead to a slight decline in market share within the fast acting segment, but the most recent script level data indicates a strengthening of our position, and we expect to continue to gain market share in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 11. In the United States, Victoza sales continues to be encouraging. We estimate that around 250,000 &#x2013; 225,000 people with type 2 diabetes are treating with Victoza today. We now own the market share of more than 49% of the total GLP-1 scripts and we're capturing more than 60% of the new patients. Importantly, since the Victoza launch in February 2010, the GLP-1 class has grown by nearly 55% and now constitutes more than 5% of the total U.S. diabetes market measured in value.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide please. In Europe, we continue to see very strong <mark type="ph" /> offset of (11:17) Victoza in several key markets. The GLP-1 class has more than doubled since it's launched. Victoza is now the leading GLP-1 product in all three key markets in Europe, Germany, the U.K. and France. We estimate that around 140,000 people with type 2 diabetes are treated with Victoza in these markets.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Mads, who'll give you an update on the development within our clinical pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to slide 13. As announced on July 14 this year, Novo-Nordisk has received approval of FlexTouch from the European Commission. The approval is for NovoRapid and Levemir, both modern insulins currently delivered in the FlexPen. FlexTouch is the latest <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:00) delivery system from Novo Nordisk and it will provide even greater ease of use for patients relying on insulin pens in daily life. Thus, current pens require users to inject manually by pressing back the dose button to its original setting by use of the force of their thumb.</p>
          <p>In contrast, we ergonomically designed FlexTouch uses an auto injecting mechanism minimizing the dose force, and clinically, this novel mechanism has been associated with enhanced treatment satisfaction. Launch timing of FlexTouch in specific EU countries is pending local negotiations.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on recent Degludec data as they were presented at the ADA conference in San Diego in June. The unique protection mechanism of Degludec, soluble self-associating multi-hexamers, was shown to increase the half life to twice that of insulin glargine. This doubling in half life is pharmacodynamically reflected in Degludec being the only insulin to effectively lower glucose for more than 24 hours on all days in all diabetes patients.</p>
          <p>Finally, the day-to-day variability in the zero to 24 hour insulin action profile shown on this slide was two to seven fold lower for Degludec when compared to insulin glargine. All in all, this PK/PD benefits of Degludec form the scientific basis for phase 3 including a trial showing that a radical dosing scheme with alternating eight and 40 hour Degludec dosing intervals provided the same efficacy and hypoglycemic safety as the glargine administered with 24-hour intervals as per label. The clinical use of glargine both in this and all other phase 3 trials was in fact optimized since the glargine dosing regimen allowed for dosing at any time of day according to the physicians and patients clinical experience with this insulin. Based on these positive findings, Novo-Nordisk will seek to obtain a label that also includes the flexibility to administer Degludec at any time of day on any day enhancing convenience and potentially treatment compliance.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for news from the clinical pipeline. Three submission meetings have now been held with the regulatory agencies, and we are well underway with the preparations of this simultaneous submission of both Degludec and DegludecPlus in the United States and Europe within the next few months. Finally, the first wave of the phase 3b program has now been initiated for Degludec.</p>
          <p>In terms of the late stage pipeline a lot has happened the last quarter with a number of projects having kicked off phase 3 pivotal trials, two in diabetes and two in haemophilia. With Degludec, we chose a combination product known as IDegLira has entered phase 3 through initiation of the June 1 trial, a 26-week study in 1,660 type 2 diabetes patients compared IDegLira with Degludec and Victoza, respectively.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the pivotal obesity trial for the 3-mg liraglutide doses being started aiming to recruit 3,600 obese subjects according to FDA guidelines. Those with pre-diabetes at baseline will continue for a total of three years of treatment whereas the blind pivotal part of the trial completes after a 12-month treatment period. Furthermore, the diabesity study in obese patients with type 2 diabetes has also being initiated and will compare the 1.8-milligram and 3-milligram doses of liraglutide to placebo.</p>
          <p>Moving now to haemophilia, the successor molecule to NovoSeven, Vatreptacog alfa has started phase 3 in a one-year blind comparison with NovoSeven in haemophilia A and B inhibitor patients.</p>
          <p>In this efficacy and safety trial, block randomization takes place such that each patient will end up treating bleeding episodes with both trial products during the one year treatment period. Furthermore, N9-GP, the factor IX compound with a very long half life, has ended phase 3 in a three-arm study investigating on-demand treatment as well as high and low dose prophylactic treatment for one year. With this, four calculation factor projects are now in phase 3 of regulatory phases.</p>
          <p>Finally, with autoimmune disorders, our fifth antibody molecule has entered clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis. This time, it is Anti-NKG2a as humanized antibody intended to show anti-inflammatory effects in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
          <p>With that, over to you, Jesper.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to the next slide. Health care reform are affecting the sales performance of the global health care industry. Novo-Nordisk is mainly impacted by reforms in the U.S., Germany, Spain and Turkey, but also other countries have implemented reforms impacting Novo-Nordisk. In the first half of 2011, reforms have impacted sales negatively by around 3 percentage points when compared to the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we still expect a negative impact to sales growth of around 2.5 percentage points compared to 2010 with a most significant impact arising from the U.S. Health Care Reform enacted in March of 2010. Please turn to the next slide for an update on the financial results.</p>
          <p>In the first six months of 2011, sales increased by 9% measured in Danish Kroner to DKK31.7 billion and by 11% in local currencies compared to the same period in 2010. The production economy improved by 30 basis points in the first half of 2011, compared to the first half of '10. This primarily reflects a favorable product mix impact driven by conversion from human insulins to modern insulins. As a consequence of the negative currency impact of 40 basis points, the reported gross margin fell slightly by 0.1 percentage point to 80.4% in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Total nonproduction-related costs increased by 5% to just over DKK15 billion. Selling and distribution costs primarily reflects the continued expansion of the sales forces in the U.S. and China. The limited increase in R&amp;D cost reflects expanding early stage research activities and initiation of late-stage pivotal trials offset by the completion of the phase 3a program for Degludec and DegludecPlus. As Mads alluded to, the initiation of three phase 3a programs and the two phase 3a trials within liraglutide and obesity is expected to increase R&amp;D spending in the second half of 2011. Operating profit increased by 13% to DKK10.7 billion. In local currency, the growth was approximately 17%.</p>
          <p>Net financials showed a net expense of DKK25 million compared to a net expense of close to DKK500 million in the same period last year, primarily driven by a foreign exchange income of DKK32 million in the first half of 2011, compared to an expense of 460 million in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. This slide shows the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner. Further, the expected annual impact on operating profit of a 5% movement in each of our key invoice and currencies and the current extent of hedging for the same currencies are shown. During the first six months of 2011, the average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar versus the Danish kroner was 6% lower than in the first half of 2010. At present, the value of the U.S dollar is approximately 7% below the average level of 2010 and 7% below the average level of the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial guidance for 2011. Novo-Nordisk has increased the expectations to sales growth of 2011 and now expects sales growth of 9% to 11% measured in local currencies. This is based on expectations of continued market penetration for Novo-Nordisk's key products as well as expectations of continued intense competition, generic competition through all anti-diabetic products, and an impact from the implementation of health care reforms primarily in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>The increase in the expectations is primarily driven by a better outlook for our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:38) sales in the U.S. as a consequence of not yet experiencing any generic competition and by continued successful market penetration of Victoza. Given the current level of exchange rate versus the Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is expected to be around 3 percentage points lower than the growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Reported growth margin for the full year is expected to be at the level of 2010. The expected product share contribution from around 0.5 percentage point from product mix is expected to be offset by a negative impact from currencies. For 2011, growth in operating profit is now expected to be 15% to 19% measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the recorded operating profit growth is expected to be 5.5 percentage point lower than the growth measured in the local currencies. For 2011, Novo-Nordisk now expect a net financial income of around DKK150 million. The current expectations reflect currency hedging gains primarily related to the U.S. dollar. The effective tax rate for 2011 is still expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditure as likewise still expected to be around DKK3.5 billion in 2011 primarily related to investments in the new insulin formulation and filling plant in China and a new pre-fill device production facility in Denmark.</p>
          <p>Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are still around DKK2.7 billion and free cash flow is still expected to be more than DKK16 billion. All of the above expectations are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not change business conditions for Novo-Nordisk during the remaining part of 2011 and that currency exchange rate, especially the U.S. dollar, will remain at the current level versus the Danish Kroner during the remaining part of 2011.</p>
          <p>This concludes the financial update. Now back to you, Lars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper. And as closing remark, I'd like to highlight the key growth drivers for our business. The diabetes care market continues to be characterized by solid underlying growth rates as more people, unfortunately who are diagnosed with diabetes and treated with more and more advanced products. We are the clear leader in this market with 51% insulin volume market share, and with Victoza we continue to expand our share as the total diabetes care market to now account for 24%.</p>
          <p>As the only company, we have completed the phase 3 for two new insulin compounds. In addition, we're investigating the use of liraglutide for the treatment of obesity and then we have a strategy for expanding our haemophilia franchise in terms of haemophilia more broadly with factors VIII, IX and XIII.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. We are now moving to the Q&amp;A part and operator, we are now ready to take the first question. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the first question today comes from Peter Verdult from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Peter Verdult here Morgan Stanley. Lars, could you maybe comment on performance in China, it seems that there is a very significant slowdown in growth in Q2. There is a rising debate around pricing restrictions et cetera, et cetera, so could you maybe comment on what's going on there, is it timing issue on tenders or is there something we need to be concerned about. I remember at the Capital Markets Day, you were pretty confident on pricing being positive in that market, but given the importance to your growth, some commentary there would be helpful. And just as a very quick add-on, has Victoza started to get reimbursement yet in China?</p>
          <p>And then the second question maybe to Mads, is, is there any chance that you will be able to file the Degludec dossier before the end of this month thereby getting a PDUFA ahead of ADA next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter, this is Lars Rebien here. I will deal with the question pertaining to China, and then Mads, on the timing of the filing of the Degludec file. With regards to China, yes, we do believe that there is largely a timing element in the slowdown of the business in China due to anticipated health care reform being enacted which is likely to have some, or be, in our assessment, modest negative impact on products like the ones that we are selling in China. So there will be some kind of negative price impact, there is some timing issues as a result of this. With regard to Victoza, no, we are not having reimbursement yet. So you're still waiting another six months before we will start to see Victoza in the marketplace in China.</p>
          <p>Mads, time lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, Peter, we have, as I mentioned, had the pre-NDA meeting with the different agencies, and there were absolutely no surprises &#x2013; positive meetings, very technical as usual. And the only thing I could see is we are working really as fast as possible to submit, but to do it before the end of this month being August would be on the optimistic side because we want to make sure that what we do submit are two world class dossiers and we actually are seeking to submit both Degludec and DegludecPlus dossiers and in more territories at the same time, i.e. both United States and Europe, but we are doing it very expediently, and <mark type="ph" /> it will go professionally. (26:21)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is Lars Rebien here again. Just a final additional comment about the Chinese market. We have also seen given the increasing pace, a decline in growth rates in the insulin market whereas it has previously in quarters has been above 20% in volume. It is now coming down, and we're looking at around 17% volume growth. So it is to be anticipated with the growing pace in China that we will start to see more humane growth rates in terms of volume demand. We are however still seeing great value upgrades in China. So overall the business is performing quite well.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question comes from Keyur Parekh from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Lars, you mentioned about slowdown in the European volume growth kind of now being sub-3%. Can you throw some additional light on why that might be the case and when do you expect that to recover? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we can perhaps broaden it out. If we look at Europe first, it's correct. When we look at the European market, the current volume growth rate is around 2.5%. It is primarily driven by slowdown in Germany, U.K., and France and the Netherlands, whereas in Southern Europe, there is still relatively strong growth with higher growth rates of more closer to 5% that we usually have seen.</p>
          <p>So I believe personally that there is an element of impact from the introduction of high volume new drugs in the OAT area &#x2013; the DPP-IV inhibitors. As you know, we have traditionally seen that there is a certain slowdown when new products are bring introduced until they sort of capture their normal audience and people will be postponing to go through insulin because they are trying a new set of drugs. So that could be one of the effects.</p>
          <p>When I said we could broaden that out a little bit, it's because, of course, the key question here is the general model that we try to assess in terms of the insulin global market growth. And there we have historically talked about a 5% volume growth and a 5% value growth meaning that our anticipation longer term is that the insulin market will grow 10% in terms of value. We still think that is going to hold true. If you look at the global market right now, it's growing in volume terms of around 6%. So there is no reason to indicate that that is not going to continue.</p>
          <p>The growth rate is of course being much, much stronger in IO and in China as we just recently discussed, whereas the main below average growth rates are seen in Europe and in Japan. So we think the volume growth is going to be there on a global basis, Europe is challenging at the moment as well as Japan is challenging at the moment. If we then look at the value component, that comes of course from being competitive, being able to operate in the markets the new products we have enjoyed over the recent years, both all main factors in fact push towards modern insulins. That value of component in the short-term had been going down as the base have become bigger, we now see that 81% of the value in the insulin market is occupied by modern insulin. So hence, of course, the added value from conversion is reduced compared to previous years. We're now talking about conversion of around 2% to 3% rather per year compared to historically 6% to 7% in previous years.</p>
          <p>In the future, that value component will be driven by new products and devices, and Novo-Nordisk is the one that's going to push this value upgrade, whereas when we look at a competitive situation, Sanofi-Aventis is likely to try to retain value and perhaps add value by introducing 45 glargine product with the GLP-1 component whereas as Lilly is currently not in a position to offer any innovative solutions in the short or medium term. That's why we can see some competitive pressures negatively on the price component. So we have two negative pressures on price component at the moment, one is health care reform and the other one is Lilly's very aggressive bidding for contract and bidding for contract in particular in the human insulin side.</p>
          <p>And when we look at Novo-Nordisk's situation in the short to medium term, we believe that given the better competitive situation with the introduction of Degludec, we should be able to gain market share and gain volume over and above that of the average market. The pricing element is of course an uncertain one because I cannot predict what market situation, we will find ourselves in when we are going to price Degludec when it comes to the market, but it gives us an opportunity to believe in a further value upgrade from Degludec and DegludecPlus. And there is still a component of value upgrade in devices relating to the business in United States. So for Novo-Nordisk I still believe that the case of 10%-plus annual average growth rate of our insulin franchise is still a viable model whereas it's the pressure short term because the base of modern insulin have become so large. Sorry for that a little extended answer, but lets' take the next question please.</p>

          <p>Hello, it's Michael Novod from Nordea Markets. The first question relating to the U.S. is in contract, I saw yesterday was out on newswire saying that you actually won some contracts here in Q2, which was significant with &#x2013; we've not seen in numbers yet. Could you elaborate a bit more on that? And then also of course in relation to that comment on the dynamics regarding Lilly, you say they are still aggressive, have you seen them also continue this very aggressive bidding into new contracts. And -</p>

          <p>This is Lars Rebien, you have a third question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just had one more &#x2013; just on the cost levels, especially on sales and marketing. I can see your R&amp;D of course is going up with your clinical trials, but on the sales and marketing, is that a guidance you give where you see a major cost boost in Q4 in order to start to ramp up sales force for Degludec?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will answer &#x2013; try to &#x2013; without getting in trouble, I'll answer the first question and then Jesper can answer the cost element. The reason why did I said I should be careful not getting in trouble here is we shouldn't of course announce our pricing policies as there are a very few players on our field and we could be treading on very thin ice here. Suffice to say that, we have of course observed the impact from &#x2013; this is very aggressive bidding on human insulin contracts in the U.S. with three contracts we lost early in the year. We can see with our commercial activities that new scripts, we are reverting to more normal trends.</p>
          <p>And we've been pursuing a strategy and let me again answer a little bit extended that one of my colleagues used a pretty good analogy to the telephony market. There are sort of three markets. There is the fixed line telephones which is equivalent to human insulin and the mobile phones which is equivalent to modern insulins and then there is of course a next generation which could be the data text which could be the iPhones and perhaps even Victoza as another treatment for type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>And so, we see now that that there is a heavy price competition and volume gains on the part of Lilly, especially in the fixed landline, the old technology. But it is a declining segment, and it is in our view a short-term strategy. We prefer to compete in the innovative end of the business, and but we have of course always also an interest in having a certain number of patients on our products so that we can upgrade patients rather than having to convert competitors' patients.</p>
          <p>So, there is always a balance for us between volume and margin. We have been pursuing a margin strategy over recent years trying to build value into the business by converting patients, in some cases even discontinuing the low end of the product range like we did in the U.K., only to find that this was perhaps short-term and is not the smart move because it was countered with a very aggressive move on the part of Lilly. So yes, it is an anticipated competitive move we see due to, in our assessment, a lack of innovation short term in the pipeline from one of our competitors, Jesper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of, Michael, on the growth in cost and the cost ratios in the second half of 2011, it is great to assume that we will see a higher growth in our selling and distribution costs in the second half of the year, and we anticipate that the level for the full year is going to be in the ballpark of 29.5%, 30% &#x2013; so somewhere between 29% to 30% of sales. And our R&amp;D cost on the other hand is expected to remain in the ballpark of around 15% to sales, and admin, the guidance is there still below 5% to sales also for the full year. And then for our selling and distribution cost of course assumes that we will see a slightly higher spending in the second half of the year and that's completely in line with the historic trend in our selling and distribution costs.</p>
          <p>Whether you would see specific expansions in the sales forces in the final quarter, probably a little bit premature to say, but looking ahead it's clear that as we prepare for the Degludec launch, it could be possible for us to look at the size of our sales force as basically in the market like the U.S.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi it's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Thanks very much for taking my questions. First question just on the debt deal that has been done in the U.S. very recently and whether you see any potential of further impacts on your Medicare, Medicaid sales in the U.S. When would you expect these and how much you think the impact might be at this early stage?</p>
          <p>Second question on Victoza, and we are coming up to sort of the annualization of the growth of Victoza in the U.S., and it could be slower going forward and therefore the ex-U.S. markets could hold much much more of the growth going forward in the second half. So therefore it would be really helpful if you could give us the rough U.S., ex-U.S. split and also talk about where you are with your geographic roll out? How many countries you are in, and how many you expect to continue to roll out through 2011, and beyond? Those are my two questions. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Richard. This is Lars Rebien here. The U.S. debt agreement, it's very very hard to guestimate to what extent that will impact future potential health care reforms in the U.S. But I think we all agree that it's likely that something will impact us negatively. How much I can't, I don't think it's necessarily going to be short term. I think, we as an industry, the health care industry has to consume significant impact we have just received from the health care reform that we are consuming and implementing right now.</p>
          <p>So it's unlikely for me to see that it will happen anything additional in 2011. Perhaps even 2012, but the U.S. has to gets its economy in order and therefore something will happen and we are certain of that. This also is something that we do factor into our long range guidance when we're talking about the potential growth for the company that the pricing environment in United States are going to be more like the pricing environment we know elsewhere.</p>
          <p>If we talk about Victoza, we are starting to see very strong growth of our business in United States, and we will eventually start to report to you the numbers, the monthly or the quarterly sales numbers rather than the scripts because the script numbers that you get from IMS can sometimes be deceiving in the sense that a script can be a two-pack script of 1.2 mg pen and it can be a three-pack script of 1.8 mg pen. They all count for a script, but obviously one has a dollar value compared to the other.</p>
          <p>So when we look at revenue development it follows very, very closely our projections. And we had originally anticipated that the distribution of two-packs and three-packs were 50/50, but what we do see in the marketplace is, actually, it's two-thirds that are three-packs and one-third which is the two-packs.</p>
          <p>We have launched Victoza. It's doing well in the European market as we have already described. It's still very early days. In Japan we had the disfortunate situation that there was a misconception in Japan which led to some safety issues as some doctors discontinued insulin when they started the administration even in type 2 patients that were insulin demanding and leading to some very serious health issues and so that has postponed our ability to broadly promote Victoza for safety concerns in Japan.</p>
          <p>That situation seems to have remedied itself, but it had set us back a little bit time-wise in Japan. China, we've already mentioned we haven't seen any sales yet, and so we are looking into markets like Turkey, like other overseas markets in Latin America, but it's very small numbers that we see at the moment. So there is still some roll out opportunities to be expected in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:42) markets. Distribution, 65% come from the U.S. and 35% comes from the other regions, with 30% being Europe and 5% being the rest of the world and so you can see it's still too early to see major growth in emerging markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking my questions. Firstly on China, you previously shown some useful charts to showing how the insulin market is split by the different segments, and it's the pre-mix that sort of dominates. Presuming that's still the case, is there any obvious change in terms of the basal long acting taking a greater part of that share. And within China within that basal segment, sort of what's the rough split Levemir versus Lantus, currently?</p>
          <p>And then sort of on the human insulin side and that seems to be where Lilly are being most aggressive in the U.S. Do you see any sort of loyalty in terms of people, either patients moving on to modern insulin showing loyalty to the brand and the manufacturer and from a payers' perspective, is there any sort of bundling advantage in terms of the modern and human insulin? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. In terms of the Chinese market, there are really no dynamics indicating a major shift. But we've seen in some other markets, Japan for instance, where the basal market has started to expand with the push by Sanofi-Aventis. That is not really happening in China. And we don't really foresee that to happen, given the fact that this is based on a very high price strategy. And so that high price strategy leads to some quite nice numbers in terms of value, but in terms of volume, it is very, very modest. So We think also that given the wish for health care reform in China and the wish for extending social services to a more broad base part of the population, it would favor the current regimen to be implemented just more and more broadly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May be just an additional comment. In terms of movements between the segments, currently the growth in China is largest for the basal segment and the pre-mix segment, but the basal segment now constitute around 65% of the market and the basal only constitute around 13% of the market in volume terms. So it is clearly biggest in the pre-mix segment. The value position taken by the modern insulins in the basal segment has been very aggressive. So it is still being sold at very high prices, and there we have of course only recently launched Levemir and have a very limited market participation in the basal segment. But we are still looking at the growth in the pre-mix segment in the ballpark of 20% on a net basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's only that you both have the existing national diabetes treatment guidelines in China plus of course emerging ones and they still seem to favor the notion that Chinese people do need this <mark type="ph" /> perennial (45:15) boost of insulin plus of the rapid decay of the first phase insulin in Chinese subjects. That is reflected in how they're actually recommended to treat their patients, and of course, that's most easily done with the pre-mixes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regard to the United States and loyalty and whether or not we see any pushback from the consumers towards switches or any pushback on forced switches by payers.</p>
          <p>Human insulin are largely prescribed in vials and syringes, and so that gives little manufacturing preference. This is rather undifferentiated. So the extent of which the managed care organizations are contracting for human insulins, there are significant switching opportunities. What we see with the modern insulins is the modern insulin is increasingly dispensed in devices which starts to create some kind of switching barrier.</p>
          <p>But we also have been on the other end, the flip side is that we see increasing power on behalf of the payers trying to even make single supplier contracts and heavily forcing the consumers to switch by imposing co-pays or even prior authorizations to have alternative products being used in the formulary. So in the modern insulin market, there is still some loyalty, and that's driven largely by the device. Human insulin, there's very little loyalty, it's price. Thank you, next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So my question, first question is on guidance for Jesper, in terms of the Prandin aspect of that, could you just let us know in the previous guidance, when you actually expected Prandin to go generic in the U.S. and so how much of a sales offset that change in guidance is. Second question just on the FlexTouch pen, how much of a value upgrade is that to compared to the FlexPen, the predecessor?</p>
          <p>And then just thirdly on Victoza, with Byetta we kind of saw a one-year stay time for patients on the drug once they started treating and then they move on to other therapies such as insulin. In terms of Victoza, we're not there yet, obviously, it's not been launched in the U.S. market that long, but how long do you expect the stay time to be on Victoza and when might we see that effect at all? And do you have any extra data coming on line in terms of what we might see to be able to sort of boost interim sales if we do actually starting seeing that phenomenon. I think I'll leave my questions there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper, would you comment on the guidance and the topic of Prandin and the discontinuation of Prandin generic competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the U.S. sales of Prandin is approximately DKK1 billion on an annual basis. Now the impact we are assuming to occur in 2011 was around midyear and that would then with generic competition occurring midyear would have an implication to the ballpark of DKK350 million to DKK400 million in sales in 2011. Now given that most of this patent litigation is put on hold and awaits the ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on this <mark type="ph" /> hugeco (48:52) issue where <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:55) has appealed the verdict that was given at federal circuit in Novo Nordisk's favor and they have said that the Supreme Court is going to rule in the first half of 2012. Then it is, from our point of view, not highly likely that we will have generic competition in the U.S. occurring in 2011. As a consequence you could say everything else being equal, it increases the sales estimate by DKK350 million to DKK400 million at midpoint. So that was the factor behind the changing the guidance in relation to Prandin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jesper. Mads, you have a comment on how we should see FlexTouch now being launched in Europe with the modern insulins but the reality is that it's a product that's intended for the next generation of insulin. Please comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what you can see is, it's a slightly more sophisticated device because of the need for this metal spring that actually gives the auto-injecting mechanism, which is a clear patient preference we have seen both in the clinical crossover trial, but also in the last market research. So no doubt that it's a patient preference driver and of course we need to launch it at the scale where before we go out with hundreds of millions of pens, we feel confident that all of the childhood diseases have been weeded out, if there are any at a all. I have to say that we haven't seen anything so far.</p>
          <p>So see it more as a differentiator for existing products such as NovoRapid, NovoLog in the event that you had to buy similar coming of age, then we would still be differentiated based on superior device, while at the same time paving the road for the launch of this device with superior insulin such as Degludec, DegludecPlus and of course also the GLP-1 platform lends itself well to the use of one variant or the other of the <mark type="ph" /> PDS 219. (50:41)</p>
          <p>Talking about GLP-1, I can just mention there on the stay time about Victoza that we don't have any firm data and you absolutely said that correctly, Tim, that it's somewhat early. But based on the fact that we are seeing more <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:55) other GLP-1s, we are also expecting a longer stay time, but there is kind of almost like a rule of thumb in the field of diabetes that stay times significantly above two years, if you do not add some other therapy, they are few and far between, because even for Metformin you will be aware that there the stay time even as a monotherapy in the first line treatment group, you are speaking to two to three years of stay time.</p>
          <p>So it's too early to say, but we expect a somewhat longer stay time than with Byetta and moreover we also expect hopefully to be able to add modern insulin, or even better, Degludec, on top of Victoza, hence retaining the benefits of the GLP-1 therapy even <mark type="ph" /> once a patient leaves.

          <p>Next question comes from Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Henrik Simonsen, SEB Enskilda. Lars, what is it that makes you so confident? Do you expect to come back to normal growth rate in the insulin space with your insulins? I presume that Lilly and Sanofi will be aggressive going forward. Of course, you won't have the health care impact in 2012, but are there other issues you are doing to address the market situation? That's first question. Then second question is just on Victoza. I think you've treated about 400,000 patients, have you seen any cases of medullary thyroid cancer in any of these patients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henrik. I'll comment on back to normal; and then I think you can get a comment from Mads Krogsgaard on the safety profile of Victoza. Well, if you look at the U.S., just take the U.S. insulin market, take the first half of this year and the growth of our business in the U.S. was 6%. If we then think about the health care reform as being a once-off event, that's 5 percentage points on an annualized basis in the U.S. So, add that back on, that gets you up to 11%. And the Wal-Mart, I mean this is a contract that will be out of the base and whether we get it back or not as human insulin largely &#x2013; but that's a once-off also so assuming that no additional major contracts are lost, that's 3 percentage points. And then we have discussed the fact that we decided for margin reasons not to bid aggressively on Lilly accounts. If we assume that we are not losing further grounds as a result of this, that would account for 2 percentage points. And so if you add that, all that back up again, then you are close to 15%.</p>
          <p>Therefore, there is the general uncertainty around whether we get another health care reform in United State, and we can all speculate on that. But so I'm actually quite &#x2013; some instance when we then look at Degludec and DegludecPlus, and the potential, I mean today when 10 patients are starting on basal insulins in the United States, seven of them start on Lantus, three of them start on Levemir. It is my anticipation that we will reverse that picture such that we will have seven patients starting on Degludec and three on something else where hopefully one of them will start on Levemir for some reason.</p>
          <p>And so that will completely change the dynamics longer term in the U.S. market. So with that, and also the opportunity of course is there also for other markets, I am quite confident that we should be able to see growth rates of our insulin bases 10% in the future. It's going to be challenging this year, of course, we will not reach it because of the health care reform, but 2012 and especially as we get into '13, you start to see impact from Degludec and DegludecPlus, I think it's doable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>And then maybe I'll also note in that then in the U.S. the last year we have not seen yet any impact on insulin volumes rather to the country. We've probably seen approximately 1 percentage point drop in the insulin volume growth in the U.S. and remember the previous discussion we had on the effect of getting decent medical coverage to another 40 million in the U.S. We would anticipate that we would see that having longer term effect on the insulin growth volumes in the U.S.</p>

          <p>So should we round off with the safety profile of Victoza so far, Mads?</p>

          <p>Yeah. And I can do that in two ways. One by addressing the pharmacovigilance system we have in place and the other by highlighting an update on some post-marketing requirements that we received from the FDA upon the approval of Victoza for diabetes.</p>
          <p>On the pharmacovigilance system, we of course solicit all the reports from adverse events as you aware from physicians and investigators using the product in a real life practice. And in terms of pancreatitis we are seeing reporting in the low levels of what would be expected i.e., 1,000 to 2,000 patient-years or so, and i.e. absolutely not imply that we can see anything <mark type="ph" /> in the retrocession (56:50) or imbalance in that regard. As regard to medullary thyroid carcinoma, this typically happens at about two times per year in a million patients and that means that we are getting to the point where you would start to expect to actually seeing such a case regardless of the medical therapy being given to the patients. But last time I read into the system and the report, last month's activity was, I didn't see anything. So there, the answer is no.</p>
          <p>But as regards the very important post-marketing requirements we got, we have actually completed two out of the three preclinical ones and one of them did indeed address the issue of whether it was a rodent-specific phenomenon whereby rodent C-cells, but not monkey and human cells, specifically up to one receptor, and it was that one which drove the hyperplasia leading to the tumor formation. Now we knocked out that just one receptor in mice and found that GLP-1s, both Victoza and Byetta were no longer able to stimulate any C-cell in any rodent, reproving our point that it's a GLP-1 receptor mediated rodent-specific phenomenon.</p>
          <p>The other <mark type="ph" /> PMI (57:51) we got from the Agency was one of starting a diabetes model of acute pancreatitis, and I'm happy to say that in that model which is the first model where we tested for a pancreatitis-inducing effect in the diabetes animal, diabetic animal we did not see an induction of acute pancreatitis.</p>

          <p>With this ladies and gentlemen, I think we are unfortunately at the end of this conference call. Please remember the replay is available on our website and our Investor Relations Officers will eventually is standing by to take your calls. But we have got to go into conference call in Copenhagen and then we are onto London and elsewhere in the world. So, intermittently, they will be having personal calls, but they are standing by as to take your call if you have additional questions. Thank you very much.</p>
