          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Viacom Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Release Teleconference. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us on our Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Administrative Officer and CFO: and Jimmy Barge, our Controller and Head of Tax and Treasury.</p>
          <p>Please note that in addition to our press release we have slides containing supplemental information available on our website. Let me refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our Earnings Release or on our website.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to remind you that in 2010, we will be transitioning to a September fiscal year-end. For SEC reporting purposes we will be filing a 10-K for the nine month sub-period ended September 30 of this year. We have added trending schedules to the financial announcement section of our website, which should provide you with a base year financial information needed to model our new fiscal year. Now I will turn the call over to Sumner.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Obviously I could not be more delighted to be addressing you today after this morning's announcement of Viacom's 2009 fourth quarter and full year results. Now, I always expect a strong performance from Philippe and his team. But their accomplishments this time far exceeded my expectations. It was a great year that ended on a great note. I am particularly proud of how Viacom demonstrated that financial foresight, operational discipline, creative energy, can produce superior bottom line results.</p>
          <p>In today's economy, few would have expected Viacom's fourth quarter operating income, adjusted net earnings, and EPS to grow as it did. That performance and our optimism for the future are based on the continued strength of our brands. They are based on the evergreen power of best in class assets and they are based on the fact that these brands and assets are managed by a top rated executive team, indeed the best in the business.</p>
          <p>While there continue to be strong uncertainties on the horizon, we see many reasons for optimism as the economy picks up speed and various sectors cautiously begin to raise their levels of output and ad spending, even though it will take time, but there is a steady drum beat of renewal and progress, particularly in the domestic market.</p>
          <p>Looking across Viacom, you see the fruits of that success. You see it at MTV Networks, you see it at BET Networks where both made significant progress in renewing key brands and building audiences and at Paramount Pictures, we're making hits and making money. Once again, share top billing. You see it in the scope of our programming and the breadth of our multi-platform distribution and you see it in our rock solid balance sheet that will continue to fuel growth for the years to come.</p>
          <p>Content. Content remains and always remain king and Viacom is leading the pack and setting the pace as our content focused enterprise. I thank you for attention. And now I will turn the call over to Viacom's President and CEO, my friend, my long-term advisor, Philippe Dauman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Sumner and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you could join us today. It's been quite a year. Viacom, like many companies faced significant challenges, but we emerged stronger financially, strategically and creatively. We did what was necessary to operate successfully in an environment filled with uncertainty and very little visibility but never deviated from our core focus on content.</p>
          <p>We elevated our game on multiple fronts. We strengthened our financial position, restructuring our debt profile to lengthen maturities at very attractive interest rates, increasing our operating free cash flow and expanding our operating margins.  We streamlined our organization and found new ways to reduce our overall cost structure on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>We continued to invest in programming, keeping the creative fires burning bright and delivering compelling content that resonates deeply with our target audiences and as I'll discuss in a moment, we have a number of new and established hit properties that are breaking through.</p>
          <p>We secured several long-term affiliate agreements, locking in a substantial portion of our affiliate revenue growth for the next several years. And as changes in technology confirm the central role of content in the future of media on a global basis, we continue to develop our capabilities to ensure a leadership position in the digital media world we see ahead.</p>
          <p>We're not out of the economic woods yet. Particularly in certain international markets where the recovery appears to be lagging the U.S., domestic unemployment continues to be a serious concern for all marketers. But we do see growing signs of strength as more advertisers return to the market and new strong categories of advertising emerge, notably in several increasingly competitive sectors of the technology industry.</p>
          <p>Today I'd like to hit the highlights from our fourth quarter and talk about how we are building on that momentum in both our media networks and film entertainment segments. I also want to spend a few minutes updating you on our thoughts and plans in the digital arena. Tom will provide additional detail on the numbers and trends and then we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>As we review our results Tom and I will refer to the adjusted numbers, unless we specify otherwise. The softness in revenues in the fourth quarter reflect the ongoing impact of a muted economy. Consolidated revenues were down 3% to just over $4 billion in the fourth quarter and our full year revenues of $13.62 billion represent a 7% decline year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Media Networks revenues decreased 6% in the quarter and 5% for the year. While revenues in the Film Entertainment segment declined 1% in the fourth quarter, 9% for the year, Paramount delivered a substantial year-over-year increase in profitability. Tom will provide some more detail on that in a few moments.</p>
          <p>Viacom's net earnings from continuing operations increased 43% to $663 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.09 versus $0.76 in the prior year's fourth quarter. For the year, net earnings from continuing operations grew 5% to $1.56 billion for the year or $2.56 per diluted share. We have maintained a strong cash position, and as I mentioned, we have taken measures to enhance Viacom's operating free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Now on to our Media Networks. Brand building is an essential component of our long term success. When times get tough, it becomes more important than ever. We strive to integrate our brands into our audience's lives by reflecting their interests and entertainment preferences on television, online, and increasingly on mobile devices, a connection that has great value to our distribution and marketing partners. We have created destination networks. Viewers tune in to Nickelodeon, because it is part of their daily lives. They do the same for MTV or VH1 or Spike or BET, because they're looking for a particular kind of entertainment that is unique and relevant.</p>
          <p>Double digit growth we achieved in affiliate fees over the past year is evidence of the continued and growing value we provide to our distribution partners. Our recently signed long-term affiliation agreements secure license fee increases, as well as distribution gains, including the carriage of HD networks in key markets.</p>
          <p>We are exploring and testing a variety of new products and technologies such as VOD Dynamic Ad Insertion and Next Day VOD that offer interesting opportunities to drive greater value for our partners' businesses as well as ours. We are also continuing to test authentication with certain affiliates and we have seen a growing interest in some of our international channels here in the U.S. We recently closed a distribution deal for COLORS, which is our Hindi language general entertainment channel in India.  And we will look for other opportunities to bring international networks here to the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter domestic ad sales were down 4%, the same as in the third quarter. Two factors were at work on the downside. The fourth quarter, as you know marked the beginning of the 2009-2010 broadcast season, which had a reduced upfront. The quarter was also impacted by ratings issues at certain networks. The good news is that the scatter market was strong with scatter over upfront pricing of double digits, which helped to partially offset the lower upfront pricing and ratings improved as the year-ended.</p>
          <p>Looking at first quarter advertising sales, we remain cautiously optimistic and expect to deliver sequential improvement. The tone is clearly more positive. Now, when it comes to programming, creating hits is always the goal. Over the past year we have spent a lot of time making changes, big and small, to refine the programming slates at several networks. First among those is MTV. Improving the ratings at MTV is the top priority for the MTV networks' management. Over the last several months we brought in a new programming team with expertise in a variety of genres from scripted programming to animation to comedy and more to build a new slate that better reflects the interests of the millennial generation.</p>
          <p>Q4 was a building quarter for MTV. And late in the year we launched several shows that began to connect with audiences. As the buzz around these shows intensified, the ratings soared. During the month of January, MTV had four of the top ten original cable series in its target 12 to 34 demo. Teen Mom on Tuesdays, Real World Washington D.C. on Wednesdays and on Thursdays Randy Jackson presents America's Best Dance Crew and the number one original cable series, Jersey Shore.</p>
          <p>MTV's audience grew 20% over a year ago in the first five weeks of this year and we are building on this momentum with returning hit series, as well as new shows on the schedule. We just brought back 16 and Pregnant, one of cable's top original series of 2009 and the second season of Taking the Stage. The Buried Life debuted two weeks ago and we'll premiere the MTV original movie Turn the Beat around later this month. Of course everyone has heard by now that our breakout hit, Jersey Shore will be returning for a second season. And that, as Snookie would say is a very good situation indeed.</p>
          <p>Nickelodeon is a network that just keeps churning out the hits. It had a terrific 30th anniversary last year continuing its reign as the number one cable network in total day among total viewers domestically and in January it scored its most watched month in the network's 30 year history. The January ratings surge was led by iCarly, I Saved your Life, and the series premiere of Big Time Rush, which swept the competition to rank as the number one and number two top rated shows respectively across all television, cable and broadcast among the core kid and tween demos for the week.</p>
          <p>iCarly delivered more than 11 million total viewers, making it the highest rated iCarly telecast ever among every key demo. With nearly seven million total viewers, Big Time Rush was Nick's highest rated live action series premiere ever. The Nickelodeon programming team has a slate of well-timed specials and tent poles scheduled over the next several months featuring Big Time Rush, The Penguins of Madagascar, iCarly, and culminating with another Kids Choice Awards, which will be followed by the premiere of Victorious at the end of March. These are designed to build on the 8% growth in audience size that Nickelodeon has already seen so far this year.</p>
          <p>Internationally, Nickelodeon channels attracted larger audiences in the fourth quarter in nearly every market with notable growth in Latin America and Europe. We expect this growth to continue in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>2009 was BET's best year in its 29 year history, delivering double digit ratings gains in all four quarters and across all key demographics. This significant growth is the result of the network's new programming strategy that includes more original programming, signature specials, key acquisitions, and blockbuster movies.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the outstanding performance of Paramount Pictures this past year. Paramount Pictures finished the year with very strong results. As you know, improving the studio's profitability was one of our priorities and our results demonstrate the progress we've made. The studio's list of achievements this year is impressive. Paramount finished the year in the number two spot in total domestic box office, generating the highest average domestic box office per picture among the major studios, more than $115 million per picture.</p>
          <p>We made great progress in our strategy of building franchises, our second Transformers installment, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, was the number one movie of the year. We revived the Star Trek franchise for a new generation and we released a breakout hit in Paranormal Activity, for which a sequel is already in the works.</p>
          <p>With restructuring and a substantial reduction in overhead costs, we improved Paramount's full year margins by nearly 300 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter we had a nice uptick in our Home Entertainment business, fueled by the DVD and Blu-Ray releases of the year's tent pole film. The sell through conversion ratios of Star Trek and G.I. Joe, in particular were well above industry averages.</p>
          <p>Double digit increase in television license fees was driven by growth in the area of international syndication. Looking ahead we have a strong film slate planned for 2010 beginning with next week's release of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. We will distribute three DreamWorks animation films this calendar year, two in the fiscal year, beginning with How to Train your Dragon, coming out in 3D late in the first quarter. That will be followed by Iron Man 2 and our Nickelodeon tent pole M. Knight Shyamalan's, The Last Airbender.</p>
          <p>Finally, a word about Epix. We launched a new network and digital service during the fourth quarter and the consumer reaction has been very positive. The breadth and quality of movie content Epix is offering is unmatched by any other single Pay TV network. Importantly we are no longer in a testing phase. We are authenticating customers today and offering full access to all of our content online.</p>
          <p>Our Network today offers more than 150 films in HD, more than any other Pay TV service and there are about 300 movies available online, most in high definition. That number will grow to more than 3,000 in the next year. We recently signed several new distribution deals with Cox Communications, Mediacom, Charter Communications and the National Cable Television Cooperative, NCTC. With those new deals as well as Verizon's FiOS, Epix will be available in nearly 20 million homes by May and there are more deals to come.</p>
          <p>I'd like to take a moment to talk about the digital landscape. Over the next decade or so, the Media business will evolve from a primarily linear world to a digitally dominant environment. And wherever we are in that continuum, content will play a central role. Every new device will require content. Even those we cannot yet envision. At Viacom we are digital every day. Our digital strategy is woven into everything we do. It centers on expanding the reach of our brands and building new businesses around our core competency of content creation, while also working closely with existing and new distribution partners to exploit new technologies.</p>
          <p>This strategy allows us to build our presence in the digital world prudently while waiting for sustainable business models to emerge. We are at our best when we focus on our own branded properties and provide our audiences with engaging experiences. Viacom Digital attracted nearly 100 million monthly unique global visitors during the fourth quarter, a 9% increase from a year ago.</p>
          <p>We know that our branded online sites actually boost viewership of our television networks by increasing the buzz surrounding hit programs. We are also experimenting with original programming created for digital outlets. Digital content can be created at a fraction of the cost of linear programming and with limited distribution costs and presold sponsorships, we have already created compelling products such as MTV's $5 cover and Paramount's Circle of Eight.</p>
          <p>Viacom also has a growing footprint in the area of casual online games through top rated properties such as AddictingGames and GameTrailers.com. If you were to aggregate all of our gaming entities across the company, it would be the top gaming property in the gaming category online in the U.S. No one knows for certain exactly how the world of media will look 10 years from now. Business models will evolve and devices will come and go. But we do know that Viacom will continue to provide much of the world's greatest entertainment content across all screens and across all geographies, which is why our digital strategy is pivotal to our long-term success.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we have worked with the leadership of our divisions to achieve a number of strategic objectives. We restructured our international operations and significantly expanded their margins. We developed a new strategy for Paramount Pictures designed to improve the studio's profitability. We accelerated our digital activities across the company. We continue to make programming investment a top priority and we strengthened our balance sheet providing us with greater financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>These accomplishments bode well for Viacom's future as we tackle the challenges ahead and continue to strengthen our leadership positions in key entertainment categories. Our brands are vibrant and the power of those brands to motivate consumers cannot be overstated.</p>
          <p>Before I close, I want to acknowledge the phenomenal work of Judy McGrath and Debra Lee and their teams at MTV networks and BET networks in producing two historic evenings of entertainment to raise money to help with recovery operations in Haiti. MTV networks presented Hope for Haiti Now, which aired on nearly all of our networks globally as well as all the domestic broadcast networks and many other cable networks, and raised more than $66 million and counting for the cause, a new telethon record for donations from the public. Two weeks later Debra and her team at BET networks presented SOS Saving Ourselves, Help for Haiti. The success of these extraordinary events further illustrates the strength of the bond our audiences have with our brands. It is that connection, that trust that we will continue to nurture to drive our business in the future.</p>
          <p>And now I will turn it over to my partner, Tom, for a closer look at the numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've had a chance to review our earnings release and the web presentation summarizing our fourth quarter and full year results. Our 10-K will be filed shortly. This morning I'm going to take you through our results in more detail and I'll update you on the key factors impacting 2010. I'll also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage, and our cash position.</p>
          <p>In terms of my remarks, I will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations which exclude, from the fourth quarter of this year, 50 million of discrete tax benefits related to prior year's audit settlements, as well as a non-cash impairment charge at Media Networks related to certain broadcast licenses. The charge had a $60 million impact on operating income and a $19 million impact on net income. As a reminder, last year's adjusted results excluded restructuring charges of $454 million, discrete tax benefits of $9 million as well as a $15 million non-cash investment impairment charge.</p>
          <p>As Jim mentioned, in 2010 we will be transitioning to a September fiscal year end. This change in fiscal year better aligns our financial reporting period and our planning and budgeting processes with our business cycle, particularly the cable broadcast year. The trending schedules should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition period.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues declined $145 million, or 3%, to 4.1 billion as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Media Networks revenues declined $142 million, or 6%, primarily due to lower Rock Band and advertising revenues. Filmed entertainment revenues declined slightly in the quarter. Total company expenses declined 368 million for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined 230 million, and Media Network expenses declined 165 million. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was principally due to lower distribution costs related to our third party distribution title. The decline at Media Networks was due primarily to lower Rock Band costs. Consolidated operating income increased 24% to 1.2 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our segment results. I'll start with the Media Networks group. Media Networks revenues declined 6% to 2.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Domestic revenues declined 7%, and international revenues were flat. Foreign exchange had a five percentage point favorable impact on international revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues declined 4% in the fourth quarter, which was on par with the third quarter. International advertising revenues increased 3% in the quarter with foreign exchange favorably impacting the growth rate by seven percentage points. We continued to see sequential improvement in international advertising since it bottomed in June 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 10% while international revenues increased 17%. Foreign exchange had a five percentage point favorable impact on the international affiliate growth rate. In terms of the drivers for domestic affiliate revenues, nearly 80% of the growth was from rate increases while approximately 20% of the growth was from increased subscribers. International growth was impacted by a combination of increases in subscribers, new channel launches as well as rate increases.</p>
          <p>Moving to ancillary revenues, domestic revenues declined 43% while international revenues declined 21%. The decline in ancillary revenues reflects lower Rock Band revenues primarily due to lower sales of Rock Band bundles as well as a challenging retail environment. Media Networks operating income of $921 million in the quarter was 3% higher than last year. The operating margin improved approximately 300 basis points to 39% in the fourth quarter. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 43%. Programming expense in the quarter increased 6% as we invested in original programming including Jersey Shore, Teen Mom as well as other acquired products.</p>
          <p>Despite the difficult economic environment, for the full year the core margin improved approximately 70 basis points to 40%. During the year we aggressively re-allocated capital in our core businesses, reducing SG&amp;A costs by 7% and distribution costs by 11% and we used some of those savings to invest in our programming and our brands. Programming expenses for the full year increased 3%. If you exclude the savings from last year's fourth quarter restructuring charge, programming expenses increased 6%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Filmed Entertainment, fourth quarter revenues declined 1% to $1.8 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide Theatrical revenues decreased 73% in the quarter to $93 million. The decline in Theatrical revenues was primarily due to the number and mix of films as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues increased 12%, or 125 million from the fourth quarter of 2008. Foreign currency had a five percentage point favorable impact on worldwide results. The increase in Home Entertainment revenues reflects the performance of our summer hits, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Star Trek, G.I. Joe, as well as the performance of Paranormal Activity. TV license fees increased 27% to 445 million in the quarter reflecting higher Pay TV, Pay-per-view, and Foreign Syndication revenues.</p>
          <p>Filmed Entertainment generated operating income of 298 million in the fourth quarter as compared to operating income of 84 million last year. The $214 million improvement in operating income reflects the Home Entertainment performance of our summer tent pole as well as the theatrical performance of Paranormal Activity.</p>
          <p>For the full year Paramount generated 236 million in operating income and improved its operating margin approximately 300 basis points. This is the highest profitability the film studio has generated in seven years. During the quarter, certain of Paramount's film releases were made available to our Epix Pay TV joint venture. Accordingly, we recognized 32 million of revenue and 11 million of operating income at Filmed Entertainment related to the films. We also recorded 19 million of equity losses from the joint venture which reflects programming amortization and marketing costs associated with the launch of the channel. So the net impact overall to Viacom in the quarter from Epix was de minimus. From a cash perspective, inception to date, we have invested 82 million in the joint venture and we have received 110 million in payments for the films that we have delivered.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to touch on the Corporate group. Expenses increased 12 million in the quarter, primarily related to higher employee compensation costs including higher equity-based compensation as a result of the increase in our stock price. Moving below the segment results, total company equity losses from investments were 20 million in the fourth quarter. The losses in the quarter principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. Other items generated income of 10 million in the quarter which compares to a loss of 59 million last year. The income in the quarter primarily reflects foreign exchange gains while last year's results reflected foreign exchange losses.</p>
          <p>The reported tax rate for the full year was 31.1%. The reported tax rate was impacted by 124 million in discrete tax benefits. The full-year adjusted effective tax rate was 35.7%, which is comparable to the full year for 2008.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and our debt profile. We generated 1.1 billion in operating free cash flow in the quarter and two billion for the full year which is up 17% over the full year 2008. Page six of the web deck provides the components of free cash flow. Our aggressive cost containment in working capital management enabled us to generate operating free cash flow of $3.36 per share in 2009. During the fourth quarter we paid down the 775 million outstanding balance under our receivable securitization program because doing so was the most economical way to fund these receivables. Currently we are able to access the commercial paper marketplace at annual borrowing rates in the mid-20 basis points.</p>
          <p>The difference between operating free cash flow and free cash flow is the pay down of the asset securitization program and the premium we paid when we tended for our 5.75% senior notes back in the third quarter of the year. Accordingly free cash flow for the quarter was $353 million, and for the full year it was $1 billion. In terms of leverage, we ended the year with 6.8 billion of debt in capital leases outstanding and approximately 300 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn.</p>
          <p>At this point virtually all of our debt is fixed rate. The fixed rate debt has an average cost of 6%. The only short-term variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end was $16 million of commercial paper. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times, which is within our targeted range of two to 2.5 times. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least three times. At the end of the quarter our interest coverage was approximately eight times.</p>
          <p>In terms of our debt profile we began 2009 as a split-rated company with the triple &#x2013; within the BBB category with near-term maturities and leverage of three time. During the course of the year we termed out our debt so that we have no substantive maturities until 2014. We reduced our leverage and improved our rate of free cash flow conversion. Our strong cash position and our strengthened balance sheet enabled us to go from a split-rated company to a solid BBB by both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. We exit 2009 with an improved capital structure and leverage profile.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting 2010's fiscal year. In the March quarter, 2009, our affiliate revenue growth rate had a three percentage point benefit from certain non-recurring factors. Accordingly, reported affiliate revenues in this year's March quarter will grow high single digits given the difficult comparison. We expect domestic affiliate revenues to resume their double digit growth rate after the March quarter.</p>
          <p>As was the case in the prior year, we anticipate a loss at Filmed Entertainment in the March quarter. The loss is primarily driven by the P&amp;A impact from the March 26 release of How to Train Your Dragon as well as the absence of any major titles entering the Home Entertainment or Pay TV windows during the quarter. In 2010 we are forecasting a tax rate of 37%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.</p>
          <p>This past Monday we closed a transaction where we repurchased the movie library that was financed through DreamWorks funding. The acquisition will result in significant savings as we are able to fund this program at a significantly lower cost than the entity as a stand-alone credit. As a result of this purchase, we will consolidate on our books the DreamWorks live-action library as well as approximately 400 million of net debt associated with the venture.</p>
          <p>In summary, this past year presented companies with unique challenges. The uncertain global economic environment exposed weaknesses in many company's operating strategies and capital structures. Our brands and franchises demonstrated their resilience during this period as we secured long-term affiliate deals, improved the ratings on several of our flagship networks and successfully launched several new film franchises. Our operating and capital discipline put us on a stronger footing as we exited the year. At Media Networks we re-allocated capital from overhead into investments and programming, and our brand, and we have begun to see the returns from those investments.</p>
          <p>At Paramount, we rationalized the studio's cost structure and put in place a more focused release strategy which enabled us to generate the strongest profitability the studio has seen in years. And we were able to improve our operating margins at both Media Networks and at Filmed Entertainment despite the difficult economic environment. We aggressively managed our working capital and capital expenditures which enabled us to generate operating free cash flow which exceeded the prior year. And we ended the year with a stronger balance sheet and a more secure debt profile. Going forward, we will continue to find ways to improve the returns in the business and enhance shareholder value.</p>
          <p>With that I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions.</p>

          <p>Thanks, I have two for either of you guys. First one would be, for many years I've been asking about Paramount profitability, so it was good to see the profits finally turn and the margin go up. So with that said why can the current level of profitability now remain steady at Paramount for the next couple years?  And then secondly for Rock Band, this segment was not kind of turning out the way we thought it would be, so why do you remain in the Rock Band business? And if you stay, what would you do differently in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michael. As to Paramount, obviously in terms of future profitability in the movie business, it will depend on how films perform. However, what we have done, as both Tom and I discussed, is reduce the overhead structure, save on costs, operate more efficiently, and our release strategy is such that we have fewer films. We are anchored on several existing and new franchises, and we also are really looking forward to some of our big branded pictures based on Nickelodeon and MTV brands, notably Last Airbender, which is opening this summer. So we think we have a structurally sounder studio and a great creative platform.</p>
          <p>As to Rock Band, it certainly was a challenging year in 2009 for the video game industry in general and certainly for our Rock Band franchise. As we go forward, we are continuing to focus more on software than hardware, looking to reduce the cost structure associated with Rock Band. Being selective in the music titles that we choose for Rock Band based on their cost. The music industry will have to assist this category to make sure that it can continue on a profitable basis in the future. And then finally, we think we have the best games in the category. We'll continue to roll out exciting product.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of questions about cost side of the business. Since like the operating expense excluding Rock Band and programming was down significantly, as we look at 2010, do you expect costs excluding programming and Rock Band will be down, flat, or up year-over-year?  And secondly, how should we think about the programming cost increase this year? And finally, can you give us some sense about your international cable margins for this year and how does that compare to the domestic margins? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Imran, as far as programming costs for the year 2010, we expect that they will continue to be up and we will be able to do that because we're quite consciously managing the rest of our cost base to maintain or improve the margins that we have. So I provide you with some forecasting guidance along the area of flat in terms of the overall cost, but programming costs will increase. We are going to work very hard to drive our margins to a sustainable level that we have achieved and work as best as we can to continue to see improvement there. International margins continue to be in sort of &#x2013; just above the high single digits, or low &#x2013; into the low double digit area on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We don't see that number changing all that much in the near future. Perhaps I'd say maybe in the 2012, 2013 timeframe is where we could kind of get out to hope to redefine that metric.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. Actually just continuing on the Cable Network margins, can you, Tom, can you just give us your outlook over the next few years, where you think you can take the Cable Network margins to? I mean you showed really good growth in the margins, and just where do you think you can get to? Secondly, with all of the new deals you guys signed with Epix, will it be profitable in the current year? And can you give us any, can you just generally lay it on where it's already offered, how many people are actually taking it? Or using it, the service? And then finally, can you comment on the tone of the kids' market given competitor comments? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'll let Philippe talk about Epix and the kids' marketplace, but in terms of the cable margins for the future, Jessica, if you look at the business, international as I said, is in the high single digits, low double digit type of range. And then there's Rock Band in there as when we kind of break out what Rock Band's impact is on margin. And it is significant. If you look at the core domestic networks, they're in the high 40s, so a very, very profitable network from a domestic point of view. It really will depend on which elements grow more in the future. If the advertising marketplace is &#x2013; in the United States continue to grow, to grow healthily I think we'll be able to increase the domestic proportion of the business and that would have a commensurate impact on the overall margins. Philippe, why don't you talk about Epix and the kid's market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jessica. As to Epix, we're very pleased with the distribution deals that we have achieved and others in the pipeline. There's a little bit of a lag time in the launch under these agreements. So as we previously announced, Cox will be launching Epix in April. Charter will be launching it in May. We are in front of Verizon subscribers. So as we ramp up the distribution, the revenues will start coming in, and we are still targeting to be operating cash flow positive next year for Epix. So we are in the trajectory that we expected there. As far as the kids' marketplace, I'm aware of some of the comments made by one of our competitors. We're the market leader in kids. And while there's been some softness in categories such as toys, when scatter dollars came in at the end of the fourth quarter, as they were advertising, we believe we captured the great bulk of those scatter dollars. 80% and up of the dollars that were available.</p>
          <p>Also, unlike the competition, again because both of our leadership position and the fact that we have a lot of co-viewing by parents and so forth, we are getting the overwhelming lion's share of non-endemic advertising associated with the category. So for us, the marketplace for the Nickelodeon brands is, in relative terms, quite good.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, couple of questions. One, the DreamWorks live-action library that you re-acquired, could you just talk about how much EBITDA you get out of that library at least on a trailing 12-month basis? What you paid for it beyond the assumption of debt and just what interest rate that debt that you're assuming is at, just so we can think about the impact on fiscal 2010? And then it looks like with doing $2 billion of kind of normalized free cash flow, and assuming you're going to have growth based on your margin expansion comments before, it looks like your stock is trading at somewhere around seven times free cash flow. Is there any better use than starting to buy back stock again? And when would you think about actually starting to buy back stock timing wise, given the extent of free cash flow? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, we're not going to break out in any detail the profitability of the library. But it, you know it functions depending upon availability, as films become available in different windows. It's basically a catalog of all library films. The 400 million is the 400 million. That's what we paid, that's what's going to be on our balance sheet. Nothing higher, nothing lower. It's cash that comes in associated with those receipts and those things that this thing amortizes very quickly over the next few years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as our policy and returning cash to shareholders, as you know, Rich, we are a, as demonstrated by our results, our free cash flow is very back end loaded in the calendar year. So we will &#x2013; we obviously are in a strong position, as you pointed out, and as we go further along in the year, we will look at economic conditions. We will look at the condition of our balance sheet and our company, and we will evaluate what we can recommend to our Board in terms of when and how we return money to our shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Tom mentioned in his remarks, our targeted range is two to 2.5 times. So I think that answers your question. But we just have to evaluate the uses. We just took in the DreamWorks library and we'll just have to see where we sit as the cash flow comes in at a heavier rate as the year progresses.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had two quick questions. In terms of the sequential improvement you alluded to, I think in the first quarter, does that &#x2013; by improvement do you mean less negative or actually positive ad growth? And then my second question is, what, are the odds sort of zero or low or medium that if MGM keeps contributing or stops contributing cash to Epix that you ultimately consolidate that venture? Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the sequential improvement of ad sales in the first quarter, it's still early in the first quarter and we were at minus four in domestic ad sales in the fourth quarter. So sequential improvement means we will be better than minus &#x2013; we expect to be better than minus 4% in the first quarter of '10. Beyond that, we are not in a position to make any predictions. As far as MGM, they continue to be a good partner. We have &#x2013; we are very pleased at Epix to have access to their very strong library, which puts Epix in a good position. We are not consolidating Epix at this point, and obviously we will evaluate that situation as we go forward based on facts and circumstances.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Two sort of follow-ups. The first, I may have missed it. Did you actually quantify the amount of free cash flow that the DreamWorks library, the live-action library is generating? And second, on the international cable business, your business is somewhat more mature than some of your competitors internationally, but the &#x2013; it sounds like you're looking for another kind of two years-ish to really see a step up in margin. What is the primary driver there that we expect to develop over the next two years to kind of get you to the next level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you look going forward in the international margins as we shift sort of the business model from operating in a full-blown operating model to a license model in the marketplace, it would reduce the overall revenue line but increase the absolute profits that we throw out of the business so the margins would inherently improve. And we have not quantified the DreamWorks &#x2013; the cash flow coming out of the DreamWorks library or the operating income. But it does have significant cash flow associated with it. It was a financing vehicle and over the years, it does generate cash flow to pay itself down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>And the leverage ratios you gave included the impact of that acquisition or excluded it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now the leverage ratios you are referring to are 12/31 so it did not include that but there won't be a material change in the leverage ratios.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add on the international, the other factor in the international arena is, as you know, there is worldwide economic weakness.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Just looking at these Paramount results. Philippe, how much of this was perhaps also driven by revision of some of your contracts at Cinram where there perhaps &#x2013; there might be lower replication costs involved? And also, maybe perhaps just initiatives surrounding the second disk? A lot of people just don't want that second disk &#x2013; the two disk DVD just tends not to sell very well. Is there any realignment there that you can comment on? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there was some benefit as far as lower replication costs. That was certainly one of the measures taken by Paramount management team but that was achieved rather late in the year. So most of the benefit will be felt as we go forward, that's part of what I referred to when I said that we had some structural improvements in the cost structure at Paramount. And certainly, we look at what works from a consumer standpoint whether there's &#x2013; what works in the DVD marketplace which as you know on an overall basis was challenged although our titles performed quite well. Notably, we had the number one and number two titles in the Blu-ray format with Transformers and Star Trek and Blu-ray has now become a significant portion of DVD sales. And we think that will grow and that's a nice margin product. So we will test different configurations of the product and really see what enjoys consumer acceptance.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thank you for taking calls this morning. A lot of my questions have been asked so just a really quick question. When you're looking at the 20% of your affiliate revenue &#x2013; I think in the fourth quarter that was driven by new subscribers and the other 80 being by rate increases. On the 20% on the sub increase, is this telco adding channels that previously a cable customer was not getting? Or can you sort of talk more about sort of what kind of subscriber growth you're getting? I'm kind of curious on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as &#x2013; in the various deals that we achieve, we are getting additional distribution. Some of our channels are not fully distributed. So in many of these deals, we are getting additional subscribers. Obviously our main networks such as MTV, Nickelodeon and others are pretty much fully distributed. So we are getting some lift from that. You're quite right that when you look at some of telco's, they carry all of our channels. So &#x2013; not all distributors do carry every one of our channels so that gives you some of the lift. And of course, household formation is a factor. You see that rates has been a larger percentage than normal in terms of the breakdown between rate and subscriber growth and part of that is with the recession. The household formation in the country has slowed down. In a recovery, that should pick up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on that front, I mean sort of talking about the channels in general, when you look at the first quarter and you talked about I know you're going to see a slightly low-ish number for the year, is that a function of some of like &#x2013; is that just a function of seasonal trend or is that a function of some contract, sort of timing issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately, the first quarter of 2010. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That was just a one-time event in the first quarter of '09 that we're comping against which is why rather than being double-digits in the quarter as far as growth goes, we expect to be high single-digits. But once we get past that one-off comp, we'll get back to the double-digit affiliate fee growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you just sort of think out further from an affiliate perspective, what's your view on what sort of &#x2013; I realize not sort of looking for guidance but what's your sort of view on what a medium term sort of growth rate would look like splitting it down between subscriber increases and rate increases. Do we start to go from 80/20 to sort of more a 70/30 as household formation comes back and as rate pressures kind of moderate a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't break it &#x2013; we can't start making predictions and breaking it down that way. We have &#x2013; the nice thing about the affiliate fees is that they are subject to long-term contracts so we know where our rates are going. Obviously we have renewals along the way and you can't predict that exactly. And I'm not going to sit here and start predicting just how quickly and to what extent the economy will recover and what impact that will have on household formation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Good morning. A couple things. First, just to go back to your advertising revenue guidance, can you give a little bit more detail here, not guidance but your outlook? A bit more detail on the components of that given that in the first quarter you're comping what was really probably the softest quarter in terms of performance last year and what we were seeing in the economy. So, if you could talk a little bit about maybe why that was so weak, the pricing, sell through, ratings? And then what you're seeing this year in the first quarter? I know that you have a higher mix of upfront with sort of weight on the fourth quarter. How is that progressing? And if you could talk about scatter-over-scatter and sell through? And then also on Rock Band, Electronic Arts I think had mentioned they're moving away from distribution agreements and I was wondering if you could just comment on how that could impact you and what you might end up doing there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as the ad revenue outlook for the first quarter, we are still not even half way through the quarter so there's really not that much that we can say more than we have. You quite rightly point out that the previous quarter was the quarter where we had the largest proportion of upfront inventory. Still quite a bit in this quarter. So the pricing on that obviously pulls us down. On the other hand the scatter market remains strong so that's an offsetting factor. And then we'll see what the demand is as we progress. So all we can say right now is based on where we are currently, we do expect sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. As far as Rock Band distribution, we &#x2013; EA is continuing to distribute our products &#x2013; our product notwithstanding the issues in the industry and in the category last year. It's still a very strong product. We are in discussion to evaluate future distribution relationship and we'll let you know when that is determined.</p>
