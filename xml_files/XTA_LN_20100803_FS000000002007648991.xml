          <p>Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the presentation of our half year results for the six months ended 30th of June 2010. Also, as usual, I'd like to welcome those that are attending the presentation via webcast and those on the phone as well.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are the other members of the Executive Committee who most of you by now will recognize, quite a stable team. In the front of the room we have Trevor Reid, our Chief Financial Officer; Charlie Sartain, Chief Executive of Xstrata Copper; Ian Pearce, Chief Executive of Xstrata Nickel; Santiago Zaldumbide who is a Director of company and Chief Executive of Xstrata Zinc; Peter Freyberg, Chief Executive of Xstrata Coal and Peet Nienaber, Chief Executive of our Alloys business.</p>
          <p>Benny Levene is our Chief of Legal Counsel and Thras Moraitis, our Executive General Manager of Strategy and Corporate Affairs are also in the room this morning. And I would like to say that Senior Independent Director, David Rough is in the room as well. So if you have any rough questions please address them to Mr. Rough.</p>
          <p>In the first half, Xstrata's businesses delivered a robust volume and cost performance, which together with the improved commodity prices led to a very strong performance especially when compared to the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>Operating results were more than doubled to $3.2 billion and net earnings rose by 150%. And once again, progress in reducing our operating cost base is very encouraging with a further reduction of some $243 million in the period.</p>
          <p>The other key highlight of the past six months has been the momentum we have built up in delivering on our industry leading growth pipeline. And I am very pleased with progress our teams are making on our major growth projects from a rather technical, social and environmental point of view.</p>
          <p>All of our projects remain on track and within budget, and a further $8 billion of projects have been approved since the preliminary results in February.</p>
          <p>So I'll now hand over to Trevor who will take us through the key points of Xstrata's operational and financial performance before we elaborate further on the transformation that our organic growth projects are delivering.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks Mick, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. As usual, our financial and operating performance during the period has been set up in some detail in our half yearly report released this morning and available in your packs. And so I may have to limit today's presentation to the key points.</p>
          <p>The recovery we experienced in the second half of 2009 continued into the first half of 2010 as demand for our product and consequent rising commodity prices continue to increase, resulting in a solid set of results.</p>
          <p>Revenue for the period was $13.6 billion, 43% higher than the first half of 2009, whilst operating profit more than doubled reflecting significantly improved prices across the majority of our commodities which more than offset the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar or local operating cost. Once again real cost savings were a feature of this periods performance.</p>
          <p>Interest rates continue to fall and the reduction in debt levels resulted in negligible net finance costs during the first half. The effective tax rate has remained at 25%, as further guidance are provided at our 2009 preliminary results presentation.</p>
          <p>Attributable profit before exceptionals increased by 153%, to $2.3 billion, only half a billion less than 12 months net earnings for 2009, providing earnings per share before exceptional items of $0.79.</p>
          <p>Positive momentum in earnings growth continued into 2010 with operating EBITDA rising by 10% compared to the second half of last year and by 67% over the first half. Stronger market conditions led to improved prices and sales volumes in most of Xstrata's businesses.</p>
          <p>The result was also positively impacted by the ongoing benefits we are seeing from the restructurings of our Nickel and Zinc businesses undertaken in 2009 and by the successful commissioning of new lower cost production.</p>
          <p>Recovering demand and ongoing constraints to supply have supported significantly higher average base metal prices than last year. And the global economic recovery and restocking in the stainless steel sector has also led to a 60% increase in ferrochrome prices.</p>
          <p>Average LME copper, nickel and zinc prices increased by 76%, 81 and 63%, respectively. The overhang of lower thermal and semi-soft coal contract prices settled in 2009 for the Japanese full year to April impacted received thermal and semi-soft prices in the period. This negative impact was offset by higher received coking coal prices which rose by 36% in line with improved global steel production.</p>
          <p>Now clearly, the second half received thermal and semi-soft prices will benefit from recently concluded thermal coal settlements at substantially higher prices.</p>
          <p>Demand for ferrochrome continued to improve in the first half, reflecting growing global production of stainless steel. In response, Xstrata's operations returned to around 85% capacity utilization at the beginning of 2010.</p>
          <p>The recovery in economic conditions created a significantly stronger pricing environment for all of Xstrata Alloys' commodities. And during the first half of the year, the ferrochrome price and average PGM basket both increased by 60% compared to the same period in 2009.</p>
          <p>It is a credit to Peet and his team that despite the difficult operating environment Xstrata Alloys achieved real cost savings of $54 million to mitigate the impact of significantly higher electricity prices and ongoing inflation in the South African mining sector, exacerbated by the negative impact of a weaker U.S. dollar against the South African rand.</p>
          <p>The entrepreneurial spirit of the Alloys team is evident in the way they continue to proactively offset expected cost increases in key areas, including reducing energy intensity through the implementation of proprietary technology, increasing the use of low cost UG-2 ore in the mix, reducing their dependence on higher price met coal and investing in additional palletizing capacity at the Rosenberg operations.</p>
          <p>The growth of Xstrata's platinum business continues steadily. At the Eland, the shaft for the western decline system has advanced by almost 700 meters, and the shaft development at the eastern decline is currently at around 400 meters, following the capital approval in March. Production for the underground operations at Eland is projected to reach some 250,000 tons per month by 2013 with steady state capacity of 500,000 tons per month being achieved sometime in 2015, equivalent to some 310,000 ounces of platinum. And this mine will have a life of approximately 40 years.</p>
          <p>Exploration programs are also underway to investigate the potential to extend and increase capacity through the development of the deeper Madibeng and adjacent de Wildt Reserves.</p>
          <p>We continue to see strong positive momentum in coal prices into Asia and annual thermal coal contract prices were settled at substantially improved level of $98 per ton for the year commencing 1st April. The momentum has continued into the third quarter with subsequent settlements of $103 per ton from the 1st of July, and coking coal settlements in the range of 220 to $270 per ton, some 75% higher than the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Semi-soft sales volumes increased by around 50% on the first half 2009, while thermal coal sales remained in line with the prior period as we switched thermal coal production into semi-soft to take advantage of higher prices and margins.</p>
          <p>The recommencement of longwall operations at Oaky No.1 contributed to a 58% increase in coking coal sales volumes and together with productivity improvements at a number of sites reduced real unit cost by a total of $109 million.</p>
          <p>Peter and his team continued to bring on successive new lower cost coal production and during the first half commissioned both the replacement Blakefield South longwall operation, which adds a further 12 years of life to this New South Wales complex, and the GGV or Goedgevonden, an open-pit mine in South Africa which is ramping up to reach full capacity of 7 million tons in 2011.</p>
          <p>Three growth projects are currently in the construction phase at Mangoola, Newlands and ATCOM East all of which are expected to start production in 2011. And today we have also announced the approval of the Ulan West project at a capital cost of $1.1 billion, which will add 7 million tons of annual production from 2014 over a mine life of 18 years. Two further significant coal projects are still due to be approved in the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>In total, near-term growth projects will add over 30 million tons per annum of new thermal coal production and 2 million tons of additional annual coking coal capacity, increasing total production volumes by 50% by the end of 2014 and reducing operating cost by approximately 10% over 2009 levels.</p>
          <p>Improved recoveries, higher grades and increased copper sales volumes from Collahuasi offset the multiple headwinds experienced by Xstrata Copper's operations of lower, of low copper grades, significantly lower gold grades and recoveries at Alumbrera and the mining of low grade material at Ernest Henry as the open-pit reaches depletion.</p>
          <p>Lower grades impacted operating profits by some $62 million during the period. However, the Copper team successfully offset almost half of this impact through productivity improvements elsewhere, most notably at Collahuasi, together with lower maintenance costs at Kidd Metallurgical following its closure this year. All-in-all, C1 cash costs were maintained at around $0.90 per pound.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Copper continues to make good progress on its suite of expansion projects. The $0.5 billion project to transform the Ernest Henry open-pit mine into a major underground mine was approved at the end of 2009 and work continued in the first half, despite a delay of around a month to the main underground shaft project due to the uncertainty created by the Australian governments proposed Resources Super Profit Tax.</p>
          <p>As of 30th June, the underground decline development had reached a total of 4,500 meters and initial site works had commenced to construct a 1.2 million ton per annum magnetite facility to process Ernest Henry tailings.</p>
          <p>The $300 million expansion of Lomas Bayas to 2020 remains on schedule to reach full production in the fourth quarter of 2012. And at Antamina, a $1.3 billion expansion approved in January to increase Xstrata's share of copper metal output by approximately 40,000 tons per annum, it is progressing well towards initial production at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>At Collahuasi, the expansion to 150,000 tons per day is due to complete in the first quarter of next year and further debottleling projects are planned to progressively reach a processing capacity of 170 tons per day and the recent 2 billion tons of additional mineral resources announced at this operations underpins the scoping study that will be completed early next year in respect of a future expansion to 1 million tons of copper production per annum.</p>
          <p>Charlie will provide more detailed update on the landmark Southern Peru projects of Antapaccay and Las Bambas later in the presentation, but clearly the fact that both these projects are now approved and underway marks a significant milestone in developing our industry leading copper growth pipeline.</p>
          <p>The restructuring of Xstrata's Nickel assets in 2009 has reshaped the business as a more focused, lower cost producer with a robust operating platform and strong growth options. Real unit cost savings of $49 million were achieved and C1 costs reduced from around &#xA3;4 in the first half of last year to a run rate of around &#xA3;2.50 at the end of June, well within the bottom half of the industry cost curve.</p>
          <p>The Nickel work refinery achieved record production at its increased annual capacity of 92,000 tons of nickel, increasing volumes of refined nickel by 8%. All down stream facilities are now being integrated with our own mines and will supply the feedstock from our production from Western Australia and Canada.</p>
          <p>Nickel Rim South commenced four mine operations in April 2010. The new mine was delivered on time and below budget with a world-class safety record, and we'll continue to reduce overall operating costs as it ramps to full production of 18,000 tons of nickel in concentrate per annum.</p>
          <p>And in New Caledonia, the Koniambo project is now around 60% complete and making excellent progress. Ian will provide a more detailed update on the progress of this major Greenfield project shortly.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Zinc turned in another highly impressive performance in the first half, achieving record mine zinc production, including an all-time production high from Mount Isa operations, further productivity improvements and increased volumes at the zinc smelters, which offset the closure of the Kidd met plant in May.</p>
          <p>Another strong cost performance, so real unit cost savings of $66 million and C1 cash costs on a fully integrated basis were reduced by 18% from $0.44 per pound in the first half of 2009 to $0.36 per pound in 2010, and this is despite the impact of strong operating currencies.</p>
          <p>The expansion of the Mount Isa and McArthur River operations in Australia are continuing, and a project to deepen the Black Star mine at Mount Isa was approved during the first half, with construction now well underway.</p>
          <p>Construction has also started at the Bracemac-McLeod project in Canada, which will start production in early 2013 and which will contribute 325,000 tons of zinc metal and 40,000 tons of copper over an expected four year life. This $150 million project will use the Matagami concentrator and the required additional infrastructure has already been installed.</p>
          <p>In terms of financial performance, revenues increased by 43% and improved sales prices contributed $2 billion to operating profit compared to the same period last year. Increased sales volumes across most of our businesses contributed a further $384 million to operating profit.</p>
          <p>The benefits of the substantial restructurings and cost saving initiatives implemented in response to the global economic downturn, together with the ramp up of new lower cost production from successfully completed growth projects continued into the first half of 2010. And a total of $243 million of real cost savings was achieved during the period.</p>
          <p>A stronger second half production performance as all grades recover at Xstrata Copper will reverse some of the significant cost pressures experienced in that business unit in the first half.</p>
          <p>Mining sector inflation reversed as the lagging impact of lower input costs in 2009 flowed through in the first half of 2010. This was particularly evident in the coal business. However, increasing investment by the industry in response to global economic recovery and continued demand for commodities is expected to again result in increasing cost pressures going forward.</p>
          <p>The U.S. dollar weakened substantially against the majority of the Xstrata's operating currencies with the Australian dollar 25, South African rand 18 and the Canadian dollar 15% stronger against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 2010. In total, adverse foreign exchange movement reduced earnings by $767 million compared to the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Xstrata's operations generated $4.8 billion of cash in the first half of 2010, almost $1.1 billion higher than generated in the second half of 2009. Net interest paid is almost half to reflecting lower debt levels and interest rates. Tax paid increased substantially and was higher than the 2009 full year due to increased earnings over the past period.</p>
          <p>With a strong organic growth pipeline of high return projects, we continue to ramp up capital investment with nearly $1.5 billion of expansionary capital spent in the first half of 2010. Sustaining capital expenditure was $650 million in the period.</p>
          <p>Cash flow after capital expenditure was $1.6 billion and during the period Glencore exercised its option to repurchase Prodeco resulting in a cash inflow during the first half of $2.25 billion.</p>
          <p>As a result net debt decreased by almost one-third to $8.4 billion. Gearing decreased from 26% at the end of the 2009 to 19% at the end of June. And as we stand today, I can say for the first time in my career at Xstrata that we have no drawn bank debt.</p>
          <p>Despite the entry period of significant expansionary capital that will transform our production capacity over the next three to four year, we strengthened our balance sheet and our confidence in the outlook for our operations and market has enabled us to increase our dividend; and consequently, an interim dividend of $0.05 per share has been proposed which will be paid on 8th of October to shareholders on the register at 17th September. The interim dividend represents a 25% increase over the implied full year level for 2009.</p>
          <p>The high returns offered by our project pipeline will add significant value to our shareholders. And I believe that the actions taken over the past 18 months together with our strong operational cash flows have provided Xstrata with an appropriately robust capital structure to fund our ambitious growth plan.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure during the first half has privatized to focus on the delivery of near-term growth and to develop the longer term growth projects throughout the Group, especially in our Nickel, Copper and Coal businesses.</p>
          <p>Expansion in capital is expected to increase in the second half to approximately $3 billion, which will take fully expenditure to $4.6 billion. I also expect to sustaining capital to increase in the second half, and I am currently budgeting expenditure of circa $1.8 billion for the year reflecting an element of catch up after last years cash conservation measures.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand you back to Mick.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Trevor. Now, I'm sure you will all have seen the two exciting announcements we have made today on the approval of the Las Bambas copper projects in Southern Peru and the Ulan West underground mine in Australia. These projects joined 13 other major expansions currently in construction and continue the strong momentum we're building in delivering the volume growth and the next stage of Xstrata's transformation from the growth projects within our portfolio.</p>
          <p>So I'd like to take a few minutes here just to review the strategy we have set out to grow our business and in its current phase primarily, but not exclusively, through organic growth. And I'll also review the profound impact this will have on Xstrata. Then I'm going to hand over to Charlie who will provide some insight into emergence of this world-class copper district in southern Peru and to Ian who will give you an update on the progress with the Koniambo Nickel project, which is now well over half way mark in terms of construction.</p>
          <p>So, Xstrata's strategy has consistently focused on achieving value for shareholders by growing our business and by progressively improving the quality of our existing assets. While the major acquisitions of previous years have grabbed the headlines and investors' attention in achieving steep changes in scale and diversity of our business, we have in fact consistently pursued both organic and acquisition growth throughout Xstrata's development. That strategy of growth coupled with an ongoing focus on improving our quality remains intact today and will continue.</p>
          <p>The delivery of organic growth projects is not new for Xstrata. We have successfully delivered 14 new operations since 2002, and our commodity business teams have established a solid track record of on-time and on-budget delivery. But there can be no doubt that we've now entered into the most intensive phase of organic growth in our history.</p>
          <p>As we stand today, 15 major projects are approved and in construction. Our near-term organic growth pipeline is industry leading, both in terms of the scale of our expected growth CapEx of $14 billion from this year to 2012 as a percentage of enterprise value and in terms of the transformation that these projects will bring about.</p>
          <p>And I should also note that a further second wave of projects is being currently &#x2013; concurrently progressed to replenish our range of growth options, once projects in construction have been successfully delivered.</p>
          <p>So this very rich portfolio has been amassed in the main from the acquisitions we have completed, which delivered substantial growth optionality into our portfolio, in addition to the scale and diversity they brought. However, as in the case of the Las Bambas and currently at a much early stage of development, the Zanaga iron ore project, our teams have also identified and invested in promising early stage prospects to help build this world-class growth portfolio. In each  case, our commodity business management teams have nurtured our projects through the various conceptual and feasibility stages, leveraging the strong project development skills of the people in our existing business and those that we have acquired, and engaged in engineering and technical partnerships with internationally recognized specialist to de-risk project development to the greatest extent possible.</p>
          <p>Now, as Trevor has outlined, our balance sheet is in really good shape to fund our capital requirements, with this gain of 19% at the end of the June, and the net debt of only $8.4 billion, after some very significant and robust operating cash flows this half year.</p>
          <p>So to reiterate, our strategy has not changed. We will continue to pursue both organic and acquisition-led growth, and we'll continue to actively review opportunities when they offer clear and potential value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And indeed on Friday we announced that we have entered into an exclusivity agreement in respect of minor proposed transaction to acquire the outstanding units of Noranda Income Fund to give us full ownership of CEZinc refinery in Quebec. And the transaction reflects the uncertain future for the trust fund given some pending loss of tax-free status; but it more importantly, it enables Xstrata &#x2013; will enable Xstrata to achieve synergies within its existing zinc assets, improved productivity and provide a basis for future expansion.</p>
          <p>However, as we stand today, the next transformation of Xstrata will be delivered from the projects which are currently in construction and those which are soon to be approved. The compelling nature of the opportunity is clear. Our projects will deliver an average ratio of return in excess of 20%, and an overall volume growth of 50% weight towards copper, thermal coal and nickel.</p>
          <p>Our operating cost profile will reduce by around 20% as new lower cost reductions brought on stream. And the development of these projects lies largely in our hands with significantly lower execution risk and without the possibility of an interloper or the market bidding away value.</p>
          <p>The impact on this business growth, of this growth in Xstrata in terms of volume growth, returns to shareholders, operating costs reductions and increased exposure to attractive commodities is without doubt as transformational as a major acquisition. And there are not many transformational transactions that could be executed with the same degree of certainty in the value that will be created for shareholders over the next four years.</p>
          <p>The pace of our delivery on growth is gathering momentum with significant progress achieved in the six months since I last presented to you in February. At that time, I set out my expectation that three growth projects will be completed and 10 further projects, with a combined capital expenditure around $10 billion, would be approved during 2010. So I'm pleased to announce that we're on track to meet both of these targets having already successfully completed the three projects as anticipated; namely, Nickel Rim South, which is a mine in Canada and that is already exerting a significant influence on our Nickel cash costs as it ramps up the full production, and the two thermal coal operations, the Blackfield South underground longwall operation, which is a highly efficient longwall to replace both China and New South Wales, and Goedgevonden open-pit mine in South Africa.</p>
          <p>We have already approved over $8 billion of new projects, new growth projects this year. And if we look at the inventory of projects that we'll achieve our expected 50% increase in overall volumes in next four years, the vast majority already approved and in implementation. In fact, the completion of already approved projects &#x2013; the completion of already approved projects will deliver a 40% increase in volumes by 2014 with the balance due for approval in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Copper has gained its approvals for its key projects in Southern Peru; Antapaccay, which is the expansion to the Tintaya operation, and the associated major greenfield Las Bambas project announced today. The 1.3 billion extension of the world-class Antamina operation in Peru, as you know, was also approved in January.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Zinc's Black Star Deeps expansion at Mount Isa and the Bracemac-McLeod expansion project in Canada have recently commenced construction, and Xstrata Coal today announced the approval of Ulan West which will add another 7 million tons of annual thermal coal production from a highly efficient underground longwall operation to Xstrata.</p>
          <p>Coal's industry leading asset portfolio is enhanced by this project for a cost of $1.1 billion. This momentum is set to continue in the second half <mark type="inaudible" /> with North open-cut thermal coal mine Australia will add a further 14.5 million ram 29:00) of mine tons to annual production.  And at Cerrejon in Columbia, a project to expand annual capacity to 40 million tons will be presented for approval before year-end. In line with the significant progress made since the start of the year, the approvals of Las Bambas and the Antapaccay projects are perhaps the most exciting.</p>
          <p>And so I think it's a good time to hand over to Charlie to take us through the progress on this, on the strategy to develop a major new copper producing region in Southern Peru in more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Mick. As Mick has indicated and the approval of the Las Bambas project does mark a major milestone in Xstrata Copper's delivery of their organic growth strategy. Over the past five years, through a combination of acquisitions and intensive exploration programs at our mining operations and Greenfield projects, Xstrata Copper has grown its resource base more than five-fold, including the recently announced 40% increase in mineral resources at our world-class Collahuasi mine in Chile.</p>
          <p>This has provided the foundation for a series of approvals to five brownfield expansion projects over the past nine months that are now all under construction: Lomas Bayas and Collahuasi mines in Northern Chile; Ernest Henry underground mine in Queensland, Australia; and Antamina and the Tintaya, Antapaccay mines in Peru.</p>
          <p>This latest approval to develop the exciting Las Bambas's greenfield project builds on this solid growth platform to continue the transformation of Xstrata Copper into a low cost, 1.5 million ton a year copper producer.</p>
          <p>Before I provide you with further details on Las Bambas, I would like to quickly touch on the copper market. As you are aware, copper enjoyed a strong recovery from the low prices seen in early 2009 on the back of very robust Chinese demand. The intensity of copper usage is steadily rising as populist countries such as China, India and other Asian Nations undergo urbanization. And these economies remain the key driver for demand growth into the medium term.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the industry is striving to meet increasing demand in the face of declining grades and the challenges of operating aging mines.</p>
          <p>We anticipate by next year demand will again drive a very tight market and highlight the challenge that the industry faces over the coming decade to ensure sufficient supply to feed the industrialization and urbanization of the major developing economies. These challenges, well illustrated in this slide, where mine project development constraints such as escalating capital and operating costs, infrastructure shortages, CapEx suspension and restricted access to the capital due to the financial crisis has significantly delayed mine project development.</p>
          <p>Between early 2008 and the middle of this year, these delays are estimated to have deferred more than 14 million tons of copper from potential new sources of suppy over the next six years.</p>
          <p>This supply outlook, coupled with robust expectations for demand, illustrate the significant opportunity that we are pursing as we progressively expand annual mine copper production by more than 50% over the next four years.</p>
          <p>The development of Las Bambas will leverage important synergies with the Antapaccay project and transform our assets in Southern Peru into a Tier 1 one copper division for the Xstrata Group.</p>
          <p>We are currently investing $1.47 billion to develop Antapaccay to convert our Tintaya operation into a long-life asset and to increase production by 60% to 160,000 tons per year in two years from now.</p>
          <p>Combined, these two major projects in the same mineral district in Southern Peru will produce well over 500,000 tons of copper in concentrate per annum by the end of 2014, compared to the current output of approximately 100,000 tons per annum from Tintaya.</p>
          <p>It's also worth noting the expansion to our major Peruvian asset, the Antamina copper zinc mine in the Ancash region in which we hold a 33.75% interest which will increase our share of production by around 40% from 100,000 tons per annum to approximately 140,000 tons per year.</p>
          <p>Corporate approvals to invest $4.2 billion to develop the Las Bambas project into a major low cost mining operation followed a completion of a positive feasibility study, the formal submission of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment and the very successful outcome of the Public Audience process.</p>
          <p>Xstrata will now formally exercise the option to transfer the Las Bambas mining titles from the government agency Proinversion.</p>
          <p>More than a 5,500 local people attended the Public Audience on the 15th of July, in Chiclayo and the project received overwhelming public support as a result of that meeting, which effectively provides us with a social license to develop the Las Bambas project.</p>
          <p>Formal government approvals for the environmental and social impact assessment are expected in the first quarter of 2011, based very much on our recent experience with Antapaccay. From the earlier stage before exploration even began at the site, we have given a high priority to building strong relationships with communities and other stakeholders at Las Bambas and to making sure that our project would provide substantial benefits to the communities and the region as a whole. And it's very pleasing that the dialog that we have established over the past six years has been recognized so strongly with the public support the project now enjoys.</p>
          <p>The Las Bambas project contemplates the progressive development of three open-pit mines, at Fuerabamba, Cochabamba and Sofabamba and the construction of a 51 million ton per year sulfide concentrator that is designed to produce 400,000 tons of copper in concentrate in the early years of its long life, with important gold, silver, and molybdenum by-product credits and highly competitive cash costs.</p>
          <p>The copper concentrate from this plant will be transported by a 215 kilometer pipeline to a filter plant headed close to Tintaya-Antapaccay and from there transported by railroad to the expanded Matarani port facilities for shipment to customers worldwide.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Copper's innovative standard concentrator design will be applied at Las Bambas, which will be the second of the standard concentrator plants to be approved following Antapaccay. This follows three years of collaboration with engineering, construction and project management company Bechtel to design and replicate standard layouts and major equipments for concentrators at a number of our major projects.</p>
          <p>The standardization of major equipment such as SAG mills, ball mills, crushing, grinding and floatation components has resulted in reduced engineering costs and CapEx, whilst also mitigating risks related to the scheduling and delivery delays of major equipment.</p>
          <p>The standard concentrator design also provides important operational and maintenance synergies as identical equipment will be used in both plants, that's requiring the same spare parts, common operational maintenance and training processes and a reduced overall organizational structure.</p>
          <p>The new project will be commissioned in the second half of 2014, and will enjoy very competitive cash cost of less than $0.60 per pound due to economies of scale, important gold, silver and moly by-product credits and synergies with the Tintaya-Antapaccay operation.</p>
          <p>Since we acquired Las Bambas in August 2004 for a total consideration of $121 million, Xstrata has completed 329,000 meters of drilling, transforming Las Bambas from an early stage exploration prospect into a world-class mining project; one of the two largest greenfield copper projects to be commissioned globally over the next decade.</p>
          <p>The current mineral resource is 1.13 billion tons at a copper grade of 0.77% using a cut-off grade of 0.3%, of which almost 80% is in the measured and indicated categories. There is substantial scope to add to the current mineral resource base in the highly prospective Las Bambas mineral district, and we are currently planning the next phase of drilling programs.</p>
          <p>The project will share significant transport infrastructure with Tintaya-Antapaccay in the form of the existing Tintaya road network, the established Arequipa logistic center and the expansion of existing port facilities.</p>
          <p>Shared management support functions will further reduce overheads and the trained and experienced workforce will move sequentially from the construction of Antapaccay to Las Bambas, ensuring that the project is probably resourced and minimizing delays or cost associated with the availability of skills.</p>
          <p>The development of Las Bambas will be led by a proven and experienced internal team in a strategic alliance with Bechtel which has developed most of the world's major copper concentrators over the last decade and is currently developing our Antapaccay project. And major equipment orders are already been manufactured.</p>
          <p>The plant facilities will be constructed from 2012 and pre-stripping start in 2013 prior to commissioning ramp-up and full scale production which will occur during 2014.</p>
          <p>So following on from recent announcements of a range of brownfield project commitments, the approval to develop the Las Bambas project really does represent a major step in the continued development of Xstrata Copper as a leading global copper producer.</p>
          <p>Our advanced development portfolio of five brownfield projects and one greenfield project, all now approved, will deliver 50% growth to our annual copper production over the next four years.</p>
          <p>The transformation of our more mature operations into modern, long-life operations and the delivery of new world-class mines will have a dramatic impact on costs, achieving a reduction of more than 20%.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to make progress on the next generation of projects under evaluation; Tampakan in the Philippines, Frieda River in Papua, New Guinea and El Pach&#xF3;n in Argentina to provide optionality for a subsequent phase of organic growth, which has a potential to deliver a further 50% increase in volumes.</p>
          <p>Our growth plans reflect our confidence in the buoyant outlook for the copper market and we expect to be delivering significant volume growth into a supply constrained copper market that is expected to become tighter as demand continues to grow.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and I'll now hand over to Ian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to provide a brief update on the successful completion of the new Nickel Rim South mine and significant progress we have made at the major Koniambo project in New Caledonia. Sometime ago we set out a strategy to transform Xstrata Nickel into a low cost producer.</p>
          <p>Our goal was to operate within the bottom half of the industry cost curve with strong organic growth potential. We started that process in 2008 by streamlining our top level management by 30%. The corporate and operational restructuring followed, and last year we closed some high costs operations that were reaching at end of their life at Sudbury, and we used feed from our sterling operations to fill our downstream capacity.</p>
          <p>We also suspended Falcondo, traditionally a strong producer, while we undertook feasibility studies to reconfigure the energy source and create a low cost sustainable operation. The next piece of the puzzle was successfully delivered during the first half of this year with a commission of Nickel Rim South operation in Sudbury. Nickel Rim South is an efficient poly-metallic mine which came in on time with an accelerated build of nine years from discovery to completion.</p>
          <p>Most importantly of all, it was delivered on budget at $800 million and with an exemplary safety record. Nickel Rim South will ramp up to full production in 2011 with an annual capacity of 18,000 tons of nickel.</p>
          <p>The Koniambo Nickel project will accelerate the next step of our transformation by doubling our mined nickel, securing the business position low on the cost curve and providing a long-life, high grade operation with a resource base that provides substantial future growth potential.</p>
          <p>This cornerstone project will deliver production of 60,000 tons of nickel containing ferronickel with a first quartile cost position. First ore is expected to be processed in mid-2012 followed a ramp up to full capacity within two years.</p>
          <p>The Koniambo massive is a large coal high grade ore body with a mine life of more than 50 years based on exciting reserves and resources. It is widely considered to be the best underdeveloped lateral deposit in the world. Importantly, the technology used at Koniambo is low risk. The project will use conventional pyrometallurgical smelting technology, meaning that it does not require high pressure acid leaching.</p>
          <p>The project team is highly experienced, and we have strong relationships with our local partners. Koniambo remains on schedule and within the original budget of $3.85 billion that was approved by Xstrata board in October 2007. Around 80% of the budget has been committed with $2.2 billion incurred to date.</p>
          <p>A number of significant milestones were reached in the first half of 2010. We completed dredging in the lagoon for the 4.5 kilometer access channel and the 150-meter wharf is now complete. Both of these milestones were reached while maintaining an exemplary environmental record and without incident.</p>
          <p>Our teams have also recently completed the foundations on-site for the furnaces in the metallurgical plant. The site has now fully prepared for the arrival of the fabricated module components from China. We're using an innovative modular design for Koniambo that enables substantial components of the infrastructure required on-site to be pre-fabricated at dedicated engineering facilities and then shipped to be assembled on-site. This approach has significant capital cost benefits but also minimizes the technical, safety and environmental risks involved in constructing large-scale infrastructure from scratch at a remote location.</p>
          <p>The first modules will begin loading out from China this week as the ship has just arrived. The next key milestones for the project are the successful delivery of all the modules from China by November, followed by the completion of the on-site assembly of the metallurgical plant modules by year end.</p>
          <p>Earthworks to construct the conveyor route and the ore preparation plant are expected to be complete by the end of this year. The overall project is now almost 60% complete. For activity trends for current contractors are in line with our plan. Off-site engineering is now complete, and the engineering center in Malaysia will be demobilized by the end of this year. Our focus is now squarely on-site based construction.</p>
          <p>I'd like to show some photos of on-site construction and the modules that have been started to be shipped to New Caledonia.</p>
          <p>This other view shows the Koniambo base camp and industrial site. Currently the base camp has accommodation for more than 3,000 workers. Camp capacity will increase to more than 5,000 by the end of the year, in preparation for peak on-site construction activity from January to July 2011.</p>
          <p>During this time, more than 2,000 workers from China, Korea and other Southeast Asian countries will be on-site to construct the metallurgical plant and the power station.</p>
          <p>This shows a closer view of the industrial site with the foundations for the power station in the foreground and the metallurgical plant to the right. To maximize our chances of succeeding, we took the unusual step of completing 80% of detailed engineering before the first concrete was poured.</p>
          <p>This infrastructure is designed to facilitate future high return plant field expansions at Koniambo. This picture shows a close-up of a metallurgical plant foundation. Including the completion of the module fabrication in China, construction of the met plant is currently just under 40% complete and awaiting arrival of the fabricated modules from China. It is expected that the first of the two lines at the metallurgical plant will be mechanically complete in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>The power station is shown here. The first five segments of a boiler stack are installed in a concrete shell with the remaining segments ready for lifting.</p>
          <p>First steam generated power is scheduled for the first half of 2012. Final completion of the ports shown here occurred in July. In the first month of full operation, the port reached expected peak capacity. The first vessel arrived in early June carrying 6.5 meter diameter steel barrels for the construction of the boiler stack at the power plant as well as high capacity cranes.</p>
          <p>The vessel in this photo is delivering the fuel storage tanks. The vessel delivering the modules will be more than 200 meters in length.</p>
          <p>Pictured here are two of the 17 metallurgical plant modules fabricated and Jindal, China prepared for delivery to the Koniambo site. What is critical here is that modules underwent preassembly in China so the systems could be powered up and tested before shipping. This gives us greater certainty. It is important to note the Chinese model yard has completed its work with exceptional safety performance, including reaching more than 4 million hours worked without a lost time injury.</p>
          <p>We were very pleased with the way our partners in the module construction COOEC adopted and adhered to Xstrata's sustainable development policies.</p>
          <p>Returning back to Koniambo site, this picture shows earthworks for the mining area on the massive. The mass earthworks for the entire sites are currently 65% complete.</p>
          <p>This phase has been largely carried out by local contractors. Peripheral activities for the oil preparation plant and the corridor for the other end conveyor will be completed by the end of this year. An 11.5 kilometer conveyor will transport oil from the massive to the industrial site. Pre-assembly of the conveyor began in April and will be completed in the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>On the environmental front: a surface water management contract is in place as well as sediment control structures and re-vegetation programs for erosion control.</p>
          <p>The Koniambo team has done a remarkable job on engaging with local communities and interested stakeholders in the project. More than 1,000 people have visited the site, and there is a strong local support for the project. The team has also engaged local communities at every step, for example, public consultation meetings were held on all marine activity including the construction wharf pledging, main wharf, and the ocean outfall pipeline. It is important to note that this pipeline will carry sea water with less than 2% treated industrial discharges and filtered domestic waste water.</p>
          <p>These sessions explained the construction process, resulting impacts and mitigation measures in an accessible way. The public have welcomed the regular updates on the project and have provided positive feedback.</p>
          <p>We have a high level of economic involvement with local enterprises. More than 45 local companies have been established since the beginning of the construction with the assistance of an entity set up by the Koniambo project. Significant training programs are also in place in partnership with the North Province to ensure the availability of local skilled labor.</p>
          <p>I want to wrap up with this thought. We are very pleased with the progress we have made on the Koniambo project. We have a world-class environmental track record, strong support for key stakeholders &#x2013; from key stakeholders and we're on track to deliver a Tier 1 asset into Xstrata's operation platform &#x2013; operating portfolio in 2012.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I'll now hand back to Mick.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, Charlie and Ian. When I stood here earlier this year in February, our industry was benefiting almost highly from the effects of the massive Chinese stimulus package, which was largely oriented towards fixed investments. And since then we have seen steady signs of recovery in the United States, with industrial production turning to growth and employment becoming progressively, albeit tentatively positive and the restocking of our products.</p>
          <p>And despite the occasional disappointing statistic emanating from the United States, growth does appear to be moving to a sustainable level post the restocking phase, supporting exports from China and other Asian economies.</p>
          <p>And unfortunately during the same period, the specter of sovereign risk appeared especially amongst the southern European counties, high deficits across Euroland have driven governments to adapt austerity packages, which promised to increase levels of unemployment to potentially further and, therefore, dampening our domestic demand.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the governments will seek to strike a balance between austerity and growth by retaining some lose momentary policy and at certain levels of stimulus, further increasing levels of sovereign debt. An uncertainty in Europe is, therefore, likely to persist in the short-term.</p>
          <p>China, on the hand, grew at record levels of 17% in nominal terms in the first quarter of this year, and this is clearly unsustainable. And the high end real estate bubble and the grain inflation are just two symptoms of overheating growth levels.</p>
          <p>The Chinese government seeking to be proactive in taking steps to manage the economy to a sustainable growth range of 8 to 10% in real terms. At the same time, the Chinese government is seeking to bring about a fundamental shift in the provision of affordable housing for more than 12 million people moving to urban centers each year.</p>
          <p>Now, inflation appears to have peaked in China and exports have grown robustly of something like 41% year-on-year in the second quarter. Infrastructure investment plans are still ambitious with the 12, five-year plan earmarking over $1 trillion for urban infrastructure with additional expenditure allocated to railway construction and rural infrastructure.</p>
          <p>So while the Chinese economy is clearly slowing, and it almost had to slow from the heavy growth rates of earlier this year, I remain confident that it's headed for a soft landing and the GDP growth rate echo higher than the 9% reached last year.</p>
          <p>Over the medium-term, we see China undergoing a fundamental shift in the drivers of its economic growth as growing domestic demand mitigates slowing infrastructure investment. An aging population and growing dependency ratio will obviously encourage or cause lower savings, increasing the potential of a higher domestic expenditure as well an improving social net and fundamental land reforms.</p>
          <p>Fewer new entrants into the labor pool, the manufacturer of high value products and increasing organization will increase wages and hence disposable income. So demand for commodity is driven by domestic consumption such as durable goods will increase accordingly.</p>
          <p>Beyond China, we are now seeing definite signs of India's importance in the demand for our products as well, in particular thermal and metallurgical coal. Although somewhere behind China's level of investment, India's construction spend is forecasted growth almost 13% per annum over the next five years.</p>
          <p>Already India is the fifth largest steel producer and is expected to move into second place within five years at over 120 million tons per annum. Ambitious energy generation plants install over 20 gigawatts of capacity per annum are driving growing imports of thermal coal.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, we certainly envisage a three-speed global economy concept for the foreseeable future. The developing economies lead by China, India, Brazil will continue grow strongly and support stronger and robust demand for our products.</p>
          <p>We expect the United States to recover steadily, serving as an important source of demand for exports from developing countries indirectly for commodities. On other hand, with the exception of Germany, the EU is likely to struggle for sometime to reach historical growth rates.</p>
          <p>So from our perspective, Xstrata offers, therefore, attractive exposure to important commodities required to support the developed and industrializing &#x2013; developing, industrializing economies.</p>
          <p>In particular, we are encouraged by the outlook for thermal coal and copper, which is our two core commodities at the moment. In Copper, existing operations are struggling to maintain levels of production, a fact highlighted by recent industry mined copper production figures, while many of the new projects expected to replace those declining production are some way off, underpinning the thesis that Charlie took you through earlier. On the back of growing imports by China and India and infrastructure constraints, the outlook for thermal coal is also expected to remain positive.</p>
          <p>Our growth plan is to take advantage of these robust market conditions. Moving forward, a 50% increase in both copper and coal volumes over the next five years, with substantial reductions in operating costs. Our operating teams have delivered a robust operating performance, and we move into the second half of the year with positive momentum on volumes and costs. Approved and soon-to-be-approved growth projects form the basis of another unprecedented transformation of Xstrata. Our organic growth will deliver industry leading volume growth, substantial cost reduction and robust returns.</p>
          <p>And within Xstrata, we have the financial wherewithal and the project management expertise and experience to deliver and to continue delivering projects on time and on budget. While these projects have been developed, operating teams will continue to reduce costs, extend the lives of the resources and pursue operational excellence.</p>
          <p>Our suite of commodities is, therefore, well-geared to continue infrastructure investment in China, India and elsewhere, but also to growing domestic demand and the emerging shift to reduction of higher value products in our key markets.</p>
          <p>Now, much has made of fact that Xstrata comprises good financial engineers with an eye for good deal, and that may well be true. But as you've demonstrated every year since the IPO, we are not too bad at managing assets and have an unmatched ability of turning ugly ducklings into graceful swans.</p>
          <p>We also built a thing or two as well, and today we've created for our investors an irresistible portfolio of growth projects which will lead the third company transforming an event under the supervision of this management team, supported and guided by our board. While we deliver on this promise, we'll continue to be alive to corporate opportunities with a highly disciplined approach that prioritizes the creation of shareholder value.</p>
          <p>And in my times as Chief Executive of Xstrata, I have not felt more comfortable with the state of our business nor more convinced of our ability to deliver superior returns.</p>
          <p>So that brings us to the end of the presentation and, as usual, we will take questions. Please wait for the microphone to reach you and then fire away.</p>

          <p>Oh, hi. Robert Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Three questions please. First the &#x2013; there is a lot of discussion at the moment in the press about the Glencore and what they can possibly be doing in terms of mergers with Xstrata or otherwise. Are you involved in any discussions with them at the moment, can you talk about or give us some color on what's going on there? And the second question is probably more for Trevor, talking about the debt facilities, over the last 12 months you've talked about refinancing those and increasing your capabilities there. Can you talk a bit about what you have done given you're undrawn at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not received any proposals from Glencore. The focus of the team is this fascinating and I think very exciting growth that we have been talking about for a long time now, which is now really crystallized into the fact that, as we stand today, of the approved projects which are underway at the moment, they will deliver 40% growth in volumes. And the remaining three to be approved later this year will top up to make up the 50% by 2014. That is the company transformation of Xstrata that we &#x2013; that we are busy with. And I can't really add anything further on the speculation that I, too, read about in the press on Glencore's ambitions. I make the point that this is a board and a management team, which are always alive to the opportunities to create value for shareholders, and we will take any opportunity to create substantial value.</p>
          <p>On the issue of the second question, as you said, Trevor is much better equipped to answer it than I am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Much of that's true. We have around $2.1 billion of bond refinancings or bond repayments that we have to make next year. As we sit at the moment, we have headroom of about $8 billion undrawn on our two big bank facilities. We, in fact, reduced that headroom early on this year. We deemed it to be excessive.</p>
          <p>And 3 billion of that 8 billion of headroom expires towards the end of the next year. We could, of course, repay the bonds from our existing bank debt. But I think together with Ian we'll be working on our strategy as to how we continue to maintain that fire power. Obviously, the bond &#x2013; all the bond markets are relatively open to us and increasingly as you've seen from our &#x2013; what some of our peer groups have done in the bank market, that market is also offering some attractive capacity at the moment.</p>
          <p>But we're not in any pressure as we speak at the moment, but we will probably be doing some refinancing activities over the next six months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>There are two questions. One is, you just sort of alluded to you probably won't be looking to do any more, sort of, M&amp;A short-term, but are there any, sort of, assets you'd be looking to divest in the short-term, particularly if you can make some comments about the Lonmin stake? And then just secondly, you also suggested that you expect the industry to face increased costs going forward. I am just wondering whether you could perhaps give us more detail about that, where you expect those cost drivers to come through? Historically, it's been more oil price driven, and we've, sort of, seen the oil price trading more around $70 a barrel. So I'm just wondering where you see those cost pressures actually coming through in the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The issue of the ongoing review of our portfolio, yes, we continue to review what's in the portfolio. And every now and then I'm quite sure that we'll find things which are more valuable to other people than to us, but we can see nothing of any significance across our portfolios that would &#x2013; of any material issue of note at the moment.</p>
          <p>Your reference to Lonmin I have to say that our stake in Lonmin remains a valuable option for us. And once we've worked out how to capture the value inherent in that option, we'll tell you all about it.</p>
          <p>On the issue of where the cost pressures are going to come, I mean, as economies build into growth, I mean the capacity constraints that exist in the past I think will start to reemerge, perhaps not in the most profound way in which they then did, but it will translate into probably increased energy prices which impact us directly as you alluded too. It will translate into increased cost of labor on the contracting side in particular. It manifests itself perhaps in the old, sort of, highly annual of tires. But it's a build-up of cost pressures over a continuum of your operations which one has to build with and which one has to cope with. And our expectation is that these will slowly start emerging again.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then, just for Peter on coking coals, getting some feedback from some other participants in the market that China is actually pushing some of the coking coal volumes that it had contract for H2 back into the market. Is that something you can comment on?</p>

          <p>The market has been through bit of a soft patch, Jason. However, we have seen recent transactions resurrecting again. So there are, again, in recent days and weeks, coal is starting to move back into China, coking coals.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Hi, it's Chris LaFemina from Barclays. Just a couple of questions, one, a follow-up on the Lonmin question. Have you been approached by any other companies regarding that stake, any companies that might be interested in buying it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, thanks &#x2013; on the cost performance &#x2013; your cost performance looks very good in nickel and in zinc and in copper, but if I look at EBITDA margins in each of those businesses, they're between 30 and 35%; yet commodity prices in the first half averaged double or triple, your C1 cash cost, just trying to understand why there's such a large difference there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, maybe I can <mark type="inaudible" /> in coal and nickel and copper, each of the two executives just to talk about interest of their margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to start off with coal, we've had very fairly good pricing this year. But on the cost side, we've seen in real terms our cost come down as well as a reduction in cost of a lot of the inputs &#x2013; steel-based inputs into our business. So that's supported our margins. However, we lost some $400 million as a result of strengthening domestic currencies, weakening U.S. currency. That's always had a big impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the copper side of business, our volumes &#x2013; our sales volumes typically go from half-to-half. There's a cycle that we tend to go through. In the second half, we will see a pickup in sales volumes which will have a direct benefit on the EBITDA margins that  we see. And we also continue to have a proportion of our businesses that's directly related to smelting and refining businesses there. And so the margins, as you know, are particularly skinny in those businesses. At the moment there it tends to affect the EBITDA numbers there, particularly on the sales parameter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on Nickel, again, same thing, we've got, of course, big influences of our ramping up of Nickel Rim in Sudbury. So as we ramp up that operation, we'll see more dilution of our fixed cost going on in the business, and that can improve our cost position overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Tobias Woerner from MF Global. Two questions, if I may.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just &#x2013; I mean, it's always difficult reconciling these real cost savings of the C1 cost, because you have the big issues of currencies, you have the fluctuations in the price of the by-product credits which we take through the sales price line. And then, of course you have inflation which actually in this quarter was relatively modest but the big two were the movement in the by-product sales prices and currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, if I may. I like your chart, at the end of the life cycle chart with regards to commodities; and historically, you never, sort of, aimed for a certain percentage of commodity exposure. With that chart in mind, are you changing that view slightly, i.e.,  that you are aiming for certain exposures which are, let's say, more exposed to the Asian consumer or, let's say, the Indian thermal coal story?</p>
          <p>Secondly, platinum on that live chart &#x2013; lifestyle chart seems to be going up. Obviously, it's a consumer driven commodity. You are ramping up your production to 310, eventually 1,000 answers in Eland, could you give us maybe a little bit more color on your eventual strategy in  platinum from a standalone basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your first question, look, one has to recognize that you are what you are. And it's fortunate that we are a major copper and coal producer because we think that there is great value in relative basis in being long on copper and coal. And so having that position, the important thing is how do you exploit that position, and I think what we try to demonstrate to you, is that we exploit in the position in the best possible way we can to benefit what we think is going to be short energy and short copper supply situation with significant demand given the urbanization that is taking place in China and India.</p>
          <p>Now, that is not to say that we're not going to concentrate on increasing the value of the rest of the portfolio. And I think Ian was unusually eloquent in the way that he described the transformation of the Nickel business. And he is rightly proud of what they have achieved.</p>
          <p>And Santiago's divisions since 2004 have reduced costs by $500 million, which is just the most staggering and phenomenal amounts. Some of that is been, in fact, half of that comes through the increase and throughput at Mount Isa, but the balance of it comes through this ongoing focus on finding small elements where you can include the business almost everyday and you have build up and the ramp up to a very significant amount. So we try and use the natural advantage we've got in our metals exposures to the best advantage, and we think it will offer superior value to shareholders. At the same time, making sure that none of our other businesses lose sight of value creation opportunities.</p>
          <p>On the issue of platinum, we identify platinum as &#x2013; right from the very beginning, those of you who recall the emergence of Xstrata, we were asked at the time of the IPO what commodities would you like to be in, and we identified three at the time. We spoke about platinum. We spoke about iron ore. We spoke of manganese.</p>
          <p>Manganese was a bit frustrating. Iron ore is a long play, but we are now have a foot in &#x2013; yeah, sort of foot in the pond, as it were, or a toe in the water. And on platinum, we are busy building a business. And we have this very important, this very important position on Lonmins. So I think it's quite clear that we have every intention of building a substantial platinum business over time. And Peet and his team are exceptionally focused on doing that. So our intention is absolutely clear. What is not clear to you because we have not actually worked out a strategy is what role Lonmin plays in that. And when that does become clear, then at least that will be a  distraction which you won't have to worry about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Liam Fitzpatrick from Credit Suisse. Three questions on your coal division, please. Firstly, could you be a bit more specific on your total production guidance for 2011, 2012? Then secondly, in the South African division, performance was a little bit weak in H1 on both volumes and on price realization, so can you give a bit of guidance for the second half? And then lastly, on your medium-term growth plans in South Africa, how much of a constraint do you expect logistics to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance for '11, '12, I think it's best to extrapolate where we are today going forward. We have, other than the reduction that we've seen in New South Wales as a result of the closure of the United Mine, we are just simply adding capacity and growing our business. We'll see the full ramp up of the Blakefield operation, we'll see the commissioning of Mangoola going forward, and the continued, certainly in Queens, a return to full production at Rolleston and continued operation at Oaky and Newlands at the same levels they are today.</p>
          <p>South Africa, this year did take something of a slowdown. We're in a major transition from underground operations to new large open-pits. We've commissioned the GDV mine, as Trevor was speaking about. And that currently is running over the last month, it's run as 900,000 tons  feed, which is about &#x2013; it's over 90% of designed capacity. And as we said, we'll have it in full production certainly within 2011.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are transitioning into the ATCOM East area, which is resources that we acquired from the joint venture that used to be held together with BHP Billiton. That project is on schedule, and we expect that we'll be commissioning the plant towards the end of this year, early next year. And then that will be in full production.</p>
          <p>Certainly, with regard to logistics in South Africa, I think the question was, we are starting to see some improved levels of performance out of TFR, the rail business. Obviously, we all know that the full capacity is there, so we're starting to see on a regular basis plus 70 million ton per annum type rates, so that's fairly promising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think coming just back to the total tonnage issue, if we &#x2013; on both met coal and thermal coal, if you're looking for some sort of ballpark through this 2011, 2012, I mean, sort of see about 2012 being something of about 110 to 112 million tons and probably, what, about 90 odd million tons in 2011 in total tons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mick. Peter Davey from Ambrian. Just following on from that South African coal question. South African coal has been a poor performer in, I think, most people's portfolios. Are you expecting any sort of significant uplift from Goedgevonden? I don't think ATCOM can make much of a difference, but maybe GDV can? And on the back of the logistics, can you see TFL perhaps going for power privatization? I mean where does the government get the money from, if not try to get the main sort of Richards Bay Coal Terminal owners to chip in and take part ownership of that rail, is there any hope for that so you can speed up that bottleneck on the rail line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll ask Peter again to address that. Just on your last point, public-private partnerships don't have a great history in South Africa. And I remember one discussion I had many years ago with the rail authorities where we were happy for them to own it if we ran it. Well, that didn't appear to be very exciting. I'm not &#x2013; really, it's too difficult to speculate how the infrastructure side of South Africa is going unfold. And clearly, as we know, both in power and transport are eco straining factor. But I think it's just too difficult to speculate on that. Perhaps, the first part of your question as to where the uplifts going to come on in South Africa, Peter, do you want to pick that up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll just disagree a bit. TGVO will obviously give the uplift that you're talking about. But the ATCOM Complex will consist of a two dragline truck-shovel operation, brand new fleets with an expanded wash plants and new run-of-mine facilities. We're spending 3.1 billion rand on that. So we do expect a very significant uplift from that, and that will be closely followed, hopefully, by the Tweefontein project which is, will also be a very major open-pit operation. So this is a real transition from undergrounds operations and small contract operated pits to major large scale highly efficient open-pit mines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Olivia Ker from UBS. Firstly on Charlie, you talked about your expectation of a soft landing this year. We've got the slowdown and, sort of, high-end investment property market offset somewhat by the low-end, sort of, low-income housing projects. Do  &#x2013; are you concerned about some sort of lag impact to overall demand into the back end of this year, early next year? And then my second question probably following on a bit from Tobias, when you are thinking about your longer dated growth projects and gearing yourself into more life cycle commodities, is there a fit for uranium in your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, one remains concerned about any forecast of economics <mark type="audio gap" /> does well, because we live in a highly volatile environment where people don't have religion. They essentially are not believers, and 2008 was such a shock to the system and destroyed fundamental belief systems and things that you ordinarily rely on that all of us remain concerned about any forecast and any fundamental views that we have. But as we look at the dynamics of China, and clearly we visit it and try and understand it as often as we can, and we look what's taking place in United States. We've come to the conclusion that the world is not in as bad a shape as people think it is whenever we have some poor statistics. So and then the pessimist comes out, are we going to have double dip and the world is going to die. And our view isn't that. We have a sort of a much more &#x2013; we're not a black and white view of this. We have a much more gray view of where the world is, but sort of a lighter shade gray than the dark shade of gray.</p>
          <p>And on the issue of China, yes, I mean, certainly, the Chinese government can overcorrect on  policy procedures and they may react late in terms of downplaying these &#x2013; of reducing the, sort of, measures that they put in place to curb that formation. But in our view that the fundamental elements of fixed investment remain very robust, the pickup of the export market. The level of activity that we actually see across the, sort of hinterland to China, yes, speaks for a credible growth story.</p>
          <p>And so one is hopeful that we won't have a sort of a hard landing which then has to be corrected again, that we're going for the soft landing, that's our judgment. But we can be sure about these things, because at the end of the day in a economy which is a command economy directed from the center, judgments are made and judgments are put into place, and decisions can overcorrect one way or the other. But our view is that that won't happen, and all the evidence suggests that that won't happen. And we have, I guess, except to have volatility in the near-term, we have in overall terms a more positive outlook on the economic activity going forward than perhaps some of our competitors do.</p>
          <p>How do we position? We try and position Xstrata, but at the end of the day, we are opportunist. We have to take the opportunities which are available to us, and you can't manufacture opportunities. They've got to be there. And the key success in building any corporation is how you seize the opportunities become available, as opposed to thinking that you can create something out of nothing. It just doesn't happen. And so what we try to do is we try to actually be masters of the capture. And when we're seeing an opportunity which will make sense, to take that opportunity very resolutely and act on it in a way that we can. We did this both on M&amp;A activities and no doubt we'll continue on M&amp;A activities going forward, and we're now doing it in the projects.</p>
          <p>So I'm never &#x2013; I can't say to you and I would never actually predict to you that this huge strategy here which is sitting here saying how do we actually construct Xstrata to fit this thing and shift these elements around and do that. That's just not life. Life is about the opportunities which you have and how you manage them, and we've just made the best of the opportunities that we have. And it's fortunate those opportunities came in copper and coal as we sit at the moment. And we acted resolutely to capture those opportunities, and that's what we'll do.</p>
          <p>In our other businesses, we have done our best to make those very highly value-adding propositions. And Santiago, every time I see him, he says we run a very modest little business, but he's added enormous value in the way that he and his team have transformed zinc. And so that's the other elements of the job that you take what you've got and you make it better. And we've done that, and we continue to do that instead of worrying about the fact that what you've got ideally is not what you'd like to have. You have what you have and you make it better, and you add value for your shareholders in doing that. And that's essentially what we've done.</p>
          <p>So we've been asked a couple of questions today about the &#x2013; how many assets do you have for sale? Well, we rather concentrated rather not trying to sell assets. Yeah, we're rather trying to say, well, we take those assets and see how we can turn those assets from being fourth Tier to third Tier; third Tier, second Tier; second Tier to first Tier. And that modest crappy little zinc business that we inherited when we bought MIM, which they were about to close, is now a world-class operation. We didn't take the opportunity to sell it, we took the opportunity to build it. I think I sort of lost track of what your remaining question was.</p>

          <p>About the uranium price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. Okay. It shows you what happens when you go on a monologue. Well, there are couple of other things on this show that I would like to talk about today as well, I mean, but uranium. Uranium, clearly, in my view, is that given the importance that almost every government in the world attaches to the issue of climate change and the requirement for energy, there's no doubt that nuclear power is going to emerge as a growing element of energy provision here. It declined over many, many years. I think that will reverse. I think it takes a long time for that reverse. But as it reverses clearly that will impact the prospects of uranium.</p>
          <p>I think there's two issues which in my mind mitigate us making, wanted to make a play into uranium. First of all, there actually is a lot of uranium around the world sitting in a lot of different countries. And in one project in Olympic Gam, they could, sort of, produce enough uranium &#x2013; and that project is going to satisfy a whole host of new demand. And that will have an important influence on uranium price, but there are the uranium deposits sitting in Eastern Europe, as well.</p>
          <p>And so, I think that one has to have a handle over what is the potential for supply before one gets too excited about current pricing levels and where the real term price will sit. But the other things about uranium is it's a highly politicized commodity, and it's politicized almost in every county that you mine in.</p>
          <p>And we in the mining industry sit at the forefront of this interface with populations and with governments and with whose resources are they and whether we guess contract miners and what our rights are in relation to resources. I sort of don't really want to compound that by taking an additional element of politicalization, which is the nuclear element, into the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, we are not &#x2013; the long answer is we're not seeking out opportunities in uranium for those reasons. I mean if somebody, sort of &#x2013; if there's a company out there to buy which has uranium in it, I'm not going to exclude the acquisition because it's got uranium, but this is not something which we're looking for.</p>
          <p>I really should try and answer these questions much more succinctly, shouldn't I? Have I filibustered everybody out of questions?</p>
