          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome you to Norilsk Nickel conference call devoted to the release of our 2008 annual financial results, which we posted on the web site today. My name is Alexey Ivanov I'm Director for Investor Relations.

After this brief introduction we're going through the presentation page by page and provide you with additional comment and the management views. Finally, we conclude with Q&amp;A session. You're welcome to use web cast service for easy navigation through the presentation.</p>
          <p>Before we officially begin this call I would like to draw your attention to the disclaimer and the presentation on the slide number two. And remind you that it is important in relation to that we are going to talk about today.</p>
          <p>I will take a couple of minutes of your time to remind you about our positioning. Norilsk Nickel Group is the worlds leading nickel producer with over 20% of world nickel output and the largest producer of palladium accounting for half of the world mines output. Our assets located in Russia, Africa, Australia, Finland, and the United States. Due to the unique predominately sulfide mineralogy of our international efforts and high level of vertical integration as well as our high level of self efficiency in manage and transportation. Norilsk Nickel is positioned at the lowest cost nickel producer with mine life exceeding 25 years.</p>
          <p>Now let me hand over to Dmitry Kostoyev who will provide you with the overview of our financial statement. Dmitry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello everyone. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for taking part in the conference call. Today I'll provide you with an update on our financial performance and key developments in 2008. Our financial statements were audited by Deloitte &amp; Touche presented to you. And 2008 was the first year of full consolidation of OGK-3 and Norilsk Nickel International, which significantly affected the financial performance of the Group. Clearly, Norilsk Nickel's result have been impacted by the turmoil in the financial markets and substantial decrease in metal prices.</p>
          <p>In 2008, revenue from metal sales totaled US$11.8 billion, which presented a 26 decline comparing to the 2007 year. The main factor for this was the substantial decrease of sales prices for base metals slightly created a physical volume of metals sold contributed to the fall in revenues as well. Adjusted EBITDA declined by 43% to US$5.8 billion and was also impacted by consolidation of OGK-3 and NNI Norilsk Nickel International fall in metal prices and certain upward pressure on the cost side.</p>
          <p>High level of impairment of non-financial assets amounted to 4.7 billion, reflects the conservative reporting position of the management. Such be comparison change has led to paper loss reaching US$555 million. The Group's cash position remained solid with healthy two billion of cash in hand while the net debt is at the reasonable level of US$4.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. Decrease in base metal prices in 2008 was partially compensated by positive price trends in PGM and gold. These facts led relative construction of share of nickel and metal revenues to 51% and increase in share of PGMs.</p>
          <p>As you can notice our main geographical destination of sales remain Europe, however, the recession in Europe caused certain weakening in demand and decrease in the share of this market in metal sales from 63% to 51%, at the same time I would like to mention the growing importance of operation markets in particular Chinese where we believe there is a great potential for further growth.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. On revenue side nickel, the revenue from nickel sales decreased by 40% in 2008 to a number of US$6 billion mainly due to a significant decrease in the adjusted average selling price of nickel reduced by 42% from US$37.2 thousand in performed in 2007 to an average price of US$21.5 thousand an average price in 2008. During 2008, the physical volume of nickel sales reduced and the Russian Federation decreased by 2% over 5,000 tonnes to 229,000 tonnes, which was partially compensated by 7% or 4,000 tonnes increase of physical volatile nickel sales produced by Norilsk Nickel International.</p>
          <p>Copper ratings, the rating from copper sales decreased by 2% in 2008 to a number of 2,893 million mainly due to decrease on physical volumes of copper sales produced in the Russian Federation or by 5% or 22,000 tonnes to 382,000 tonnes and slight decrease of the adjusted average selling price of copper to $7,046 per tonnes in 2008. The decrease was partially compensated by the copper sales purchased by from third party and the amount of US$145 million.</p>
          <p>Palladium, palladium sales decreased by 3% from 1,325 million in 2007 to a number of 1,282 million in 2008. In physical terms sales of palladium produced by the group in Russia amounted to 2,856 ounce in 2008, which is 9% lower compared to the sales of 2007. The decrease of physical volumes was partially compensated an increase of adjusted average selling price by 2% up to 357 per ounce in 2008. Palladium sales by Stillwater Mining Company increased by 7% to 231 million in 2008. Physical volumes of palladium sales produced by Stillwater Mining Company amounted to 567,000 ounce in 2008 that's basically all about palladium.</p>
          <p>Now Platinum sales, platinum sales increased by 12% up to 1,420 million in 2008. The increase is explained mainly by the significant increase of the sales price nearly 24% up to $1,615 per ounce in 2008. Growth of selling price was offset by decrease in physical sales volume. Platinum sales by Stillwater Mining Company increased by 47% to 387 million in 2008, the increase in revenue is explained by a 43% growth in the adjusted average sales price mainly in the first half of the year an increase by 3% in physical volumes of sales to 246,000 ounce in 2008.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. Cost side, cost of metal sales increased by 17% from 4,719 million in 2007 up to 5,500 million in 2008. Russian operations account for 67% of all cost, inflation related growth of course, amounted to US$385million. The cash operating cost structure changed slightly mainly due to the acquisition of Norilsk Nickel International operations and OGK-3 in 2007, financial year and its full consolidation in 2008, which contributed additional 117 million of cost. Depreciation increased by almost 245 million up 30% mostly due to full NNI that is Nickel International consolidation and extensive capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. Labor, Labor remains the most important item of the cash operating cost. However its relative share declined from 31% in 2007 to 30% in 2008. Consumables and spares, consumables and spares cost in 2008 increased by 273 million or 27% up to U.S $1,272 million such increase was mainly due to the general increase in price cost by inflation, U.S $203 million full consolidation of Norilsk Nickel International representing U.S $44 million and the foreign exchange impacts of U.S $26 million. Purchase of nickel and concentrate, purchase of nickel and concentrate in 2008 significantly decreased by almost 150 million or 31% to only 332 million. Such decrease was mainly due to a significant decrease in nickel concentrate prices in 2008 and full consolidation of MPI Nickel results.</p>
          <p>In 2008 which was an associated of the Group in the first half of 2007 and major supplier of nickel concentrate. The decrease of purchase of nickel concentrate was partially offset by usage of external supplies in order to feed in refining facilities or fair well to nickel. In Finland due to placing or indefinite care and maintenance in second half of 2008 Australian mining operations of Norilsk Nickel International.</p>
          <p>Transportation, transportation cost increased by only six million or 2% to figure of 376 million in 2008 such increase was mainly due to consolidation of Norilsk Nickel International operations for the whole year and that basically all above the transportation utilities. In 2008 expenses on utilities increased by 29 million or 19% up to US$185 million, the main reason for this increase was significant increase of utility tariffs in Russia and the U.S. Share of expenses on the utilities remained stable in 2008 comparing to 2007 year and amounted to 3% of the cash operating cost in total.</p>
          <p>And finally, regarding the revenues from the sale of by products sales of by products in 2008 was US$1,124 million and did not change significantly comparing to the results of 2007.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. SG&amp;A expenses, in 2008 selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by almost 2% year-on-year or US$29 million in dollar terms and amounted to US$1.6 billion in total. The decrease is mostly explained by the significant reduction of custom duties which is due to the fall in export revenues of the Group. This factor contributed to 617 million to the overall reduction. However, the full consolidation of OGK-3 and Norilsk Nickel International in 2008 less to these increase of SG&amp;A expenses by almost US$79 million.</p>
          <p>Next slide please, EBITDA, EBITDA analysis. In 2008, our adjusted EBITDA diminished by 43% year-on-year to a number of US$5.8 billion comparing to US$10.2 billion in 2007. The main reason for this, were the fall in metal prices and certain increase in cost due to inflation. However, our unique mineral base and substantial lower production cost compared to the majority of our periods gave us an opportunity to maintain a robust operation of margin level in the environment of the deteriorated markets, market conditions.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. The impairment of non-financial assets amounted to US$4.7 billion in 2008 as compared to US$1.9 billion in 2007. Such increase was mainly due to impairment of goodwill recognized at Norilsk Nickel International in the amount of US$1.6 billion. Impairments of refining technology registered under the trademark Activox in the amount of US$490 million and the impairment of appropriate plan and equipment at Norilsk Nickel International and OGK-3 in the amount of US$2.5 billion and US$157 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. Just to briefly touch upon the capital and reserves. As at the 31,</p>
          <p>December 2008 capital and reserves amounted to almost US$12 billion as compared to almost US$22 billion at the end of the previous year. The key factors that effected capital and reserves were as follows. Loss for the year an amount of US$555 million including attributable to the shareholders of the parent company an amount of US$549 million; dividends declared by the company and OGK-3, during 2008 amounted to almost US$900 million and US$5 million accordingly; decrease in minority interest in the amount of almost US$1 billion due to the acquisition of minority interest in OGK-3, Arkhangelsk Sea Port, and RAO Norilsk Nickel shares; buy-back of issued shares in the amount of US$2.6 billion; decrease of the revaluation reserve for investments available-for-sale in the amount of $US1.5 billion; and finally net decrease of the effect of translation to the presentation currency and translation of foreign operations in the amount of US$3.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. At the end of 2008, investments in associates amounted to US$951 million. The increase of investments in associates by 72% or nearly 8% was mainly due to acquisition during &#x2013; acquisitions conducted during the year, mainly 25% stake in RUSIA or RUSIA Petroleum for a cash consideration of US$576 million; 35% stake in Plug Power, a company, for a cash consideration of US$33 million; and additional contribution into the share capital of TGK-14 and Nkomati Nickel Mine in the amount of US$51 million and US$14 million respectively.</p>
          <p>The increase was partially offset by the following reasons: First, impairment loss in the amount of US$283 million; reclassification of US$69 million of investments in Krasnoyarskenergo and Kolenergo to investments in available-for-sales in the course of restructuring process of RAO "UES"; and an amount of US$250 million of effect of translation to presentation currency.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. Investments in financial assets. At the end of 2008, the current and non-current other financial assets amounted to a figure of US$1.8 billion compared to US$7.5 billion in 2007. The decrease by US$5.6 billion is mainly due to the following factors: Decrease of short and long-term deposits by almost US$2 billion to a figure of 1.4 billion; settlement of promissory notes in the amount of US$1.4 billion; and remaining portion mainly consists of the change in the market value of available-for-sale securities in the amount of almost US$2 billion; also disposals of the Group's investments in OGK-5 and Polyus Gold in the amount of almost US$200 million.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. Debt and cash position of the Group. At the end of the year, cash and cash equivalents amounted to a figure of US$2 billion compared to a number of US$4 billion at the end of the previous year, in 2007. The change in balances of cash and cash equivalents is mainly due to: first, decrease of bank deposits by almost US$2.9 billion; and increase in current account denominated in foreign currencies amounting to US$867 million.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we had 525 million available from long-term deposits, which we have an option of early withdrawal within six to 30 days from the date of notice &#x2013; from date of notification.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2008, loans and borrowings of the Group decreased by US$1.6 billion to a number of US$6.4 billion, against almost US$8 billion at the end of the previous year in 2007. Total amount of loans and borrowings as at December 31 consists of long-term loans and borrowings in the amount of almost US$6 billion, representing almost 86% of the total financial debt, and short-term loans and borrowings in the amount of US$872 million or almost 14% of the total.</p>
          <p>Net debt of the Group was at US$4.4 billion, which we believe to be a comfortable level for the company. Mean ratios are -- at the end of the year were the following: We had net debt to EBITDA at a level of 0.77, and net debt to equity was at a level of 0.38, which we believe is more than healthy situation, taking into account the existing turbulence in the markets.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. We have repaid around 1.5 billion in 2008, and envisage to pay down another US$872 million during the current year, in 2009, of which we have repayment of 500 million of our Eurobond issue maturing in September 2009.</p>
          <p>2009 budget envisages no external financing for the current year. The main deal of debt  falls on 2010 &#x2013; on the period of 2010 to 2012 when Norilsk Nickel will have to pay &#x2013; will have to entire &#x2013; retire, sorry, almost 94% of all long-term loans on the balance.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. The main source of cash for the Group is net cash flow from operating activities. Due to the significant decrease of revenues from metal sales in 2008, net cash generated by operations decreased by US$3.8 billion and amounted to a number of US$3.5 billion, which is lower comparing to the figure of 2007 when we had almost US$7.3 billion.</p>
          <p>And this is basically all from me, and thank you for you attention. And I will give next step for Alexey Ivanov.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Dan Yakub. Please state your company name and proceed with your question.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot for the sets of results. I am Dan Yakub here from Citi Investment Research. Just quickly wanted to ask a question, in 2009 what would you expect to be weighted average cost of debt for the Group given that the total debt is around about $6.4 billion at the end of 2009, what will be the weighted average cost of debt this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a very little. This is Dmitry Kostoyev speaking.. We have a very healthy interest margin above LIBOR. And we believe that servicing our debt will be in the range of LIBOR plus 100 basis points, that means LIBOR plus 1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the margin above LIBOR is 1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It fluctuates from the debt-to-debt but it's always within this range of 1%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Alexey Ivanov. We have very detailed explanation of our debt structure in the financial statement. So then you can find all the debt structure and the ratios, and as well as the yields in the financial statement on the website.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And would you expect any of the obligations to become more expensive as the year progresses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned before, we do not see any need to tap the market during the year and to attract new additional debt on the balance. So, we believe our debt service and expenses would remain &#x2013; shall remain at the level, which I just mentioned. We do not see any reasons for increase in cost of debt for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, its Mikhail Stiskin from Troika Dialog. Thanks for the presentation. I have a few questions, which I will ask one by one, if I may. First, what do you expect to be the scale of the release of working capital into cash flow in '09 according to your preliminary estimates? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mikhail, could you please repeat the question, scale of working capital release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what's going to be the scale of the release of working capital into cash flow in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure that we'll be able to provide you with an exact figure, but we're trying to keep our working capital, especially accounts receivables and accounts payables relatively balanced. We see that all the receivables, which we have on the balance are paid in due time in due course. And we're trying to accelerate all the payments from our customers. My colleagues probably would help me with the number. And in a best scenario, I believe we'll extract something around 300 to US$400 million during the year, as an additional cash from the working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. One more question, essentially if I follow your note on the share capital, it is stated that ROSBANK as a trustee entered into a forward agreement to sell six million of treasury shares in September '09 at the acquisition price plus 10%. Could you please elaborate on this agreement, is it binding agreement or non-binding agreement for Norilsk? And also who will be the buyer of the treasury shares under this agreement? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this agreement is official and legal, and that's why we have this agreement accounted for in our financials. We cannot name our counterparty because of the confidentiality disclosure in the agreement. As we have mentioned in our financials, it's not related contract, not -- non-related party contract, and well that's basically all. The rest of the information you can find in our financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is a binding agreement for Norilsk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or you cannot comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; as I said, since we have this contract accounted for in our financial, that means that there were legal ground for such a position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And final question, you have to repay just under 900 million in '09, do you plan to seek refinancing? And if yes, how successful have you been essentially in arranging for refinancing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned before, we have a quite healthy position with cash on the balance, and we think that we are &#x2013; we have more than sufficient cash to service our debts through the year. We will consider going to the market for additional cash, just &#x2013; well, in case, we see improvements in terms of financing for such companies as we are. Right now, we do not need to take any additional cash from the market to service current debts, and including those payments, which we told you during the year, especially in September, repayment of Eurobonds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, guys.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes hello, it's Alexander from Dow Jones. I understand that you lowered a little bit your production outlook for nickel for 2009. Do you have any outlook for the prices for nickel, copper, palladium and platinum for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the current year, we have a very conservative budget. Actually our budget, which was approved by the Board meeting earlier this year, reduced sales prices, which are currently lower, which are lower than the current metal prices, which we can see in the market. For example, we built our budget with a nickel price for the year at level US$10,000 per ton, where now we have price more than 20% higher than the price originally introduced into the budget.</p>
          <p>And for the copper, our budget was based at a price level of US$3,300 per ton. Now we have more than 45% &#x2013; price more than 45% higher. And since we &#x2013; initially we wanted our budget to be at a conservative level in order to be in a safe haven for the rest of the year. We do not think that we need to recalculate our budget, but the prices I just mentioned.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, it's Rob Edwards from Renaissance Capital. Thanks for the presentation. Back in December management highlighted some measures to try and cut costs in 2009, notably on the head office and on other, cost of production by about 7 to 8% of last year's level. Can you give us some update as to the progress being made on the cost front? And what areas you've been able to tackle and if your kind of cost reduction guidance for this year would have changed from December's levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. As I mentioned before, the Russian operations account for the bulk of the total cost of the company, and here we try to keep all our costs fixed in rouble terms comparing to the previous year. That means that we're trying to keep ruble cost at a level &#x2013; at least at the same level as in the previous year, and also at some points we have a reduction even in &#x2013; reduction in costs even in ruble terms.</p>
          <p>Taking into account, recent ruble devaluation effect, which we had during the first quarter, we managed to cut our U.S. dollar costs at a level of more than 33% year-on-year, and we're still working on that. We are still trying to reduce our cost in every way possible without effects on the volumes of production and without effect on the labor &#x2013; total head count of the personnel of the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Dmitri Smolen. My question &#x2013; I have a question regarding your write-off. It looks like that the major parts of your 4.7 million write-off came from impairment of LionOre assets, while the loss from OGK-3 was only $100 million. Could you explain the effect given the drop in &#x2013; 80% drop in the share price of OGK-3? And my second question is regarding your plan for the Australian and South African assets. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you &#x2013; you're absolutely right. Most of the impairment provision was created for our international assets. We have provision of US$157 million for Russian assets and that is assets of OGK-3. All provisions which we accounted for were based on the models which we built for calculating these provisions. These models were audited by the big four auditors, such as Deloitte &amp; Touche and Pricewaterhouse and they felt comfortable with our calculations. And that's basically &#x2013; well the figures are self explanatory. So, we have a provision for OGK-3 in the volume of, as I just mentioned, 157 million.</p>
          <p>When talking about the current market price and the market price existed at the end of 2008, the reason for creating provision, impairment provision is a bit different from the reason when you adjust &#x2013; create reserve for revaluation loss. The impairment provision is created only when you have no &#x2013; when you do not have sufficient evidence that your assets will be generating cash to cover, sufficiently to cover original cost of acquisition. When &#x2013; with the OGK-3 we have got the different story. OGK-3 is an asset producing positive cash flow, sufficient to cover original assets value and that's why we had no &#x2013; not that much reasons for creating impairment provision on that asset.</p>
          <p>And as far as our international assets are concerned, here we are currently working on the strategy regarding all those assets and we will come back to you with more comments on our strategy as soon as we have this strategy finished, polished and approved by the Board members.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Marat Gabitov from UniCredit. I have two questions. First question is, as you already mentioned, metal prices are now well above those that you budgeted for this year. So in this case, are you going or can you probably revise your production plan for this year and maybe you have any benchmark price for nickel for you to reopen your Australian mines? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. As I said before, we are not planning to change our budgeted parameters for this year, just to be sufficiently conservative in the environment of turbulence existing in the markets. Regarding our international assets, we are still working on the strategy, as I just mentioned. And obviously, there are different scenarios in front of us, and basing on different price levels on the market, we can have different actions regarding our international assets, especially Australian assets. Basically, that's all I can comment on that.</p>
          <p>Your question was also related to the price level at which we would be willing to restart our Australian operations, and I would comment on this that it's not just a matter of price. I mean there are much more other factors to be considered as well. So, we're still working on the strategy and we'll comeback as soon as we have this strategy in place and finished and fully approved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And the second question is, as you have quite comfortable debt position structure, are you going to use this &#x2013; to use the cash that you have and maybe a certain availability of external finance just to look at some acquisitions, because companies are still well below 2008 levels, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, we are open for all the existing market opportunities, and we are looking at the market conditions as well and the position of our peers in the market. There is not any M&amp;A deal on the table, which management will discuss. But if we feel ourselves comfortable with the financial performance over the year and if we receive certain signals from the market and from the shareholders that we are actually in a position to make such decisions, we will probably come back and -- to this question and make certain moves.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you. I'm calling from Dow Jones, and I know you just received a couple questions about your plans for your international assets.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. I was wondering if you could comment on some recent reports about potential sales of your Australian operations. I know some comments came out this week about that and then you've also commented before that you're also in discussion Poseidon Nickel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I just mentioned before, we are working on this strategy for our international assets. And that until this strategy is finished and approved, we are not planning to do anything in as far of sales our asset &#x2013; international assets, and including Australian operations. So, we're receiving &#x2013; we receive a number of proposals, but they are not on the table for consideration right now, since we are still working on this strategy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, great. And then so &#x2013; and if I could just ask one final question. I noticed that your PGM output was down overall more than nickel. And I was just wondering what's the reason for that was, if you're focusing more on nickel output right now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Devon, it's Alexey Ivanov again. The main reason for the PGM metals decline is the decline in grades of ore within our Russian operations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. This is Alexei Morozov from UBS. Thanks for the conference call. I have three questions. My first question relates to your cash balance and I'm just interested how much of that cash balance stays o the balance sheet of OGK-3? Second, interested to whether you are undertaking any stockpiling of metals at your Russian operations at the moment or if all the metals produced are sold into the market? And third, maybe if you could just provide some rough indication of cash costs of nickel production before by products at your LionOre operations in Australia and Africa? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. First question is a breakdown of or a division of cash between the balance of OGK-3 and Norilsk Nickel. Just a second, I'll try to give you these numbers. On the balance of OGK-3, we had approximately US$500 million, and the rest was represented by the cash on balance of the my company. The reason for such a lower figure is that partially our cash is sitting on the &#x2013; cash of OGK-3 was sitting on the long-term deposits with banks. And auditors do not consider this cash as a cash and the cash equivalents, and consider them as a financial investment. So you will find the remaining cash in our short-term financial investments in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Regarding the cash costs in our Australian operations, as probably you know, currently our Australian operations are closed, and we do not have a clear indication of this cash cost, which we would have if these operations were in place. And the third question &#x2013; just remind me what was the third question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question was whether you are undertaking any stockpiling of metals at your core Russian operations at the moment or if all the metals which are produced are sold into the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, we have no stockpiling at all. And according to the results of first quarter, we even sold a bit more than we produced during the first quarter. So, we efficiently are selling all the metal we produce here in Russia.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, gentlemen. It's Yuri Garbuzov from JP Morgan, I have three very brief questions. One is could you give us a cost associated with keeping your Australian site closed? And second question is could you give us a guidance on CapEx associated with OGK obligatory investment? And the third one is about your nickel sales from Europe, and when you were reporting your first half results, I can see the figure of 503 million, but when you're reporting the full year result, I can see a figure of 411 million. Could you please reconcile that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Regarding Australia, we have only maintenance costs which we're paying to keep these assets afloat. And through the year, they amounted to approximately US$15 million. I might be slightly wrong, but in general, figure is around that number. And regarding the capital expenditures related to the obligatory investment program of OGK-3, for the current year we have budgeted a figure totaling to around 12 billion roubles for the current year in 2009, which is approximately US$345 million. And if we see our further developments &#x2013; a positive developments in our financials and further developments in the market, we'll probably try to increase capital expenditures, both for the metal producing part of the Group and for OGK-3, if we consider it necessary, taking into account the conditions of the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have any long-term guidance such as three to five years for OGK-3 investments?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Long-term guidance, as you probably know, there were recent developments in that industry. Some -- a number of new rulings emerged. And we are now trying to understand for ourselves how we should &#x2013; how this should affect our capital investment program and what should we do to put our investment program intact with the rest of the industry participants.

We have the decision of the Board meeting approving to &#x2013; approving sale of these assets, just because we have nothing to do with our core activity and these are not strategy assets on our balance sheet and we consider all these sales as one of the potential additional sources for additional liquidity for the Group. That's the first position. And regarding the strategy for OGK-3, right now we have this balance &#x2013; we have this company on the balance and destiny of this asset will be decided by the shareholders. Management does whatever it can to develop asset within the strategy &#x2013; a production strategy, which we have previously in place. Rob?</p>
