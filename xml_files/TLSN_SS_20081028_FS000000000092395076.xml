          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to TeliaSonera Interim Report January-September 2008 Presentation. My name is Martti Yrj&#xF6;-Koskinen, I'm Head of the Investor Relations. Today present from management, we have Mr. Lars Nyberg our President and CEO, and our new Executive Vice President and CFO, Per-Arne Blomquist.</p>
          <p>Lars, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning and welcome everybody. The third quarter I think was a good quarter. We reported growing sales and a strong EBITDA driven by Mobility Services and Eurasia.</p>
          <p>We successfully managed to protect margins in Mobility Service, despite intensive competition and regulatory intervention in the form of lower interconnect and roaming fees. The launch of Apple iPhone has been a great success and a boost to all our brands in the Nordic and the Baltic markets, and continues to be a top selling item for us.</p>
          <p>Sales within Broadband services was essentially flat in absolute terms, but there is a considerable change in the underlying product mix. Net sales in Sweden declined 5% driven by migration from traditional fixed voice.</p>
          <p>The decline was partly offset by international carrier and higher sales of IP-based services. In these areas, the margins are considerably low, although they are improving. So cost efficiency measures also had a positive effect on the margin in Broadband services.</p>
          <p>The number of broadband access and IPTV customers are increasing. It is very encouraging to see that in Sweden after the initial free of charge trial period, about two-thirds of the people signed up for IPTV. IPTV continues to act as a paying customer.</p>
          <p>The growth engine of the group, Eurasia, continues to show strong organic revenue growth. In the biggest markets, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, where we are the market leader, we posted large sales increases. Sales in Uzbekistan more than doubled, and we are up 70% in Tajikistan. That makes us the market leader in Tajikistan actually. This is a very encouraging development as we entered these two last markets only a year ago.</p>
          <p>One of my top priorities, as you know, is to improve the efficiency of our operations. I have said &#x2013; since I've started here long-term, TeliaSonera cannot have structurally higher cost than our competitors.</p>
          <p>Given that prices are under pressure and we still manage to maintain our EBITDA margin and the forecast for the full year of 2008, it makes clear that we have made some progress in these efficiency programs.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of this year we identified that these measures would result in redundancy of some 2,900 jobs; about 2,000 in Sweden, and 900 in Finland.</p>
          <p>The net effect of personnel-related cost savings is still relatively limited. But if we take into account the redundancies that we have identified and implemented for this year and for next year, we are halfway there. But that also means that we have the other half to do. So there is a lot of work to do still.</p>
          <p>We will also shift the focus from what we always have done in this company, say, gross savings. We will shift the focus to net savings. Net savings by business area and country, and we will also share some of those targets over time with you. For 2008, we estimate that the gross savings will in effect will be above the 1.5 billion compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Another very important priority is to grow our business in attractive, fast growing and profitable markets. Our aim is to create leading market positions by growing organically as well as through acquisitions. When we look for acquisitions, we look at markets with reasonably sized young and growing population, low mobile penetration and high economic growth. We'll look for a market with a cultural fit with our current operations where we can leverage our management expertise and also having a strong local partner is a vital ingredient in our choices.</p>
          <p>Following the successful investments in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, we have taken further important step by acquiring controlling interest in two mobile operators, as you know, Spice Nepal in Nepal and Applifone in Cambodia. Both companies will be consolidated this quarter.</p>
          <p>The strategy for our associated companies, Turkcell and MegaFon remains &#x2013; to try to acquire a majority position and to consolidate our ownership. However, as I said before, we are prepared to accept a minority position provided that the ownership become liquid and that we can have a certain degree of operational control of the company. I actually believe that the current credit crisis may in fact open some new opportunities.</p>
          <p>We have an ambitious plan for Yoigo, our start-up activity within Spain and I believe our management is doing a good job. Having said that I conclude that we will fall somewhat short this year of that plan and also that the breakeven will occur one year later than we had originally planned.</p>
          <p>Given that the investments acquired in this market is higher and the potential returns are lower than in high growth emerging markets, we will consider all options going forward. I'm not going to be pushed for the time or sell at any price.</p>
          <p>The last word is about the market situation, we are right in the middle of a period of severe financial turmoil, which is difficult to predict how long it will go on. We &#x2013; TeliaSonera is a strong financially balanced company with healthy cash flow and then we operate in a business that is fairly non-cyclical. Therefore, we see no immediate effects on changing customer behavior in our operations.</p>
          <p>Actually, regulatory intervention, intense competition and costumer migration remain the primary challenges for us. I'm convinced this is a good industry to be in and it will continue to be attractive. We have a unique position in the Nordic and the Baltic countries and we are very well positioned in several emerging markets with high growth potential.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in high quality networks, new services that will improve our productivity and flexibility of our customers and we continue looking for new investment opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now over to our new CFO, Per-Arne, he will take you through the details and then we will take your questions later.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Q3 is normally a very strong quarter for TeliaSonera, is usually the best quarter during the year, and that also was the case this year. Yes, it works. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we reached close to 26 billion in net sales and we also increased the EBITDA up to more than 8.9 billion and that means that we increased something between 3 to 4% in these items. Behind this, we have growth in mobility, we have growth in Eurasia, we have a slightly downturn in the broadband business.</p>
          <p>Further down, in the profit and loss, you could see that the operating income is slightly down on both &#x2013; when you look at the non-recurring items and also both excluding and including. Even though it's slightly down, I would say that this is a strong quarter because Q3 last year had some extra items in there. So I would regard that even though it's slightly down, it is a very, very strong result.</p>
          <p>You can also see that the CapEx is &#x2013; continued to be up to the same level as last year, slightly down from Q2. But we continue to invest in our business. Cash flow is also down, I will come back to that later on. It looks more dramatic than it is actually is.</p>
          <p>Going down &#x2013; further on and look at the first nine months, you can see the same trend here, growing the business, more than 75 billion of sales. EBITDA also close to 25 billion, and we're growing between 4 and 6% here. And it is the same pattern as I said before that mobility and also Eurasia is growing the business.</p>
          <p>If you then look at operating income, we are up 6% in both the areas. And you could also see here that financial items is now increasing with &#x2013; well, let's say, close to a billion and this is of course the effect that we have a higher net debt today and also slightly higher funding cost. CapEx, well above last year, further 5% up. Investments both in the Mobility, but also Eurasia also requires more CapEx.</p>
          <p>If you look at the trend, I think it's interesting to see here, if you put this into perspective, we're now today close at 26 billion as I said. We started in Q1 2007 with 23 billion and with this pace that we have right now &#x2013; we have actually exceeded 100 billion in net sales on an annual basis. And what I think is perhaps even more positive is that the EBITDA trend, especially when it comes to the margins has sort of changed. We had a number of quarters with decreased margin, but you could now see that we have changed that trend and for the time being we are now close to 32% in the EBITDA margin when we're looking at this on a 12 months rolling basis.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, of course, extremely important these days, if not always. The big difference, if you look at the difference that we also show before, with a 2.8 and 5.1. It's very much dividends from associated companies. Last year we had, first of all, an extra dividend of roughly 650 million, but we will also get dividends now in Q4. That's the reason I'm saying that the underlying cash flow is still rather strong. So I am not &#x2013; I'm always concerned about cash flow but I'm not concerned about the difference here that you see that might be a bit more dramatic than it is.</p>
          <p>That also means that we continue to have strong key ratios. Return on equity close to 70%, equity/asset ratio 50%, and the net debt to equity of 41%, which I think is a strong statement of the stability of our balance sheet was in the rather tough times.</p>
          <p>Now, I think it's fair to say that this is something, if you look at debt schedule, it's something that concerns a lot of people right now in the market. It is of course a concern for all of us operating with this kind of issues. But what I would say is that the maturity schedule for TeliaSonera is rather good. If you look at the bottom part here of the picture, you could see it's well-balanced over time. And we need to re-finance ourselves for the coming &#x2013; I would say 12 to 15 months, so roughly 11 billion. And so far so good. The refinancing needs that we had in October and November is already set. We have taken care of that, we don't need to refinance more before New Year, which I think is good, I think it would be profit times coming closer to New Year. We have done that.</p>
          <p>And we have new needs in the coming year. But given that we have different programs in the bond markets and also that we have committed bank clients of roughly 12, 13 billion, which is today unutilized. I think that we are standing in very tough market. It's a very tough market time, but we are standing pretty good in sort of the stormy weathers.</p>
          <p>So I feel that we have a good opportunity to continue to invest and also to continue to work with the development of our Company.</p>
          <p>Finally, coming into the outlook, it is unchanged, which means that Q4 will be a strong quarter. Extremely important to say that this will not be a walk in the park. You all know what sort of &#x2013; we have outside in the world right now. But we keep this outlook anyway. But it will be a tough target (13.12) to achieve at this point.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Hans van der Gram. You talk about further expansion in emerging markets. The biggest of them all, one of the biggest, that is, India with low penetration and big population and good growth potential, do you have any special thoughts on that country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I have answered that kind of questions before. Let me first start saying we just concluded Nepal and Cambodia. And I would like to give the management some time to integrate and consolidate that organization. So I think that we need some time to &#x2013; if we do anything more right now. Secondly, the really big markets like India has a bigger risk, because it involves a lot of &#x2013; more money. And I think I would prefer to &#x2013; if possible to have several mid-sized markets instead of one big one. So that's my thought.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Next question we take down here.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Sven Sk&#xF6;ld from Swedbank. You know I always ask you about the gross margin. The gross margin was unchanged now and was up in the second quarter. Can you discuss a little bit about the mix here and what has affected that &#x2013; I mean the positive effect in the second quarter and the now stable margin compared to last year, and how you look at the gross margin going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the gross margin as such is &#x2013; partly very much &#x2013; I mean it is very much depending on the mix that we have in the business. And that depends on what kind of sales we'll have in the coming quarter. But anyway, what we're trying to do is going to save quarter gross margin as much as we can and make sure that we're keeping the the margins at <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The more &#x2013; I mean more business we do in Eurasia, if we talk in &#x2013; not gross margin but we're talking EBITDA margin. We run the business in Eurasia with a 50% EBITDA margin. So the more we can grow over there it helps our EBITDA margin obviously. I will say that I think some of the efficiency measures have also helped us in broadband because some of the efficiency measures came on OpEx lines, some come on the cost of goods sold. Both, of course, helps the EBITDA line. So I think that's a &#x2013; and I'm very, very encouraged by this, because if you remember 2007 and even in 2006, we had declining EBITDA margins every quarter, even to the point that we had increased sales and flat or decreased EBITDA kroners. And that was one of the ambitions we had when we entered this year, we really would like to try to see if we can maintain the EBITDA margin in percentage, 32.2 is for the year, right? We are an inch behind last year after nine months and we repeated the outlook and said, we think we have &#x2013; we maintain the ambition to go up to 32.2, which means obviously as Per-Arne was saying that then to do that the fourth quarter has to be, in terms of EBITDA margin, better than fourth quarter last year, otherwise we won't make it as we are slightly behind. But I feel very encouraged by the fact that we have &#x2013; we've been able to hold the decline of the EBITDA margin and keeping it sort of flat for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question down here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. <mark type="inaudible" />. Your guidance say that the restructuring program costs three rather than four billion, can you please give us some details there. The agreement with the union, has that changed the terms for redundancy, etc? And then secondly you said that the financial turmoil creates opportunities, are you thinking about the MegaFon and the potential acquisition of Altimo, since it's 25% in MegaFon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I take the correspondent 17.32) on this, of course we have looked at what the <mark type="inaudible" /> during this year. So that is one explanation why we take this. But I don't, of course, agree with this &#x2013; another part of that. There is a <mark type="inaudible" />, but this is combination of these two items.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Well, on the new opportunity side, I little bit joked when the last report said that the moon and the stars have to line up to make a deal, right? The moon and the stars are moving because of the financial turmoil, so maybe they line up one day, I don't know.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Michael Andersson, Evli Bank. I noticed that the broadband ARPU was flat or actually up 1%, at the same time you are having price pressure on the normal mix shift, if you could give some light on that. I haven't looked to the broken down figures for the different regions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean &#x2013; of course, I mean if you start with the broadband ARPU, it's mainly a access ARPU still today. But of course we get some benefits on the TV side. However, I mean there are some small decrease in that one. I wouldn't take it too seriously at this point in time. And of course we hope that the IPTV and other services on top of the broadband access will help our ARPU going forward. When it comes to the mobility ARPU &#x2013; was that the other question in Sweden?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean there are two different parts. And first of all, we had the postpaid ARPU, and of course it's under pressure because we report the broadband &#x2013; mobile broadband customers as postpaid customers. And today they are monthly charged and mobile broadband is less than a postpaid ARPU that we have. On a previous base I wouldn't say that there is any major pressure on that one, but of course we're also getting hit on the mobility side, from interconnect and roaming changes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have also increased &#x2013; yes, in broadband &#x2013; mobile broadband side, but it was quite a small one. Next question we will take it upfront here.</p>

          <p>Hi. Stefan Pettersson, Nordea. Congratulations to a good quarter. I'm curious on Eurasia. Last quarter we saw a slowdown in growth, this quarter, growth is holding up rather well. We have seen effect from food inflation, but now food prices are coming down. Do you see an effect from the credit crisis in these regions yet, and how do you weigh those two components going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's probably so that we will see more effects on the credit crisis in emerging &#x2013; in fast growing markets than we would in our home market. I think that's a pretty logical analysis. We said last quarter that we saw then and we continue to see that people in those markets buy less phone, they don't call less, they don't change their phone as often, they might even buy second hand phones instead of a new phone. So there's more in that space we see it. And as I said, we are in a fairly non-cyclical business. I could even argue with you and say, in this &#x2013; today's situation I think we all try to save cost in the company, so we travel less, and if you travel less, you call more. So I don't think that we are exposed to this turmoil and we are close to some other companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the effect from food inflation, has that leveled off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will tell you I don't have an analysis that relate food inflation to calling patterns in Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan or whatever. I just conclude that we're growing the business very healthy and I am very encouraged about what oppositions we have in these countries. I am very happy about Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, I mean that was a big bet we did a year ago and it seems to be paying off. Now we made another big bet a couple of weeks ago with Nepal primarily, but also Cambodia, I mean here we will see the best source paying off.</p>

          <p>Hi there. A couple of questions, the first one on the iPhone. Could you tell us if you've seen any margin impact in the sale of the iPhone? And my other question was on the emerging markets, could you tell us if you've recently seen a trend &#x2013; a change in trends in the Baltics or in Eurasia in October, for example? And what makes you confident that you will be able to offset these impacts? I would like also to listen from you on what do you think would be a reasonable price for Yoigo in Spain, when for example, companies in Europe like Three are still losing money after so many years? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The iPhone, yeah. I am very happy with the iPhone because it's really boosted, I think, our image in those markets. iPhone, not only for us, but for other operators selling iPhone. We've also seen higher ARPU from iPhone customers. Yeah, there's a subsidy, but there is a subsidy on every phone and if we are allowed to, like we are in many of our markets, to offer a subsidy connected to a reasonable time contract like in Sweden it was 24 months, it's a good deal for us. So I am very happy with the iPhone not only from a financial standpoint, but also from an image of TeliaSonera and our brands.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, it's Maurice Patrick from JPMorgan. A couple of quick questions. First of all, in Finland, it looks like the ARPUs were declining by 20% in the quarter whereas last quarter it was down 10% and the usage per customer is also down. Could you just talk a bit about what's happening in the Finnish markets? And separately, on your pensions, I noticed that your obligations have increased and you have decreased your discount rate, whereas I think the company in the telecom sector most talked about, with pensions increasing, the discount rate, because it tracks the double A discount, corporate bond rate, so could you just talk about those two elements? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. And if we start with the Finnish ARPU. Again, I mean, Maurice, same pattern as we see in Sweden. We have interconnect and then of course national &#x2013; international roaming that affects the ARPU. And from a volume perspective, I also think that it's quite flat and whereas in Finland, one thing is that &#x2013; because the other way is of course mobile broadband where you have higher ARPU than the underlying postpaid ARPU, and when it comes to the other question, then I'll turn it back to Per-Arne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the discount, I mean we have changed the discount rate once a year, so that will be taken care at the end of the year. And then also, I mean, given that we also have more retire &#x2013; more people retiring during the year, their obligation will increase. But normally we make that one calculation once a year and then we have the whole effect and then we will also look at the interest rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why reduce the discount rate, I think in the slide you say it was 4.6% at 2007 and now it's 3.9?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, first of all, I mean the numbers that we are providing you are our own estimates for the time being, and of course we have to make sure that this the whole also for the year-end. And then we can have a discussion with this a bit later on in more detail about exactly how we do the discount rates.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We take next question over the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Ulrich Schaeffer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My first question regards the guidance for the year where you said yourself it requires a bit of an acceleration in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering, from a trend perspective where would the pick-up be geographically, or on which division? And that would be my first question. Second question, you are commenting in your report that the IPTV subscriber base is flat in Sweden in spite of the summer campaign. I was just wondering how you look at that, is this a question of very high competitive intensity or is it sort of something &#x2013; maybe not as attractive in the product offering as you wish it to be and you will change that or how do you look on that situation? And my question, if I may, is with regard to the Swedish fixed cost base, if I calculated it correctly, the net costs in Swedish fixed actually up year-on-year by SEK60 million. It was down in the third &#x2013; sorry in the previous quarter by 60 million. Why are the net costs in Swedish fixed going up this quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second question. So I think that's maybe most important of them. As I said, we experienced that two-thirds of the people who took this free trial period, remains a paying customer. That means one-third goes away. So if you have a flat customer base that means you have acquired new customers to the same tune as you lost. So I am actually pretty happy with the flat number of IPTV customers, of which two-thirds have now, have to decide to stay or leave, two-thirds are staying and are paying customer for us.</p>
          <p>And then coming to the outlook, what I was referring to was that we had a slightly weaker quarter in Q4 last year, and from that perspective we need to be better than the last quarter &#x2013; last year. That's what we are referring to. It has to be delivered basically by everybody, no particular business area or geography, just has to be a little bit better, not a lot better, but just slightly better. And then the last question was about the OpEx in Swedish fixed going up or down 60 million in the quarters, and I think the general question is here of course, do we have some seasonality. But simultaneously also have a situation with broadband services, where we have IPTV, there are cost attached to it depending on how many customers did the company retain from the old customer base. And then of course, on top of that we have the migration from fixed voice going down and we have efficiency improvements. In Q2 &#x2013; it was somewhat lower in Q3 and we have somewhat better effect on those. So it's a sum of all those different parts &#x2013; many moving parts. And we continue with questions from the floor. And Lena, if you get ready?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lena &#xD6;sterberg from Enskilda. Two questions. First of all, could you maybe give us some guidance on the split as for the cost cutting between the business areas, on broadband and mobility, how much you achieved so far? And then or Spain, have you been approached by somebody else, has the process started or is &#x2013; this is entirely triggered from the performance of the operation itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The spilt &#x2013; I won't give you any details, but it's quite clear, but the major cost saving will have to be and has been in broadband. That's where you have a big cost base. On the year ago, now this is a decision that the management and supported by the Board of course has taken in view of the performance. And the fact that it takes one year longer, and I don't think it is a secret to you that I think the emerging markets are very attractive because they grow fast. They have a high EBITDA margin and I will prefer to invest my money there if I can. And therefore because of the fact it is one year later now I want to see what options do I have. I will underline again what I said and I really meant it. I will not only push anybody for a certain date or I won't sell at any prices, so is an option.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have one more question on phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, two questions now, and maybe return to &#x2013; first Norway, 600 million, are you expected to lose from network Norway and also from the symmetric interconnect in Q4 on an annualized basis? How much of that was already coming to Q3? Is this a comparison compared to Q2, or is it comparison compared to Q3? And the second question on Finland, obviously better than most people expected, particularly in the broadband side, but also in the mobile side, can you talk about returning back on marketing, is that something you expect to do in a weak economy to cut back on subsidiaries and marketing to lift margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I will take the last one. I think generally spoken, I think, we've spent a lot of resource on marketing. We just look at this country, and we look how much we spent compared to competition. We ask ourselves is that really the right thing to do when we are looking for savings. I think we have this debate every quarter, and that's what school said. One school says, if we don't invest in marketing, you lose marketing share and another school says where is the right balance, and I think we have some good discussions with the business areas, managements about this issue. I think we should be careful. We should be &#x2013; not automatically invest in marketing because we've done that in the past four quarters. You should, every quarter ask us is this a good investment. So yeah, some quarters it will go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to know what &#x2013; I mean what I have said is that we will have an annual effect, <mark type="inaudible" /> for Q4, going forward, <mark type="inaudible" /> affecting the quarter <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And we have &#x2013; I don't know that really have an effect...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had the full effect of interconnect in the quarter, and then we have of course, re-looked it just a one month effect on the network now. We take three more questions over the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a question from Mr. Peter Kurt Nielsen. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux, two questions please. Firstly, relates to your international expansion strategy, you are saying now that you are sort of reviewing your options in Spain given that you haven't delivered on your business plan and your targets. At the same time, you're entering two new markets at a considerable expense and saying that you are considering entering new further markets. Now, if you could not deliver on the business plan and targets in Spain what should give us any confidence that you can do so in markets which are even further from your home region? And my second question relates to the mobile &#x2013; sorry, with the wholesale margin, which has taken a significant positive turn this quarter, what is driving that dynamic please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the track record of Eurasia is the argument. We are growing the Eurasian business 17% with a 50% EBITDA margin. We've had a high margin as long as I've been CEO of this company. I think that at least convinces me that the management of Eurasia is doing a good job and I expect them to continue to do a good job. I will say, and I said this before, I think the major challenge in Eurasia are the political risks that you don't totally control. But I prefer emerging markets &#x2013; to expand in emerging markets compared to the alternatives.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And then the next question was about the &#x2013; that I really wanted...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I think that's more of an internal shift between business units within the broadband. So it's nothing that has to happen for links only.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean what situations in the quarter we saw that international carrier continues growth, and of course this is all done with somewhat tighter margins as we've previously seen and simultaneously we also kept the SG&amp;A cost down, which of course then implies we are somewhat higher. And then we have a small internal shift between broadband Sweden and wholesale Sweden.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Jakob Bluestone. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Jakob Bluestone from Merrill Lynch. Two fairly quick questions. Firstly, could you just give us a bit of an update on where your thinking is regarding spending on CapEx, and returning cash to shareholders, briefly, given some of the comments that you made during your presentation about refinancing and cash flow. And then secondly, your change in working capital this quarter was quite a bit worse than last year. And I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on why that was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; I mean, what you see there is probably the effects &#x2013; that we have invested during the year and also that <mark type="inaudible" /> increasing some investments in all areas. I don't think it's also dramatically higher than last year, to be honest. I don't know why people conclude that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you &#x2013; Jakob, repeat the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so just &#x2013; the first question was could you just give us an update about what your thinking is on spending on CapEx and returning cash to shareholders and just given what you were saying on refinancing in alternate markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, CapEx, we have talked about 15 billion and we have this license that we bought on top of that. We maintain that opinion. Yes, we do we do increase CapEx, <mark type="inaudible" /> showed you CapEx for the first, I think, first nine months is up 25%. That's a good investment, clearly networks in emerging markets. We will continue to do that. One of the priorities is quality networks. I strongly believe that TeliaSonera, wherever we operate, could be a good operator, successful operator provided we have high quality networks, great customer service and competitive cost structure. That is what it takes to be a success in this business. And if you want to have high quality networks you have to invest in the networks. And we will continue to do so. With regard to the returning money to the shareholders, the program has not changed, the policy has not changed, it's maintaining as it is. The board will have to look at this at the end of year. I will say that I think &#x2013; I hold it for &#x2013; highly unlikely that the board by the end of this year will decide for next <mark type="inaudible" /> in view of the situation and also in view of new opportunities, I think might be around the corner for us. Thank you. Next question over the phone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Mr. Jacques de Grillion. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jacques de Grillion from Natexis Securities. Regarding the ARPU in Finland. I would like to assess how can it move by 20% just only about mobile termination and roaming? And could you give us a feeling of how much of the cost elevation now is mobile broadband? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the mobile ARPU in Finland, again, the same question, I mean it's the interconnect and roaming that affects it, and simultaneously of course also a question of the intake customers, at point in time we have taken and what would it start to generate by these customers compared to previous customers. We can have a more detailed question with regard to this, give me call a later on, and then the second question was...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Finland. As to investments, I wonder if you get more for your money than before, there's been a lot of talk about price pressure when it comes to Erickson and Nokia Siemens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, now you are talking about the prices of our suppliers basically. I think you can compare what is happening in our industry with what happened in the IT industry with microprocessors and memory. Basically you've got double capacity from the same price. I mean the PC in those days cost the same amount of money. Every year you have doubled the capacity and memory or process capacity. Same thing will have to happen in our industry. If you look at Mobility primarily, if you look at Mobility and you look at the capacity that those networks are required to deliver, maybe going all the way up to 50 and 100 megabits per second, the prices will have to be the same, otherwise the business model doesn't work for the operator. And I think all the suppliers know this. And they are working very hard on it. And we see that you have seen the price come down in the last couple of years and I expect it and I communicate that when I talk to our suppliers that we expect it to continue, otherwise our business model doesn't work, and so far so good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And maybe just one general comment that with regards audit, because I missed so many questions about mobile auditors. Of course there is also one thing that we have to keep in mind and that is, of course, more and more people have multiple SIM cards. And I still feel that you can only use that much phone. So, I mean, you do have some SIM cards that are not as active as some others. And that's of course something we follow very carefully.</p>
          <p>So I think this ends the Q&amp;A session, and if you have interest <mark type="inaudible" /> Cecilia will take care of all those arrangements, and if you have interest of interviewing <mark type="inaudible" /> (40.33) will take care of all these questions.</p>
