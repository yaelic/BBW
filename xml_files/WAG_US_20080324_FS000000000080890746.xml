          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to the Walgreen Company Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Hans, Director of Finance.  Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone.  Welcome to our second quarter conference call.  Joining me today are Jeff Rein, Chairman and CEO; Greg Wasson, our President; Bill Rudolphsen, our Chief Financial Officer.  Also in the room and available during the Q&amp;A session is John Spina, our Treasurer, and Stanley Blaylock, Senior Vice President and President of Walgreens Health Services.</p>
          <p>Jeff will begin with a review of our specialty pharmacy announcement this morning and key highlights of the second quarter.  Then Bill will discuss the detailed financial results of the quarter, followed by Greg who will cover Walgreens Health and Wellness strategy and how it complements our retail pharmacy growth model.  Following our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take any questions.  Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, so that we may give an opportunity to as many investors as possible during our limited time.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that today's call is being simulcast on our Investor Relations website located at investor.walgreens.com.  After the call, this presentation will be archived on our website for 12 months.</p>
          <p>Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty.  Please see our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Rein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Rick and good morning everyone.  Before we discuss the second quarter financial results, I want to update you on the significant contract announcement we made this morning.  Walgreens has signed an exclusive multi-year specialty pharmacy contract with Prime Therapeutics, the pharmacy benefit manager owned by 10 Blue Cross Blue Shield plans.  We are delighted to partner with Prime Therapeutics to provide the highest quality care and service for any of their 20 million members with specialty pharmacy needs.  We are excited about the potential this contract offers us.  These are large clients and we'll concentrate on a flawless start-up.  We will be phasing in the individual plans over time.  We strongly believe that our independence from the major PBMs is a significant factor in winning this business and our independence will help us consistently win contracts over the long-term.  Customers are telling us they prefer to be aligned with a company that isn't involved in services with which they may be competing in the future.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the second quarter.  We reported record quarterly sales of $15.4 billion, an increase of 10.5%, driven by continued organic expansion and acquisitions.  Despite comparisons to a 27% net earnings per share increase a year ago, we increased net earnings per share 5.2% this quarter to $0.69 compared with $0.65 a year ago.  For the second consecutive quarter, we benefited from disciplined cost control and solid execution.  We controlled costs while facing tough comparisons with last year.  We executed our growth strategy with the opening of 121 new stores, 41 more than during the year-ago quarter and including our first store in Washington, D.C.  And we grew our market share while improving overall customer service, witnessed by store-level complaints trending down.</p>
          <p>Sales improved as the quarter progressed.  While Christmas seasonal sales were weaker than expected, we rebounded with strong Valentine's Day sales.  We also showed that our core product categories, including our popular private brand business, insulate us from the full impact of a slowing economy.  Some of the sales challenges we faced in the quarter included the withdrawal from the market and cautions on the use of cough and cold products for children six and under and the late flu season which, when it finally hit, didn't generate the level of related prescriptions seen in 2007.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we also aggressively priced digital photo prints.  While that created margin pressure in the short-term, it will drive more front-end business over the long-term.  During this fiscal year, we have executed the classic balancing act very well.  We are controlling cost in a challenging economic environment and delivering results in the short-term, while making the needed strategic and capital investments to ensure our success over the long-term.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to introduce our CFO, Bill Rudolphsen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone.  Let's briefly discuss our second quarter financial performance.  Jeff already provided our total sales and earning numbers, so I'll move into more specifics.  Total sales in comparable stores were up 4.7% in the quarter, while front-end comparable store sales increased 4%.  Prescription sales rose 11.1% for the quarter and 5.2% on a comparable store basis.  The number of prescriptions filled in the second quarter increased 3.6% on a comparable store basis.  That compares to a 2.3% increase in total U.S. retail prescription volume during the same period according to IMS Health.</p>
          <p>Gross margin dollars and overall profits are being impacted by tough comparisons to an unusually strong period a year ago, which benefited from the introductions of blockbuster generic versions of name-brand drugs Zocor and Zoloft.</p>
          <p>Total gross profit in the quarter was $4.4 billion, a 9.9% increase, compared to 16.7% increase the prior year.  Gross profit margins decreased 14 basis points versus the year ago quarter to 28.82.  In the front-end, we saw them decrease because of the sales mix shifting to lower margin items.  In the pharmacy, margins increased with the growth in generic drug sales, but as pharmacy sales grow faster than front-end sales, they reduce overall margins, which are lower in the pharmacy than the rest of the store.</p>
          <p>The LIFO rate remained unchanged this quarter compared to the first quarter, but in last year's second quarter we lowered the LIFO rate by 50 basis points resulting in a LIFO provision of $13.4 million in last year's second quarter, less than half the $30.6 million recorded this year.</p>
          <p>As Jeff mentioned, this quarter we again demonstrated strong discipline in SG&amp;A expenses, which increased 11% over the year-ago period, slower than the 14.3% increase in last year's quarter.  The improvement was primarily the result of a slower rate of store salary growth.  We also saw contributions from lower legal and insurance expenses.  Our entire organization continues to focus on taking a highly disciplined approach to managing our SG&amp;A spending.  As a percent of sales, SG&amp;A expenses increased 11 basis points versus the year ago quarter to 21.75.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate was 36.82% compared to a rate of 36.75% in the year-ago period.  We anticipate a tax rate of about 37% for the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations totaled $1.5 billion for the year-to-date.  Total short-term debt stood at $728 million at the end of the second quarter.  We will continue managing our balance sheet for maximum financial flexibility and to support our core growth strategy.  We expect to fund the acquisitions of I-trax and Whole Health Management with commercial paper and short-term notes.</p>
          <p>Inventories in the second quarter climbed 12.2%, slightly ahead of our 10.5% sales gain.  Inventory levels were affected by our non-comparable Anderson, South Carolina distribution center, additional pharmacy distribution capability at our Perrysburg, Ohio facility and the launch of over-the-counter Zyrtec.</p>
          <p>I'd like to quickly note that our integration of Option Care, the specialty pharmacy and home care provider we acquired last August, is going well.  We are on target to reach our $15 million synergies goal this fiscal year.  I also want to note that we continue to target at least 15% ROIC in our acquisitions and organic growth initiatives.  Store growth includes plans for total square footage increases of approximately 8% per year while our strong financial flexibility allows us to act on acquisition opportunities as they come up.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Greg Wasson, for an update on growth initiatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill and good morning.  I'd like to briefly touch on recent progress in our strategy to one, extend our pharmacy service offerings; two, expand our store base; and three, add new store services that give our customers more reasons to shop with us.</p>
          <p>Through these initiatives, we will grow earnings and add shareholder value.  We see a tremendous opportunity in pharmacy and wellness care to connect the dots for patients and payers.  That's what our recent moves are doing.  With the formation this month of our Walgreens Health and Wellness division, plus the acquisitions of I-trax and Whole Health Management, we will make healthcare services more convenient and accessible.  We'll do that by tying these businesses with our other services to create almost 7,000 points of care.  That includes retail pharmacies, in-store Take Care health clinics, worksite health centers and pharmacies, and other outlets.</p>
          <p>Our platform will provide pharmacy services near the patient's home or at work, specialty pharmacy products and patient management services needed for these complex and expensive medications, homecare services including respiratory and home medical equipment programs, and new services such as wellness programs, disease management and occupational health services.  These services and the access points for reaching our patients that they provide allow us to become a close advisor to employers and health plans.</p>
          <p>We will help them reduce cost and improve the quality of healthcare for their employees, dependants, and retirees. And our trusted brand will extend further into the healthcare sector.  Meanwhile, our store expansion continues as we take advantage of current opportunities that will position us as the leading drugstore retailer for years to come.</p>
          <p>We opened 290 stores in the first half of fiscal 2008, ahead of last year's 223 first-half openings.  We are on pace to open 550 new stores this year with a net gain of more than 475 stores after relocations and closings.  We have the leading market share in 121 major markets, including Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Phoenix, St. Louis and San Francisco.</p>
          <p>We are also growing through pharmacy file buyouts.  We acquired pharmacy files from 43 pharmacies across the nation, plus 27 Rite Aid stores in the Las Vegas area in the second quarter.  These buyouts quickly build our pharmacy business and, in many cases, we add quality pharmacists and staff with strong ties to the community.  We have had better than expected success in Las Vegas with the Rite Aid patient file acquisition.  Vegas is a great success story for us where we've gone from no presence in 1996 to the market leader today.  We will continue to track competitive developments in the individual markets and take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they come up.</p>
          <p>We also continue to improve customer traffic and add sales opportunities through front-end store initiatives such as digital photo services, printer cartridge refills that will expand from 3,000 locations today to 4,500 locations by the end of the calendar year, and DHL shipping services, which will be virtually chain-wide by December.</p>
          <p>All of these services add up to what the online world calls a sticky shopping experience.  So now, I'll turn the call back to Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Greg.  Before we move on to your questions, I'd like to thank our 230,000 employees who delivered the results we reported this quarter.  Success always begins with serving our customers and patients' and 5 million of them pass through our doors everyday.  And I'm looking forward to welcoming our new I-trax and Whole Health coworkers.  You will be a great addition in helping us provide convenient, accessible care to our patients including many who are new to Walgreens.</p>
          <p>We will also work hard to exceed the expectations of our specialty pharmacy patients coming to us through our new contract with Prime Therapeutics.  With access to their 20 million members combined with our existing specialty pharmacy business, we are a major player in this industry.  All of this positions us well to create long-term shareholder value.  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Folks, that concludes our prepared remarks.  We are now ready for your questions.  Mark, may we have our first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question today will come from Mark Wiltamuth, Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  First on the SG&amp;A improvements, could you let us know how much of that was &#x2013; from legal and insurance and then maybe give us an idea of how much more SG&amp;A improvement you could have here?  Have you really reduced the 24-hour store counts and what are the other opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi Mark.  This is Jeff here.  Approximately 60% of our reduction was on the payroll side, 40% was the legal and insurance experience. Our goal, as you know, is that 11 to 12% increase in SG&amp;A.  There is more room, we have taken some action on 24-hour stores where they haven't made sense.  We do look at the numbers of course, we look at the trade area and we want to make sure that we serve people properly. Where there is an opportunity to save dollars and serve the folks just as well then, of course, we would reduce our 24-hour stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you could talk just a little bit about the macking out trends, it seems like the worst of that should be over here in February and maybe a better half coming in the second half with generics, may be if you could talk about that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about the generic pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as you know, this is a weaker year than normal for brand going to generic and it's still a little bit weak towards the end of the year.  However, in 2009 and 2010 in particularly it picks up very, very nicely.  We do try to take advantage of all brand-to-generic opportunities obviously.  Once again, it's just a little bit weaker this year as it has been in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I would add to that.  In the third quarter of last year, our gross profit increase was 16%, so that still is a challenging comparison and it gets more favorable in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And next we'll hear from Mark Miller with William Blair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping if you could share more on the Prime Therapeutics contract as it relates to timing, you talked about phasing that in?  And also anything more you can share on how that's going to impact you financially. And will you need to build and invest ahead of the earnings growth as you do with stores or does the flow-through improve relative to the retail model as you expand it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mark, that's a good question.  Let me turn that over to Greg Wasson who has been really involved with Prime Therapeutics now for quite a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Mark, thanks.  Good morning.  Hey, just first, we want to, I definitely want to say that we are excited that we've been chosen by Prime Therapeutics for this exclusive opportunity.  We've known Prime for quite some time.  Tim Dickman and his management team have run a great shop.  They do &#x2013; they have done a great job serving their affiliated Blues groups over time, so we are really looking forward to the opportunity.  As far as the timing, certainly it would be somewhat hard to predict because most of these plans will be phased down over time.  We certainly think that over time, that most, if not many, of the Blues will begin to use Prime Therapeutics' product.  But I would say that with any large contract, obviously the first thing we're going to want to do is to make sure that we execute the first plan or two to come on board flawlessly.  We know that Prime and the Blues would certainly expect that.</p>
          <p>As far as the financial impact, it is tough to predict because the plans will roll out over time.  We certainly think it's a huge opportunity because of the significant specialty spend these Blues have but certainly hard to expect or to predict.  Capacity, I may turn it over to Stan Blaylock who is with us here.  I think we have absolutely plenty of capacity.  And if you think back of some of our recent acquisitions, a year and a half ago we acquired Medmark for just that reason. We acquired management expertise as well as capacity to scale and certainly with Option Care last year with our national fusion capabilities, we have plenty of capacity.  So, I think we are in great shape, looking forward to being a part of it.  Stan, anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would echo what Greg said, Mark.  We clearly have capacity by virtue of our dedicated central fulfillment facilities in both Pittsburgh as well as the Ann Arbor operation, which we have out of Option Care.  We also now have a dedicated specialty pharmacy facility in Portland, Oregon.  So we have plenty of capacity to handle this, and are looking forward, as Greg said, to working with the Prime folks who really I think chose us because we have a high-quality independent service offering that meshes nicely with the high-quality integrated medical and pharmacy services they are trying to provide to their customer base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thanks.  My other question is as we think about the easier comparisons coming up, I noticed that Walgreens has been tracking on a two-year basis at roughly a low 30% rate which, averaging across the two years, is about in line with your long-term growth rate.  Should we think about that continuing more or less in to the back half of the year?  I know you don't want to have guidance, but on the other hand, I know you also have an interest in analysts being in the right ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I would say certainly our long-term goal is to achieve the earnings growth that we have achieved in the past.  I would again point to the third quarter as a little bit of a challenging comparison considering the significant gross profit improvement we experienced last year, and again fourth quarter gets easier as our earnings actually fell last year in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>John Heinbockel with Goldman Sachs has our next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, can you guys speak to performance of new stores, you know specifically maybe a lookout over a couple of year period here but sales, script count, EBIT margin return on capital, how are new stores performing compared to two or three years ago or further back, has there been any slippage there in the performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes John, that's good question.  I know people are concerned about our new stores as we showed in the charts last time, they are doing very well based on trend, based on history.  Bill, I think you have some thoughts on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes John, I would point you to the charts that we illustrated in the last quarter's call, our script count.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And our front-end sales are still performing for our new store base as they had in the past.  So we feel very good about our performance in new stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; how about return on capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Same thing.  We did illustrate some return on capital numbers in that slide last quarter and we do see it increasing over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, what do you think as you look forward here, because a lot of retailers tend to slow expansion only after returns have fallen.  I mean as you look forward what are the kind of puts and takes you guys look at to &#x2013; is what we're seeing today likely, do you think it's likely to continue or when you look at whether it be changes in reimbursement, maybe competition at the front-end, do you think returns go down over time or what's &#x2013; as you look out a couple of years what's your thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Jeff here.  There are fabulous opportunities to continue to expand, as you know, the age wave nothing is going to slow that down.  People are going to continue get older.  They're going to continue to take medications, which we are a major provider.  They're going to continue to use pharmacy services whether that's specialty, immunization and flu shots. And they like the convenience of the smaller store.  I think you even see some of the competition now trying to experiment with smaller stores because as the population gets older they want accessible healthcare, they want accessible services and they want it to be convenient at the same time.  So we are very, very well positioned.  The stores we're building, they're in A locations, great demographics, great trade areas.  There is no reason to think that we are going to do any worse at all.  In fact maybe we'll even do better as other competition consolidates or it goes out of business.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Locations are not a problem; I would say it does come back to the people.  We want to make sure that we have the proper trained personnel to staff the stores, not only in the front-end but in the pharmacies. But it's a real balance, of course.  We want to balance to make sure we get the best sites.  We don't want to over-reach and be pressured to make some number.  We do want to make sure we get that return on investment that we've been targeting and we'll keep going after the best of best.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your gross margin was down less than it was in the first quarter especially on a FIFO basis.  Is it because the front-end &#x2013; I am sorry, I should say just because the pharmacy margin was up more year-over-year than it was in Q1 or is it because the front-end margin declined less?  And then you know how should we really think about the gross margin for the remainder of the year?  Does it continue to get better from here, get worse, should we just assume you know a similar trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.  Let me turn that over to Bill for the answer please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Ed, we are seeing better margins in the pharmacy. I do believe that that will continue.  As Jeff had mentioned, we will see probably a bigger increase in '09 and '10 as generics come out in the marketplace.  On the front-end, it was a challenge in the quarter.  We did have a softer seasonal season in December.  We did see sales of lower margin items and as the economy tightens, I think we will continue to see some of that.  In addition, we were a little bit more promotional, especially in the digital photo area.  I think that that will probably continue as the economy tightens here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then just a follow-up here, your front-end comps, if you kind of look historically grew at an average rate of maybe about 3% or a little bit more prior to 2004.  Now the growth over the last few years was obviously in the 5 to 6% range but it's decelerated recently.  Which of these two growth rates should we think about going forward over the next few years, are we seeing a reversion back to the mean? Maybe you could just kind of help us understand how you are thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a reversion to the mean does happen, of course.  I think one of the things to consider over the past couple of years is that people felt extremely wealthy with the stock market, their houses, and all that sort of thing, so their discretionary spending was up.  Right now, they are being very careful on the type of products they buy.  They are trading down a little bit.  We are seeing more ad sales versus the everyday basic sale.  I think once again people are looking for that value.  We will continue to do well based on our convenience and access but people are really looking for that sharp price, that value price that makes a difference.  However, there are a lot of things that we are going to get into that Greg has talked about in the past, where it will help increase sales.  As you know, the ink cartridges, the refills, we'll have those in 4,500 stores, so that's a way of driving business.  We'll have DHL in almost all our stores.  Once again, it gets back to convenience and offering that consumer a value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Jeff, you talked about sales improving as the quarter progress, is that a combination of traffic and ticket or can you dig a little deeper there for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what happened is in December, people were really shocked almost, not only with the stock market but with the housing crisis and folks scared of losing their job and that sort of thing, so we did see a trend of down seasonal sales or a slowing of seasonal sales.  However, when you look at Valentine's in particular in terms of seasons, it's one of those things, is who is going to forget their sweetheart.  So we had phenomenal, phenomenal Valentine sales.  It worked out very well.  And once again, as people are looking for value and in terms of our advertising it really helped drive those sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you say during the quarter that traffic improved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Traffic, it's hard to say on that in terms of quantifiable but it's about 50:50 in terms of traffic and then ticket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then obviously on the SG&amp;A side, there is &#x2013; very impressive in terms of what's happening at the store level, can you talk about how you are optimizing labor differently now than you have in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the past, as we mentioned before, we didn't really follow the budget as well as we should have.  We do have the district managers and store vice presidents sitting down with the store manager and decide on a budget, what is appropriate for the front-end and what is appropriate for the pharmacy.  And one of the things that got us in trouble last year is, we did not follow those budgets as well we should have.  We do follow the budgets now and people track that, we look at it, usually twice a week but no more -- I am sorry, no less than once a week and once again, we make sure we follow the budget that is set up through the system and through people talking with each other and it's worked out very, very well for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and Debra, Greg.  I think the other thing that, as Jeff alluded earlier to one of the callers was that we are really looking at every store's opening hours.  Have been looking at competition, looking at what make sense for the store and really getting laser focused on when the store should be open, how long it should be open, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are there any changes in processes or procedures or is it mainly kind of being very budget-focused and mindful of kind of hours?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's attention to what the hours are needed to serve the folks, not only in the pharmacy but out front.  As we mentioned, complaints have continued to trend down.  And many, many years ago, for example, we would just cut 20 hours per store across the chain, didn't make sense. So if a guy or -- a guy or a gal was doing very well, they still lost the 20 hours.  What we are doing now once again is we are focusing on that budget and what is really needed to serve our customers well.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Our next question will come from Scott Mushkin with Banc of America Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to get back to the Prime Therapeutics, just to understand a little bit more about the opportunity.  So what was the total specialty spend at these 10 Blues we're doing and how quickly will it ramp over to you guys?  Do they all have to use the Prime PBM service or no?  I just guess a little bit more clarity there.  And then the integration, I know you guys have been together pieces of the specialty business and you said there really isn't much investment to be done but maybe you can give us a little color on how the integration of all the separate business is going, in order to handle this type of contract, do you have to put a lot of systems in place to get it done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Greg, you want to answer that one please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Scott maybe I will take a shot and then I'll have Stan come on in on it.  As far as go back to when will the Blues, the various groups come on board, again Prime Therapeutics realized that they wanted to really put together a good solution, specialty solution.  They'd realized that they didn't really want to outsource and chose us.  I think for a lot of reasons, primarily because they valued our independence as a specialty pharmacy provider.  I think they also realized that with Medmark we had a longstanding relationship with a very respected Blues in Western Pennsylvania, Highmark.  And so I think that's what they are looking for us to bring to them.  As far as the Blues groups that they work with, they obviously are at will to make their own decision as to who they use and when.  I think because that they are affiliated and/or have ownership within Prime Therapeutics they certainly will be looking to utilize all the resources that Prime brings to them and that's the reason Prime put together this solution.  So, as I said earlier, I think that many, if not most, will come to use and will use Triacin over time.  And our key will be to really start off strong with the first one or two that come on board.</p>
          <p>As far as the integration maybe I will turn that to Stan.  Let Stan talk little bit about the integration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to continue on with what Greg said too Scott, when you sort of look at the overall spending amount, there are 20 million sort of underlying medical lives when you look at the Blues plans that are investors in Prime Therapeutics.  So the opportunity is both on the pharmacy benefit side and the medical benefit side.  So it is a tremendous amount of spending.  We are not commenting on the value of the contract as we indicated in the release.  As it relates to our systems aspects this will be run on our current platform, our ScriptMed operating system.  So we have invested significantly in that system and have already rolled that out to our multiple facilities.  So from a systems integration perspective, we are already there in terms of being able to handle it.  Obviously, we will be coordinating that tightly with Prime who is going to be handling some of the front-end functionality as it relates to things like eligibility and prior authorization and some of the clinical oversight, but we are already there from a systems perspective as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, perfect and maybe just one follow-up.  This actually has to do with the front-end.  I know you guys signed that DHL contract.  How does that work exactly?  I mean is there a certain volume?  I guess, maybe a little insight into the profitability there.  How, I mean clearly you're trying to get more people into your stores to use these services but is there any kind of volume break that you guys need to see to make it profitable or is it profitable from the beginning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is obviously a volume break in packages per store.  We wouldn't give out those figures at this point but one of the things it does do is get folks into Walgreens on a timely basis when they need to mail their packages and obviously they pick up other supplies, they do impulse purchasing, and things of that nature.  DHL is helping us spread the word that Walgreens stores have this.  We think it's one more way to leverage the box and take advantage of what's going on &#x2013; ties very, very well into our digital and certain home office services.  It's just a furthering of how we can serve our customers, as we need to serve them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there is a packages per store break-even point, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is, there is and we do have that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any insight how that's going so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going actually very well in the areas that we piloted.  It's been extremely good.  As you know, there is a lot of small business owners, a lot of entrepreneurs, a lot of people that don't want to wait in lines at the post office or maybe a post office is too far for them.  With over 6,200 stores across America, we are very convenient for people to send their package whenever they want to.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two things, first of all, on the Prime, two follow-ups, one is how did &#x2013; did the Blues go their own independent ways previously to get their specialty needs dealt with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Eric, Greg.  To my recollection, I believe that some of them used a previous provider from Prime and then others may have used their own specialty provider and gone their independent route.  I think this is Prime's intent to really put together a quality solution with Medmark to be able to go to the Blues and really offer them a complete package.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I &#x2013; I certainly understand the confidentiality of the size of the contract, but can you just give us any guidance at all of what the total spend was, that is potential or what was done within the -- not what the contract was for but just, to give us an idea of how big the pie might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric we, this is Jeff here.  We just signed the contract with them.  We obviously have to see the uptake in terms of specially, it will be phased in over time.  As we learn more, we can tell you more about it but let's get started with it and make sure we do it very well and then we will get into the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondly, the gross margin performance in the quarter was quite strong and was different than 1Q in terms of the year-over-year comparison.  And I understand there is lots of moving parts, the front-end being one, but the pharmacy progress in the quarter which seemed material versus the first quarter, is that sustainable, I am just trying to figure out if the 1Q or the 2Q experience is what we should be thinking about for the second half of the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I think what you are seeing there Eric is a lift in the pharmacy margin related to generics, again generics always drive the pharmacy margin.  I certainly &#x2013; this thing can certainly move around but I believe it will be sustainable for a while and again, as new generics come out we would certainly see a lift.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there has been some weakening in some areas but it's not as pronounced as you are seeing in the residential areas.  We go after the prime corners.  There is still a lot of competition for those prime corners and whether it's banks or our competition or Starbucks, whatever it may be, there is still competition for the very best corners.  People want that easy-in-easy-out location, so we are not really seeing much once again on the commercial side.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Greg here, David.  Today we like to think that we are the fourth largest specialty provider in the country, but we also like to talk about that we are the number one independent specialty provider in the country.  And I think that's where we are looking to really grow our businesses with the Blues organizations, Prime Therapeutics, and regional health plan.  So we have made significant progress over the last several years with the Medmark acquisition, Option Care.  With Option Care, we are actually one of the largest and leading infusion specialty providers as well.  So, I believe we've made good progress in market share.</p>

          <p>Yeah, it's going to phase in over time.  I would say it's over the long-term.  It's not going to be immediately within a two- to thee-year timeframe.  So, I would be thinking six to eight years out over time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.  We heard some of the wholesalers grumble a little bit about Fosamax, that it was &#x2013; because it wasn't a 180-day exclusive, that you had multiple manufacturers, so the thought at least for the wholesaler is that the product wasn't as profitable at the launch as they were hoping?  At the retail level, given the multiple manufacturers, is that a plus or a minus for you in terms of kind of out-of-the-box profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not quite sure what the wholesalers are saying here, but in terms of exclusivity and everything, if there is only one other manufacturer than they don't drop the price as much obviously.  If there is multiple manufacturers it does help drop that price.  There is a lot of profit available there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you &#x2013; all things being equal, I mean looking at a Zocor where you had the 180-day and an authorize, and looking at Fosamax where you &#x2013; it's a free for all, would you prefer the Fosamax-type situation over the Zocor-type situation?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.  Jeff, how would you characterize the competitive environment currently?  And, particularly if you could ref &#x2013; in reference or in comparison to other periods of consumer slowing, is it typical or do you think there is some major differences?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The difference this time versus the last time when it slowed is, we have phenomenal competitors.  I would like to point out that CVS and Rite Aid have really stepped up their game.  Wal-Mart is doing very well.  Target is well merchandised.  They do a very nice job.  We have Longs out there making progress.  We have a lot of folks that are doing a great job today and you have the Internet.  In the past, we didn't have as much in terms of competition being at the top of their game as they are right now.  So I would say it's a little bit tougher now than it was in the past, and once again with all this consolidation the strong get stronger.  People are definitely looking for a value now.  They're definitely shopping Walgreens.  So we're going to be able to compete very, very well not only in the stores, not only in specialty but with our site.  We have one of the top-rated sites, websites right now that folks utilize.  So I'm very confident that we'll be able to fight against competition, but once again, they are very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just following-up, how about in the area more specifically like in circulars with other drugstores, is that &#x2013; is it hotter or about the same as you've seen sort of in terms of trying to promote folks into the store again versus, let's say, the last downturn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say based on what I've seen with the different sectors with our drugstore competitors and the mass merchants, is that it's similar, is that when we went into a lower spending environment that the ads heated up a bit as they did want to get folks into the store.  We do see our competitors getting aggressive, particularly on the front page and the back page where people pay the most attention to, so that is definitely heating up.  I have not seen any huge, huge giveaways though that people are destroying profitability, but there are instances where folks are obviously getting more aggressive than they might have a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  And then I wanted to just follow-up on John Heinbockel's question on the new store performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But get to the other end of the spectrum which is the mature store performance. I think I remember Daniel Jorndt used to say drug stores are unique in that they have a 20-year tail on same-store sales; it's an annuity that keeps on giving.  And obviously with all the upfront losses for three years you kind of need that for the &#x2013; I think to get to the ROIs you guys are talking about, so could you speak to really mature store performance? Are the older stores still comping fairly decently as is the way I understand the model to work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, mature store are still doing well. What's nice is, we've be able to fill in, in more areas than ever before across the country.  This does hurt obviously the mature store on a dilutive basis maybe for a year to 18 months.  But overall, once again as people get older they take more medication, so we can still serve them better and they are shopping our stores more based on convenience and accessibility.  So they are still doing extremely well and the model still works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Andy, once those stores hit the three year mark after that, you are seeing mid-teens ROIC and I think we have disclosed that in the past.  That three to six year mark is really where our stores take off and then I think beyond six years is where you are seeing more of an inflationary increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, that's helpful.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from Sean Roberts with Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sean Roberts sitting in for Meredith.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Sean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  On the script growth I think there has been some questions on the front end, but looking at script growth trends, I realize that flu is part of the slowdown in the current quarter but as we start to move out of the flu season here would you expect us to get back to that 5 to 6% script growth trend anytime soon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good question.  It really depends on what people's actions are.  I do believe one of the challenges of course is that people ramped up in 2006 on the Medicare Part D.  So we are not seeing those huge increases that we did before with Zyrtec going over the counter right now, that affects us by about 50 basis points.  I think what the other thing is happening to is that we are seeing more folks really worried about their spending, so we have had some reports of people breaking pills in half, for example, either take it everyday like that or take their medication every other day, things of that nature.  We still think the script growth is going to continue to do very well.  It has trended down in United States though, as you know, over the last couple of years.  So it's definitely a challenge for us but once again, we are up to it.  I believe as more drugs come on line, particularly the generic drugs, that does help drive the business as people can afford those medications better than the brand side, so once again I'm quite confident of the future.  I don't know the exact number though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question would be on I-trax, I see that they are headquartered in Pennsylvania, to the extent that you guys can say where their clinics are actually geographically concentrated?  And if it is kind of in that Mid-Atlantic, Northeast region, as you add pharmacies to these worksite locations, do you think that will cannibalize your existing store base at all?  Or will that be kind of a key part of growing into new geographies where Walgreens isn't as heavily concentrated today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question and it will definitely, definitely play into our game plan.  Greg, I think you had some comments on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Sean., I think definitely the latter.  I think that as we go into some of the newer areas such as the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, that it absolutely will help us grow our brand, grow our recognition and help us grow in those areas.  Concentration, both companies are pretty much nationwide, however, there is a large concentration in Northeast and Mid-Atlantics and that's one of the things that is certainly appealing to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sean., this is John Spina.  I want to add on to Greg's comments that these aren't cannibalizing our existing stores.  They are a new main and main.  They're not an either or, it's another access point for these patients to get into our systems.  So it's really &#x2013; it doesn't cannibalize.  It really just, it's in 40 states and if we have a store down the street, it's just another access point.  We have similar experience with our hospital clinics where these folks see it for the first time and they enter our network of pharmacies and stay with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sean., Jeff here.  You may consider an analogy could be the Take Care clinics were 20% of the folks using the Take Care clinics are new to Walgreens.  So we believe the employer are onsite pharmacies will be very, very similar. A lot of folks that maybe are not shopping us right now will be introduced to the Walgreen brand, the Walgreen name and the Walgreen services.  It will definitely get them into the Walgreen system and we will be able to serve them and their dependents very well.</p>

          <p>Neil Currie with UBS has our next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks for taking the question.  I just wanted to ask another question about new stores and strategy going forward.  I think there have been some people suggesting that you may decide to pull back on new stores if you saw the returns declining.  As I see it though, the strategy has always been a long-term one whereby you haven't been acquiring stores and you have been looking at all the best drugstore markets in order to get access to the fastest growing markets, which has meant that you have historically not had the store density that maybe your competitors have had in many markets or that you would actually require.  So the question is, is actually pulling back on new store opening an option or is it absolutely vital to continue opening new stores in order to leverage your infrastructure in these still immature markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil, we obviously believe in long-term growth, so organic growth and acquisitions are major plans for us in the future.  As you know, we do buy other drugstores where they make sense.  For example, El Amal in Puerto Rico fit in very well to us.  We bought those stores.  We are continuing to look for other acquisitions.  At the same time we want to continue our organic growth, because you have the store as you want it, you have the people, the systems, everything is much easier and quicker and faster.  Plus as the trade areas get denser and denser, we find that many times you can build another store to service those folks that may have been serviced by a Walgreen store two miles away.  Now it's maybe a half a mile or a mile to their house.  So a lot of it depends on the density, but definitely we want to continue our organic growth and acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right and I wonder if I can also ask about seasonal sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously December is a very important month for seasonal sales; it tends to index higher than most months.  And it's characterized by a lot of gift items that are maybe more discretionary.  How should we think about other seasonal events in terms of their discretionary nature, clearly Valentine is about cards and candy, maybe Easter is similar, but summer season, is that something that we should be able a little bit more cautious of because of the nature of the items you're selling there and how about other seasonal events?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't characterize it necessarily as being more cautious there.  One thing to keep in mind about seasonal products on the aisle that we do have, is seasonal products create hope, they create memories and folks are very, very reluctant to give that up.  We don't sell things that are very expensive.  I'd like to tell the story that maybe about three or four years ago we learned our lesson where we went after Christmas toys that were very expensive, $50, $80, $100.  We didn't do very well; we wrote off about $10 million.  Most of the items in our stores are 20, $25 and less.  So for people to buy a cologne or a chocolate or a small toy for their child, I do not see that slowing down.  Where it's incumbent upon us to increase the profitability is to make sure we buy correctly.  Sometimes we can get very, very enthusiastic, as we all are in retail sales.  But if we control our inventory, control the buy, the seasonal sales will still continue to do well.  One thing to keep in mind is that seasonal sales is like gravy.  It's not there necessary to provide all your profits.  We get that from our basic everyday sales whether it's drug, health products, beauty products, food products but once again the seasonal is like icing on the cake and if we can control the buy, folks will always be coming in to create those memories.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thinking through the gross margin line a little bit more, if pharmacy margins improve sequentially what's the right way to think about front-end margins and was there an acceleration in margin erosion?  And could you also give us some texture about how front-end margins, current front-end margins, compare to levels that you had in 2001?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, Bill will answer that question, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Bob, front-end margins certainly were impacted again by the soft seasonal season and more promotions.  I believe that that trend will continue in the softening economy.  We're going to have to be promotional to drive traffic.  I think that that trend will continue.  They are down versus the prior year.  And I think that it's probably similar to prior recessionary periods that you're going to see softening margins on the front-end.</p>

          <p>As a reminder, with Easter this year falling on the earliest date since 1913, you need to look at combined March, April, sales to get a true picture of the performance for those months.  Our next quarterly financial announcement will be June 23rd, when we announce third quarter results.  Before that, Bill Rudolphsen will present at the Lehman Brothers 11th Annual Retail and Restaurant Conference in New York City on April 30th.  Then on May 28th, Jeff Rein will speak at the Sanford C.
