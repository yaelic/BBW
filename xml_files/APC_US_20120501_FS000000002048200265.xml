          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Anadarko Petroleum Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. John Colglazier. Please proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today for Anadarko's first quarter conference call. I will remind you that today's presentation contains our best and most reasonable estimates and information. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today.</p>
          <p>You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases, for the risk factors associated with our business. In addition, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures. So, be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release and on our website. And as we do each quarter, we've included additional information in our quarterly operations report that is available on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO, who will discuss our first quarter results here in a second. Jim is joined by other members of the executive management team who will be available to answer questions later in the call. Jim?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. We'll keep our prepared remarks brief this morning since it was only a few weeks ago when we hosted our Investor Conference here in The Woodlands. During the conference, we shared an in-depth look at our portfolio and its embedded value-creation opportunities. So, this morning, we'll focus on some of the major achievements during the quarter, which include that we reported record daily sales volumes, delivered first oil at Caesar/Tonga, generated strong discretionary and free cash flow, experienced continued success in our exploration program, demonstrated outstanding flow rates with drill-stem tests in Ghana and Mozambique and finalized a mutually beneficial resolution of the Algerian tax dispute.</p>
          <p>Focusing first upon Anadarko's operational performance, we achieved record daily sales volumes of 704,000 BOE/d during the quarter, with liquids volumes surpassing 300,000 b/d, for the first time. It's worth noting that approximately 75% of these record liquids volumes were comprised of oil. Underpinning the increase in liquids volumes were both our U.S. onshore growth plays and the startup of the Caesar/Tonga mega project in the Gulf of Mexico. At our March Investor Conference, we highlighted five major U.S. onshore liquids-rich growth plays: Wattenberg, Eagle Ford, Permian, East Texas Horizontal and Greater Natural Buttes.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we increased liquids production in these areas by approximately 27,000 BOE/d, representing a 50% increase year-over-year. This liquids growth was primarily driven by the Wattenberg and Eagle Ford assets, each of which continues to demonstrate excellent returns on capital. The Wattenberg field sales volumes averaged more than 80,000 BOE/d in the quarter, while delivering a 12,000 b/d increase in liquids volumes compared to the first quarter of 2011. We are continuing to accelerate our horizontal drilling activity in this play as we expect to add additional rigs over the coming months.</p>
          <p>Moving to South Texas, we're currently running 10 rigs in the liquids-rich Eagle Ford Shale. During the first quarter, we achieved 55% year-over-year growth in our net liquids sales volumes in this play. Keep in mind, this production growth and our returns on capital are even stronger considering the $1.6 billion joint venture we executed between last year and this year with KNOC.</p>
          <p>In Ohio, we're encouraged by the early results of our three producing wells in the Utica shale, where the most recent well has delivered from than 13,000 barrels of light-gravity oil through the first 30 days. We're continuing an active 2012 program in Ohio as we work to further evaluate a larger area in the prospective liquids-rich window, covering approximately 390,000 gross acres.</p>
          <p>In responding to the current weak natural gas price environment, we are planning rig reductions in the Marcellus shale and Greater Natural Buttes assets and are evaluating opportunities to direct some of those rigs to areas like the Wattenberg field that offer exceptional liquids-related returns.</p>
          <p>As production continues to increase in these major growth plays, we are simultaneously ensuring our ability to extract maximum value through expanded infrastructure and access to premium markets. This includes our announced participation in the Front Range in Texas Express Pipelines that will carry NGLs from the Rockies in West Texas to Mont Belvieu.</p>
          <p>It also includes our operated Chipeta Train 3 cryogenic expansion in Greater Natural Buttes, which will increase our net NGL sales volumes by more than 7,000 b/d, as well as construction of the Brasada, Lancaster and Bone Spring natural gas processing plants and securing numerous processing and takeaway arrangements in other geographic areas.</p>
          <p>Turning to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we brought Caesar/Tonga online during the quarter and safely and rapidly ramped up production from three wells to more than 45,000 BOE/d. The partnership plans to drill and complete a fourth well later this year there.</p>
          <p>Since sanctioning the Lucius project in the Gulf of Mexico late last year, we've made good progress fabricating the hull of the spar and constructing the topsides of the facility. Later this year, we are planning to initiate development drilling in the Lucius field and are on pace for first production during the second half of 2014. We recently spud Spartacus, a Gulf of Mexico exploration prospect that is targeting subsalt Pliocene sands similar to those encountered at Lucius.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Vito prospect is currently drilling below salt to further appraise this middle-Miocene discovery. During the quarter, we announced a successful appraisal well in the Heidelberg field that, coupled with the successful down-dip sidetrack announced in April, has provided additional confidence in the 200-million-barrel-plus resource estimates here.</p>
          <p>Moving to our international projects, offshore Mozambique, we announced successful appraisal wells at Lagosta-2 and Lagosta-3 during the quarter and a successful drill-stem test at Barquentine-2, which flowed at equipment constrained rates of 100 million cubic feet per day. Since that time, we've successfully conducted another DST at Barquentine-1 that tested a deeper Oligocene sand formation and also flowed at facility-constrained rates of approximately 100 million cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>These flow tests demonstrated strong connectivity and productivity within the reservoirs. These are characteristics which should lead to fewer subsea wells and therefore significant cost savings in project development. The successful Barquentine-4 well completed our appraisal drilling program in the Prosperidade area. And we have restarted our exploration program which will include drilling the Golfinho, Atum, and Orca prospects in the north, before moving to the southern portion of the block for up to two exploration wells there.</p>
          <p>Offshore Ghana, the Ntomme-2A and Enyenra-4A appraisal wells both encountered oil which significantly enhanced the value of the TEN, Tweneboa, Enyenra, and Ntomme complex and expanded its aerial extent. We also conducted successful drill-stem tests at multiple zones at the Owo discovery well which flowed at combined equipment-constrained rates exceeding 20,000 BOE/d. Partnership is continuing an active program in the deepwater Tano block and working to submit a plan of development for the TEN complex this year.</p>
          <p>Further west, offshore Sierra Leone, as previously reported, Anadarko and its partners encountered hydrocarbon pay at the Jupiter-1 prospect, and in April, the company announced that the appraisal well at Mercury-2 encountered water-bearing reservoirs.</p>
          <p>As expected, we're incorporating the data from both wells into our models as we evaluate further drilling plans -- offshore Sierra Leone. In C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, we are currently drilling the <mark type="ph" /> Pond (8:25) prospect and will report on the results by the second quarter conference call.</p>
          <p>Turning to financial results for the quarter, we reported earnings of $4.28 per diluted share and have provided a breakout in the earnings release of items affecting comparability, the most notable of which are the $1.8 billion related to resolution of the Algerian tax dispute and a non-cash charge of $275 million associated with Tronox' adversary proceeding.</p>
          <p>Excluding the items affecting comparability, first quarter net income would have been about $0.92 per diluted share. Although we remain confident of the merits of our position regarding Tronox, we also recognize there's value in removing uncertainty for our shareholders. Therefore, we continued attempts to resolve this issue, and as a result we recorded a loss contingency of $525 million associated with the adversarial proceedings. If a settlement is not reached, we are prepared to go to trial in mid-May, and we'll vigorously defend our interest.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we generated strong cash flow, discretionary cash flow of more than $1.9 billion during the first quarter. Free cash flow totaled more than $130 million which includes the impact of $98 million in consolidated capital expenditures by Western Gas partners, our midstream MLP.</p>
          <p>As a result of these strong results, we ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion of cash on hand. During the quarter, Moody's Investors Service returned our senior unsecured rating to investment grade, to Baa3 with a stable outlook. Also, we retired $131 million of debt during the quarter and reduced our net debt-to-capital ratio to 38% compared to 41% at year-end 2011.</p>
          <p>We see a clear path to our targeted net debt-to-capital range of 25% to 35% by the end of the year, with anticipated strong operating cash flows and income generation, including significant value from the Algerian tax resolution.</p>
          <p>In March, we announced an agreement with Sonatrach that resolved issues surrounding the implementation of Algeria's 2006 exceptional profits tax. The resolution preserves our long-standing relationship with Sonatrach and also returns significant value to Anadarko.</p>
          <p>There are two parts to this resolution. The first part provides for a benefit of approximately $1.8 billion to be received over a period of 12 months, and this was fully recognized in our earnings during the quarter. In terms of cash, we expect to receive about $1 billion of this amount during 2012 and the remainder in the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>The second aspect of the resolution is an amendment to the production-sharing agreement which will provide additional sales volumes estimated to be 1.6 million barrels in 2012 alone and an additional 5 million barrels during 2013.</p>
          <p>The impacts of the resolution have been included in the updated guidance attached to our earnings release, as well as in the Algerian guidance model on our website.</p>
          <p>Also, we recently closed on the divestiture of our South Texas dry gas assets mentioned at the Investor Conference, and we soon expect to close the sale of our Pompano asset located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We also finalized a joint venture agreement where we assigned 23% of our working interest in are enhanced oil recovery development at the Salt Creek field in Wyoming in exchange for our JV partner funding up to $400 million of future development costs. This transaction was identified during the Investor Conference as well.</p>
          <p>As we were evaluating bids for our Brazil assets, we received notice of the potential unitization of our Itaipu field with already-producing Petrobras-operated Whale Park pre-salt complex, formerly referred to as Jubarte. Accordingly, we do not expect to announce anything related to the potential divestiture of our Brazil subsidiary in the near future.</p>
          <p>To reflect the increased sales associated with the amended PSA in Algeria as well as strong operational performance, we have increased our 2012 sales volumes guidance range by 2 million barrels to 258 million to 262 million BOE with no corresponding increase to the 2012 capital investment program. Additional updates to guidance are attached to last night's earnings release.</p>
          <p>We believe the results of the first quarter reflect our commitment to delivering capital-efficient growth and good returns on capital. The depth and quality of Anadarko's portfolio continues to provide this flexibility to successfully manage through the current market environment and deliver differentiating value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, Jeff, we're happy to take everyone's questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim &#x2013; whoever wants to take this, but can you guys &#x2013; can you just step back and give us a snapshot of Tronox, your understanding of the case? I realize you're in legal proceedings, but whatever you can tell us as far as background and then I'll just leave it open and see -- whatever you could share with us would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I'd ask Bobby Reeves to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David. Look, there's been a lot of misleading media and other reports out there about the Tronox case. And I should preface what I'm about to say by urging you to look at our 10-K and 10-Q disclosures. But let me see if I can give you a little color about this. The plaintiffs in the Tronox matter is a litigation trust that resulted from the Tronox bankruptcy. And they're alleging a fraudulent conveyance theory under the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
          <p>And to break that down a little bit, they're alleging that Kerr-McGee, either through an internal corporate reorganization back in 2002 or the subsequent IPO of Tronox, what was originally their chemical business in 2005, somehow attempted to harm creditors, environmental creditors in this case. We really believe that Kerr-McGee's corporate reorganization, an internal corporate reorganization to separate the E&amp;P and chemical businesses in 2002, was conducted for totally legitimate business purposes and was not in any way done with an intent to harm creditors.</p>
          <p>I think everybody will also agree that Kerr-McGee made very detailed public disclosures prior to the Tronox and the IPO in 2005 as part of the securities filings and that allowed the market to really value the company. That resulted in the spin-off of a very solvent, adequately capitalized chemical company, whose contingent environmental and toxic tort liabilities were well-known and well disclosed to lenders, investors and the public.</p>
          <p>Taking all that, we really believe that Tronox's financial problems were not the result of any sort of fraudulent transfer but were, rather, simply the result of the economic and housing crisis. That in turn led to the reduced demand for the company's principal product, which at that time was paint pigments. If you don't have housing being built, you don't need paint pigments. Pretty simple in our opinion. Those events were totally unforeseeable at the time of the IPO in 2005 and the spinoff of Tronox from Kerr-McGee.</p>
          <p>Now, if for some reason the plaintiffs are successful on their theories, damages could vary depending upon the theory of liability. For example, if the plaintiffs were successful in arguing that the &#x2013; somehow, the internal corporate reorganization in 2002 was a fraudulent conveyance, then their damages might be measured in some way by, up to the value of the oil and gas assets that were transferred. If they were successful though in somehow claiming that the fraudulent conveyance occurred at the time of the IPO in 2005, then the damages might be measured by the value of what Kerr-McGee got as part of the IPO, which was roughly $800 million.</p>
          <p>Lots of discretion, in our opinion, by the judge as -- if he sees liability here, which we don't believe is appropriate, but if he does, how he could award damages and avoid some of the punitive-like numbers you're hearing in the press.</p>
          <p>It's worth also talking about, David, that the plaintiffs have repeatedly claimed that this is a case about the value of environmental liabilities and toxic tort liabilities. If that's true, then it would be something you need to look at what the plaintiffs' own experts have said are the estimates of those liabilities at the time of the Tronox IPO in 2005 of somewhere between $1.9 billion and $2 billion, not the $15 billion or more that's being claimed in the media. And as you would expect, our experts have a completely different view of those values, dramatically lower, in our opinion, much more realistic.</p>
          <p>I think, as Jim said earlier, we remain optimistic about our chances of prevailing in the lawsuit. We're going to vigorously defend it. But all litigation has its risks, so we'll continue to look for any reasonable settlement opportunity to remove uncertainties for our shareholders. Trial starts in May, and we look very forward to telling Kerr-McGee's side of the story to counter all of the sensational media reports. It will be the first time that our side of the story is actually told.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Bobby, just following up. So, I mean, could you put some parameters on, as to what you think your liability is top to bottom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd love to, David. I think that'd probably be in appropriate. I think I've given you enough color there that is more than anything. Certainly, we've taken a charge at this time of $525 million and that's our best estimate at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I had to ask, my job to ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask one other question outside of that and I'll jump off. Getting back to Algeria, Jim, the 2 million barrels this year, do you guys have a feel for &#x2013; or could you give us a feel for what  that impact is going to be for 2013, similar-type number, bigger type number, as far as production volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Bob Gwin. Production volumes around 5 million barrels is what we're anticipating the impact would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2013, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim mentioned the two parts here, that's from the revision of the PSA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. All right. That's all from me. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I've got a couple of questions as well, fellows, if you don't mind. Just a quick follow-up in Algeria. The guidance on the tax, leaving aside the settlement volumes, it looks like the tax rate's coming down. But because we've got a full year and only a couple of quarters, I'm not really sure what the run rate is. Could you tell us what your cash tax run rate will be in Algeria going forward post settlement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hey, Doug, this is Colglazier. I think the simplest way to do it is to go to our website where we put a pretty robust disclosure on the impacts of the amendment to the production sharing agreement. It's on the IR tab under presentations. Off to the right is the physical location of it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But to answer your questions specifically, one, we'll get the additional 1.6 million barrels as profit oil this year, another 5 million barrels next year. And then you can continue that and decline it with production going forward.</p>
          <p>On top of that, the implied TPE, production tax rate if you will, will decrease, and this will happen in the third quarter because we're still working through some inventory in the second. But in the third quarter that will drop from 30%, which is what it's been previously, down to about 18% on a go-forward basis. And then since it's &#x2013; I don't want to get into how tax is treated, but when the effective tax rate for Algeria, therefore, will decline to somewhere between 45% and 50% from the approximate 60% that it is today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That was the number I was looking for, John. Thank you. Just two further quick ones, hopefully. Caesar/Tonga, now it's on-stream. Could you just remind us what the rationale was between the scale of the production and the size of the resource because I understand Constitution is the kind of receiving facility, so to speak, but what's the prognosis for the production plateau? And would you expect to be able to increase the capacity on the Constitution over time?</p>
          <p>And I've got one final follow-up, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Doug. This is Chuck. We currently have 45,000 BOE/d online which was our peak expectation for the three wells. We intend to drill an additional well this year. And what we've done is we put our production capacity on Constitution topside and as Constitution declines, that gives us an opportunity to increase our throughput on Caesar with time.</p>
          <p>And so, we'll play the balancing game there with future wells and ultimately displace Constitution/Ticonderoga volumes with Caesar/Tonga volumes over time. And the timing of that is uncertain right now, but that's coming down the road.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And my final one, and I hate to bring this one up, but strategically, Mozambique, I mean, we've seen some very substantial value recognized now and confirmed with Cove Energy. If you look at the long-dated nature of some of the potential LNG volumes there, I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are on whether or not you believe you will also get full recognition by retaining that as an operated project with a very long-dated production profile, and I'll leave it at that. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Hey, Doug. This is Jim. As you might expect with the value that's being created there, and you rightfully referred to in terms of the Cove process, is that we have been approached by a number of companies about their interest in helping us, if you will, in Mozambique. And while we don't talk about specific transactions, that's always available to us.</p>
          <p>The thing that's very exciting here is that we've got some really great exploration wells still to drill, so that in terms of capturing value, we're still a way from the maximum value period. And it's not escaped us that as you get more long-dated in terms of the reserve life, that our investors, as with all of our NAV, would like some of that classed forward. So, we will clearly keep that in mind. But for right now, we're just thrilled about a validation stamp being put on this in terms of what this is worth and very excited about the five exploration wells we still have to drill this year.</p>

          <p>On Jubilee in Ghana, you'd highlighted in your ops review the five wells that are part of 1A and the sidetracks with the more optimal completions on the Phase I wells. Can you just give us an update on the timing of the ramp-up that you believe, when you would expect full facility capacity? And then how many 1A wells plus sidetracks that that would entail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ron, this is Chuck. Jubilee started &#x2013; the outlook for Jubilee's starting to look up. We're now producing 70,000 barrels a day and we're excited about the EBITDA that we're seeing out there at over $100 a barrel, so it's really looking good again. And what we're seeing is with the success of the sidetrack that we've had and a couple of acid jobs, that we see our way toward the peak production that was expected previously.</p>
          <p>We intend to start drilling our Phase I wells there shortly, and they will have a different completion on them, one that's taken into account the learnings of the original completions plus the sidetrack. And we look forward to seeing the production ramp up through 2013, and we'll get a lot of good value out of it with the great returns that we're having on our project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to ramp up a bit at a time. We drill a few and then complete a few, drill a few and &#x2013; so it's going to be a bit lumpy as we move up. And then we're going to be doing acid jobs in addition to that to try to recover some of the rate that we've lost from the original completions.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks. And then shifting to the Marcellus Shale, production was up nicely quarter-on-quarter. You'd previously taken up, I think at your Analyst Meeting, your EUR to 8 Bcf. Can you just characterize your backlog there?

        <plist>
          <p>Brian, This is Chuck again. I'm not sure I could actually give you a percentage of both, but we've had a number of wells both operated and non-operated that have been waiting on midstream tie-ins and completions. And that activity is still going on today, particularly in our non-op position in the Chesapeake <mark type="ph" /> area (25:53) mine where we've had a considerable  number of wells that have been waiting on just some key infrastructure tie-ins, and that's now occurring and has really built the volumes out of the Marcellus.</p>
          <p>We still have a pretty have good backlog, in the order of 100 plus wells that could be tied in. And we're &#x2013; the thing that we're doing there is really slowing down the rig activity, both non-op and operated, given the wellhead economics that we're seeing and the prices that we're realizing out there. But the machine has been built, and it's working, and it's delivering some outstanding wells. And we're just looking forward to better realizations at the wellhead.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A follow-up question to the prior question on the Marcellus. So, as you guys take rig count down in the Marcellus, should it be our expectation then that production will continue to grow given the backlog and the -- behind pipe production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our expectation, Brian, is for it to continue to grow, not substantially, it's more of an offset to our I Hub declines, as we see the midstream as well as the completions of temporarily abandoned wells come on. So, it's a growth pattern just because the wells are so strong, they have such shallow decline, high IPs and  just long plateaus. So, the underlying asset will continue to ease up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in the Marcellus, what is the minimum rigs you guys need or want to run at this point, given the leasing commitments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably in the order of 10. We have leasehold commitments in, particularly in our non-operated side. The Chesapeake, we'll continue to operate on. And then, we'll be going steadily down to around four or five rigs toward the end of the year, and that should cover us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Algeria, maybe this just wasn't clear to me, but the &#x2013; what is the sensitivity of the projected cash flows from the additional profit barrels with changing commodity prices? So, would your &#x2013; my question is, would cash flows change if crude prices were higher or lower than your expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, it's Al Walker. I think the short answer to that question's yes. But it doesn't make that particular production unique. There, the Sahara Blend is a premium to the Brent, so you're getting a further premium to WTI. And so, as you look at Algeria going forward, I think you just need to appreciate that we have a very attractive commodity that's being produced at a premium price to Brent, and that, therefore, it does have some volatility if we see Brent in this particular benchmark here back up or move back towards WTI. But I don't think it's unique from the sense that Algeria is something that &#x2013; a place that produces in a way that anything else in our portfolio might not produce the same way. As an example, in China, in the first quarter, you saw us have realizations of the wellhead there approaching $130 a barrel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask it differently. I was talking more just on the additional profit barrels. So, if &#x2013; say, if crude prices drop, do you get more...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, let me ask you this, are you referring to the settlement barrels for which we are recovering $1.8 billion, or are you talking about the amendment to the production-sharing agreement where we have a lower TPE going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking about mainly the additional recoverable barrels, the first part of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That $1.8 billion, I think John described that well, that's a value barrel, so when we recover $1.8 billion, whatever the price environment, we'll deliver barrels related to recovery of that amount. So, the barrels really don't matter as much as recovering the dollar amount of $1.8 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I was looking for. Thanks. Because it was my understanding that you're going to still recover it, sort of, in a barrel fashion, but thanks for the clarification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. And it'll come through future listings &#x2013; liftings over the next 12 months, and John's given you good guidance, I think, on what we anticipate that to be this year and next. And as we &#x2013; whatever the price environment is, once we get to that $1.8 billion, then those liftings for the settlement barrels will go away, and we're only dealing with the TPE barrels to produce &#x2013; be produced going forward.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Another shale question. In the East Texas &#x2013; well, actually not shales maybe, but East Texas, the horizontal program, what is the gas/oil or liquid/gas mix in the wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Subash, this is Chuck. There's two different plays, one is the Cotton Valley, the other is the Haynesville. They have pretty similar characteristics that, they make some condensate in the order of 10 to 20 barrels of one million. And then the big uplift that we have is NGL volumes from both, and they range from 50 to 100 barrels per million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. So, I guess, should we see the dry gas component &#x2013; the associated gas component of East Texas rise as you drill this program out or will that &#x2013; or will it be offset by natural declines in the dry gas component?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're talking about the residual gas after processing and you should see it &#x2013; you should see it rise slightly with time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the Gulf of Mexico and completions, you talked about Caesar/Tonga, I guess that's to sort of keep production flat. Are there any other completions expected in the Gulf this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had an additional completion on our Nansen project, number 14, that came on at about 1,500 barrels a day and around 40 million cubic feet a day, which is really heavy liquids once we separate those out. And then we have a rig program in Marco Polo that is dominated by oil rig completions. And we're also doing work at &#x2013; I'm sorry, Constitution and Ticonderoga, from re-completes and stimulations at those wells.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Constitution, Ticonderoga. Got you. And just two more, if I could. In Mozambique, there's the oil area, I guess, will you participate in that license round or is your primary focus at this point just going to be the gas that you've identified so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Subash, it's Bob Daniels. We're paying attention to all the licensing rounds up and down the East African Coast, Tanzania, Kenya and Mozambique. And if something looks interesting to us, we'll weigh it against what's in our portfolio. Regarding the oil, we think that we still have good potential on the southern portion of our block, and we'll be testing that later in the year with our Barracuda and Black Pearl prospects, which will be on either side of the Ironclad well that we drilled early in the exploration campaign. So, we still think that we have potential for liquids down in the South. I'm just excited to get those tested later this year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. And one final one if I could on Tronox again. The &#x2013; so, if I heard correctly, I think there was, in characterizing liability, there was a $1.5 billion to $2 billion number you might have quoted as the actual environmental liability that was cited by the plaintiffs. And my question was, if I heard that correctly, how much of that has previously been paid out by Tronox?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bobby again. Let me clarify what you heard was plaintiff's expert reports on value of the environmental contingencies at the time of the Tronox IPO. There &#x2013; that's not necessarily the damages that are claimed, but I think it's a good measure for what's really being fought over here as compared to the punitive amounts that are being carried about in the media.</p>
          <p>I don't have readily available what's been paid in environmental liabilities. There &#x2013; the Tronox litigation trust did receive several hundred million as part of the bankruptcy reorganization. That included some cash and real estate as well. So, there were some dollars that they received as part of the Tronox bankruptcy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that second settlement, the settlement you've done in a second case, I think, with the debt holders, security holders at Tronox, it looks like it's absolutely a different path than this settlement. I was curious if there was any sort of relationship here that could be drawn from the other settlement in a different court?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't believe so. I think those are totally different claims. It certainly relates to the bankruptcy at Tronox, as you would imagine any sort of class action that would come after such event. The amounts were not material and were totally offset by insurance, so not a big deal there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. In the Gulf of Mexico, you all tied in Cheyenne East recently. When you look at Independence Hub, I mean, what should we expect in terms of, like, production progression here over the next couple of years? And correct me if I'm wrong, but you aren't really drilling any more gas wells around that at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Chuck, <mark type="ph" /> Ian (36:43). We're not currently drilling any more gas wells around I Hub. The project's done great. It's made over a Tcf. And it paid out very quickly. And we continue to use that asset base for cash flow, as you would expect. We had a very quick tie-in opportunity that we started several years ago in Cheyenne East. And the ball was rolling, and the commitments remained, so we went ahead and finished it off. What I see happening out there, the Hub's currently making around <mark type="ph" /> $400 million (37:15) a day. We're going to see the natural declines of those wells and many of the wells are big wells, $50-plus-million-a-day wells. And as they water out, you see these large declines in a very quick time. And the Hub has a life of two or three years left on the original production in some of the wells, like Cheyenne H that we just drilled, probably has a four- or five-year life, that you'll see just the steady natural declines take place. And we have a lot of additional opportunities out there should gas prices recover, but until then we won't be drilling any additional wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And all that's reflected in our guidance, what Chuck just spoke to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, when you look at like a new drill-out there, I mean what gas price makes that economic? Obviously the Hub itself is there and remind me of the well cost, is it like $50 million to $60 million per well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in that order of magnitude, if you add completions, it's a little bit more than that. So, you need some really good gas prices for 30 bcf to 40-bcf-type completions and today they're just not there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And one other question, just in general on guidance. Obviously you get about 1.6 million barrels from Algeria, and then you beat the quarter by the midpoint about 2 MMBOE instead about 3.6 MMBOE, I'm sorry 3.6 MMBOE of potential upside to your prior guidance, but you raised it by 2 MMBOE. Is it some of that related to kind of conservatism given what may happen on the natural gas side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Scott, there's two things really. The first thing you need to consider is the fact that we're selling properties like South Texas, we did the EOR JV, so that will cut into our production that we've seen. At the same time, our shales and other assets are growing so you have that benefit. Caesar/Tonga will be online for a full quarter.</p>
          <p>What we haven't done is really putting a lot &#x2013; put the gas volumes through to the future guidance because we continue to believe at these kind of wellhead prices, you'll see some curtailments through time. You'll see people not go back in and resurrect production if it was to have an issue. So, we've been fairly conservative with our gas guidance, just with the anticipation of poor wellhead realizations will result in lower production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify one point you mentioned there. So, the recent asset sales you had, that was not already in the prior guidance? Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, it's Bob Gwin. It was. We provided that at the Investor Conference, the total of those three, the EOR, the Pompano and the South Texas, as Jim mentioned, was about 3 million barrels of 2011 production. And so, those assets are either closed or in the process of closing. So, some production from those assets was included in the first quarter, but it's fully baked and had been baked into the annual guidance.</p>

          <p>Well, in the areas where you have rig growth like Wattenberg and Maverick and probably up in the Bakken, you're still seeing price pressures. In the assets where we have, like the Bone Springs, Avalon, Haynesville and our other GNB, that type of asset, we have some opportunity to reduce those costs. We've taken advantage of those opportunities, and we reflected those in the operating reports. I think you'll see continued pressure, downward pressure in those type of assets. I think there'll be regional differences in the really hot plays where resources, both completion and other assets like trucks, et cetera, are very scarce right now and the demand is high, so the prices are up there with them.</p>
          <p>But we're going to continue to work our areas and I think we've established ourselves sort of as the 800 pound gorilla in many cases in these plays. And our pace is what dictates the pace of the basin and therefore, we have some pricing leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the completion of drilling efficiencies more than make up for these cost pressures that we see even in the hot areas, which is handy. So we're beating down the cost in other areas.</p>

          <p>That's good. I appreciate that. Just a brief follow-up on Tronox &#x2013; not here to kind of beat a dead horse, and your statements are very helpful. But the loss contingency, up from the last quarter, I just presume that reflects current negotiations with the plaintiffs and kind of like exploration, this is some risk version of potential outcome based upon state-of-the-art discussions?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Then maybe just one last question. Wattenberg also operationally great year, but can you discuss any material constraints to growth or any bottlenecks related to either takeaway or a processing capacity here in, at least in just 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a great asset, a growing asset, and we've really pushed up the volumes. Jim mentioned, I believe, is over 80,000 barrels a day of volumes now. There's several things that we've undertaken to make sure we eliminate any constraints that we see that are foreseeable, which include an additional plant, processing plant, called our Lancaster plant, that Jim mentioned.</p>
          <p>We've also subscribed to some NGL takeaway capacity down, to get product all the way down to Mont Belvieu which will be beneficial for us. And aside from that, we're essentially just stepping up the rigs in concert with any constraints that we see with regard to land clearances or right-of-way clearances of permitting. And as those are overtaken, we continue to ramp up rigs. We originally anticipated ramping up to seven rigs by year-end. We're already there. And so, the process is working good. The machine is starting to spin well. And you're seeing our volumes ramp up accordingly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Real quickly, over in the Utica, when you look at sort of the production composition or mix, does that create any anxieties with respect to ability to get production online and delivered over time due to high BTU content or liquids content, or has that all have been planned for ahead of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, this is Chuck again. Actually, the things we're seeing is predominantly oil related, it's a liquid-rich environment, but most of this is actually oil. We do have liquids in our gas, and our midstream team is working through solutions to handle it. The volumes are not so great that we can't readily handle this and deliver it to markets. And there's an opportunity to use our current infrastructure to handle the volumes that we have. And so, we're feeling very comfortable about the gas side of this. Of course, we can handle the oil easily and get it trucked to market. So, we don't really foresee a big problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's a helpful clarification. And then, with respect to your comments earlier about being a little conservative with gas guidance and the performance you guys have seen today, can you talk a little bit about it, is that potential gas that could be curtailed, is that more driven with production growth from associated gas, or production that's tied to traditional natural gas wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's natural gas wells, dry gas wells. We were anticipating additional curtailments some of the Northern Rockies production <mark type="ph" /> CBM (46:22) and those type of areas, as well as the Marcellus, in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just one clarification, I mean, with your guidance, it shows that kind of gas production is certainly tapering. Is there a point as you redirect activity towards more liquids-rich areas but that have decent associated gas content, that we'll actually see an increase in gas production on a corporate level just due to associated gas production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Al. Let me try to answer that. Probably one of the biggest variables we face as we provide guidance is what the outside-operated properties are going to do. And I think, as you think about looking at us, we're pretty conservative in what we assume others will actually do. And consequently, as we move quarter-to-quarter ourselves, we're sometimes surprised by what our outside-operated properties will do. And so, consequently, our ability to true that up as we go through the year, to some extent is where that variable is coming from, and that's not as easy as you might imagine for us to predict as for our own operated properties.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of John Malone with Global Hunter. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick international questions. On Golfinho, when do you expect to spud that Mozambique? What's the timing of it? And then this being, I believe, distinct from Prosperidade, so what's your idea of resources in that part, the Northern part of Area 1, resource potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John. This is Bob Daniels. Golfinho is actually spud, and so we figured it'll be about a 60-day well, something like that. With the last couple of wells out here, though, we've been really drilling them fast. I think our drilling group has just done a phenomenal job of understanding what they have to do to get these wells down. It is -- the objective of Golfinho is the same sand system that we see over at the Prosperidade Complex up to the north and west of it. We see a potential that it could be an extension of that, but we also see a potential that it could be its own accumulation. And so, that's what we need to get out there and test and see if we get &#x2013; we have the hydrocarbon there and then also what the pressures are and whether there may be a relationship between the two.</p>
          <p>That will be followed up with Atum, which is very similar, testing another sand system up in the north and west of the Prosperidade Complex and then followed by Orca, which will be testing a  lower sand package that we've seen some hydrocarbons in in the Prosperidade Complex beneath the thrush sheets. So, we've got a very good exploratory program going to the North and it should be back-to-back, Golfinho, Atum, Orca.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to clarify that, and you're not seeing anything <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:14) that would indicate either? You think it's possible that this could be 50 miles away but still an extension of the bigger complex that you've found so far, Golfinho?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a possibility. I don't think it's the most likely outcome, but it is a possibility when you look at the &#x2013; all the data that we have in there, and you look at the continuity of these sand packages, these are very, very significant sand packages and seem to be very laterally continuous which we proved from our DSTs out there. So, there is a possibility of that, but we think that the higher likelihood is that it's a independent accumulation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then just on Brazil, can you elaborate a little bit as to what the government is doing with the unitization, what it's going to take to get that sales process moving again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Bob again. On Brazil, we've got a couple of wells that we drilled and that we're going to drill this year. We've got another Wahoo well to drill and a couple up in the Esp&#xED;rito Santo's basin. And the Itaipu is the area that they're talking about unitization. We've got a couple of wells in it, looking at drilling a third and potentially a DST on that. And that is potentially in communication with their Whale Park area to the north and west of it which is on production in the pre-salt, and so I'll let Bob Gwin then talk about the implications of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The unitization discussions obviously are being handled by the operators, so we defer to them on questions around unitization. From our perspective, unitization could change expectations around the asset with regard to capital or cash flow production. Obviously, the timing of each of those things, those have effects potentially, we don't know, but potentially material effects from the valuation of the asset. And accordingly, we need to do the analysis and let the process run its course before we're able to assess how it might affect our views on valuation or the timing of our process. Obviously, not only do we need to do such analysis, but potential purchasers will need to do that as well, work it into their cases as they &#x2013; we would expect, would then rebid.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and great quarter. I'd like to ask a little bit more about the Utica. And I know it's early days on wells, 30 days on your best well out there, but how is the pressure holding up there? It seems to me we're seeing declines start to slow in that well. Good thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, this is Bob Daniels. We like what we're seeing to date, but it's very, very early. We've got a couple &#x2013; three wells on production now. The best one was the third of that group. We think that we're going to have to evaluate them longer term to see &#x2013; to answer the question that you're asking as to how they're going to hold up.</p>
          <p>And then we also think that at some point because of the liquids &#x2013; high-liquids content that we have out here, that we may have to put artificial lift on these and really see what they can deliver because, of course, the first two had fairly low gas content relative to some of the others in the area, very high oil content. And so, to really get a good sense of what they will deliver, ultimately, we may have to have artificial lift and just watch them for a while.</p>
          <p>Of course, we've got a rig out there we're continuing to drill. We've got our fourth well that we're completing. The fifth is being drilled and we will continue with that program. Typical of what we do in these shales is pilot programs around our acreage position and put them online and evaluate the results before we decide where to kick off a development program if it's called for.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you kind of answered my question because I didn't see enough gas for gas lift. I mean, are you &#x2013; is the gas-oil ratio the right ratio for a potential gas-oil lift? Is it sufficient enough at this point, you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first two wells had about 1,000 GOR, is what we're seeing to-date. And that would not be enough at this point. As we move farther to the south and east, you get higher gas content and more energy from the gas. What we're really looking at is what are the economics of the oil versus liquids-rich gas versus the dry gas. And that's what we're paying attention to, as to how these wells are going to perform and then what it means in the way of returns to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has there been any change after three wells, now a fourth, in your completion design? Are you doing them all the same at the moment? When would you vary up that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We try to learn from every one of them. The first well was our shortest lateral. We've increased the length of our laterals. And then we've been tweaking the numbers and types of frac stages we've been putting on. And each one of those seeing how they respond. The most recent well will be our longest lateral, the fifth well that we've drilled. So, we're just testing all the different ideas out there as we move geographically to see where the best areas are, and then what the best way to get the hydrocarbons out of the rock is.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a very small area. Actually, the first two are on the same pad. The third well was a step-out down to the south and east a little bit, about, I don't know, three or four miles. And then the fourth well's a little bit farther to the southwest. We haven't even stepped off to the north some significant distance. That'll come very shortly as we get past the wintertime where we were kind of restricted on where we could build locations and move equipment.</p>

But with respect to Clean Water Act fines and penalties, there's really been no activity there. We still believe we have the right case there, that we're not culpable.

If you could provide an update as to where you stand on that production figure now, that'd be great. And the follow-up to that is, realizing that the area in the East Texas horizontal is localized in your drilling structural highs, do you see a potential to &#x2013; or are you still seeing any potential to nudge up the number of drill sites there or are you in a situation now that the development teams feel like you're kind of tapped out in that regard?</p>

          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my call &#x2013; or my question, rather. I actually have two questions. First, touching on the Wattenberg, I think an earlier person asked about how the logistics are going. But I was wondering if you could talk about the other side of that, which would be the results you're getting out of there. And I know that you guys gave us a lot of detail in March. But also, that there's kind of new things being turned over there all the time. So, I was wondering if you could give us an update on what you're seeing kind of from the reservoir in the different horizons there.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charles, we're continuously &#x2013; just outstanding results from Wattenberg. Our production has climbed up. That's how the 80,000 barrels happened. It's over 10,000 barrels a day up from when we came out with the Wattenberg discussion six months or so ago. So, it's increasing very quickly. We're drilling both Niobrara and Codell wells, and they're both performing extraordinarily well.</p>
          <p>And I think the coolest thing to me is we're seeing great results across the field area, the field area proper, from east to west to north to south, and our neighbors are having great results. So, your &#x2013; this thing's working, and it's working in a big way, and we're pushing up the volumes. And they have good economics. They have great wellhead realizations. And we can do it at very low cost. So, the equation is about as good as it gets.</p>

So, I was wondering when &#x2013; what's your expectation of how many days is it going to take to drill and when should we kind of expect to see something there in the way of results?</p>
