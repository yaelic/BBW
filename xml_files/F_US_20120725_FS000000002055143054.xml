          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter Ford Motor Company Fixed Income Conference Call. My name is Katina and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question and answer session towards the end of the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And as a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Molly Tripp, Manager, Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katina, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Michael Seneski, Ford Credit Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. We also have some other members of management who are joining us for the call, including Stuart Rowley, Ford's Vice President and Controller; Marion Harris, Assistant Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Global Accounting; and George Sharp, Executive Director, Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to review a few items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media website for your reference. The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our Annual, Quarterly and Current Reports.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit CFO, Michael Seneski. Michael?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Molly. Consistent with last quarter, today's presentation will cover Ford Credit's profit and credit loss performance, Ford Credit funding and liquidity highlights, Automotive cash, debt and liquidity and then we'll wrap things up with a summary of the quarter.</p>
          <p>So, let's start off with Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide two. Ford Credit had another strong quarter with pre-tax profit of $438 million and net income of $296 million. Managed receivables were $86 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $1 billion from year end 2011 and equal to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>When it comes to credit losses, we've had several consecutive quarters at or near historic lows. Second quarter charge offs were $17 million, down $49 million from last year and the loss receivables ratio was 8 basis points. At June 30, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $406 million or 47 basis points of receivables. We paid distributions of $100 million in the second quarter and $300 million year-to-date. Managed leverage was 8.1:1 at June 30, 2012, compared to 8.3:1 at December 31, 2011. And at end of second quarter our equity was $9.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide three shows $166 million decrease in second quarter pre-tax results compared with a year ago by causal factor. The results are more than explained by fewer lease terminations, which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain and lower financing margin. The decline financing margin is explained primarily by the runoff of higher yielding assets originated in prior years. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pre-tax profit decreased by $14 million compared with the first quarter.</p>
          <p>For full year 2012, Ford Credit continues to project full year pre-tax profit of about $1.5 billion and total distributions to the parent of between $500 million and $1 billion. Ford Credit now projects managed receivables at year end to be in the range of $85 billion $90 billion and managed leverage of 8:1 to 9:1 for the foreseeable future. This is a decrease from the prior mid-decade target of 10:1 to 11:1 and is consistent with the goal of maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet. Lower leverage will result in a reduction in our mid-decade return target from low double-digits to high single-digits.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide four, this shows our quarterly trends of charge-offs, loss-to-receivables ratios, and credit loss reserve. Our second quarter credit losses continue to be at historically low levels. Charge-offs were $17 million, down $32 million from the same period a year ago, reflecting lower repossessions in the United States. Charge-offs were down $18 million from the first quarter 2012, reflecting the same factor just mentioned.</p>
          <p>The credit loss reserve was $406 million, down $267 million from a year ago and down $73 million from the first quarter of 2012, reflecting the decrease in charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Slide five shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. Retail and Lease Business, which comprises approximately 70% of our consumer portfolio. Over 60-day delinquencies were 13 basis points in the second quarter, equal to the same period a year ago. Repossessions in the second quarter were 7,000 units, or 1.19% of average accounts outstanding, down 52 basis points from the same period a year ago.</p>
          <p>Severity of $6,700 in the second quarter was up $200 from the same period a year ago but equal to the first quarter. As discussed on the prior slide, the charge-offs and the LTRs have declined on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis due to lower repossessions.</p>
          <p>Slide six shows the U.S. Lease residual performance. As we've been highlighting for the past several quarters, Lease return volumes in the second quarter were 40% lower than the same period last year, reflecting primarily the lower Lease placements in 2009. The second quarter Lease return rate was 59%, up 4 percentage points compared with the same period last year, reflecting a higher mix of 24 month contracts, which typically have higher return rates than longer-term contracts.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, our auction values for 36-month vehicles declined by $325 per unit from the same period last year. Compared with the first quarter, our 24-month and 36-month auction value performance was mixed.</p>
          <p>Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $12.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from $11.1 billion at year-end 2011.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide seven, the big news this quarter was that Ford and Ford Credit were upgraded to investment grade by both Fitch and Moody's. It is an important proof point of our continued progress the team is making with our One Ford plan. In addition to the release of collateral securing Ford's revolving credit facility, the second investment grade triggered the exchange of Ford Credit's FUEL notes for unsecured notes.</p>
          <p>We are on track to achieve our 2012 funding plan. In the second quarter, we completed $5.5 billion of funding in the public markets and an additional $1.6 billion in July. We have completed $15.3 million of public term funding year-to-date. During the quarter, we issued our first public investment grade unsecured debt transaction since 2005. Our funding strategy remains focused on diversification, and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels and investors.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with about $33 billion of committed capacity, renewing about $10 billion in the second quarter, including renewal of our 364 day FCAR facility. Our liquidity remains strong and we will maintain cash balances and committed capacity to meet our business and funding requirements in all global market conditions. Moving forward we are focused on achieving and maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide eight, which shows the trends in funding of our managed receivables.  At the end of the second quarter, managed receivables were $86 billion. We ended the quarter with $11 billion in cash and securitized funding was 48% of managed receivables, which reflects the FUEL note exchange. Since the first quarter review, we have narrowed the year-end 2012 managed receivables to a range of $85 billion to $90 billion. The change reduces the upper end of the range reflecting uncertainty in Europe. Securitized funding is expected to represent about 49% of total managed receivables at the end of the year. It is our expectation that securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables will decline going forward.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows our 2012 public term funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term funding programs. Year to-date, we have completed $15 billion of public term funding in the U.S., Canada and Europe, including about $6 billion of unsecured debt. This reflects well over half of our public term funding needs for the year. We project full year public term funding in the range of $20 billion to $24 billion consisting of $8 billion to $10 billion of unsecured debt and $12 billion to $14 billion of public securitizations. The public securitization range is up about $2 billion from the first quarter reflecting a shift from private ABS to public ABS as a result of the success we have had in the public markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10, our liquidity remains strong at $21.6 billion, up about $3.5 billion from the prior quarter. The increase primarily reflects lower conduit utilization and the FUEL note exchange. We expect liquidity to reduce between now and year-end closer to the level we reported in the first quarter. Ford Credit sources of liquidity include cash, unsecured credit facilities, our FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines and asset-backed bank capacity. As of June 30, we had $44 billion of cash and committed liquidity sources, down slightly from the first quarter, reflecting lower cash and FCAR lines, offset partially by increases in conduit facilities. Utilization of our liquidity totaled $18.4 billion at quarter end, down $3.9 billion from the first quarter, primarily reflecting lower usage of our private capacity.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with gross liquidity of $25.6 billion, which includes about $4 billion of capacity in excess of eligible receivables, providing funding sources for future origination and flexibility to transfer capacity among different asset classes and markets. Our liquidity remains strong and we are focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet our business and funding requirements in all global market conditions.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 summarizes our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the second quarter. Automotive debt was $14.2 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $13.7 billion at the end of the first quarter, reflecting additional draw downs of low cost loans for advanced technology. We will make our last draw on these loans in August, with repayments beginning in September.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.5 billion and Automotive liquidity of $33.9 billion, both increased when compared to prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's close with a summary of the second quarter and I'm now on slide 12. Ford delivered our 12th consecutive quarterly pre-tax operating profit, which was $1.8 billion. Net income was about $1 billion. Ford also generated positive operating related cash flow and ended the quarter with Automotive net cash of $9.5 billion and liquidity of $33.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Ford and Ford Credit returned to Investment grade with upgrades from Fitch and Moody's during the quarter. As a result, collateral securing Ford revolving credit facility was released and Ford Credit's FUEL notes were exchanged for new unsecured notes.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit had a strong second quarter with pre-tax profit of $438 million. Managed receivables at the end of the quarter were $86 billion and credit losses continued at historically low levels. Year-to-date Ford Credit has completed $15 billion in funding, well over half of our public term funding needs for the year. Ford Credit's liquidity was about $22 billion for the quarter, which is in addition to Ford's liquidity of about $34 billion.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit continues to support Ford's business with $100 million in distributions during the quarter. Total distributions for 2012 are still expected to be between $500 million and $1 billion.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Molly to begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Neil. With that we'll start the question-and-answer session. Katrina can we please have the first question.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker>
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question comes from the line of Mark Altherr representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. What was the change in the leverage driven by since Ford Motor Credit and Ford are effectively combined for rating agency purposes, was that maybe driven by the one rating agency comment about the standalone credit quality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually thank you for asking that. As you know, as we've said in the past we believe the underlying quality of our assets support actually a significantly higher leverage than what we've been running at. However, we do like to look at our business separately and when compared with the competition and our goal to have a strong investment grade balance sheet versus just BBB-, we believe that this is a prudent move and is consistent with where we want to be in the future. So for the foreseeable future we'll be between 8:1 and 9:1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And great loss experience there, is that going to drive any loosening of your credit standards maybe to bump up your share of overall Ford business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I appreciate that, but our underwriting standards have remained remarkably consistent. I wish I could explain why customers are paying the bills, an 8 basis point LTR is something we've never really seen before in the past, but we continue to underwrite three out of every four subprime customers who buy a Ford vehicle are financed by Ford Credit, that hasn't changed and we expect that to continue going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Doug Karson representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, guys. Thank you for being in the queue here. One of my questions kind of focuses on something that was chatted on the call earlier, I'm not sure if it's out of scope but it was regarding Europe capacity utilization, there have been kind of some reports that with kind of contradictory information, some had said that capacity utilization in Ford Europe is high and some in the 60% area. I'm just not clear on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Doug, thank you. This is Stuart Rowley. I think Alan responded to the question. You're correct, there are numbers being quoted in the media and we're refraining from quoting capacity utilization numbers. There are many different ways to measure capacity utilization, whether it be on a two shift basis or three shift basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the installed or manned capacity, so it can be somewhat confusing to make comparisons. What we did confirm is clearly given the downturn in Europe, industry volumes are at a lowest level since the mid-1990s, and as a result it's very clear that we have excess capacity. So that is clear, as does the industry as a whole. But we're not quoting specific numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess the concept would be is that capacity unchangeable in the intermediate term given the environment there and the unions and the issues surrounding some of those countries where capacity is underutilized or just going to have to have volume grow to get the capacity back in the right area? Like how do we fix that, is it fixable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as Bob commented in a call earlier, we do view the situation in Europe as being structural and not cyclical in nature. That's how we think about it and we have our plan, a key element of our plan is to match production to demand and as we said we're reviewing all parts of our business, but we don't have anything cash specific to share further today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we do we'll communicate with all stakeholders at the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And back to Ford Credit &#x2013; thank you for that answer. Ford Credit, I'm looking at Appendix 5 of 7, that's got Ford Credit operational highlights and we have a Europe line item that looks like contract placement volume was 104,000, which was about flat, you are actually up year-over-year. I mean how has Ford Credit done in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, it's actually, we've been doing very well there. If you think about it from a share and contract perspective, you can see that we continue to work closer and closer with the Motor Company, have improved our share year-over-year. From a credit quality perspective, we continue to be at or near historic lows. Just to give you a couple of data points, all of the big five markets showed improved 60-day delinquencies, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Their version of the repossession ratio improved both year-over-over and quarter-over-quarter for all the big five except for Italy, which was a very small movement. And overall losses were down 32% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. So all the metrics there for the portfolio are continuing to perform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. All right. I think that's it for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Doug -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Doug, just on the funding side, I think the other piece of the balance sheet, we continue to renew the capacity. It's a market that, other than the Sterling deal we did earlier in the year, has been a market dominated by ABS because that's the market that continues to be cost effective for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're renewing capacity as it comes due. So, so far so good on that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So liquidity is good there, too. Okay. Excellent.  All right. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Eric Selle representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. A couple of housekeeping things. You guys had the variance in North America, there was an other of $200 million. Could you guys give us the big stuff in that number? There was a positive variance in other just year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Eric. Stuart Rowley here. Obviously, given a business of the size, there are a number of other items that you get a large number of small items in there, but a couple of key pieces in that were improved results in our FCSD business year-on-year and some improvement in our ACH business, lower losses, and other component-related improvements. So, those two things accounted for about half of it, the other half -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OSC.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; there is a raft of other minor items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And then on the cash slides, another other of $600 million coming in, can you guys kind of give me the big components of that as well? It was right before cash before other actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yes, there's one significant item in there which was release of a cash collateral related to our business in Kaioba. That was the one major thing and there were also some affiliate transfers coming into the Automotive business related to OPEB obligations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And don't mean to be anal, but you guys are giving kind of a $9.5 billion equity year-end estimate for Ford Credit, EBT's going to be around $600 million, dividends to Ford are going to be around $400 million, that gets you about halfway there. Is there anything I'm missing or it's just kind of rounding error or am I being too anal on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I think the dividends, Eric, are going to be somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion, so that's kind of you're movement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Yeah, for the year, right.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's about &#x2013; I was just talking back half, your guidance for earnings is like $600 million EBT and then backing out that $750 million midrange there is about $400 million in dividends in the back half alone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that would put you to the middle of the range and then, as we've said, our leverage will fall out somewhere in the eight to nine range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's what I'm missing. And then you guys had a comment -I think Shanks had a comment of earlier today he said Asia, Europe ended the quarter slightly better. It was an interview, obviously, didn't hear it. I didn't hear that on the first call. I mean is it slightly better on incentives or are the competitors acting more rational towards the end? Are we getting better foot traffic? Or is &#x2013; am I reading into a quote on Bloomberg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The &#x2013; I think Bob was &#x2013; this is Stuart Rowley, again, Eric. Bob was referring to, we came out slightly better in those two regions. In our actual close, there was a raft of items, many small items, obviously exchange rates at the final close vary from what we're forecasting. So nothing materially significant of itself. We just had a strong close in those operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's really referencing, Eric, the interview he did back the end of June, which said that the international affiliates were going to lose about three times what they lost in the first quarter, and it was 190 in the first quarter. And so the better than was referencing the fact that it wasn't as bad as we thought it was going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And then this is kind of a broader brush question and it's meant to be an offhanded compliment, but you guys are investment grade. You guys could hit the market &#x2013; our market's wide open. You guys, you're generating cash under below trend volumes, you're a cash flow machine, and your focus is paying down debt. If I look at your capital structure, I would argue one of the best returns is potentially buying back stock. Why wouldn't you guys now look to that stock being so depressed on a multiple basis, obviously given your restructuring efforts &#x2013; has a very bright future in my mind. Why wouldn't you use some of that excess liquidity and take advantage of this here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's a broad question there on the overall capital strategy and we've got a lot of things that we want to do with pension contributions, with funding the business and the growth, continuing to pay the dividends that we started and I think we will continue to evaluate sort of the trade-offs on how that all works from a standpoint of which actions we take when. But at this time we really don't have anything to add to what we're already doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sounds good. And I always appreciate your time. It was a good quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys. I just have a few housekeeping items and then one kind of bigger picture question. I'll start out with the big picture question. It was kind of touched on in the earlier call, but obviously comment around a potential for a plant closure in Europe was made a few weeks back, and I mean at what point do you guys feel you have to decide whether you'll need to actually close a plant or not? I mean is there a timeframe that you feel that kind of you'll update the market on that or is this something that you're still kind of assessing and it could be a year from now, it could six months from now? Any type of color there would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this is Stuart Rowley. So to answer that first question, we shared &#x2013; we haven't made any specific comments around plants, and as Bob Shanks described in the call earlier we're reviewing all parts of our business. We do view the issues in Europe as being structural in nature and not cyclical but we don't have anything further to share at this point in time and we are not providing any timeline for that. We will, of course, though communicate any plans when the time is appropriate and we'll do that with all of the stakeholders involved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a few of the housekeeping items, just you've lowered the target leverage to eight to nine times for the Credit business, is there the potential here, are you going to change the support agreement at all or is that still based on an 11.5 times leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this stage, Brian, I don't see us changing a support agreement. We're just changing our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the guidance. And then pension versus paying down DoE loans, I mean, I would think that your cash flow, you would probably peg towards more to the pension, because de-risking and so forth and given the rate on the DoE loans is so low but I mean, can you kind of give us &#x2013; is there any type of preference there for where future cash flow will go when you're kind of looking at debt items and deciding between pension and DoE? I mean, I would have to think it's pension.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think we would agree with you on the fact that pension clearly is a higher priority versus the DoE loans. We're making the final draw on the DoE loan this month, so it will be done in August, and then per the agreement we actually start paying it down, amortizing it over the next 10 years, starting in September by quarter. And so that'll just happen naturally. The average rate on it is less that 2.5%, so it's very, very cheap long-term debt, which we would intend to keep and continue to work the balance sheet, both on the other debt as well as pensions as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last housekeeping question, can you break out how much &#x2013; what the DoE loan was, the Ex-Im and the EIB loans were separately for us? Is there any chance can you do that now or is that something...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the quarter or in total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What the actual balance was at the end of the quarter for each?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The end of the second quarter the DoE loan was $5.8 billion. And if you recall, from the very beginning we had an allocated amount of $5.9 billion, so there's another $100 million to draw in the third quarter. And I think the Ex-Im loan outstanding was about $250 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about, do we have an EIB number? We could do it offline &#x2013; it's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let us get back to you on that, but I think I have the &#x2013; I think it's like &#xA3;400 million &#x2013; dollars, yeah. So, it's about &#xA3;400 million.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
