          <p>Thank you, Jose, and good morning to everyone from sunny St. Louis. I would like to welcome you to Monsanto's second quarter earnings conference call. And I am joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; and by Terry Crews, our CFO; and by Laura Meyer and Bryan Hurley, my colleagues in investor relations.</p>
          <p>Given both our second quarter results and our revised ongoing full year guidance, this is shaping up to be another year of expectational growth for Monsanto. Importantly, the results here today are milestones that propel our growth through 2012.</p>
          <p>This morning, Terry will spend some time reviewing our gross profit and gross margin results and outlook, and Hugh will take that financial look a step further to track our 2008 progress against our 2012 commitments.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we are webcasting this call and you can access it at Monsanto's website at monsanto.com, the replay is also available at that address. For those of you who would like to go to our website, the slides for this call are posted on the Investor Information page. The page numbers are on the bottom right hand side of each slide.</p>
          <p>We are providing you with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. In those cases where we referred a non-GAAP financial measures, we've provided you with a reconciliation to the GAAP measures on the last slide and in the earnings press release.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that this call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language contained in our most recent 10-Q and today's press release.</p>
          <p>I would like to start by asking you to reference slide four. Ongoing EPS for the quarter increased by 81% to $1.79 per share. If you move to slide five, you will see this gain reflected a 45% increase in total revenues and a 54% increase in gross profit with Seeds and Genomics gross profit up 37% while Roundup increased more than 200%. Margins overall for the quarter were higher reflecting strong demand, prices and volumes around the world and across the portfolio.</p>
          <p>The growth in seeds and traits underscores the trends that set the stage for Monsanto's long-term success. Notably in the quarter, the 39% increase in seeds and traits revenue reflect stronger prices, market share gains and increased trait penetration. This was partially offset by the cost of goods effect of higher commodity prices for some seed production particularly in soybeans. This cost of goods effect make year-over-year margins in seeds and traits were down one point. For the full year, we would anticipate that margins for the seeds and traits segment will be flat although corn margins are expected to be up by one percentage point.</p>
          <p>The second quarter also reflected the expansion of the Roundup franchise with price and volume up globally with some smaller benefit from currency. In the U.S., we saw larger branded volumes than we have historically, as we sold more branded Roundup and as our customers purchase more product in the second quarter than they have historically to secure supply and price in the tight market. For the full year, we would expect U.S. and global volumes to be up because of organic growth and branded volumes to be a larger part of the overall mix.</p>
          <p>These same trends led the ongoing EPS for the first half reaching $2.25, an increase of 94%. As a result of this strong performance through the first half of the year, and our line of sight through year-end, we raised our fiscal year 2008 guidance last year to $3.15 to $3.25 for ongoing EPS, growth of well over 50% compared with 2007 ongoing earnings.</p>
          <p>To reach this target, seeds and traits' gross profit will need to grow 20% or more to be in the range of 3.6 to 3.7 billion, while the Roundup franchise will have to deliver 1.8 &#x2013; 1.7 to 1.8 billion in gross profits.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow for the year-to-date was just under 1.5 billion, reflecting both earnings growth and a higher than usual level of prepayments for Roundup. This was exclusive of the planned acquisition of the De Ruiter vegetable seed business, which we announced on Monday and would hope to close before the end of this calendar year. It is inclusive, however, of the 163 million in cash we received in the second quarter as remuneration for our claim in the Solutia bankruptcy settlement.</p>
          <p>So, with that short overview, I would like to turn the call over to Terry, who will go further in depth in our gross profit target and how 2008 is shaping up to accelerate those commitments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Scarlett, and good morning to everyone that is joining us on the line this morning. When we laid out our five-year growth commitments to you at our November investor day, we set out several milestones for gross profit and gross margin growth. These targets reflected our ability to continue to deliver ongoing earnings growth, on average, in the mid to high teens over the next five years, as higher market share, global trade expansion and new product launches more than offset the effect of greater competition globally.</p>
          <p>Starting with slide six, our performance in the quarter and what we expect for the full fiscal year gives us further confidence that not only is this growth achievable, it is actually ahead of schedule. Four metrics from our investor day are important to us to update today, especially in light of our performance in the second quarter and our new guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>Let me take you back to those November 8  targets. First, we projected that our seeds and traits business globally would deliver 6.5 to $7 billion in gross profit in 2012. Secondly, we targeted gross profit for Roundup stabilize at 1.2 billion in 2012. Third, we flagged an interim milestone for gross margins, estimating that we could achieve margins of 52 to 54% in 2010. Finally, the sum total of all these metrics is we would nearly double gross profit in 2012 from over $4 billion in 2007 to a target of more than $8 billion in 2012.</p>
          <p>So the logical place to begin in evaluating these four factors is with our seeds and traits business. We anticipated then as we do now that our seeds and traits business will continue to be the major driver of our growth over the next five years. What we've delivered through the first half of this year indicates that our seeds and traits business is ahead of plan, despite some ups and downs among the various crops in terms of gross profit contribution.</p>
          <p>Our new guidance of $3.15 to $3.25 for ongoing EPS for 2008 assumes that the seeds and traits gross profit will now be in the range of 3.6 to $3.7 billion, a 20% or greater growth year over year. As we expected, our 2008 seeds and traits performance is being led by corn. By year-end, our growth in corn seed market share globally increased trait penetration; greater pricing flexibility for our higher-yielding products will lift corn gross profit by nearly 25%. This increase, on an absolute basis, will come even as we offset higher production costs for corn seeds because of higher commodity prices and increased winter production to meet customer demand for triple-stacked corn.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, corn gross profit is up 48% and margins are up one point. Different than last year, traits are a richer percentage of the gross profit mix in corn in the second quarter this year. Margins in the third quarter will be flat, reflecting a higher mix of seeds in overall corn gross profit. By yearend, though, corn margins should be up by one percentage point. Even with the current debate over how much of which crops will be planted, we are very comfortable with our ability to meet our seeds and traits guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>As we demonstrated with this quarter's earnings and our upgrade to guidance, incremental acreage shifts do not have a dramatic effect on our overall performance. As we noted earlier this year, and as you can see on slide seven, for every one million acres that shift from corn to soybeans, or vice versa, on average there's just $0.01 change in EPS.</p>
          <p>Soybeans are enjoying a resurgence from a planted acreage perspective in the U.S. Given that our Roundup Ready trait here is already fully penetrated, we won't get a margin lift on soybean traits until we introduce Roundup Ready 2 Yield in 2009. Additionally, soybean seed production costs have risen dramatically with higher commodity prices. Given the pace and timing of that climb, we were not fully hedged for the higher level of soybean volumes ultimately needed this year. As a result, we would expect to see lower margins for the year as we have in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Absolute gross profit is up modestly in the quarter and is expected to remain up modestly for the year, as higher trait acreage in the U.S. and increased Roundup Ready trait revenue in Brazil will have offset the increase in cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>In cotton, we still believe we are uniquely positioned to create greater value from the Delta and Pine Land business. And that is true, irrespective of plant to cotton acres in the U.S. Our focus in cotton right now is less about the 2008 U.S. season specifically and more about the turnaround in Delta and Pine Land starting in 2009. The Delta and Pine Land acquisition was concluded too late in 2007 for us to make the more trait-intensive production choices that are the hallmark of Monsanto. Thus, we are limited in the flexibility of what we have to sell in the market this year.</p>
          <p>With the addition of Delta and Pine Land's significant seed footprint, our cotton portfolio reflects a larger percentage of seed than it has in previous years. Seed margins are lower than trait margins and we will see that dilutive effect to that mix in our first full year of ownership of Delta and Pine Land.</p>
          <p>All that said, cotton gross profit for the year is likely to be up as we expect our cotton business in India to continue to grow. They won't be able to offset the margin dilution from the U.S. business for this year.</p>
          <p>As you see on slide eight, our vegetable seed business on the other hand is a turnaround story now. And the combined effect of improved operational performance and higher sales is bearing itself out for the quarter and the year in increased gross profit and improved gross margins.</p>
          <p>The commercial backbone in vegetables has never been stronger. Strategic growth initiatives are in place to boost price and drive a richer product mix, translating top line growth to improved margins. Coupled with the operational improvements made over the last two years, Seminis' gross margin should lift this year into the mid-50s. The addition of De Ruiter Seeds should boost our longer term vegetable seed growth outlook, increasing revenue and gross profit projections by more than 20% through 2012.</p>
          <p>The sum of all these parts is projected gross profit growth of 20% or greater for seeds and traits for the full year. This performance in seeds and traits puts us ahead of schedule on our overall growth plan and puts us on strong footing for our 2009 fiscal year.</p>
          <p>The most significant change in gross profit for this year has come from Roundup, of course, which will more than double its gross profit year over year. The quarter and year-to-date results for Roundup globally reflect price, volume and mix shifts that we now believe will be sustained through the year and will result in gross profit contribution of 1.7 to $1.8 billion, with the margins retuning to the mid-40s level.</p>
          <p>The question with Roundup is, is this just good luck in a good year or is this a sustainable trend?  To gauge that we look at three key factors &#x2013; price, volume and mix, and compare those against the global supply/demand environment. Our analysis indicates that the supply/demand tension will remain. Volumes will grow in the low single-digit ranges because of the growth of Roundup Ready crops globally; the expanded use of conservation tillage practices and higher use rates by farmers.</p>
          <p>The current pricing likewise looks to be sustainable. Generic suppliers that were once subsidized are now constrained by higher raw material prices, lower export subsidies and more stringent practices for environmental controls and profitability. This has been particularly true outside of the United States where the increase in the net average selling price for the first half has been significantly higher than what we've experienced here in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that the current supply/demand trends will continue for the next five years. Our current thinking would target Roundup gross profit in the range of $1.8 billion through 2012, up from our original $1.2 billion. This new projection for Roundup performance assumes lower single-digit volume growth coupled with the net average selling price for our branded Roundup in the range of 16 to $18 million per gallon, plus continuation of our best-in-class manufacturing cost position. While we believe Roundup performance is a new band, we don't anticipate replicating the extraordinary growth that we've experienced in 2008. The path forward for Roundup is more gentle than steep although it may not be linear.</p>
          <p>The majority of our gross profit gain in 2008 is contributing nicely to net income as we're hoarding our 2008 spending for SG&amp;A at 20% of sales, which is at the lower end of our previous forecast. Also we anticipate R&amp;D as a percent of sales to be approximately 9% in fiscal year 2008 even as we accommodate the peak regulatory expenses for Roundup Ready 2 Yield and SmartStax and the rapid advancement of new products in our pipeline.</p>
          <p>Our overall gross profit outlook is based on our revised commitments for 2008 as shown on slide nine, our important milestones toward reaching our 2012 targets. In November, we set a 2012 gross profit target of over $8 billion. With 2008 gross profit expected to increase to more than $5 billion, we're already 1/3rd of the way through our 2012 target in our first year. This will also translate into an estimated margin of 53% for this year, reaching our targeted 52 to 54% gross margin two years ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we've had a tailwind from the unprecedented performance in our global Roundup business. If you adjust our 2012 gross profit target, just for the change in Roundup gross profit to 1.8 billion, we would now expect our total gross profit to increase by 600 million, exceeding 8.5 to $9 billion by 2012. We've also experienced some earlier than anticipated momentum for seeds and traits with stronger market share gains than anticipated in Argentina and timely approvals for biotech traits in Argentina and Brazil. We will provide a revised 2012 goals to you after we have the U.S. season in hand and have made production and pricing decisions for the 2009 season globally. This change should again demonstrate that the true growth in this business still rests squarely on the shoulders of seed market share, trait penetration and new product launches.</p>
          <p>So with that overview on income, I'm going to move to cash flow. If you move to slide 10, the revised free cash guidance of 1.3 billion for the full year is exclusive of the planned acquisition of De Ruiter and inclusive of the total cash from the Solutia settlement. This change in guidance from last week now reflects broad approval for some anticipated needs for additional capital spending. Because of the acceleration of our corn seed market share gains, we pulled forward a portion of the two-year 610 million planned capital spending for seed production.</p>
          <p>Additionally, given the supply/demand dynamics for Roundup, we just received sign off on a $200 million debottlenecking project at our Luling facility that will be completed in fiscal year 2010. As I noted earlier, the supply/demand equation for Roundup is flat and we are uniquely suited given our cost curve and brand strength to solve the supply issue rationally. More importantly, we need to ensure that we are protecting our Roundup Ready trait franchise by continuing to be the consistent high quality supplier of glyphosate in the global marketplace. And this is much of the impetus behind our capital spending decision.</p>
          <p>In total, our capital spend for the year will now be in the range of $950 million and we expect it to remain at this level in 2009 as we continue our investments to meet the growing demand for both seeds and Roundup.</p>
          <p>We've also said that we will continue to use free cash for share repurchase and are currently more than 54% of the way through our current $800 million authorization with $429 million in shares repurchased. We're currently evaluating the use of share repurchases and dividends as other mechanisms to return value to shareholders in light of the increase in operating cash from our Roundup business and the influx of cash from the Solutia settlement.</p>
          <p>In summary, the second quarter both from an ongoing EPS and a free cash perspective tells the story not only of outstanding growth today, but the potential for growth yet to be unlocked. Those areas where gross margins are squeezed today in crops like soybeans and cotton, in reality point to a resurgence in 2009.</p>
          <p>We have substantial growth ahead of us just from what we have in hand as we grow market share globally and as we lift margins with greater trait penetration and greater stack trait concentration. On top of that, we poised to launch two game changing platforms in the next two years that will bring even greater yields and greater value to growers.</p>
          <p>As we've expanded growth into new space with vegetables and will build on that platform with the De Ruiter acquisition in anticipation of the products that will come from our molecular breeding program. Whether it's Roundup, DEKALB, Asgrow, Delta and Pine Land or Seminis, we are succeeding though because we do one thing better than competition: we bring new tools of greater value to farmers worldwide.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Hugh for a more expanded strategic review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Terry. As I listened to Terry once again review where we are, where we're going this year, and where we hope to be in five years, I'm struck that we are rare as a technology company and as a technology company in the agricultural space, and that we can provide such a line of sight six months into the fiscal year, not only in what we'll achieve in the next six months but what we'll achieve by the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>So I'd like to spend some time with you today reaching out and touching those next 4.5 years and giving you insight into our latest thinking on how we bridge from this April to August of 2012.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 11, let me tell you broadly how I'm looking our long-term commitments. We've laid out six core growth drivers, all in seeds and traits. The gross profit benefit of these growth drivers roll out differently, casing our layering effect over time. And most importantly, when we look at the dashboard of these growth drivers in 2008, every one of them is on track with the 2012 plan. And in fact, of the growth drivers that have the most meaningful strategy in 2008, I think we're actually ahead of plan.</p>
          <p>So with that backdrop, I think the logical place to start is in cotton. Between now and the summer of 2012, cotton looms large in our growth plans. And what is most remarkable about the cotton growth is it's balanced. There's opportunity in the United States and in international markets in seeds and in traits and existing markets and in new uncharted markets. Around the world, we're expanding the footprint of our cotton seeds and setting the stage for accelerated trait penetration.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 12 within the U.S., DEKALB continues to be on track for a 2 to 3 point share gain this year, most of which appears to be coming at the expense of other large national brands. Less visible but equally profitable on a gross profit per acre basis is the American Seeds business, which we forecast to grow share by 1 to 2 points this year.</p>
          <p>If you move to slide 13, you can see that growth in our international corn business is as impressive of that in the U.S. With five points of organic growth in Argentina, we hold 45% share, nearly three times as large as Midera, the second largest competitor. Similarly in Brazil, if you look at the entire hybrid market across both growing seasons, our share stands at 40%, making us almost twice as large as the nearest competitor, Pioneer.</p>
          <p>While you will see and hear many variations on market share calculations across the industry, for clarity and for consistency, the numbers that you get from Monsanto are always based on our sales volume divided by the size of the entire hybrid market for a defined region like the EU 27 or for a country like Brazil.</p>
          <p>More importantly, this footprint sets the stage for the next wave of growth in cotton traits. In the U.S., we have accomplished something special this year. Going into the year, we announced price increases that reflected the tremendous value that our traits are delivering. Against that, we've increased trait penetration, grown our brand share, and done it all in a market that's seen some incremental contraction. I think that dynamic is rare, and I believe it speaks to the value that farmers place in our products.</p>
          <p>So as the season gets ready to start, the data points in U.S. all support this positive trait landscape. If you go to slide 14, we originally forecast triple penetration across channels of 25 to 27 million acres. We now believe that penetration will be above that range, reaching 26 to 28 million acres even with lower projected total corn. Our trait value has been validated in the marketplace and the net selling price for our triple-stack and our branded DEKALB seeds &#x2013; including both germplasm and trait &#x2013; has increased more than 20% this year, consistent with our earlier guidance.</p>
          <p>As we're finalizing production decisions for fiscal year 2009, we're poised to see a new lift from launches of corn traits in Argentina and Brazil, shown in slide 15. In the 2009 fiscal year, 30 to 40% of the DEKALB seed that we sell in Argentina will be with the newly improved double stack. That equates to 15% penetration rate in the first year of commercialization. So to put that in some perspective, we didn't reach 15% penetration with the first double stacks in the U.S. until the third year of commercial availability.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we just received approval for Monsanto hybrids contained in our first approved corn trait, and the ramp-up to launch is now in full throttle. Given our current production volumes, we believe that we will have enough seed available to make an initial splash in year one with 1 to 2 million acres of YieldGard seed in total for both the summer and winter planting seasons in fiscal year 2009.</p>
          <p>Insect pressure in Brazil is intense, and the average retail price per acre would reflect the substitution value for insecticides as well as the farmers' cost savings and yield gains. The total value package for the YieldGard trait runs between $20 and $30, and we will price against a portion of that value just as we do globally. All of this, I think, set the stage for the launch of SmartStax in 2010 in the U.S., and in fairly rapid succession in Latin America.  All, of course, as usual, pending regulatory approvals.</p>
          <p>We're completing the production decisions now from the starting quantities of SmartStax seed that we'll produce this year. Those in turn would be the bulk up for the commercial launch in a year and a half. Once again, we'll have significant first-mover advantage with a breakthrough technology. Most importantly, SmartStax will be the platform for the new traits that will emerge from a rich product pipeline in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Cotton is a continuing growth story just with what we have in hand and then the bar is raised and the growth reset with the launch of SmartStax. Soybeans, as Terry mentioned, have been a peak penetration from a trait perspective for the past five years or so in the U.S.  If you move to slide 16, you can see the soybeans reemerge as a growth driver in 2009 with Roundup Ready 2 Yield.  With 1 to 2 million of pre-commercial quantities in the 2009 growing season, we'll again set the standard for the introduction of a second generation product. You can imagine then the impact of a full blown launch of 5 to 6 million acres in 2010, again with a significant first-mover advantage and the pricing premium.</p>
          <p>So for those of you who join us for the Whistle Stop Tour this year, you won't just see a golden acre, but I think instead you'll see a golden farm rich with Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybean seed being produced to sell to farmers in 2009.  We've delivered in every timetable we lead out for Roundup Ready 2 Yield and we've raised the bar I think of what defines a HIT project and an accelerated commercial launch.  Most importantly, for a farmer, if you're looking for a consistent reliable supplier of new technologies delivered as promised, we've once again proven that Monsanto is the only seed and trait company that you can turn on year-after-year.  By 2010, we should reach full penetration in Brazil of Roundup Ready soybeans, just ahead of the launch of an insect-protected version of Roundup Ready 2 Yield specifically designed for the Brazilian market.  The Brazilian products will price against both the added value for yield plus the substitution cost plus this conventional insecticides.</p>
          <p>So, I'll just take a minute and talk about cotton and vegetables. The cotton business is really a tale of two countries over the next couple of years.  One is the tale of an Indian market, that's converting over the stacked product for insect protection, was accelerating this growth season with a target for full penetration by 2012.  The other is the tale of the turnaround of the U.S. Delta and Pine Land brand in which the entire portfolio will be converted to a double stack of second-generation products also by 2012.  As Terry mentioned, the cotton turnaround will be staged in 2009, but the vegetable turnaround is behind us and the growth is beginning to be reflected in the numbers.  We have a clear line of sight on mid 60s margin profile in 2012, which will only further benefit from the acquisition of the De Ruiter presence and protected culture.</p>
          <p>So, in short, nothing has changed our game plan and growth prospects for our seeds and trait businesses, other than an acceleration of potential a conformation of our leadership and a determination to drive harder, faster, and further into the first decade of biotech.  Once again, we've expanded our genetic footprint by converting cash from Roundup into acquisitions in higher margin seed businesses where we can create even greater growth by applying our technology to under-leveraged pools of germplasm and to untapped market potential.</p>
          <p>The strength of our core is being masked somewhat this year by the unlocking of new value in the Roundup franchises.  I make no apologize for satisfying the increased demand from our customers for high quality branded Roundup nor for aggressively managing the world's largest agricultural chemical in such a way that we can sustainably drive greater cash generation that in turn can be applied to fund the growth of our business.</p>
          <p>But we aren't shifting our focus because of Roundup's success.  Between now and 2012, we're the only company in the ag space that can successfully launch a game changing platform every other year.  Between now and 2012, we are the only company in the ag space that can offer growth in new technologies that continue to deliver a step change in yield.  Between now and 2012, I think we're the only company in agriculture that can point to consistent growth irrespective of the swings in commodity prices, fluctuations in planted acres or the usual ups and downs in the popularity of things like ethanol.  We're unique creating new value for the farmer and for our owners.</p>

          <p>Yes, congratulations on a good quarter. A two-part question relating to weather in the midwest; we all know at this point that it's been cold and wet there. On the Roundup side, could you talk a little bit about what impact that had on volumes in the first quarter and what impact you expect on the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And then the second part of that question, I'm just wondering if you could &#x2013; I've been hearing that some of the soybean seeds that had already been implanted haven't germinated. And if there is some sort of issue around the failure to germinate, either with corn or with soybeans, what policy, return policy or other type of policy, does Monsanto have with the farmers?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, thanks for the two-part question. I'll just touch briefly on spring and where we are in the season. And then maybe ask Terry to comment on product movement in U.S. foods and Roundup and your question on seeds.</p>
          <p>So, if we had this phone call last week, I think I would have been saying its cold, wet set up to spring in the midwest, but we're enjoying sunshine today. So, spring will come, but it's still early. The good news is we've had an enormous amount of soil moisture this year, and if you're choosing conditions in the spring, moisture is always good. The bad news is seed beds are still cold, probably unseasonably cold.</p>
          <p>So, no weeds are growing, no crops have been planted. So, Roundup's not been sprayed yet, and soybeans haven't been planted. So really what we're seeing in the market right now is the key position and again getting products through retail and getting ready to move to farm in anticipation of the season. And, Terry, maybe a few words on effects we're seeing in Roundup and also soybean movement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, relative to Roundup, I'll begin with that. I think it's more indicative of the supply demand situation than it is weather. But we have seen some pre-buying of Roundup in the U.S. a bit earlier than trend has been in the past couple of years. So, the second quarter does reflect a higher U.S. component of Roundup than what would we normally see. But again, I want to emphasize, I believe that's supply demand related, not related to weather.</p>
          <p>Relative to the crops, very little is planted and our return policies are about the same as they've always have been, so there is a return capability. However, in soybeans, in some cases we have limited the amount of returns that could be sent back. But that again, is related to the supply of soybean seed to be used in the market; it's not at all related to germination issues. And we're way too early to be talking about germination concerns in soybeans or corn, either.</p>
          <p>The last comment I would just make relative to the weather. One of the things that's changed in U.S. farm is they can plant a lot of corn in a very short period or timeframe. So we're really not into the major planting season until we get into late April anyway, into early May, so way too early to speculate about whether this weather will affect the corn acreage or not.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering about your corn seed revenue growth. You were up 555 million in the quarter. I was wondering how you did that?  And that if your prices are up order of magnitude 20%, that's maybe 238 million, so there's an extra 317? And your triple-stack forecast is that you'll sell maybe ten million more acres. So, even if all of that was incremental and you sold the whole year and the quarter, that would get you to 360? So could you just analyze the revenue growth for us in the corn, seed and trait business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the question, Jeff. First of all, it really gets back to the same story. I guess, we repeat it every time we see corn grow, but the end of the day it's the reason it grows. There is a price effect, which you actually outlined for us already in your comments, but the next two things to contribute to that revenue growth are the continued trait penetration and the trade-up to triple-stacks. So we see that growth, so that's contributing there. The third thing is that we continue to grow our share in both our branded business and in our ASI businesses. So, the revenue growth is driven by all those same three factors that we've discussed previously.</p>
          <p>I do believe when I look at the calendarization of the quarter in the U.S., we see a bit more technology in the second quarter that we typically have seen in the third quarter. And we've pointed that out a little bit in our script this morning. But that's really what's happening in the U.S. It's really driven by those same three fundamentals and we feel really good about what we are seeing at this point in the season.</p>
          <p>But in addition to that, we've highlighted that we continue to see international growth. So, contributing factors due to our share growth in Argentina and acreage growth in both Argentina and Brazil are contributing to that as well. So, it's a combination of all those factors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I suppose there will be a thousand questions on corn. So I was wondering if we could talk about the longer-term vegetable outlook for a second. As we start to think about the period beyond, say, 2009, I'm just curious how sensitive your expectation for vegetable seed growth is to the rate of farm commercialization or any other big bottlenecks that are out there? Obviously, the growth looks like it's there on the demand side; I'm just curious what's going to determine the rate of growth and how quickly we get there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'll maybe start and let Terry say a few words relative to De Ruiter, because I think there's a new trend emerging within this. But there's no big bottlenecks, Mark, and there's nothing in there that is a big inflection point. I think veggies is back on track. I think it's made a really nice contribution for the quarter and will do for the year. And it's demand-driven and a sort of ability to command price ease as we improve the quality.</p>
          <p>As the molecular marker suites that we're developing kick in, which is the pun of the decade, early in the new decade, I think that gives us additional opportunities to add value to seeds, and I think, maybe invite Terry to say a few words. The De Ruiter acquisition changes the game and that protects the culture segment, which is an emerging trend. If you're in a supermarket in the U.S. today, about half of those high-quality tomatoes would come from protected culture environments. So, Terry maybe a couple of words to Mark's point there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just to summarize, really, Hugh's comments. One of the things that's occurring in vegetables is that there is going to be a premium pay per seed that can deliver value. And the protected culture market is an indication of that, where margins are greater than they are in the open field business and therefore, the margins at De Ruiter are greater than what we've seen in our Seminis business.</p>
          <p>The key for us is to get those new products that have good traits in them, not biotech, but good breeding traits in them, and take that to the marketplace and let the growers see that value and then translate that value into revenue growth for us. So I think the key for us is twofold: we need to use our molecular tools that we've got and have used within row crops to deliver a better product, and then we need to show growers that that better product gives them a better value at the end. And if we do that, we'll be able to see the kind of lift we're looking for in vegetables. Very confident,  very pleased with the turnaround we've seen this year, very confident of our ability to reach our objectives in 2012 in vegetables.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There &#x2013; I would guess that their percentage today that's in biotech is small or close to zero and that's good news, because it's so upside there. We're in the process today integrating their manufacturing production and bringing them in line with Monsanto.</p>
          <p>The split between the two seasons, I don't know, I guess it would be in proportion with everything else. But, Terry, I think that's one we're going to have to get back to you on. I think the real headline on Agroeste is we bought it on significant portion of ten share points in one step. And when you think about genetic footprint, and you think of the capacity that brings to expand share of the biotechs coming in, that's the real headline, I think, rather than seasonal splits. And, Terry, anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add is just that it just proved really the strategy we've embarked on with Agroeste is the good strategy. Because what we've been doing is trying to stabilize our existing DEKALB brand, which we feel good about this year, adding ten share points to Agroeste and setting the framework for biotech approvals which are now coming in Brazil. So, I don't know, P.J., I just feel like it's really a validation of the value in expanding that genetic footprint in anticipation of biotech in Brazil being approved.</p>

          <p>Maybe I can ask a quick question on page seven of your slides. Your soybeans indexed gross profit is half, or less than half, that of corn. I was just wondering where could it go with Roundup Ready 2 Yield coming on next year?  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We haven't &#x2013; yeah, we're kind of looking at each other here &#x2013; we haven't announced pricing on Roundup Ready 2 Yield. We've talked a little bit about the value that we believe Roundup Ready 2 Yield can bring to the farm, somewhere in the neighborhood of ten to $30 per acre based on the yield improvement that you get.</p>
          <p>I think there is two sides of soybeans, though. One is managing through not having the kind of surprise, which we had this year, even with the amount of acreage of soybeans that are going to be grown, so we manage the cost side more effectively. And I think we'll do that, and we'll see that margin with and that's going to occur more immediately. And then that's kind of the value we talked about Roundup Ready 2 Yield.</p>
          <p>The third contributing value to soybeans, which is going to make it encouraging as we get out to the 2012 timeframe, is what we've been able to do in Brazil and potentially even in Argentina in taking Roundup Ready 2 Yield in a Bt stack there.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you talk a little bit about what your surveys of farmers are telling you  in regard to the drought gene that you are going to be introducing? How might this change their purchasing pattern and your market share? And related to this, how might Rohm and Haas' INVINSA fit in with this picture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the two questions <mark type="inaudible" />. So, I can tell you based on meeting, maybe in our surveys, just meeting directly face to face with farmers in the last few weeks myself, there is tremendous anticipation for the technology. And a lot of questions on how quickly can we spread this into platforms like cotton as well.</p>
          <p>So tremendous pent-up demand because water, I think becomes an increasingly important piece of the mix, regardless of the size of the commodity markets or the pricing. So, huge impact.</p>
          <p>On share, bit too early to speculate, but, I think our goal in this is to get SmartStax as a new platform and then drought would be loaded on top of that platform. And that is a really, really impressive lineup. So, that's, this isn't the future anymore; we are making production decisions on SmartStax in the next few weeks. So, it's all getting really close.</p>
          <p>Your question on Rohm and Haas, the best of my knowledge it's a chemical. So, there is a difference, I think, between key program genetic information in the seed that starts totally the day that seed starts growing and a chemical that you apply at a latter stage. The analogy I would apply, it's a bit like Bt versus an old insecticide. So, it's the difference between control that lives inside the seed and starts the day that the seed wakes up, versus filling something in a sprayer tank and then switching the engine on and driving out one morning.</p>
          <p>So, I think droughts are a huge market, I think there is opportunity for everybody in it. But our focus is going to be clearly on genetics rather than on chemicals.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Hugh, I'm wondering with regard to glyphosate herbicide, how much of the recent pricing strength that we've witnessed do you attribute to simply scarcity of product versus a much higher value in use these days? The reason I ask is, if I look at slide six, your $1.8 billion gross profit forecast for 2012 is virtually flat with 1.7 to 1.8 billion this year. I'm trying to get a sense of whether that's simply conservative, or if you foresee certain market circumstances where there could be a price decline in coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Kevin thanks for the questions. I think it's interesting we say, is 1.8 billion simply conservative, because it was 1.2 billion in November. So, some of this is unprecedented. We've seen two or three things happening simultaneously. One is an escalation in costs and genetic material coming out of China, in particular, escalating cost and increasing scarcity, that's the first thing.</p>
          <p>We're seeing a price band now in &#x2013; as Terry mentioned in the 16 to $18 range, and the U.S. would be in the middle of that from a pricing point of view. So, Brazil and the European markets would be priced higher, and some of the Pacific Rim would be priced lower, so you see the U.S. in the middle of that price band. I think a piece of this is scarcity.</p>
          <p>And it's interesting; the demand has come up a little bit based on increased acreage of Roundup Ready crops and also $110 oil. Because, what I'm guessing, we're going to see a resurgence or a renaissance in conservation tillage where a grower thinks twice about running over a field two or three times cultivating when you can spray one or two times.</p>
          <p>So, a piece of this is scarcity, a piece of this is cost, particularly coming of China, and I think the sub-piece is demand, as we see this new world of agriculture unfoldling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A follow-up to that on your capacity expansion announced in Louisiana; when should we expect that to come online?  How large might it be?  And if I look at the free cash flow forecast decline of 100 million, should I infer that about half of the $200 million cost will hit this year? How should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Terry take the cash flow pieces; that will come on stream in 2010. It's a debottlenecking project that touches multiple pieces of our Luling facility and will buildup some infrastructure as we are doing this. It's about 20, about 20% increase in our capacity and it's a piece of ensuring that sustainability of $1.8 billion of sustainable GP through 2012. And from a cash flow point of view, Terry, couple of words on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No just with &#x2013; well, we've increased overall cash flow expectations for the year, given the growth of Roundup. But relative to the capital spending for Roundup, yeah, I would assume that somewhere in that $100 million range would be spent this year. We roughly will spend it this year and then the bulk of it will be spent next year as well.</p>
          <p>So, I just want to remind you that part of the capital spending increase for the year, it's a combination of Roundup as well as advancing some of the corn seed facilities that we're going to need to meet demand coming off of this season as well. So its a combination of both factors.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just if you could touch a little bit on what's going on in corn, the switch back to soybeans and so forth. I mean from a triple-stack perspective, I know you've increased the number that you expect to sell this year. But are you sold out? Is there anymore to come? Has that number been affected by the potential lower corn acreage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I will take this in order, but let me just start with, it's a fascinating time of the year, it almost became a tradition, because USDA publishes these numbers, and the only thing that's dependable is, it's going to be wrong most years. So, the telephone survey the first week in March and the numbers come out this week, and the fascinating thing is, between the day that farmers were telephoned and the day that the numbers are declared, soybeans have moved another $2. So, there's an arbitrage $2 down.</p>
          <p>So, there is an arbitrage between corn and soy right up to the morning that the plants are rolled out in the barrel. I think if you are a fertilizer company that's a really, really big deal. From where we are sitting, the focus for us is, to your point, how many acres of triple stacks are we going to sell? How many acres of share are we going to capture? And we're obsessed with the numerator much more than we're obsessed with the denominator.</p>
          <p>So, I would say this; a million acre swing either way between corn and soy is a penny of EPS. So, we're chasing a much bigger picture than this; we're chasing share and we're chasing penetration inside that share. I think the fact that triple stacks are up in a theoretically compressed market is a real indication that growers are going to spend money on the best performance seed. And the good news is, if you're still interested, we're not sold out of triples yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add though, we have had more triple production in our winter nursery than we'd anticipate as well, but we're not sold out yet.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley of Soleil Securities. Please proceed with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question gets to the big increase in Roundup profitability, gross profits this year. Hugh, if I were to think of that as a bit of a windfall, how would you be redeploying that within the company in terms of how it events other parts of your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Mark. So, you know, windfall sometimes suggest the one time, one year event, and I think we were clear this morning, that we anticipate this being sustainable at $1.8 billion of gross profit over a number of years; it's a sustained windfall.</p>
          <p>The way that we've been thinking and talking about this is how do you take that cash and reinvest it in higher margin, longer-term opportunities. And I think, it's not the only one, but I think a great example of that is the De Ruiter investment. Where we take this cash, we reinvest in a protected culture seed that has margins, the gross profit level running the 80% range. And I think from a sustainability point of view and long-term growth that's a nice way to take profit and reinvest in the business.</p>
          <p>And then, as Terry mentioned in his comments, we are examining, repatriating cash to our owners through buybacks and dividends as well. But, I think &#x2013; what we've been talking about for five years on investing in lucrative seed spaces, investing in new technologies and returning cash to share owners is exactly the continuing strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the fiscal 2012 goal, I want to make sure I understand what the increase is. It appears if they are increasing in gross profits from the November Investor Day to today is in the order of $0.5 billion, as I read the charts and I listen to what Terry had to say, can you help us out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me make sure we get that communicated clearly. What we said at this point right now is &#x2013; our message is that, we believe the $600 million growth that we've seen in Roundup will be sustainable through this period. And so, 2012, we've increased our gross profit objectives by $600 million for Roundup.</p>
          <p>What we said relative to our seeds and traits is that we are really pleased with what we see to-date. We think this year sets a good benchmark for us, next year we're going to wait till we get through the U.S. season and reassess what we think seeds and traits could be in 2012 and we'll update everyone on that post the end of the U.S. season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we really haven't made a change yet as it relates to seeds and traits, we would love to get to the U.S. season, but we are just giving an affirmation to everyone that we expect that the Roundup profit will be sustained at a level $600 million higher than we originally anticipated.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hugh, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, in South America you mentioned an acceleration of commercialization there and the ability to get similar pricing. What kind of trait fee sharing will you experience there relative to the U.S.?  And then when you bring in Roundup Ready 2 and SmartStax particularly in the U.S., do you have some kind of preferred buyers club or how do you determine access to that technology for your customer base, who gets it first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second piece first, Bob. So the &#x2013; in the U.S. there will be no preferred club or &#x2013; so the first year volume is going to be limited and we are not in the U.S. in Roundup Ready 2 Yield, so second piece first. We &#x2013; volume will be limited than our initial year of launch. So we talked today about a million, two million acres and then we'll ramp that to nearer five to six in the second year, and it will be spread across a bunch of different varieties. I think the difference between this and 1996 is, in '96 we were limited in the number of varieties and the number of zones. This will be a broader launch, but we will be obviously limited in volume in the first couple of years. But I think the performance based on this year's trial results the performance is going to speak for itself. And then the first piece, can you give me a first question again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering if the selling mechanism in South America would alter the traditional sharing of the fees with your retailers in South America versus the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it won't. It won't, I don't anticipate that it well. I mean, the good news down there is we're after ten &#x2013; well, more than ten, I was going to say ten, it's 12 plus long years we are now beginning to see biotech reaching the farm. And it's exactly the right time when you look at the increased demand on commodities. I think the really big news down there is on the development in the long run of the combination Roundup Ready 2 Yield by DC products. And that I think represents tremendous opportunity in the long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, I think that the best barometer is Argentina right now, if you look at Argentina where we're already selling traits that would be very similar to the U.S. We haven't decided yet where we're pricing the grower in Brazil, but we shared with you the values, there is some comparable values, in terms of value in Brazil to the grower versus compared to value in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very similar. And in fact very intense bug populations down there. It's warm, and it rains at the right time, so insect pressure is a big deal in these countries.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shaw of UBS. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good morning, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just kind of following up on Jeff Zekauskas' question about the growth in the corn revenues, how &#x2013; I understood there was probably lot of pre-ordering based on some orders not getting filled last year and the special offers and there is just generally I guess people are buying stuff in advance price increases on everything fertilizers, herbicides whatever this year. So, how do you &#x2013; does that influence the second quarter sales growth in corn or does revenue recognition take care of that and it parses it out to the second and third quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we &#x2013; Chris we probably need to separate pre-order versus shipping, because that's &#x2013; they are two different things. When things are pre-ordered and sometimes even prepaid, they still don't become sales till shipping and shipping patterns are pretty similar. What we are seeing this year is more technology component in our second quarter so there is a technology lift in second quarter, because technology continues to grow as a part of our overall corn business. So there is definitely some pre-ordering and some prepaying that's higher than normal in the seed business. Shipping patterns have been quite similar, but technology is lifted in the second quarter versus last year. We saw a little bit more of that in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So even if they're prepaying you're not recognizing it until you deliver it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't recognize until we ship it, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what you've seen is a demand effect and I think that the fact that triples are up year-on-year even in a down market for corn speaks to demand more than shipping patterns or early orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson [Merrill Lynch]. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Hugh you've talked a couple of times about how as you look forward to 2012, you expect consistent growth irrespective of commodity price swings or fluctuations in planted acres and yet a sizable portion of the market wonders how you can grow if corn prices were to pull back or acreage be down. So what do you think people are missing in terms of that disconnect between commodity prices and your growth objectives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I &#x2013; thanks for the question. I think and it's really hard to talk of this. Because this is a &#x2013; we see these fluctuations today in the stampedes that are occurring, but the reality is whether you're farming here in the Midwest or you're farming outside Sao Paulo on finite fixed acres a farmer's whole focus is on optimizing yield and whether corn is 5 bucks or 3 bucks, he is always going to reach for the best possible seed available to optimize yields on fixed acres, whether that's mitigation or trying to blow the doors off in a high price year. So we have seen that we are traded out a lot less than many other variable costs in down years. So as long &#x2013; the key for us, the deal I think, the contract that we have with the grower is that we deliver the best possible technology that yields the highest possible outcome on his farm irrespective of commodity prices. And if we fulfill that, if we deliver on that contract, then we will win disproportionately versus our competitors.</p>
          <p>Now, to the earlier questions, Don, on the market dynamics in corn, the fact that triple stacks are up in a contracted corn market I really think speaks volumes to that. So we are not recession proof, but we are traded out a lot later in the game than many other variable cost on the farm and that's why I think as we look to 2012, and we've done a lot of work on this, that's why I think that these growth rates are achievable and sustainable because they move independent of the vagaries of the commodity cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. When you say you are not traded out, so you don't have as much volume risk but is there still price risk there say if corn is $3 instead of 5 or do you still think that your value capture right now is low enough that you won't have to move your pricing back down even at say $3 corn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's &#x2013; so I think the farmer makes that decision every springtime at the kitchen table. And I think that as long as we continue to deliver incremental value and improve yields through our germplasm just as much as through our biotechnology, then we're sharing that price and sharing that value with the grower and that's a fair deal. So I don't see a retreat as long as we continue to advance technology.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>If we could take the last question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Yes. Our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies &amp; Company. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi this is <mark type="inaudible" /> speaking for Laurence. I just had a question regarding phosphate, did the tight demand supply balance in the phosphate market give Monsanto an incentive to vertically integrate in other regions besides the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. Just very briefly, because I know there has been a lot of speculation on this. We mine phosphorus here in the U.S., we are probably the biggest elemental miner of phosphorus in the world and every gallon of Roundup has got a handful of phosphorus in it. So we have a &#x2013; we believe we have a cost advantage versus a number of our competitors, because we're fully integrated today in phosphorus extraction and production, and then we ship that phosphorus to our production facilities in Luling, Louisiana and also in Brazil. So, I think it's a &#x2013; I think we've a unique cost position and we are integrated today. And I see that entirely independent of some of the discussions that are going on at the moment with the fertilizer industry. So we're focused on our own business and we're focused on supplying weed control to growers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just on that, and in respect to your time and the very large number of people that are on the call today, let me just wrap this up, and to tie it back to Don's question, we really, really are looking out to 2012. And we recognize that the decisions that we are making &#x2013; in fact some of the decisions that we make in the course of the next month help to provide that line of sight towards 2012.</p>
          <p>In fact between now and planting, we will finalize our production plants that set the stage for the size of our first mover advantage that we'll have with Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans. We'll finalize our production and pricing for the triple-stack availability next year, and that in turn sets the stage for the bulk up of seeds that we need for a high impact launch of SmartStax the following year. And we're about to plant, I think the largest R&amp;D field trial program in our history in seed breeding and in biotech traits that will give us more data and more pipeline candidates to fuel our next decade's worth of growth.</p>
          <p>So as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we know absolutely that our advantage is in our innovation, we've created value based on long-term trends, not on short-term cycles, and that, and the decisions that I've just mentioned are our advantage &#x2013; that's our competitive edge. And I think here's how that plays out: Monsanto will introduce on average a new game-changing technology, from Roundup Ready 2 Yield to drought tolerance, every other year through the middle of the next decade. So I believe very heartily that our strategy is accelerating, our opportunities are great, and that we do control our own destiny, and that we're committed to delivering what we've promised.</p>
          <p>So I'm really pleased that you joined us today. And I look forward to reporting back to you on our continued progress as the spring season plays out in the Northern Hemisphere. Thanks very much for your time today.</p>
