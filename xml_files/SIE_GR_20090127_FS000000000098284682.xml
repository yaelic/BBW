          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Siemens 2009 First Quarter Conference Call. As a reminder this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on page two of the Siemens presentation. This conference call may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumption and therefore are subject to certain risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Michael Sen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2009 conference call. The earnings release, the flashlight and all other documents were out at 7 o'clock this morning. Yesterday there was also a press release on putting our Areva stake and on the commitment to nuclear power. You can download all these files from our website.</p>
          <p>This morning's presentation is also online now. Our President and CEO Peter L&#xF6;scher and our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Kaeser are here this morning to present the Q1 results. We will have a short presentation with time for Q&amp;A afterwards where Joe will answer your questions.</p>
          <p>With that let's get us started. I would like to hand it over to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, thank you, and good morning to everybody. As you are well aware today is our day of the annual shareholders meeting, so and I have to be present. For this reason. I will only be making short brief introduction and then I will hand over to Joe to provide you further details of the quarter.</p>
          <p>We had a very solid quarter. It was a clean quarter with strong earnings expansion of plus 20%. Also the order intake and the, with a robust book-to-bill of 1.13 is a strong sign that the quarter was very solid.</p>
          <p>We have also from a growth perspective finished a good quarter. It is also now demonstrating that we continue to have an intense focus on lowering our cost base. And we have started this early in the cycle, which gives us a distinct advantage versus many of our competitors. So our SG&amp;A program is progressing to plan.</p>
          <p>As we have shared with you in the last quarter, in Q2 we will also announced to you further details of our supply chain initiative, which basically will help us to support our 2010 targets.</p>
          <p>In the last couple of weeks, we have seen numerous government-based programs, which are very much targeted around infrastructure investments, which is clearly at the sweet spot of our portfolio. And we clearly see this as a big opportunity for us, but likely to be for 2010 in terms of really being relevant for order intake. And we have clearly in terms of scale of our portfolio and our large customer base, we are now driving very focused our operational efficiency agenda.</p>
          <p>As you are well aware, we also concluded our legal proceedings with the German and US authorities and from a strategic aspect, it was also important that we finished it. We have now our head free to really focus on our operational business on our customer base and going forward, you will also have the side benefits that the legal costs will certainly sequentially go down as we progress through the year.</p>
          <p>We made one strategic announcement as well this morning in terms of providing to Areva or putting our option to Areva for our minority equity position in our joint venture, Areva NP.</p>
          <p>We see the nuclear business as a clear business area of great growth. It's important for us strategically in the wider context of our energy and clean energy business portfolio. We therefore would like to play an enhanced industrial role in this business area. And we will, going forward, develop our options, our partnership options with other partners and we will announce it accordingly as soon as we have any results.</p>
          <p>With this I would like to finish my opening remarks and hand over to Joe for further details. Joe?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter. A very warm welcome to all of you listening to our first quarter results call this morning. As Peter said we saw a massive deterioration of the macroeconomic environment in the quarter and I want to go through these now in more detail.</p>
          <p>It's I think very obvious that every data point continues to deteriorate and we now expect to see negative global GDP growth for the calendar year 2009. This is also mirrored by the sentiment amongst manufacturers which is weak with no bottom in sight. But I do want to reassure you that we aren't driving while we're looking into the rear mirror. We want to be realistic about what is ahead of us and get ready to act and to execute.</p>
          <p>Let me now walk you through some of the details of the first quarter, starting with the development of our top line. On the left hand side, we display our regional numbers from the quarter. As you can see, order growth fell across all regions, with the US and China obviously being impacted by the slowdown and as stated as previously as some of you might remember.</p>
          <p>In the case of China, orders are particularly affected by the slowdown in the Industry Solutions, and Power Transmission businesses, both of which had tough comps in the prior year period, for example, two large orders in metals and mining. However, Germany managed positive order growth of 14% year-on-year, which is largely due to Mobility winning a significant order from our biggest customer, Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>On a revenue basis, all regions recorded positive revenue growth, with the US growing their billings by 6% compared to the prior year's quarter. As guided the global slowdown has clearly now arrived in the industry sector with bookings declining 11% year-on-year and revenues decreasing &#x2013; increasing by 1% like-for-like.</p>
          <p>As anticipated, we saw the strongest declines in Industry Automation, Drive Technology and Industrial Solution, which was partly offset by 9% order growth at Mobility. Despite this, the Industry Sector's book-to-bill still held up at 1.05 in the quarter. The Energy sector book-to-bill remained strong at 1.37 with revenue increases across all divisions. The order book was also up about 18% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>On the year-on-year base, the sector's bookings dropped by 6%, which obviously in large part was due to the 38% decline in Renewables, which should actually not come as a surprise, particularly given the tough comps from last year. In contrast, we saw a strong performance at Fossil, which delivered a 14% increase in orders year-on-year.</p>
          <p>And finally, the Healthcare sector. As Peter mentioned, Healthcare showed relative strength in the quarter. Its order book dropped by 4% year-on-year, which was largely due to Workflow &amp; Solutions orders declining by 17%.</p>
          <p>The order intake at Imaging &amp; IT declined 2% off the back of tough comps, for example, a large contract last year at Healthcare IT. Hence, Imaging equipment and services held up very nicely in the fiscal Q1 2009. Diagnostics orders were up at about 1%. So overall, Healthcare's revenue grew 3% year-on-year with positive contributions from all divisions.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the highlights of the first quarter. In Q1, total sector profit was 2 billion, up 20% year-on-year with the Energy and Healthcare sectors driving sector profit growth. Total sector margin for a quarter was 10.8%, up from 9.9% last year.</p>
          <p>The Energy sector led the way in margin performance in the first quarter with all divisions delivering margin increases and all divisions meeting their target margin range already for 2010.</p>
          <p>Fossil Power Generation's margin performance in the quarter was particularly strong, rising 12.2% compared with 1% in the prior year, when charges of about 200 million adversely impacted the profit of the division.</p>
          <p>The Industry sector which was the greatest short cycle exposure, saw margin pressure in Industry Automation and Drive Technologies resulting in an overall sector margin of 9.7%. However, we saw margin improvements year-on-year in Building Technologies, which actually is holding up very well, Industry Solutions and Mobility.</p>
          <p>Osram's margin also picked up from last quarter, favorably impacted by some smaller one-off gains, as I referred to in the earnings release. Although there is clearly, is clearly a challenging Healthcare environment, especially in the US, the Healthcare sector delivered a solid performance in the quarter with an underlying margin of 13.5% excluding OTCs one-time costs, PPA and net divestment gains.</p>
          <p>If we were to exclude the charge for particle therapy, the margin of the quarter would be at 14.9%. At the divisional level, Imaging and IT delivered strong results, especially given the market environment with a 25% incremental margin. Diagnostics produced a solid performance in the quarter with an underlying margin of 17.1%.</p>
          <p>Income from continuing operations increased to about 1.3 billion, up 17% year-on-year. This is largely attributable to the increase in total sector profit, as well as lower expenses for corporate items, higher income from equity investments and continued progress in other operations. Earnings per share was at 1.43, up 25% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Looking at our free cash flow development, we realize the seasonality of Q1 and furthermore we have been anticipating significant cash outflow from the 2008 charges. Nevertheless on an operational basis, we clearly have to further increase the working capital grip in our sector operations as the economy is getting weaker.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, free cash flow was negative at unsatisfactory levels of 1.6 billion. As I outlined in Q4, there will be material cash outflow from charges taken in fiscal 2008. So let me give you maybe some additional color here. Free cash flow in FQ1 was impacted by the 1 billion settlements, payments with the US and German authorities, as well as from previously recorded charges of 222 million related to project reviews, restructuring and SG&amp;A. So about 50% of the anticipated cash outflow from charges taken in fiscal Q4, 2008 has materialized in fiscal Q1, 2009.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, capital efficiency. ROCE improved in the quarter to 12.9%, up from 11.6 the prior year, obviously on the back of the earnings increase year-on-year. Going forward, we will continue to execute against our cap agenda, which includes our SG&amp;A program. And you might have recognized that the SG&amp;A already were going down year-on-year from 3.055 billion in the P&amp;L to first quarter numbers of 2.868 billion. So, you clearly can see that it's securing, and it also shows in the P&amp;L of the company. So it is on track and it will reduce costs net-net by 1.2 billion by 2010.</p>
          <p>As previously mentioned, however, we will see some of the SG&amp;A savings realized already in 2009, particularly from reductions in IT and management consulting, but the bulk of the savings are head count related and backend loaded much into 2010.</p>
          <p>As you know, we announced a second initiative last quarter, spearheaded by Barbara Kux to further drive our operational efficiency in the area of supply chain and low cost country sourcing as well as engineering. Barbara will give you a walkthrough the details and the targets of supply chain management when we announce results for the next quarter in April 2009. This initiative is going to be a key enabler to support our 2010 targets in a materially adverse macroeconomic environment as originally anticipated when we were setting the goals for 2010.</p>
          <p>As Peter mentioned, the last six months have been and have seen developments no one could have imagined that the speed that has impressed everyone in the global world. Even though we were among the first ones to see it and to act, we certainly also were caught by surprise by the structural impact of a massively derailed financial system all over the world, impacting our customer's ability in some parts to finance the project on time.</p>
          <p>The continued adverse market conditions have made our 2009 targets even more ambitious. They certainly would become even more challenging if there were any material delays or cancellations to the backlog scheduled to turn to revenues in 2009, or if additional pricing pressure, in the tail end of our fiscal 2009 would kick in. Those developments we have not seen in fiscal Q1, but history and experience tells us that we better get prepared for the trend that certainly works against us. As I have said before ladies and gentlemen, we are monitoring this very closely. We're going to be realistic and we'll keep you closely updated on its potential impact for 2009 guidance.</p>
          <p>Before I'm going to take your questions ladies and gentlemen, this actually is the last conference call, our Head of Investors' Relation, Michael Sen is participating, and helping me out on. From tomorrow onwards he'll focus on his both challenging and attractive job as the CFO of Healthcare. The succession planning is underway and I would not be too surprised if I were already able to present the new Head of the Investors' Relations, <mark type="inaudible" />, next week.</p>
          <p>With that ladies and gentleman thank you very much for listening. I thank Michael for what I believe a massive and positive work building up a competent, in-depth, well communicating, well reporting Investors' Relations, and there's going to be large shoes to fill for the successor to come.</p>
          <p>With that ladies and gentlemen, thank you Michael. And I will be happy to take your questions. Please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you my gentlemen. We'll now start today's question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Mr. Andreas Willi of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I have two questions, please. The first one on discussions with the unions, if you could give us some update there. Some German companies go with pretty attractive short work week agreements. What should we expect from Siemens and how could that impact, by when could that impact your, basically financials and utilization rates?</p>
          <p>Second question on your financing business, you have again increased investments there after already in Q4 spending more money there. At that point in time, you said we shouldn't expect a big further increase. I think you spent another 1.1 billion there. Maybe you could give us a bit more information on what have you invested in terms of customer financing receivables that you may have bought in the market and where we're going the next few quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Andreas. Be happy to answer the question. On the unions, I think as a the track record, you might remember how quickly the company was able to lock in the agreement with the workers' council on SG&amp;A, letting about 17,000 people go all over the world. As far as the discussions on short-term work are concerned, we do see a decent support from the workers' councils. And of course, also of the unions to bridge what we would expect to be short-term capacity adjustments. And you might have heard also from the German government initiative to actually improve the conditions for the companies on short-term labor.</p>
          <p>So we are reasonably positive that this will help us even when it is being needed and the first signals we are getting are I think encouraging. On the financing piece of Siemens Financial Services, we said that we are about capping the total balance sheet exposure to about 12 billion. We've reached that threshold now. So do not expect material increases in that area. We are very thoughtful about investing into financial assets even though they will look very cheap, but the risks are also massively increasing. So we, to invest money there very selectively based on a stringent risk and value at risk management. The very bulk of the investment has been attributable to supporting our three sectors in their business and that's how we are going to look at also going forward.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Operator, can we have the next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. We'll now go to Peter Reilly of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions please. Firstly, can you give us some more color on what's happening in Industry Automation? There was a bigger than expected margin fall out of the Capital Markets Day back in December. Hiesinger was talking about having a 200 basis points peak-to-trough fall and it came in at 700 basis points in the quarter and is referenced in the statement to pricing pressures. So perhaps you can give us more color on what's happening there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in Osram you refer in the statement to forthcoming charges. Can you give us some indication of the scale of these charges? It was very enjoyable seeing a clean quarter for Siemens. Wondering if we're going a lot more clean quarters, so just trying to get a feel for the scale of further restructuring charges still to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. On Industrial Automation development, I think first of all, we just need to concede that the slowdown has arrived, also at Siemens, in that particular area. There have been many of our competitors already out in the market. They are seeing that slowdown in the last several quarters. We've been now the last one probably to get hit since we probably are also strongest in the market in terms of market share and technology, but it has finally arrived with remarkable impact.</p>
          <p>Now on the peak-to-trough discussion, I think I do remember the sectors comments on that. I think we need to clarify that aspect. When Hiesinger and Olsenpark's management was talking about peak-to-trough margin deterioration as compared to the 2001 development, the assumption has always been that if and when we fall the same magnitude in the top line, which at that time I think was about 400 base points top line deterioration and at this time we should be actually be able to be at 280 plus peak-to-trough margin. Now with the speed and the massive fall of the top line, I mean it's obviously completely unrealistic to think that is a 10% bottom line deterioration, a 280 or 400 base point peak-to-trough would be feasible. So I think it's very important that we clarify this one.</p>
          <p>So assuming similar environments on top line as in 2008, I think it's a reasonable ballpark 280, but unfortunately we're in here for completely different ballparks and different scenarios. You might have heard Mr. Huber in the Industrial Day, who was suggesting that this would last maybe only a quarter or two since distributors have been de-stocking. I would not feel that comfortable to be that optimistic at this time, because if you look at our end markets, they are reasonably gloomy. By the same token, we need to, I think, be clear about the fact that we are market leader in that environment. We do have a good reputation and a very well established global distribution network. So the aspiration here is to clearly perform better than competition does. By the same token, I think the directness of the impact has predominantly come from the fact that Factory Automation, which is the very sweet spot of Industrial Automation has been hit much more than average process industries in that area.</p>
          <p>So now on Osram, there will be charges coming likely in Q2, Q3. They should not be that material in terms of the company's impact for Osram, of course there will be. If I had to look at the reported margin of Osram, which I think is around about 8%, I think more underlying would be a six-ish number six, 6.5%. And that's what they should be able to be doing in the next quarter, excluding restructuring charges, which I think should be maximum mid two-digit numbers.</p>
          <p>Other than that, I agree it's been a clean quarter, maybe with the exceptions of the particle therapy in Healthcare. But that again shows the potential the company has if it then executes well. And this is the goal and the target going forward. I think I mentioned already last time and also when I was representing in New York a couple of weeks ago, that we do expect some volatility from our 34% Areva stake on the nuclear island in Olkiluoto. We do not know the numbers yet, but it's probably likely that Areva will reassess its ability to finish by 2011. So there might be some charges which we expect also in Q2 in our equity, energy equity environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Operator, can we take the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sir. We'll now go to Mr. Mark Troman of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone. It's Mark here from Merrill Lynch. First question please on your backlog, you must have obviously done quite a lot of due diligence on that backlog. And you've highlighted you haven't really seen any cancellations to-date. Are you fairly confident that most of that backlog will be delivered as planned? That's question number one. And the second question please on utility spend. I wonder if you could give an update of the developments you see there. Has it got worse or better? Obviously, the Power Generation division is still doing well. Some of your payers have given some sort of guidance of 30% drop or so. I wonder if you could give an update on that. And maybe highlight if the service business is growing helpfully. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Mark, thank you. Now on the backlog, we've done the diligence. I think it's fair to report that our order intake in Q1, which was massively higher than our orders with a book-to-bill of 1.13, had good margin structure. So it improved the quality of our backlog, first statement. Second, it's true we have not seen major cancellations, nor have we seen major push-outs of our order backlog, which is scheduled to turn into revenues in 2009.</p>
          <p>Has it gotten better or worse? Well, I think that's obviously is one of the key areas we're watching very carefully, because our target guidance of eight to 8.5 billions on the total sectors is very much depending on two factors. First, whether there are going to be any material push-outs of the schedule or the backlog for 2009. And secondly, whether on the tail-end of fiscal 2009 there will be increasing price erosion resulting from continued weakness in the short cycle business. So make it clear again, haven't seen cancellations nor material push-outs. Are we ruling them out going forward? Certainly not, it would be unrealistic. But then again we need to watch it week-by-week.</p>
          <p>On the utility spend, that's usually something you better listen to our customers. Some have been reasonably aggressive, others have been more optimistic. I don't want to give any, let's say guidance here whether 20 or 30 or 10% will be the right numbers. We still do a massively intact energy cycle. The dominant question to me will be is the credit supply going back in order enabling our customers to continue with projects they've been planning and doing. I think that's the key question to me whether or not the energy cycle will hold, and then of course whether or not this company is doing well than most others. That's a big question. We monitor that, but I would not feel comfortable in giving any speculation on what our customers decide on doing.</p>
          <p>The service piece certainly will hold up well in 2009 because it's basically related to the installed base. So therefore you will see good contribution from the service business into the divisions, which are benefiting from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's very helpful, Joe. Just one very quick follow-up. When you talk about price erosion in the business, is it fair to say that you are seeing it in, I guess basically the short cycle businesses of Osram and the Automation maybe. Is that where it's happening over and above the raw material decline or are there other areas as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, see, if I knew I probably would have given a clearer outlook on the guidance. We haven't seen it. Many people talk about it. Also our customers of course. But experience tells if there is continued underutilization of highly capital intensive factories, at some point in time one or the other may feel compelled to hunt in the other neighbor's backyard. And that's usually how it works. And that usually looks the way that people are coming in with lower prices. And I would not only relate that to short cycle areas, but also to areas where let's say Imaging, and then related topics take place. You have seen that continued volume weakness in the United States. I do not think we've seen the bottom yet, based on the development of funding for the hospitals and the likes. So if I think we see price erosion in the short term, it would be related to short cycle industrials as well as the Imaging area of Healthcare.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning, Scott Babka from Morgan Stanley. One, two questions, one follow-up on the pricing discussion. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the Energy division in terms of, are you seeing customers push back and require price decreases as materials have come off? And does that have any impact on the order flow?</p>
          <p>And then second back to the discussion to put the stake back to Areva. The press release talks about a commitment to remain committed to the industry. Can you just give us an idea, kind of how you see opportunities to do that, if that's not with Areva going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Scott. The pricing discussion, I think we've said enough on the pricing discussion. It would be not advisable if suppliers such as the customers to look into that area and you're not doing that. We do have meaningful customers and usually stick to the agreement as we constantly do. And that's what we also expect from the customer side. And that's I think all I can say at this time, everything else would be speculation. As I am talking of course we need to be realistic and that's why we are hinting at potential price in areas if and when volumes keep going down in the short cycle area. Don't see it necessarily in the longer cycle business, because on the backlog we have an agreement and on the negotiations of new projects, you know, customers make choices based on what they see from the suppliers.</p>
          <p>Now on Areva's <mark type="inaudible" /> with us, it all seems a little early to already comment on the strategy going forward. We barely have managed to make a decision now to exercise the put options and that's as much as what we have done today. And everything else, I think the company will develop further. We do have very clear views on what we believe needs to be done. There is a series of contractual matters between Areva NP and Siemens which need to be straightened out. We've actually cooperated very well given the circumstances, and I do expect also the negotiations to go in a positive and let's say fair and professional environment and that's all I can say at this time and will keep you updated as we move along.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you. I have three questions. The first was in terms of the Fossil division, it's obliviously been over the last two quarters a significant area of volatility in terms of margin; very bad in Q4 and very good in this quarter. I wondered if you could just sort of say whether this is just the result of the timing of delivery of bad contracts or whether there's actually evidence in this quarter that this is something that we should be more extrapolating for the year?</p>
          <p>Second question would be in terms of Diagnostics. You've obviously been very &#x2013; your comments have been relatively down beaten in terms of the Imaging area of Healthcare, but Diagnostics we have sort of always seen or have been sold somewhat as a story as been a relatively defensive exposure. And yet in terms of top line progression there, it seems to be the one that's had maybe the sharpest slowdown. So I wondered if you could give us some insights as to what trends you've been seeing in those markets and how significant that is related to the current economic situation.</p>
          <p>And then the third question was really with regard to cash. If &#x2013; you've also made the comment that is a very poor performance of cash flow in this quarter. And I sort of looked back and almost struggle to find a normal Q1 for cash flow. But in terms of the sort of outflow, I think if you took the main elements of working capital, it was sort of at 2.3 billion cash outflow. I just wondered if you could give me some feel as to how you think you &#x2013; how significant an underperformance that was  of what you'd see as a normal quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Fossil division, I mean whenever we do a good execution on projects, you will see good margins. So I think it is just what the potential the company has to deliver on time. By the same token, we need to deliver consistently, quarter-by-quarter. And that's all it is. Now, of course, there is some, some volatility given the nature of some projects being more profitable and others still stemming from the 2005, 2006 backlog. So there will be some, let's say even if we execute smoothly what I expect the division to do, then we will have, as I say, some volatility underlying, let's say maximum 200 base points up and down. That's in the normal area of projects, whether it's more service-related or more product or more turnkey, so depends on the mix.</p>
          <p>On  DICS (Digital Integrated Communications Systems) I think we are satisfied with the margin they have been producing. The last year's margin and we commented on that last time was positively impacted by some mix. So what we see today it was satisfactory, as you would not expect that division to deliver worse results. We do see some aggressiveness in the market from other constituencies, trying to win volume over price. We have not participated in that aspect, which might have gone to the extent of the top line growth. But I do not expect DICS to be in for a weak scenario going forward based on the consumables content of the business.</p>
          <p>On the Imaging, I think you mentioned that was down beaten. I don't know, I mean everyone needs to make his or her own assessment about that, I just try to be realistic, that's all it is. And by the same token as long as you don't have 100% market share, there is always opportunity, even in an adverse market environment. And I do believe in the Imaging sector, at the end of the day the jury will decide on the quality and the competitiveness of products, especially given an environment, you know, which calls for more cost effective products doing just about the same thing. And you might remember that Siemens was the first one to complete design and engineer Imaging equipment in China in low cost countries and we continue to do that. So we actually are looking, let's say on a relative term, we are actually looking very positively to the future because we believe we've got something to offer here, which is good for our customers in terms of cost effectiveness.</p>
          <p>On the cash, I truly expect the performance to be poor from the operations, and I have been clear with them about that. The networking capital turn, in our definition, has dropped from 8.6 in September 2008 for the fourth quarter to 7.8. That alone did cost about 1 billion working capital and that's not satisfactory, especially in an environment which is in for a global slowdown. And that's why I do expect the divisions to produce better results going forward. And we have a very tight grip on those actions, on working capital management. I think it's positive now that we were early in limiting the CapEx. We've brought down the CapEx to less than 100% of depreciation in Q1, and we continue to be very tight on CapEx spending going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, can I just ask a quick follow-up on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In term of the cash flow, so I see the headline deterioration and the fact that you had plans. But is it possible in any way to give me a feel as to how quickly you can execute the plans you have and how sort of significant a change it is for the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Simon, I mean we've &#x2013; if you look at the last two years, I think it's fair to say that our cash, free cash flow performance has increased massively over the years. We've done good programs. We've been successful in increasing the network in capital terms, even managing a tight supplier environment in 2000 &#x2013; particularly in 2008. And so the divisions know how to do it. Of course, I do realize and I do respect that it has been year-end for our customers, which usually impacts their willingness to pay before a year-end. But we have not done well in inventories. And that's an area where we need to become much better in the quarters to come, and the divisions know how to do it. So we will be close to them and help them to execute.</p>
          <p>So I would not feel comfortable in, let's say, giving you any guidance on Q2 or Q3, but you just need to know that this is, that cash is a very high priority in the company going forward, especially given the fact that we do have high cash payouts from the charges we have been taking in 2008. And I said it in the remarks that about 50% of the total expected cash outflow from charges 2008 has been done in Q1. And there are still 50% to come over the next quarters and that needs to be earned by the organization.</p>

          <p>It's Tuesday, very sorry about that. The next question is coming from, sorry, Mr. William Mackie of MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good mornings, gents. Thank you very much. It's Will Mackie from MainFirst Bank. So firstly, if I could just follow-up on the order execution question. Perhaps you could step through where potentially you see the greatest risk with respect to material push-out on the backlog across the divisions to give us perhaps some heads up on what to look out for with respect to specific risk.</p>
          <p>And secondly, going into the detail, could I come to the central cost element? And perhaps you could give us a little guidance on how you expect corporate costs to develop through this year, and also pension costs given the increase in the net pension obligations? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Will. On all execution on top of the, you know it's hard to tell, because if we knew already we obviously would communicate and act proactively. From what we sense, and please only from what we sense, one area which could be somewhat volatile all the time, could be the Renewable division on wind. Just because of the sheer fact that it's seen such a massive growth over the years in both markets served in our company. So that's certainly an area which we focus on very, very closely since we've also invested into capacities and the likes. And we have pushed out our next factory, which actually was planned to be started due to the fact that we'd rather understand what's substance and what may be just some scrambling for capacities. But that probably would be &#x2013; if I  had to take one of the 17 divisions in the company, probably would have taken this one. That's as much as I think as I can say on speculating on what order backlog would be affected, the most or the earliest.</p>
          <p>On the central cost element, I mean obviously, those costs for compliance suppliers and the likes need to go down significantly, they've come down. In the last quarter, we expect them to go down further over time. There will still be some related costs to that, just if you think about equipments monitoring and so on and so forth. But they will go down over time in a material way. So, I think if someone needs a number for a model on that line, I think altogether probably I would say 250 would be an aggressive number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the corporate costs. And anything specific from pension, should we just multiply this 70 by four. So we're looking at 280 on top of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That probably may be a conservative approach, but given the fact that a 250 were somewhat aggressive, you may want compensate that one. Here as you know it depends on what the expected return on pension assets, will eventually be determined. So, yes I don't just take it times four and there might be some, let's say some potential here, but I mean we are, the whole financial crisis and I said that six months ago. The real impact of the companies that we see first is in the pension. So therefore, it might be more costly going forward than it used to be and we'll get you updates every quarter.</p>
