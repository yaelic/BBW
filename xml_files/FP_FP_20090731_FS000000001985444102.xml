          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Total Second Quarter 2009 Results Conference Call. I'll now hand over to Mr. Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And welcome everyone and thank you for joining us on a Friday afternoon. As usual, we'll make some comments on the second quarter results and then go to the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Compared to the first quarter 2009, the second quarter environment was not favorable, despite the rebound in oil prices from very low levels. In the context of depressed demand, gas price continued to fall and refining margins were very weak. Taking this into account, our results were weaker this quarter than in the previous quarter, but our performance on a year-over-year basis still compares favorably with our peers.</p>
          <p>Looking at the second quarter results compared, to the first quarter, adjusted net income was $2.35 billion versus $2.75 billion, a decrease of 15%. Earnings per share was $1.05 per share, versus $1.23 share. Adjusted cash flow was $4.4 billion, stable compared to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>CapEx, excluding acquisitions was $4.2 billion, compared to $3.6 billion. Acquisitions in the second quarter were $654 million linked mainly to Libya and our deal with Cobalt. Asset sales were $1.1 billion in the second quarter, compared to $468 million in the first quarter, reflecting an increase in the sale of Sanofi shares.</p>
          <p>And our gearing at the end of the second quarter, after paying the dividend was 25%, slightly below the level a year ago, and at the bottom of our target range of 25, 30% for 2009.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter non-recurring items had a negative effect on net income of $300 million, mainly from restructuring charges in the Downstream and Chemicals.</p>
          <p>We are well into the implementation of a company-wide cost cutting program. We are continuing to review the feed and contract structures of spending projects in order to reduce CapEx, specifically on large LNG and oil sand projects, as well as other projects that should be ready for final investment decision next year, such as CLOV, Egina, Laggan and Tormore.</p>
          <p>We recently announced that contracts were being awarded for the Jubail refinery project after a second round of bidding. And the important point here is that we were able to reduce CapEx by about 25% from the initial estimate.</p>
          <p>Now I will comment on the segments. In the Upstream, the average Brent price rose to $59 per barrel, an increase of 33% compared to the first quarter. Our natural gas price realization decreased by 21% to $4.7 per million BTU. This decrease reflects the impact of weak demand on spot gas prices and the lag effect on our formula based contracts. However, relative to our peers, we benefited from our low exposure to US natural gas prices. Our average hydrocarbon realization increased by 14% to $44 per barrel of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net operating income from the Upstream segment increased slightly to $2 billion, as the effect of higher oil prices, lower gas prices, and lower production volumes essentially offset one another.</p>
          <p>The annualized second quarter ROACE for the Upstream is 16.5%. This continues to be very competitive with the other major oil companies.</p>
          <p>Our net operating income was $10 per barrel of oil equivalent. This is at the level of the best among the majors demonstrating the resilience of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Production in the second quarter averaged 2.18 million barrel of oil equivalent per day, a decline of 7% compared to the first quarter, mainly due to the following elements. Heavy seasonal maintenance, including a full shut down of Alwyn for one month, had an impact of minus 3.5%. Weak gas demand was minus 1%. PSC price effect was minus 1% and the combination of normal decline and security issues in Nigeria more than offset the contribution from new fields.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, here is what I can tell you for the rest of the year. OPEC quotas, PSC price effect, and market demand will continue to be large factors beyond our control in determining production volumes. In the third quarter, maintenance will remain at seasonally high levels, including the completion of following maintenance plus full shutdowns of Bruce and Elgin Franklin. Contributions from new fields will be mainly Akpo and Tahiti. For the fourth quarter, the seasonal maintenance will be finished and this effect on production should reverse.</p>
          <p>One of our goals for this year was to start at five major projects. Akpo and Tahiti are online, and contributed about 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent to date, net to Total in the second quarter. The three remaining major projects, like Yemen LNG, Qatargas II train B and Tombua Landana, should all started this year, and a year from now the five major projects should be contributing about 200,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day in net.</p>
          <p>I would also like to say a few words about two LNG projects that are starting this year. We expect Yemen LNG to start production by end of August or beginning of September, and Qatargas II should start early in the fourth quarter, so they should have a positive impact on production in the fourth quarter and ramp up in 2010.</p>
          <p>Yemen and Qatargas II are two of the last low cost LNG projects that the industry has launched. Yemen for example cost only about $4.5 billion for 6.7 million ton per year capacity. Mainly because of this LNG from Yemen and Qatargas II, we'll be very competitive with unconventional gas in the US market and on average will be profitable when <mark type="inaudible" /> is between 3 and $4 per million BTU.</p>
          <p>Another project that I would like to comment on is our joint venture with Cobalt in the Gulf of Mexico. We spud the first well about two weeks ago. We plan to drill five wells over the coming year. We are pleased to be working with Cobalt, and also pleased that the joint venture combines the talents and the strengths of each company. Access to resources is a constant challenge for our industry, and we believe this joint venture with Cobalt is a good way to expand our portfolio.</p>
          <p>In June, we agreed to form a partnership with a Russian company Novatek to develop the onshore Termokarstovoye field located in Yamalo-Nenets region. This field has a potential reserve of about 350 million barrel of oil equivalent of gas and condensate. Total and Novatek will carry out appraisal and development to this with the target launch date some time in 2011 for this project. These partnerships represent a fast and efficient way to add opportunities to the portfolio.</p>
          <p>We are also continuing to find oil and gas through exploration. In the second quarter, we had a positive appraisal well in offshore Congo, in the north of the Moho Bilondo field, and we also add a significant gas and condensate discovery on Niscota in Colombia.</p>
          <p>Our strategy has not changed we remain convinced that oil prices will trade into 60, $80 per barrel range for the medium term, and then move higher as demand becomes constrained by supply. Our goal is to maintain capital discipline and position the company with future growth to benefit from rising commodity prices.</p>
          <p>Now, I will comment on the Downstream and Chemicals. The TRCV margin indicator was down 64% sequentially to $12 per ton. Refining margins were squeezed between increasing oil prices and very poor demand, in particular from middle distillates. Consequently, we decided to reduce refinery runs in Europe and the US, so our utilization rate was 84% compared to 8% in the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Downstream adjusted net operating income was $213 million in the second quarter, reflecting the poor refinery margins and the less favorable environment for supply optimization. <mark type="inaudible" /> did well even if demand was poor.</p>
          <p>Despite the challenging environment, our strategies to anticipate long-term market trends and focus on increasing our middle distillate yield by investing in our best refineries in Europe like Leuna, Antwerp and Normandy. Modernizing the Port Arthur refinery on the US Gulf coast and building the new Jubail refinery in Saudi Arabia to supply the Middle East and Asian markets.</p>
          <p>Refining is a core activity for Total, it is a cyclical activity, and we have the resources and the commitment to take the steps necessary to position our sales for the recovery.</p>
          <p>Moving to Chemicals, the story was slightly better there. Compared to a net loss in the first Chemical posted net operating income of $97 million in the second quarter. This improvement was mainly due to a successful cost cutting that we start last year as part of the consolidation and restructuring plan. We are also seeing the signs of demand recovery, particularly in Asia.</p>
          <p>Our petrochemicals volumes were slightly higher, but margin remained poor. Our specialties, the improved performance resulted from an increasing product demand during the second quarter from the very depressed levels we had at the start of the year.</p>
          <p>For both Downstream and Chemicals, the environment will remain difficult until demand recovers to a more substantial level. Particularly in these segments we recognize the importance of our ongoing cost reduction and optimization programs, so this will remain a high priority.</p>
          <p>And finally, on the corporate side, in May of this year, we paid the remainder of the 2008 dividend, &#x20AC;1.4 per share. This brings the full year 2008 dividend to &#x20AC;2.28 per share, an increase of 10% compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>At its meeting yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the payment of an interim 2009 dividend on November 18, in the amount of &#x20AC;1.14 per share. The ex-dividend date will be November 13, for the ADR the ex-dividend date will be November 9.</p>
          <p>In settling the amount of the interim dividend, the Board reiterated its confidence in the future of the company, while recognizing the need to be prudent in this still difficult environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of our CapEx needs, it is too soon to say if we will spend our $18 billion budget this year. CapEx costs are trending down, and the launch date for certain projects may be delayed as we continue to work for the FEED and look for ways to improve efficiency and returns. But other factors like foreign exchange may add reverse effects.</p>
          <p>On the subject of our stake in Sanofi, you can see that our participation was down to 9.7% at the end of the second quarter, and we are continuing to sell the share in line with our plan to monetize this position by 2012.</p>
          <p>Ordinarily, the environment today is very different from the one that we had at the beginning of the year. Our full demand has not yet recovered. We are no longer in free fall.</p>
          <p>Regarding oil prices, they appear to be holding above $60 per barrel on average and this is a fairly comfortable level for us in term of managing cash flows, considering our CapEx dividend, and divestment program. OPEC has demonstrated the discipline necessary to support prices in their target range.</p>
          <p>For Total, we have better visibility, and we are more confident now than we were in the first quarter, but we believe it is wise to remain cautious. We will continue to work hard on cutting cost, we will enforce strict capital discipline on all new projects that are launched, and we will look for efficient ways towards new opportunities to the portfolio.</p>
          <p>And now we can go to the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Theepan Jothilingam from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Patrick just a couple of questions, actually. Firstly in the downstream, can you give an update on sort of what the environment you're seeing in July, and what you potentially see as the utilization rates through Q3, do you think you will have to cut more runs?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just on costs. Firstly on Jubail, could you perhaps give a little bit of a break down on how you managed to reduce those costs. Was it just raw materials or was there anything else involved? And on the cost question, you'd provided a chart in February talking about the cost trends of the major components on CapEx, so I was wondering whether you could give an update on what you've seen so far in the first half. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Theepan, for your question. On the downstream environment I will focus on Europe, because this is where we are, mainly. Refining margin are currently very low, between $10 and $15 per ton. I think this morning they were around $10 per ton. In this environment, it might be interesting to reduce runs again, and reduce our outflow from refineries, and we are studying that currently. Obviously the market is fully supplied currently, there is too much product on the market, and there is too much production coming from refineries.</p>
          <p>So we are considering things to temporarily maybe shut down units in some refineries. That was you first question? The cost in Jubail, we unfortunately are not going to give you any detail in contract that we have signed with contractors, but I can tell you that any particular contract, old contract has been reduced, and some of the contracts have been reduced by more than 40%. In average, it lead to cost cut by 25%, which is a tremendous amount of money. It's a mix of things, but every line in the initial budget was cut very, very deeply. And can you repeat your third question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was just wondering, you showed the chart in February of some of the cost trends for the components of CapEx, looking at those LNG offshore pipes. So I was just wondering if you had any data on how H1 has &#x2013; how the movements we've seen in H1 have progressed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In term of cost cutting, we launched a large cost cutting exercise, and that roughly costs are going down. You won't see that immediately on CapEx, because there is a lag effect of maybe 18 months, something like this. We are already seeing that in OpEx. Our OpEx costs are going down, and we anticipate that our technical costs for this year could be lower than the technical costs we had last year. Currently our technical costs are $1 per barrel below the average of 2008 last year. So, we are seeing costs going down on OpEx. And for CapEx you will see the effect in the forthcoming &#x2013; I would say, one year to two year. And of course, we will give you more detail in our September <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>The following question is from Mr. Jason Kenney from ING Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Jason from ING</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the volumes, if I may, the full year '08 results, you mentioned that the combination of Akpo and Tahiti could give you 75,000 barrels a day net, 2009. You say that's 30,000 barrels a day net as of Q2. What kind of contribution are we seeing in the second half? And then for the five key projects this year, in full year '08 results, you said they would add 230,000 barrels a day net in 2010. Yet, I think earlier in your commentary today you said only 200,000 barrels a day net for those five projects, so maybe just a bit of clarity there if possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Akpo and Tahiti we will be at plateau at 4Q this year. So we will enjoy the full benefit of Akpo and Tahiti by the fourth quarter of this year. And in aggregate, with Tombua Landana started, Yemen LNG and Qatargas II, I anticipate that the contribution of those projects for this year would be something like 70 to 80,000 barrel per day. There is no change in that.</p>
          <p>I did mention that the overall five projects, Akpo and Tahiti, Tombua Landana, Yemen and Qatargas too will contribute by 200,000 barrel per day in 2010. That's the average contribution for 2010, that's not the full plateau of production of those projects. And the Akpo is &#x2013; will be at plateau at 225,000 barrel per day, Tahiti at 125,000 barrel per day. In Akpo we own 24%, in Tahiti 17%, I mean you just run the figures and I think you will find your way to do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the point in question though was that, on the full year results, you were thinking 230 though. I mean it is just a phasing issue here or is this 30,000 barrels a day difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say that it is between 200 and 230. I'm not precise enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I've got a follow-up question, if I may. Can you just put some color around the resource and development scale for the Sanofi gas development and Russian &#x2013; the Russian move, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the idea of Novatek was to bring the expertise of Total in the <mark type="inaudible" /> gas field, and that's the kind of joint venture we like, because we bring expertise, and they bring some resources and together we can achieve to develop the field. If you only restrict the comment on Novatek, that's it.</p>
          <p>I'd like, and I take this opportunity to make a comment on the Shtokman project, which is in Russia also, where we bring expertise with petrol to Gazprom. The FID is not for tomorrow, we will FID by 2011, something like this, maybe late 2010 I'm assuming more than &#x2013; it will be in 2011. But those are &#x2013; this evidence that Total is moving forward to Russia, step-by-step, with no emergency and try to bring its expertise to enlarge its exposure to Russia's gas assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Mrs. Lydia Rainforth from Oxys Capital. Please go ahead madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Lydia Rainforth from Barclays Capital, actually. Just in relation to &#x2013; you mentioned CLOV and Egina would be sanctioned next year. Is that a delay from the original target, and if so, how much are you hoping to save on those? And then secondly, on my calculations, the volumes that were lost in the quarter look to have been lower margin than average for your portfolio. Is that a fair assessment? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on CLOV and Egina, currently we do not anticipate any delay, but as I mentioned to you, we are in a very strong and efficient cost cutting exercise. And if and when we did, we did launch another bid, if we are not that pleased with the result of the initial bid. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to give you any date &#x2013; any specific date for those projects, but keep in mind that, if needed, in order to reduce the costs if we think that the costs and the prices quoted by the contractors are not good enough, we could launch a second bid to reduce the costs. And could you repeat your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just in terms of the, sort of the production volumes were a lot lower, but in terms of the margins per barrel that you had, if it was improved relative to the peer group. Were they low margin barrels that you actually lost in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Mainly our OPEC cuts are related to low margin barrels, and I think that's the explanation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the same on Nigeria. We lost some barrels in Nigeria due to security reasons and those are low margin barrels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just longer term, given that they are low margin barrels, do you want to keep those in your portfolio?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I've got a few questions. The first is really when you look at your production profile, especially this quarter, you've had significant effects from OPEC quota cuts, et cetera. Have you decided, with the move with Cobalt, to really focus on non-OPEC countries, to start thinking about exploring and now to rebalance the portfolio? And related to that, could you give us a drilling outlook for your joint venture with Cobalt this year and next, in terms of when the wells are going to be &#x2013; the exploration wells are going to be drilled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Okay. The Cobalt venture we had, first of all I will make some comment is that it is &#x2013; by doing this joint venture, we acknowledge the fact that we were not good in the Gulf of Mexico. That we need to team up with somebody having the ability to choose the right blocks, and to drill the wells in a way which could be successful. The project with Cobalt is to drill five wells for the first year. The first well is already spudded, so there will be five more wells</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> in the coming year and that we will see. I remind you that any blocks which will be taken by Cobalt we will join them. So it's an ongoing business I would say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay just in terms of maybe any comments of the US versus other areas, do you see your exposure to OPEC now being more of a problem from your production profile point of view than you may have done in the past?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't see it as a problem, it is a fact. It is a fact also that we are willing to enlarge our exposure to OECD countries like the US where we are not, and it is, I would say, a weak point that we would like to correct by being successful with the Cobalt joint venture.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I wondered if you could just comment on E&amp;P, which actually despite the weak volume seemed to perform very well financially compared to your peer group, just you mentioned $1 a barrel less on technical costs so far year-to-date, and I wonder if you could give us some guidance as to where you think that might go for the balance of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question was just the pace of Sanofi disposal has been sort of quite variable quarter-to-quarter since you've sort of committed to sell out, by 2012, and I just wondered if you could give us a little bit of insight into your thinking about the pace of quarterly sales? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I start with Sanofi. I don't want to give the rate per quarter, because I don't want the market to anticipate my sell. So, I am selling when I want, and the only objective is to have complete our sales program by 2012 late, and that's it. It happened that the market was favorable this quarter, and that we enjoy it, and we take this opportunity to sell large amount of Sanofi shares this quarter. So, it is an opportunistic way to manage our sale, and that's it. There is nothing defined in advance.</p>
          <p>As far as the OpEx per barrel is concerned, my estimate is that, by year end, the technical cost should be, in 2009, should be lower than the one we had in 2008. But, there is some foreign exchange effect that I do not control. So I have to wait until this for the second half to be sure for them of what I was telling you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. I had two questions please. First on the Q2, I note that the tax rate in both Chemicals and R&amp;M have practically halved sequentially. I wonder if we should anticipate a continuation of that in the rest of the year, or any guidance you can give us would be helpful. And secondly, a more general question. Your peer group is responding to the weakness in the environment with a combination of reductions in CapEx, cost cutting, and now dividend cuts. You are obviously working hard on CapEx cost reductions, could you just remind us of how of your approach setting of the dividend policy, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Coming &#x2013; starting with the tax hike for Chemical and Downstream. Obviously, there is mixed effects on &#x2013; I pretty well reviewed the Downstream, and not so much of Chemical, so I will concentrate my comments on Downstream. It's a combined effect of our trading group tax rate and refining and marketing tax rate. So &#x2013; and it is difficult to anticipate. Basically, we are paying less taxes in trading than we are in refining and marketing, when we are making profits. I remind you that sometime in refining we are losing money, which is granted as the status of our activity in refining. Normally, it should be in the range of 30%. That would be normal average, sustainable tax rates for our activity in Europe I would say, and basically as you know, we enjoy global tax system in France, by which any income made in any country which is taxed at a lower rate than 33% is then taxed in France. So the average tax hike should be about 30%.</p>
          <p>On dividend policy, you saw that the Board of Directors maintained the interim dividend at &#x20AC;1.14 per share, showing its confidence in the company. You know that we are in a very volatile environment, your point was that 35% beginning of the year, $35 beginning of the year, and it is now close to 70. I think we are on the 31st of July, it's quite premature to anticipate anything for dividend, which would be decided by the Board in February, by the way. So, it is &#x2013; they do have time to think, and to see what would be the environment at that date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one supplementary one, going back to trading in R&amp;M, can you quantify this quarter, the trading profit, please?</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from  Mr. Jon Rigby from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. It's Jon Rigby from UBS . A couple questions, the first is just on your production and production growth, because I don't think you were unusual in this, but if I look across the profiles, since perhaps 2004, it's basically been falls not rises. And the reason why I pick it up is that I think  comment consent would have you as the sort of the growth-y major,  I think you'd like to place yourself there. And production has not really risen as prices have risen. It's not really risen as prices have fallen. So, is this something structural that you've got a problem with, or you can identify that's held you back, because it's not like you haven't had projects coming on-stream in the last four or five years? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second is about Qatargas and Yemen. Does the fact that you're an incumbent gas producer in the North Sea, selling into the UK market come into the equation when you decide where you are going to take LNG cargos, because presumably, the price effects of LNG coming into the UK will have a knock-on effect into your incumbent E&amp;P position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Coming on your first tough question about production growth, your figures are correct, and the profiles your figure out on since 2004 is correct. There are many factors. It is a combination of portfolio changes of our larger back exposure, and of course of our larger exposure in Nigeria, which got us more than 100,000 barrel a day.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we have to face some kind of half-nationalization, I would say, in Venezuela and in Libya. And unfortunately or fortunately we are not in OECDs, very little exposure in OECDs, and the result of that is what you have seen in our production profile. Technically speaking, keep in mind, that we have always delivered our project in due time. And if there is any delay in any project in the forthcoming years, this would be because of the cost reduction process. So the underlying growth exists, I am sorry to say that again, but it exists.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's more of an issue of the portfolio spread of your existing production as opposed to what you're adding into it at the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, when you look at our portfolio, and the next project we are going to launch, you have Egina CLOV, Block 32, Laggan and Tormore to be launched in 2010, so we have a bulk of new projects coming again. And as I mentioned to you the project which will be launched this year which are already launched which are at Akpo, Tahiti, Tombua Landana, Yemen, Qatargas II will contribute by 200,000, maybe 230,000 barrels per day next year. So I hope that we will not going to face any new adverse effect from anything that I could &#x2013; are not in our control that we could show again a growth of production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Thanks. And on LNG and whether you have any commercial thoughts about where you would take it as it interacts with the rest of your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It obviously interacts, and we see the gas price in the UK as low, as in the US currently. What you &#x2013; and we saw gas demand going down, and we were reduced by lower gas demand by something like 1% of our production this quarter, so we see some effect. And the UK gas price is an anticipation of the coming LNG cargos, so we see obviously the effect of this LNG projects coming on-stream Keep in mind also that even due to the low cost base of those projects, even with gas price in the UK or in the US between 3.5 and $4 per million BTU, both Qatargas II and Yemen LNG are still profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And this is &#x2013; sorry just as a follow up. Does the low UK gas price, this summer encourage you to do more maintenance, suddenly you've found a bit more painting to do on the platforms and so on, because the volumes are just not worth producing or not producing as aggressively as you might have done before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't plan it like this because we did not anticipate the big drop -such a big drop in gas price. Now, fortunately we have large maintenance when the gas price is low, but it is by coincidence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

Just a quick clarification Patrick on your $3.50 to $4 LNG profitability requirement just if I recall correctly that includes some return assumption is that right?

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes this includes the return requirement at 3.50, $4 per million BTU, the ROI of our projects are above our threshold rates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hello gentlemen, I have a question about your neutrality cash flow point for 2009. At the beginning of the year, you expected to be broadly cash flow neutral at $70, obviously it is &#x2013; it was under I guess a higher downstream and petrochemicals expectation. Where do you see your cash flow neutrality point in 2009, if Downstream and Chemicals stay weak as they are today?</p>

          <p>Currently with the &#x2013; and I can tell you we monitor it very carefully on a monthly basis, currently with the refining margin and the Chemicals, but keep in mind that the Chemical are getting better today. With the refining margin, our breakeven cost price is between 70 and $75 per barrel. And I remind you that we can sell Sanofi shares, and that something like &#x20AC;2 billion of Sanofi is face value, which would be roughly our rate of selling Sanofi shares, is lowering our breakeven cash by $15 per barrel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have a follow-up. This is &#x2013; the 75 or 70-75 range your earmark is totally in line with your Q2 achievement, if we exclude say a very negative working capital movement. Is there something special with this minus 2.4 cash flow impact, negative in Q2?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon gentlemen. I have two questions please. Firstly, on Nigeria, you said you'd like to keep low margin barrels in your portfolio, but obviously Nigeria has been a serious drag on your production. So under what scenario would you consider exiting onshore Nigeria, and can you still be involved in LNG and deepwater if you're not in the onshore?</p>
          <p>And secondly on Iraq, what's your thinking around access to Iraq and the second bidding round? I think you bid unsuccessfully for West Kurna in round one. So can you give us some color on your intentions there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Iraq it is obvious that Iraq is a very important country for us. We were unsuccessful, but I would say we were &#x2013; many people were like us, and I'm not sure if the successful one is the one you think. The commercial terms offered by the Iraqis were not acceptable by the industry, and therefore the bidding process was not a success for the Iraqis. And this is unfortunate, because I think the industry can bring a lot to the country. And we are still interested, and we are still continuing to discuss things with the Iraqis, like I think other companies, and we are not the only one doing so.</p>
          <p>On Nigeria, there is a huge potential on onshore and on offshore. You cannot forget an asset like this, just because you are facing difficulties at one point in time. Yes, we are facing difficulties. Production is going down onshore and <mark type="inaudible" /> are suffering a lot in our production profiles due to that. But we still maintain our interest for this offshore asset. Also, I like to remind you also that most &#x2013; all of them, our new project are offshore.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon, Patrick. Most have been answered. Just one left, you described your dividend policy at the start of the year as one of being competitive growth. Do you feel that that policy is &#x2013; clearly environment's important &#x2013; but do you feel that that policy is still intact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's obvious that if you have a look to the figure like this, we are facing a difficulty, which is because of effect which are of &#x2013; action which are not in our control, OPEC, Nigeria, price effect and so on. I repeat, what I mentioned, we delivered all our project in due time, and the underlying growth is there, as scheduled. Unfortunately, they are external effects...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is that &#x2013; so should I start worrying much more about a policy of competitive growth whatever in your dividends surrounding your ability to control or otherwise, your production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry I was thinking about our policy to increase the growth of what to &#x2013; maintain the growth of production. So on dividend, we had to deal with the environment. Our payout ratio today is 66%, we can live with that for a certain period of time, and it is still our target in average to increase our dividend, and this policy remains.</p>
          <p>If you compare us to some US companies, they have low payout ratio, so they can increase their dividend even in those current situations, where for us we have a 66% payout, where the US companies are more in the 50s. It's more difficult for us currently, I acknowledge that fact, but we &#x2013; if you follow us, and believe that there will be a recovery, and that the oil price will rise again in the forthcoming years, you will see this policy maintained.</p>

          <p>May I can make a closing comment. Prior everybody is leaving. Just a few comments that on year-on-year result shows that we are quite resilient, I would say very resilient and competitive with our peers. In this challenging environment, the announcement of the interim dividend confirms our confidence in the future, and I stress how strong was and is our balance sheet today.</p>
          <p>Again in term of operation we are delivering five major projects that we say would started this year and I maintain that. In the second quarter Akpo and Tahiti contributed again by 30,000 barrel per day net to Total. And a year from now, all those five projects will contribute by 200, 230,000 barrel per day.</p>
          <p>And at last I like to reassess that we are continuing and pursuing an important program of cost cutting and project of optimization. Of course, in mid-September we will give you more color on our strategy. Bye, bye everyone.</p>
