        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining Telef&#xF3;nica's 2010 nine months results conference call.</p>
          <p>Today with me I have Julio Linares, our Chief Operating Officer; Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a; Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America; Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe; and <mark type="inaudible" />, our newly appointed CFO who from now on will be joining these calls. During the Q&amp;A session, you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to any of us.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months of the year, we have posted a set of strong earnings, delivering on priorities established for the year on the back of our unmatched diversification and our execution skills. Top line trends keep improving with growth rate accelerating in the third quarter, improving by a sound commercial performance and by strong mobile data revenues. Our profitability continues to stand out, with higher commercial activities for the year having limited impact on OIBDA margin erosion as we reaped the benefits of our integrated approach and our scale.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver a strong cash flow generation, which is combined with the balance sheet strength. And year-to-date results are aligned with our internal expectations of improving trends along the year, and thus we're comfortably on track to achieve 2010 outlook, as well as we will be ramping up in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We also reiterate our 2012 guidance, including growing dividends. In 2010, we are distributing &#x20AC;1.4 per share with a dividend charge to unrestricted reserves of &#x20AC;0.65 having being paid at the beginning of this week.</p>
          <p>On slide number three, we show a summary of the first nine months 2010 P&amp;L, highlighting a sustained earnings momentum. Reported year-on-year growth rates have been impacted positively mainly by the revaluation of our pre-existing stake in Vivo, changes in consolidation and ForEx.</p>
          <p>However, focusing on organic growth rates and excluding the impact from capital gains and restructuring costs in Germany, in nine months, we have recorded a strong acceleration from first half figures by leveraging our diversified portfolio. Let me stress that in Q4, our diversification will go further with a higher exposure to emerging markets due to our increased stake in Vivo.</p>
          <p>Reported top line went up 6% year-on-year in the nine months to September 2010, posting consolidated sales to top &#x20AC;44.3 billion. In organic terms, total revenue increased 2.5% year-on-year, or 0.5 percentage points more than in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>OIBDA ended the period just around &#x20AC;20.4 billion to 0.5% up year-on-year in reported terms, which turns into a 2.3% year-on-year decline in organic terms, reflecting the lower contribution from our businesses in Spain, the sharp increase in commercial activity across regions and the negative impacts from regulatory measures, non-recurrent effects and restructuring costs just mentioned.</p>
          <p>As for profit to cash flow generation, cumulative operating cash flow to September exceeded &#x20AC;13 billion with a year-on-year performance impacted by close to &#x20AC;2.5 billion investment in spectrum in Germany and Mexico in 2010.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, with January through September 2010 net income exceeded &#x20AC;8.8 billion, with a 66% year-on-year growth or 67% in terms of EPS, which reached &#x20AC;1.95. Reported figures show material impacts from several effects. First, we have recorded &#x20AC;3.8 billion at the OIBDA level in the third quarter derived from the revaluation of our pre-existing stake in Vivo at its fair value at the date of acquisition of the 50% stake of Portugal Telecom in Brasilcel.</p>
          <p>The impact in net income is lower due to &#x20AC;321 million of tax effect. Second, we have booked a restructuring charge of &#x20AC;202 million in the third quarter of the year in Germany, as the integration process of Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany and HanseNet is going ahead of plan. And third, in the third quarter of 2010, we have included a negative charge of &#x20AC;191 million related to the transfer of the difference in market value of our stake in BBVA from equity to our financial results, which continues to be registered as financial investments available for sale. As a result, we are fully on track to meet our 2010 EPS target of &#x20AC;2.10 per share.</p>
          <p>Slide five shows the remarkable customer growth reported up to September, driven by our solid commercial momentum across geographies. Group accesses reached the 282 million mark. Organic net adds in the first nine months of the year almost doubled last year's figures and totaled 13.5 million on the back of higher gross adds and churn containment.</p>
          <p>We continue push on value in growth levers. Close to 60% of our organic mobile net adds to date were on contract. Thus already 31% of our base is on postpaid, three percentage points more than in September 2009. On the other hand, mobile broadband adoption is booming, showing  a positive 73% annual growth in accesses. I'd also like to mention the higher penetration of bundles, a key driver of retail fixed broadband expansion, and improved trends in fixed line.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide six, we are actively pursuing the growth opportunities in our markets, leveraging our integrated approach and diversified portfolio which drive our best in class organic growth rate. Organic revenue year-on-year growth recorded the four sequential improvement, despite a weaker performance in Spain, ramping up 50 basis points from the first half to 2.5% up to September, underpinned by telecom Telef&#xF3;nica Latam and Telef&#xF3;nica Europe.</p>
          <p>Global initiatives launched last year to fully capture the benefits of our scale are also a differentiating factor or our growth profile. Excluding headwinds from MTR cuts, organic sales growth would have accelerated to 3.7% up to September. In reported terms, revenue trends are also improving with 7.3% year-on-year growth recorded in the third quarter being fuelled by the fast customer growth and increased usage on the top of the positive impact from FX and changes in consolidation.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven outlines how we are fully exploiting the mobile data growth potential across regions. Total mobile data revenues rose over 21% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2010 in constant currency, driven by the continued adoption of smartphones and high-end devices. Data revenues already account for 26% of group mobile service revenue on the back of a strong non-peer-to-peer SMS revenue, which rose 36% year-on-year ex-ForEx. We are recording strong mobile broadband volumes; in fact, MBB users accounted for 9% of our mobile accesses, four percentage points more than a year ago. Especially remarkable is the robust take-up in the more mature European markets where mobile broadband penetration has already reached close to 20% of our base.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the low penetration in Latin America provides us with a differentiated additional growth lever versus our peers. And the strong demand recorded in countries like Venezuela, where penetration is well above the average for the region, further supports these high growth prospects.</p>
          <p>To accelerate mobile broadband adoption, we continue to broaden our portfolio of devices with good demand for recently launched iPhone 4, BlackBerry Curve 9300, HTC Touch, Samsung Galaxy and Nokia 5800 among others. On top of this, new operating systems will further force the competition and enhance the mobile broadband opportunity. In parallel, we continue to enhance mobile broadband product modernization for more segmented data tariffs based on offers with data control, thus avoiding flat rates.</p>
          <p>The drive on commercial activity has had limited impact on our profitability, and we continue to post strong margins in underlying terms as you can see in slide number eight. Group operating expenses grew 6% year-on-year in organic terms up to September. Commercial costs, with the high single digit organic increase and network costs, mainly Telef&#xF3;nica Latam, explain two-thirds of the consolidated OpEx year-on-year growth.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, OIBDA performance continues to dragged by non-recurrent items and negative regulatory impact. Excluding these effects, OIBDA would have increased year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Stripping out the restructuring costs recorded in the quarter in Germany, pressure on OIBDA and OIBDA margin eased during the third quarter as we are reaping benefits from the revenue rebound and taking advantage of our scale. Let me also stress that global initiatives have contributed with 0.9 percentage points to the nine months OIBDA growth.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number nine, we show that January through September 2010 CapEx reached over &#x20AC;7 billion, 66% above last year's figure in non-organic terms, mainly due to investments in spectrum in Germany and Mexico. In organic terms, and excluding the spectrum acquisition, CapEx increased 6% year-on-year. However, we continue to prioritize CapEx in growth platforms, which account for 76% of total investments through September, excluding spectrum costs.</p>
          <p>As a result, operating cash flow rose by 7% year-on-year to exceed the &#x20AC;13 billion mark, while stripping out investments in spectrum, it would have posted a 5.2% drop year-on-year, purely organic. It is worth highlighting the underlying growth and growing cash from T-Latam and T-Europe that offset the lower contribution of T-Espa&#xF1;a. I'd like to highlight that Telef&#xF3;nica's competitive advantage in OpEx and CapEx leveraged on our integrated management model.</p>
          <p>On slide number 10, under guidance criteria, revenue growth in the first nine months of the year was 3.9%, fully aligned with our 2010 target. OIBDA is still below full year guidance but consistent with the anticipated performance along the year. We do reiterate our target with a further acceleration in the last quarter of the year as we will have less challenging year-on-year comparison in Telesp and Colombia wireline and commercial activity ramped up from the third quarter of 2009 onwards.</p>
          <p>CapEx up to September surpassed &#x20AC;4.6 billion. However, mainly due to seasonality, this figure should not be annualized as an estimate for the full year. We do maintain our targets for 2010.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number 11 to review our regional performance starting with Spain. Adverse trading conditions continued to impact the business; the one comparable terms year-on-year declines in top line show a gradual recovery versus last year, dropping 3.8% year-on-year to September, 2.6 percentage points below the decline posted in the first nine months of 2009, on the back of stronger commercial activity recorded in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we posted weaker performance, mainly driven by lower voice traffic across businesses. Due to pressure on high margin revenues and high commercial costs, OIBDA in comparable terms dropped 5.8% through September, though showing as well a better year-on-year improvement as further efficiencies were captured in costs. It is worth highlighting that Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a continues to post a benchmark profitability with a healthy 47.8% OIBDA margin on a comparable basis up to September.</p>
          <p>On the wireless business, commercial activity in the third quarter remains solid with a remarkable performance in contract. Postpaid net adds increased sequentially along the year and in the first nine months of the year were 1.7 times higher than in the same period of last year, leading to a 7% year-on-year growth in the contract base. Our focused commercial efforts drove gross adds up sharply, while we sustained our best in class postpaid churn at 1.4%. As a result, 67% of our mobile customers are already on contract.</p>
          <p>Despite difficult conditions, mobile data revenue continues gaining traction with active mobile broadband users doubling last year's figure, driving growth in connectivity revenue to 59% year-on-year through September. Please notice that total data revenue are still impacted by a lower contribution from premium SMS due to changes in regulation. As a result, non-peer-to-peer SMS data revenues accounted for 66% of total data revenues, up close to six percentage points year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Mobile service revenue weaker performance quarter-on-quarter is mainly explained by lower traffic in a difficult environment. It is also worth to mention that MTR cuts had a negative impact of over three percentage points in the service revenue year-on-year change.</p>
          <p>On the wireline business in Spain, on slide 13, I would like to highlight the increased commercial activity recorded in the third quarter across all services. Retail line losses continued to improve significantly, recording the lowest quarterly net loss since Q3 of '08. These losses are almost offset by net adds in the wholesale segment that generate revenue for us leading to a limited decline of our total wireline accesses year-on-year of only 0.6%.</p>
          <p>Quarterly fixed broadband net adds increased 24% sequentially, driven by the improvement in gross adds and churn, reflecting our constant efforts to increase the premium value of our offer which allowed us to record the highest share of net adds since the third quarter of 2009 and to sustain us from 54% market share. In pay TV, we continue enhancing our competitive position with a 19% market share as net adds to September almost doubled year-on-year.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, Q3 '10 year-on-year performance in comparable terms was mainly affected by lower Voice &amp; Access driven by weaker profit and the lower contribution from the subsidiaries that offset higher data and IT revenues. Internet and broadband revenue were negatively hit by the 8% year-on-year erosion in broadband connectivity ARPU amidst stiff competition. On the positive side, it should be noticed the decreasing exposure to traditional Voice and Access revenues with new businesses accounting for 43% of total wireline revenue.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 14 to review our Latin American operations, I'd like <mark type="inaudible" /> the steady acceleration of our businesses and made good economic growth in the region. Strong commercial momentum remains with a total of net adds of 10.6 million in the first nine months of 2010, close to two times those for the previous year. Year-on-year organic growth rate accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to reach 6.9% up to September, fueled by double-digit growth in mobile service revenues and fixed broadband and pay TV revenues, and the ramp up in growth in countries that account for 70% of our revenues in the region.</p>
          <p>OIBDA trends also improved to 4.8% year-on-year organic OIBDA in the first nine months of 2010, a 0.9 percentage point sequential improvement, ahead of revenues. OIBDA margins stood at a healthy 38.1% in the first nine months, excluding the impact from the revaluation of our pre-existing stake in Vivo and despite the higher commercial activity versus last year. Then highlight that operating cash flow generation remains solid, growing in euro terms year-on-year despite the strong bolivar devaluation.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide number 15, to explain the performance of our wireless business in Latin America. Up to September, growth in wireless accesses was strong at 12% driven by good gross adds and strong retention. Our focus on enhancing customer value was reflected in the rapid expansion of our contract accesses with 53% of the total net adds in the first nine months of the year being on this segment. Mobile broadband users, another key lever to positive growth, more than doubled year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Total mobile revenue growth was driven by the 12.5% year-on-year organic increase in service revenues. Data revenues are booming, up by almost 50% year-on-year, while voice traffic rose close to 30%, fueled by our focus on exploiting the cumulative effect of growth countries. As a result, and despite the drag from regulation and fast customer growth, ARPU remained flat year-on-year with ongoing ARPU growing close to 3%.</p>
          <p>Let me outline the performance of our wireline properties in the region, where we are recording a strong commercial push. Broadband net adds continue the positive trend of previous quarters and just in the third quarter net adds surpassed the levels recorded in the first nine months of 2009, accelerating broadband access year-on-year growth to 14% on higher gross adds and lower churn.</p>
          <p>The traditional business also fostered good results in Q3, with very low net line losses driven by an improved quality and increased focus on bundles with 66% of retail fixed-lines already bundled. If you want to exclude fixed wireless accesses, the traditional business would have recorded positive net adds in the quarter. As a result of the ongoing business transformation process, new revenue sources as Internet and pay TV represent very close to 22% of total wireline revenues, one percentage point higher than last year's figure in constant currency.</p>
          <p>Let me now spend a few minutes to sum up the performance of our Brazilian assets. Telesp commercial momentum continues with net adds in the third quarter at similar levels of previous quarters, both in the traditional and the fixed broadband business resulting in a drastic change compared with the performance recorded in the first nine months of 2009. Year-to-date, we gained 45,000 fixed traditional lines with positive net adds in the last seven months. Our fixed broadband net adds reached 500,000, but it was just 22,000 last year.</p>
          <p>The good operating performance is gradually flowing to financial sequentially. Revenues turned positive in the third quarter in non-cumulative terms while OIBDA keeps improving. In wireless, Vivo posted another outstanding quarter both in terms of operating and financial metrics. Net adds were strong and Vivo increased its market share year-over-year to over 30% with a particularly notable performance in the contract segment where Vivo captured 50% of market net adds in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Financial results accelerate on cumulative terms across all metrics on the back of the strong performance of the data business, the boom in traffic and the efficiency mindset. Please notice the solid mobile service revenue growth rose to double digit and the OIBDA margin expansion to 31.2% up to September.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, we review quickly the performance of the other key operations in Latin America. In Mexico, addressing the contract segment has been our focus more recently, leading to a 53% year-on-year increase in our contract base and driving mobile service revenue up 6%. We're now focused on the reshuffle of our prepay commercial offer as we have lost momentum in the market and on a more aggressive push of mobile broadband, a big opportunity for us that after the spectrum acquisition last July, we can now better tackle.</p>
          <p>In Venezuela, our commercial activity was negatively impacted by the availability of handsets, but our financial results continued to be very robust. In Peru, revenue growth ramped up in the quarter, driven by some customer growth in fixed broadband and mobile, while OIBDA growth turned positive.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, the strong operating performance with stable traditional accesses and solid growth in mobile and fixed broadband is behind the robust performance &#x2013; the robust revenue growth and the healthy OIBDA margin. In Chile, we continue to post strong results with sequential improvements in revenue and OIBDA. To finish, Colombia, where revenues are about to grow in both businesses in the third quarter of the year, underpinned by the sustained accesses growth for the third quarter in a row.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide number 19 to show that Telef&#xF3;nica Europe once again delivered robust financial results in a very competitive market, leveraging a diversified asset portfolio. Our total customer base across Telef&#xF3;nica Europe's footprint grew by 6% year-on-year in organic terms, driven by strong growth in mobile. The contract base continues on its upward curve, accounting for over 60% of total mobile net adds in the January through September period, reaching close to 50% of our total base.</p>
          <p>Our growth smartphone portfolio as well as our targeted commercial push underpinned growth of our mobile broadband base up 46% year-on-year. Organic revenue growth for the first nine months of 2010 ramped up to 3.7% year-on-year, or to 6.4% when excluding the impact of MTRs.</p>
          <p>Non-peer-to-peer SMS revenues up 28% year-on-year in organic terms are the main growth driver of top line expansion. Profitability in comparable terms was sustained in the first nine months of the year with an OIBDA margin of 26%, impacted by higher commercial investment in customers. The U.K. and Germany continue to drive OIBDA performance while operating cash flow grew steadily by double-digit on a comparable basis.</p>
          <p>Slide number 20 would review our operation in the U.K., while Telef&#xF3;nica O2 U.K. continues to perform strongly by focusing on targeted investments in high value base in highly competitive market. This was evidenced by O2's market leading customer retention rates with contract churn of just 1.1% in the first nine months of 2010.</p>
          <p>U.K.'s mobile customer base rose 4.8% over last year after recording a 20% year-on-year increase in net adds in the third quarter. 67% of new customers were in the contract segment. As a result, postpaid customers accounts now for 47% of our total base, driven largely by the increase in demand for high-end smartphones and dongles from new and existing customers. 20% of our mobile base are on mobile broadband with strong sales of iPhone and continuing success of other devices such as BlackBerry and HTC.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth ramped up in the third quarter to 8.5% year-on-year in local currency, mainly driven by the sustained improvement in mobile service revenue to 6.3% in the third quarter and the success of hardware sales.</p>
          <p>Third quarter comparable OIBDA growth was hit by higher commercial costs following the launch of iPhone 4, as we saw an increase in the number of handset upgrades. However, profitability remained stable in the first nine months of the year compared to last year.</p>
          <p>To review the commercial and financial performance of Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany, please turn to slide 21. Our mobile customer base in Germany increased 8% year-over-year after having 1.1 million customers for the first nine months of the year. Strength in the contract segment continued with 48% of the customer base in the contract segment.</p>
          <p>I'd like to highlight that according to &#x2013; according with the annual network rankings published by the authoritative German publication Connect, Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany has for the first time overtaken Deutsche Telecom and moved into second place. This is a very significant achievement and we will fully leverage the network investment made over recent years to further push mobile broadband penetration, capitalizing also on the recent launch on the iPhone 4.</p>
          <p>Organic revenues posted a solid 7.2% year-over-year growth to September, driven by mobile service revenues, which saw an acceleration in the third quarter due to non-peer-to-peer SMS revenue growth, up 34% year-on-year. Also note that handset revenues performed strongly after the introduction of My Handy model in the second quarter of 2009, but this impact will be diluted over time, as already shown in the third quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are making good progress with the integration of HanseNet, resulting in the acceleration of our restructuring plans originally expected for 2011, and this will show payback benefits in two years. As such, we have recorded a one-off charge of &#x20AC;202 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The company continued advancing in terms of profitability, growing OIBDA in comparable terms up to September, expanding its margin, and increasing its operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 22, you see that we keep our leveraged ratio after our &#x2013; the Brasilcel acquisition at 2.4 times OIBDA, considering 100% of Vivo was in our committed target range.</p>
          <p>All of this year, despite difficult market conditions, Telef&#xF3;nica has been able to put in place a balanced financing exercise. We have entered into bank financing for an amount of 8 billion to partly finance Brasilcel acquisition and pre-finance 2011 existing debt.</p>
          <p>We have tapped the euro, U.S. dollar and sterling bond markets for an amount about &#x20AC;5 billion, and we have raised close to &#x20AC;2 billion in Latam and zone agreements with public entities. All in all, showing Group's ability in diversifying its funding sources in a tough credit market and keeping an average debt life of our total debt at six years.</p>
          <p>All this activity has been done while containing our financial expenses in the 5% mark in spite of the foreign exchange laws due to commercial debt in U.S. dollars in Venezuela, after excluding the impact of transferring from equity to financial results the difference in market value in our stake in BBVA.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have also been reinforcing our liquidity position, not only through our cash and short-term financial investments, but by our level of unused committed credit lines, which in turn has built sufficient room to accommodate the pending payments on Brasilcel acquisition.</p>
          <p>To sum up, in the first nine months of the year, we have posted strong earnings, clearly ahead of the pack, despite our exposure to Spain. Financial performance was solid across the P&amp;L, with sound growth rates from top to bottom line. Revenue continued to trend up, improving sequentially, as we do leverage our diversification, one of our key strengths, that will be even reinforced in the fourth quarter of the year with the full consolidation of Vivo, further enhancing the stability of our growth profile.</p>
          <p>We are focused on enhancing customer value, pushing key levers, namely mobile broadband and contract, where we're getting good traction. We maintain a high cash generation profile and a strong financial position with leveraged ratio in line with our outlined target.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to reiterate our confidence to deliver once more on our commitments. We are on track to meet 2010 and 2012 guidance including dividends.</p>
          <p>Please notice that the revaluation of our pre-existing stake in Vivo has had a significant positive impact in our third quarter net income. Nevertheless, we still have to complete the last quarter of the year in which we normally finalize a review of several areas, such as fixed assets, financial investments, commitments, obligations and so on, so we cannot guarantee that we will maintain this level of net income.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The first question, I wanted to ask Guillermo if you can talk about the trends in Spain in the month of October and if you can talk about how you see the fourth quarter in both mobile and fixed. And then the second question was on the organic EBITDA for the third quarter. You've indicated that you saw improvement in organic revenue in the third quarter. But when I do the math for organic EBITDA I come up with a negative number for the third quarter. And I'm wondering if in that number you're reporting, I think you say in slide three, is included the provision in Germany. What is the reason? Intuitively, it should be a positive number. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jesus, this is Guillermo. Thank you for the question. You can see in the third quarter in Spain we have witnessed this continuity in the recovery path that we have been experiencing during the last quarters.</p>
          <p>October looks very similar to September, which was a very tough month in our numbers. August and July, as you know, <mark type="inaudible" /> seasonality due to different pace of summer campaigns. But in September it was evident that the consumption was going in a different pattern than in the previous months.</p>
          <p>October has the particularity that to have more &#x2013; less labor days than the previous year. We have more Sundays and Saturdays than previous year. But all in all looks like the month is similar to September.</p>
          <p>Regarding the rest of the quarter, well it's hard to predict because the Christmas campaign is starting in a few days and the market conditions are much more volatile than before. Regarding next year, we still believe that next year is going to be better than this year and this year obviously is better than previous year. So we still believe the worst is over, but we are much more concerned about the rate and the pace of the recovery and that puts a lot of uncertainty on that rate of recovery. So we're optimistic on the mid-term, but we acknowledge that quarter-on-quarter we may see some bumps and recoveries.</p>

          <p>Jesus, this is Santiago to answer the second question you asked. If you compare the six months and the nine months you will see that OBITDA went down by 2.3% in each of those two periods. But in the last nine months we do include 202 million charges, which are coming from the restructuring, personnel restructuring in Germany, in that number. So that may be the one number you'll need to reconcile your expectation and the guidance we have provided on organic terms.</p>

          <p>Yes, a couple of questions. Can you just clarify in Spain &#x2013; it was helpful to get those comments. But is the impact you're seeing more competitive or economic or some combination of both? It would just be helpful to understand to what extent you're seeing that, because obviously, from a macro level, things, from a GDP perspective it looks slightly better.</p>
          <p>And then in Latin America, be helpful to understand you obviously had a very, very weak number in Venezuela because of the hyper-inflation accounting. How should we sort of model out the rest of the year? I guess it will depend a lot on where the currencies are, but my understanding is that it would be wrong to extrapolate the weakness of the third quarter number because you've got a kind of catch up effect from currency restatement year-to-date. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi Tim, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Let me take the question from Spain. Regarding competitive environment and microeconomics and our numbers, well, the two main competitors that we have in Spain, both Vodafone and Orange, has also posted their results and they both showing a third quarter which is weaker in terms of revenues than the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So basically, what we're seeing is in the larger players in the markets we are all having a third quarter that is weaker in terms of revenues and results compared to the second one.</p>
          <p>In our case, our view is that's market conditions basically, consumption, and some peoples have now disclaimed that this is linked to historic measures that were put in place in &#x2013; between May and July. What we're seeing is that the drop in particularly mobile and also in the fixed lines is weaker in this quarter. And also their market continues to be as competitive as before. But there's no significant change in the competitive dynamics within the third quarter and the second quarter. What has changed quarter-on-quarter is basically the consumption situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on the impact of inflation and currency slide in Venezuela. First, all the essential changes that you see are measured in constant terms, so it's excluding both effects. In terms of the currency, what we are doing on a quarterly basis is that we adjust the slide that we have seen the dollar/euro parity as the bolivar per dollar is fixed. So what you're seeing in the third quarter is the adjustment of the dollar/euro movement along the quarter extrapolated to the beginning of the year, and that's why you see this volatility. So you should take into account that the main impact is going to be the actual behavior of the dollar/euro, 'til the end of the year.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> to understand what's the nature of the cost cutting in place to allow margins to be supported at current levels? And also you've been mentioning that next year is going to be better than 2010 but it's going to be bumpy. So is there further room for cost cutting if we continue with this weakness in revenues to sustain margins and EBITDA at current levels, or the low hanging fruit has already been reaped and it's going to be more difficult to sustain margins?</p>
          <p>And second question is on Mexico, you are mentioning some change in the commercial approach and if you could elaborate on this would be useful. Why is this so negative on traffic this quarter? And when we should expect Mexico to come back to more normal growth? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Luis, let me take this. This is Guillermo. Thank you for the question. Let me take the Spanish ones. First, let me expand on the cost-cutting. Two things; one comment, we are focusing more and more on value generation, that means that, for example, in the mobile market, we are focusing more on postpaid because that generates for us more margin than prepaid and you have seen that in our numbers in the last four quarter.</p>
          <p>Second, we have been defending our margin successfully, meaning that we still have revenue, for example, market share which is in the mobile business, for example, four percentage point as our access market share. So in the commercial effort we are stronger than last year, but focusing more on value.</p>
          <p>Regarding costs, well, we are focusing on cost measures all across the place. Obviously, there are some cost initiatives that are linked to Group scale initiatives. In IT network, for example, and others are much more local, but there is still room for improvement. It's not easy, but there's still room for improvement looking into next year. So I think that we have proved to be defending our margin, which is a benchmark in Europe, successfully and we will continue focusing on that.</p>
          <p>Regarding the local ones, for example, our bad loans for non-collectable provisions, has been a positive on our margin. We've been continuing improving our ratios. And we are reducing costs in all contracts and all but personnel costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Luis. Taking your question on Mexico, we have done two things, one of them has been successful and the other has not. The first one is moving upwards our best in class prepaid customers into contract and fostering the contract product in Mexico. And therefore we have been successful on that side, increasing our customer base by more of 53%.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, we have been increasing the proposal, the value proposal to our prepaid customer upwards by eliminating meter recharges and by doing two price increases effectively. One, in order to transmit or to transfer the value added tax that was put on us to the customers and a second price increase, trying to move up with the prepaid of product betting on a better market situation. And on that side we have been wrong because the market has been very active on the low-end part of the business and therefore we have been losing market share net gain in this part of the market.</p>
          <p>We reacted, as you might imagine, we reacted very rapidly. We have raised all the meter recharges and we are back on track on doing traffic campaigns in terms of bonus minutes and bundles, but it's going to be taking a while 'til the market &#x2013; well, the markets are really reacting and we are seeing positive signs, but as the free and the first minutes that are being accounted are the free minutes even if we take a few weeks to see these new traffic flowing into revenues.</p>
          <p>So it has been a wrong marketing bit on the prepaid segment on our side, a successful one on contract. It will take a little while to be this new policy to be transferring to revenues and OIBDA, but the good thing is that it's not any structural problem, it's much more a tactical one and therefore we think that we are track to solve. On top of that, we have been successful in getting the new spectrum that we needed in order to be more aggressive on mobile broadband and as a result we think that we have everything needed to be back on track and to be competitive on the Mexican market. So you should expect from us to react and do &#x2013; to do better on prepaid in the next weeks.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions please. First, with regards to the restructuring at O2 Germany, when can we expect to see some benefits in terms of the costs kicking in? And second, with regards to Latin America, a number of the subsidiaries have apparently some positive one-offs, that's what you report in the report, specifically Chilean seeks, Peru mobile, Colombian mobile. I was wondering if you could quantify those positive one-offs that impacted the EBITDA? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Matthew. I'll pick up the Germany question. We'll actually start to see people leaving the business from quarter one next year so you should start to see the benefits flowing through from there through next year. And the pay back of the restructuring costs is set for a two year payback.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on the one-off, we are not any longer disclosing underlying terms of OIBDA excluding one-offs, because it was too complex to track. But I can tell you that in terms of one-off globally speaking, in Latin America, we have less one-off this year than the year before. So the underlying trends is robust. And namely, the most important period that we have been scoring to our numbers this quarter was the sale of our fixed towers in Chile, and that's basically the major one.</p>
          <p>But again, I can tell you that the absolute number of one-offs in terms of revenues and OIBDA is smaller this year than the year before. And then the underlying trend in OIBDA is more robust that what their accounting suggests.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I wanted to ask you on mobile data tariffs, as we are observing a shift towards tiered data plans, if you believe that may lead to some form of pricing power? I would appreciate if you can tell me your first observations about it in U.K., Germany and Spain? And secondly a question about the future ownership structure of Vivo and Telesp in Brazil?

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Luigi, hi, it's Matthew. I'll pick up your data question. The first thing to say is it's very early to say in the U.K., as we've started implementing the tiered data pricing from the first of October. The good news is, as we expected, customers' usage pattern is continuing to increase. So more and more users are actually moving into the band where we think there will be excess charges to pay. The second thing I would say is we're also looking at how we increase that level of penetration by some further tiered pricing on data, but we're still working on that one. So good news that data use is going up, more people are moving into the bands where we will charge. And secondly, we're looking at options that are actually driving that data usage penetration faster.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Luigi, Santiago again. On the Vivo/Telesp combination, we've made it public that ideally we would like to combine the two entities into a single entity. This is a multiple step process, and we are still working on the advantages and disadvantages of proceeding through alternative routes. Ideal, our ideal state of the world is to have for one listed company with two classes of share and that we think would optimize both the value for Telef&#xF3;nica shareholders and decrease the volatility of operations in there.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Luigi, this is Guillermo. I believe you also asked about mobile and pricing in Spain, yes. For the structure in Spain, the Spanish market, the data tariffs were already tiered. So the overall majority of all the tariffs, in our case it's almost 100% of our tariffs are semi-flat, meaning that the customer has an allowance of high-speed traffic, and once the allowance is used the speed is reduced to a minimum, so there is no pure value or sort of pure flat tariff. So that structure was already in place, so there's no changes in the market so far.</p>

          <p>And the second thing is are you &#x2013; have you been in the process of varying your commercial policies, because there's been a difference in trend between looking at the ARPU trend and looking at the service revenue, which makes it look like third party revenue share that disappears off is now being captured by yourselves increasingly as the quarters go by. So if that may have had an implication for subsidies, I wondered about you're thinking behind that or whether I've stopped throwing <mark type="inaudible" /> altogether.</p>
          <p>And then third on Venezuela, could you just update us on how much cash you have in local currency in the banks in Venezuela, and what the latest in terms of the outlook for that is? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our expectation, although we're still in discussion with OffCom, is that we will see the next change around April 2011 in the U.K. The level of reduction is still to be determined.</p>

          <p>And my second question, can you just walk us through the cash that you would expect to repatriate from Latin America during 2011? I guess how much from Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, et cetera, et cetera?</p>

          <p>On the question on the synergies, between Vivo and Telesp, I would say somewhat if not most of the synergies we can &#x2013; we are going to be able to capture them independently of the final structure of the company.</p>
          <p>We're already working on those in order to be &#x2013; to try to be a little bit more concrete on what is the first line of work that we are already implementing. We have already &#x2013; in terms of revenue, for example, we are already preparing our product in order to launch a fixed wireless product outside Sao Paulo, mainly for SMEs and corporates.</p>
          <p>We had extension &#x2013; we are extending the open Telef&#xF3;nica projects in terms of revenues that were not including Vivo or Telesp to both companies. And we are all also doing some joint planning for network inside and outside Sao Paulo, namely in terms of fiber deployment on the IP network.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we have already a plan to consolidate the data centers of both companies in order to &#x2013; both companies were requiring further data capacity in terms of data centers and we already explained that jointly. In order to save CapEx and OpEx for both companies.</p>
          <p>and in terms of joint purchasing, we're incorporating Vivo to the joint purchasing effort of Telef&#xF3;nica, and we are already negotiating jointly Vivo and Telesp for the equipment of both networks.</p>
          <p>And in terms of SG&amp;A optimization, of course, we already know &#x2013; we're already on track of those.</p>
          <p>So in terms of the operational synergies, full speed. We're already trying to capture the most immediate one, even optimally, some of them before year-end. And we will keep reporting to you. But the more we get into the detail, the more optimistic we are that we should be able to capture the value of the synergy that we have communicated.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jonathan, this is Miguel taking your question of repatriation. Year-to-date, we have repatriated &#x20AC;1.26 million from Latam. Roughly speaking, 475 from Brazil, 350 from Argentina, 300 from Chile, 75 from Peru and the rest from other countries.</p>
          <p>We have no special restriction for repatriation other than in Venezuela, and our policy is just to repatriate the cash we're generating there, and we are confident in continuing doing so.</p>

          <p>Hello, I'm seeing in your Spanish broadband trends that broadband ARPU is accelerating a downward trend. Can you give us some comment that is driven by promotion? There's pre-promotional pricing pressure, or if it's more macro environment, which drives that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the margin in Telesp. There's very good revenue growth report in Telesp in the third quarter, but margin is down. Is that a margin level, the 32%, we have to lift going forward, or do you see it transferring that back to old levels? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Guillermo. Let me take the question regarding the broadband ARPU in Spain.</p>
          <p>The third quarter was pretty similar to the second quarter, slightly better, 9.2% decrease compared to 9.4. We were expecting a better performance to be honest, but that was slightly better, but not that much better.</p>
          <p>Reasons. First, the different rates of the promotions that we implemented in &#x2013; both in second quarter and third quarter and the ones that we have implemented in similar quarters last year.</p>
          <p>The second driver is obviously competition. It's a very agile market, and there is coming very intense competition, particularly for resellers <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And the third one is a minor adjustment in prices like we did in April, where we reduced our 10 megabits in connection from 44.9 to 41.9. The main driver is just the competition on the different base and relevance of the promotion that we implement in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Torsten, I'm taking your question on Telesp and the APA margin.</p>
          <p>First, this 32% level that you were mentioning is measured in local accounting standards. The &#x2013; I would say the comparable terms is different because in local Brazilian GAAPs, we're including some charges like, for example, the brand fee responding to international price &#x2013; transfer pricing standards that is eliminated in consolidation.</p>
          <p>On top of that, you have a extraordinary positive items in 2009 we have a version of provision that has not been accounted in 2010. And on top of that, you have some fines and contingencies that are, by definition, non-recurrent, but that we are including in the OIBDA terms.</p>
          <p>For us internally, running all those numbers and doing the comparison in the three quarters of this year, we have been seeing a stable OIBDA margin in Telesp, in spite of a much higher commercial activity and in spite of much higher level in quality. Remember that we are already in historical highs in terms of quality standards, and that we are even beating our niche competitors in customer satisfaction already.</p>
          <p>So what I can tell you is the margin evolution of Telesp looks stable, looks above the level that you have mentioned, in spite of a significant commercial effort and a significant quality effort.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Couple of simple questions, hopefully. Just in Spain mobile, the regulation of &#x2013; what &#x2013; since you text the game shows' events , so this Premium SMS, I think it was started November last year. Just wondered if you could give us a feeling for how much that took off your growth rates in the year-to-dates in domestic mobile? And to what degree would you expect your growth to recover as we lap that effect?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just sort of big picture in Latam, just wondered if you have some basic stats on smartphone adoption at this stage. Let's say Brazil. And what you think it will take to get that smartphone penetration really accelerating from current rates in terms of sort of handset price, price per month on data access? I'm not sure you if can talk in absolute detail, but any feeling for the potential growth there would be useful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Guillermo. Let me take the question regarding mobile data.</p>
          <p>In Spain, overall, the mobile data is behaving extremely well in Spain, and connectivity revenues are growing almost 60% this first nine months of the year compared to a similar period last year.</p>
          <p>When you open the data revenues, obviously connectivity is doing very well. Traditional SMS is not behaving that well because of overall market trends and also because of cannibalization from other communication means. And premium SMS, as you mentioned, this has been hurted a little bit because of the changes in regulation, which shrinks the size of the market, no?</p>
          <p>But, overall, to give you flavor, just checking the numbers, premium SMS in one quarter is 32 million. And the decrease when you compare it to the same quarter of last year is roughly 25 million. So it is a severe decrease, but the amount is not significant in the overall numbers of the company.</p>
          <p>What changed, obviously, is the shape of the growth in data mobile ARPU, which each quarter is more relevant, the part that is non-SMS. As you can see in the chart, we show where right now it's 68% of all data revenues, mobile data revenues, are non-SMS.</p>
          <p>So that's a regulation that changed a year before, and have that keep which is relevant for that category but not relevant for the overall mobile data or revenue category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on data &#x2013; mobile broadband or data in Latam, what I can tell you that it has become one of the major if not the major growth driver in the region.</p>
          <p>On the mobile side, revenue growth is increasing on data, namely 70% in Brazil. It's practically doubling in Colombia, it's 50% higher in Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. And the growth keeps growing. We still have a very low penetration of mobile broadband, like 4%, in Latin America, but it's increasing very rapidly.</p>
          <p>Remember that we already manage 6.5 million mobile broadband customers, including smartphones and dongles. That figure has practically doubled in 12 months, and it has taken us less than three years to make a similar feel on the one that we have on wireline. So it's really booming.</p>
          <p>Data ARPU in local currency is up 29% year-on-year, and the growth keeps coming. And good news is that we have managed, for example, in Brazil, to combine that growth on mobile broadband with a sound growth on wireline broadband. So therefore we're still not at the point of cannibalization.</p>
          <p>Remember that Telesp is doing very well on the wireline side, namely Internet data, TV and IT revenues are up 30% in Argentina, 70% in Colombia, 12% in Chile, and are back on track on Telesp, Telesp having a record high in gross adds in the quarter. So ADSL will present already one-third of our total lines in Latin America.</p>
          <p>So probably at the beginning of the curve, growing very rapidly, a lot of room to go. And that's why we're preparing our network that way and investing heavily in that way. Traffic is up 8% year-on-year, and that's why we have been going for a spectrum in Mexico and in other places. So in good shape starting and very promising.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks very much, good afternoon. It's actually just really following on from the last question. But I wonder if you could just talk a bit about how your efforts to monetize mobile data in Latin America differ from the strategy you're using in Europe?</p>
          <p>I'd imagine, given the differences in network costs and the levels of consumer wealth, you need quite distinct approaches. So quite interested in hearing how those differ, and also how you're modernizing networks and how that strategy is different? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for the question. In terms of pricing strategy, for example, the answer is most likely the same that Guillermo did. We have already been applying key pricing in Latin America since the beginning, so almost over our targets &#x2013; our targets all around the region and none unlimited. And therefore, in terms of data usage, the consumer is showing some rational behavior.</p>
          <p>In terms of our network costs, again, we are upgrading our networks. We have increased our CapEx 8% this year, and we'll keep growing that. And we will need more spectrum in some places. The cost of our network is very optimal and very competitive because we take advantage of the scale of the group. Our purchasing is centralized and therefore we take advantage of the prices that Telef&#xF3;nica as a group is able to obtain, and therefore highly competitive with local competitors.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, we have one of, if not the most, extensive fiber network in Latin America with roughly 190,000 kilometers, if I remember correctly, of optical fiber. And on top of that we have the submarine cable.</p>
          <p>So basically speaking, we have a lot of infrastructure in place. We'll keep building on that. It would require still a sound CapEx effort, but we're expecting for a very sound and a very competitive position.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A question on Latin America related to Argentina. I'm wondering if you could give us an update regarding the last negotiations surrounding raising rates after they had been frozen. I know there's been some news flow there, but I just want to be up-to-date as to what the latest is regarding your ability to change rates there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no major news on that side. On the wireline side, the regulatory prices keeps frozen, and therefore there are no major changes on that one. Probably the most noticeable one is that the non-subject to regulatory fees, products or revenues is already 50% of the total revenues. And on that part, we have been able to increase prices steadily. So no major news on the traditional bucket of lines.</p>
          <p>But we keep advancing on the ADSL, on new products and services, and on the buddle with TV. And therefore, we are less and less reliant or dependent on the frozen targets. And that explains the performance of the Argentinean operation.</p>
          <p>So still half of our revenues are frozen. That's bad news. Good news is that half of our revenues are not frozen and are growing very nicely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...upon which this concession or this license was deemed to be expired. As you know, this decree has been contested in justice and therefore, it is temporarily suspended. And therefore, there is &#x2013; we are awaiting for the outcome of that process which is looking to take our wire. So on the competitive cycle, on the commercial front, no major changes. Fibertel keeps being in the market very aggressively as we are, as Telecom is. So the market in &#x2013; on the commercial side keeps the same, waiting for the final outcome of this Fibertel issue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. First question, back on Telesp for Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a. I don't know if you could tell us how much room there is still to grow from the broadband business there? Net adds have been very strong there. I don't know if you could remind us what is the broadband penetration in Sao Paulo region, and how much you compete? And eventually I think the division is coming from mid-40s March since back in 2006; I don't know what's your internal talk in terms EBITDA margin there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Telesp, we are seeing a very dynamic market. This is the first message. Since we are back on track after the expansion of last year, our product is doing very well. We have been progressively gaining market share this year, even in the third quarter, once that net has been reacting aggressively in terms of pricing. So we are seeing a very dynamic market on broadband.</p>
          <p>Penetration in Telesp, and so in Sao Paulo, we saw in the neighborhood of 26% of fixed broadband over fixed accesses in Sao Paulo. So we've seen there is still room to grow on that side. But as I was telling you before, we are pretty focused on quality. I mean, the &#x2013; and that way churn is highly contained. So for us, it's as important to keep growing in terms of gross adds as to preserve the level of churn in order not to be back on quality issues that we were mixed in the middle of last year. So we see a very robust market. Taking into consideration or as according to the model, the fact that mobile broadband is really booming in Sao Paulo, really in booming in Sao Paulo, where we will have an excellent network and has been very active as well overall competitors; so good news is that we see a significant growth ahead of us. But again, we should keep in mind that we cannot go backwards in term of quality.</p>
          <p>On top of that, remember that more than 50% of &#x2013; 55% or 56% of our total accesses have already bundled in Telesp, and more than half of our total ADSL lines are bundled with some other products. So the loyalty of our customers is also increasing. So we will keep you posted, but in the &#x2013; so far this year, it looks in good shape. It looks like we are back being competitive with Net, because Net have reacted sharply this last quarter. And in spite of that we keep gaining market share.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I was telling you before, we have been seeing a stabilization of margin in the last three quarters, excluding one-offs. In spite of the fact that we have been having last year no heavy rains in the first quarter of this year, and therefore, we have been including in that underlying margin the effort in subcontracting that we have been doing in order to preserve quality efforts. So we are more positive on margin evolution as we speak but we resist to give guidance on that side. We are more positive. We see more benign trends, but we will further update you on a quarterly basis.</p>
