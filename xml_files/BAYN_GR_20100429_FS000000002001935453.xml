          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.  Welcome to Bayer's Investor and Analyst Conference Call on the First Quarter 2010 Results.  Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.  The presentation will be followed by a question and answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Cleo.  Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, welcome also on behalf of my colleagues to our conference call during which we want to review our first quarter numbers with you.  With me on the call today are from the Holding: Werner Wenning, Marijn Dekkers, Klaus K&#xFC;hn and Werner Baumann, and from the subgroups: Arthur Higgins, Friedrich Berschauer and Patrick Thomas.</p>
          <p>As always, Mr. Wenning will start off our conference call with a brief summary of the developments in the quarter.  We assume you have all received and reviewed our stockholders' newsletter, the briefing documents and the slides, so we'll just run you through the main points.  Before handing over to Mr. Wenning, I'd like &#x2013; I'd also like to draw your attention to the safe harbor statement. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Wenning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, it's also my pleasure to welcome you to our conference call. At first, the overview.  The Bayer Group achieved strong gains in sales and earnings in the third quarter of 2010.  The recovery at MaterialScience is taking place faster than anticipated.  After a late start, business at CropScience gained considerable momentum towards the end of the quarter.  Lower sales of Yasmin/YAZ in the United States and of Betaseron prevented a better performance at Pharmaceuticals.  Consumer Health reported a successful start to the year.  Overall, we remain confident for 2010 and are raising our earnings forecast for the Bayer Group.  We are now targeting to increase core earnings per share by more than 15%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a closer look at the major business developments in the first quarter.  As usual we will be talking about portfolio and currency-adjusted amounts in most cases.  Group sales were 6% higher while underlying EBITDA was up by 13% and core EPS by 32%.  These increases were driven by the strong recovery of MaterialScience, a successful start to the year for the Consumer Health businesses and an outstanding performance at BioScience.  As guided, growth at Pharma was hampered by lower sales of Yasmin/YAZ in the United States, a decline in business with Betaseron in Germany and Russia.  Mirena and Nexavar, on the other hand, continued to grow significantly; as a result, adjusted sales of Pharma were level with the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that Yasmin and YAZ are a good choice for women seeking convenient and reliable contraception if they use the products as directed, and that the risk profile is comparable to that of other combination of oral contraceptives.  This view is supported primarily by the results of two prospective observational studies in the U.S. and in Europe with more than 120,000 users.  We are now implementing a number of new healthcare provider and consumer directed initiatives to support the recovery of the brand.  We, however, expect sales of the YAZ family to decline in the U.S. by approximately 25% this year; outside the U.S., we anticipate continued growth in the high single-digit percent range.  This leads to a mid single-digit decline of the global business.</p>
          <p>Our Consumer Health business benefited from the economic recovery, particularly in the United States.  Sales rose by nearly 7% compared to the weak prior year quarter with all divisions contributing to growth.  Underlying EBITDA of HealthCare increased due to the improvement in sales especially at Animal Health and Consumer Care.  Earnings were held back mainly by the lower sales of YAZ as well as by the last year's oncology divestitures and increased expenditures for research and development.</p>
          <p>In light of the business trends in the first quarter, we are adjusting our 2010 forecast for HealthCare as follows.  For Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate below market growth; in Consumer Health, however, we expect to expand faster than the market.  This corresponds to currency and portfolio adjusted growth for HealthCare of about 3%, against previous guidance of about 5%.  We continue to target a further increase in underlying EBITDA.  With the approvals and launches of YAZ Plus and Qlaira expected this year, and the tremendous commercial promise of our R&amp;D pipeline, we are convinced that we will regain business momentum and grow sales faster again in the future.</p>
          <p>First quarter sales of CropScience were down 10% year-on-year due to lower volume, with selling prices stable overall.  This was mainly because of adverse weather conditions in major growing regions and high product inventories in the distribution channels.  Another factor was a drop in prices for key agricultural commodities.  Sales in the Crop Protection segment, therefore, fell 16% year-on-year.  In Europe, the late start to the spring season hampered business at the beginning of the year.  Sales were down significantly in France for market-related reasons.  By contrast, business in Germany matched the strong level of the third quarter of 2009.  In North America, we registered a 30% drop in sales because of the adverse market environment and an adjustment to our pricing strategy.</p>
          <p>And in Europe, sowing was delayed by the long winter.  The market also developed unfavorably due to price erosion for corn and wheat as well as high inventories in the distribution channels.  In Canada, we raised prices for our canola seed and lowered prices for the corresponding canola herbicide.  This, of course, had a negative effect on the Crop Protection business, but increased BioScience sales correspondingly. In addition, we considerably reduced prices for our Ignite herbicide in the United States in order to secure a greater share of the growth in the market for genetically modified soybeans.</p>
          <p>In Latin America sales were down by 8% compared to the prior year period.  This was primarily due to lower sales in Brazil which were largely the results of high inventories in the distribution channels.  It should be noted that the entire season in Brazil went fairly well. Q4 and Q1 sales taken together matched the performance of the previous seasons.  In the quarter business trended positively in Argentina because of insect and disease infestation pressure.</p>
          <p>Sales of the Environmental Science business unit rose by nearly 4%.  The market environment for high quality seed was relatively favorable, leading to stronger demand.  Our BioScience business grew by 29%, mainly due to much higher sales in the areas: cotton, canola and vegetables.  Underlying EBITDA in the Crop Protection segment was down by nearly 38%, this was mainly the result of a significant reduction in volumes and by lower selling prices.  First quarter earnings were also diminished by a lack of fixed cost absorption as we continued to underproduce while selling down inventories.  By contrast, earnings of BioScience expanded substantially despite higher research expenditures.  Underlying EBITDA of the Environmental BioScience segment improved by 42%.</p>
          <p>Following the delayed start to the season, business at CropScience has now gained momentum.  We now anticipate lower sales growth overall in 2010 in view of the weak market development in the first quarter.  We confirm our goal of achieving slightly above market growth this year.  We now anticipate sales growth of between 2 and 3% on a currency and portfolio adjusted basis, against previous guidance of approximately 4%. We now expect underlying EBITDA to come in level with last year, against previous guidance of slight increase.</p>
          <p>MaterialScience got off to a successful start in 2010.  We achieved sales of more than &#x20AC;2.2 billion, up nearly 38% against the prior year quarter when business was greatly hampered by the global financial and economic crisis. The growth in sales against the first quarter of 2009 was due to significant increases in demand from the principal customer industries.</p>
          <p>Selling prices fell overall year-on-year, but improved slightly quarter-on-quarter while volumes rose significantly in all product groups.  The strongest increase in demand came from the automotive industry.  The Asia/Pacific region was again the main growth engine where we also succeeded in implementing price increases.  Volumes also rose significantly in Europe and North America.  Underlying EBITDA of MaterialScience improved markedly thanks mainly to considerably higher volumes and the related increase in capacity utilization at our production facilities.</p>
          <p>Raw material costs eased somewhat compared with the prior year quarter, but increased quarter-on-quarter.  Lower energy prices and savings achieved through our restructuring measures also made positive contributions to earnings.</p>
          <p>The economic recovery is currently progressing more quickly tan we had expected and should continue to fuel an upturn in business at MaterialScience in the coming quarters.  Against this background, we are significantly raising our sales and earnings forecast for this subgroup.  We are now targeting a sales increase in the region of 20% on a currency and portfolio adjusted basis in 2010, against previous guidance of more than 10%.  We plan to more than double underlying EBITDA compared to our previous forecast of a considerable increase.  In the second quarter of 2010, we anticipate further growth in sales at MaterialScience and an improvement in EBITDA before special items compared with the first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentleman, we remain confident for 2010 and anticipate that the slower pace of growth at HealthCare and CropScience will be offset by the recovery at MaterialScience.  Exchange rates have so far trended more favorably as well.  We are thus raising our earnings forecast for the Bayer Group.  We continue to target currency and portfolio adjusted sales growth of more than 5%.  We now aim to increase EBITDA before special items to more than &#x20AC;7 billion and we expect core earnings per share to improve by more than 15%.  Our estimates are based on the exchange rates at the end of the first quarter.  Before opening the Q&amp;A session, please allow me to summarize my remarks.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we generated strong improvement in both sales and earnings.  Recovery at MaterialScience is taking place faster than anticipated.  After a late start, business at CropScience gained considerably momentum towards the end of the quarter.  The planting season is now well underway. Lower sales in Yasmin/YAZ in the United States and of Betaseron prevented a better performance of Pharmaceuticals.  Consumer Health reported a successful start to the year.  Overall, we remain confident for 2010 and are raising our earnings forecast for the Bayer Group.  We are now targeting to increase core earnings per share by more than 15%.</p>
          <p>That, ladies and gentlemen, concludes my remarks.  We are now happy to answer your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  The first question comes from Mr. Vosser.  Please state your name, company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Richard Vosser from JP Morgan Cazenove.  A couple of questions please, firstly on materials, I noticed you haven't provided guidance for the second quarter. Should we take this as a sign that you're now &#x2013; sorry, you have substantially better visibility for this division?  Are you going to provide quarterly guidance going forward? And if you could give an idea how you see demand for at least the second quarter and, if possible, the rest of the year, maybe a little bit on the pricing environment, how that is shaping up as far as you can see, and also an outlook on the raw materials, that would be very good.  Then secondly on Nexavar, could you comment on the relative growth profiles of the two approved indications, renal cancer and liver cancer, in each of the geographies and if you could provide us with the sales between Japan and China as well that would be very useful?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's start with your question related to Patrick to MaterialScience. By the way, we gave &#x2013; I just tried to give you a guidance for the second quarter, but, Patrick, if you will answer the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem. Yeah, thank you, Richard.  Yeah, in the second quarter we anticipate further growth in sales and an improvement in EBITDA before special items compared to the first quarter.  So we see the trend continuing and, just to give you a flavor, in April our businesses continued on the strong level of the end of quarter one, and order entries in May also seem to be at a reasonable level and confirm our optimism for quarter two to exceed quarter one in terms of sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>I think your next question related primarily to the sort of guidance for the rest of year, but to answer first, we would expect to continue giving quarterly guidance for BMS.  I don't believe the visibility is improved so much that we can reverse to annual guidance.  But, Richard, on the rest of the year, I think what we're seeing is the customer industries we're serving are fairly positive and upbeat. Couple of examples, the U.S. automotive industry has just upgraded their forecast for the rest for the rest of the year.  The optical data storage market is not in decline, it's pretty much flat with Blu-ray starting to take over quite significant market shares.  So, Blu-ray is now penetrating the market in a period of perhaps one or two years, whereas DVD took nearly five to six years. For example, Blu-ray holds 20% of the market now in Japan. So there's some quite strong underlying growth driven by our customer industries.</p>
          <p>Secondly, for the whole of our business, Asia is the major driver for our portfolio and is continuing to be strong 42% of all MDI is now sold in Asia 65% of all Polycarbonates are now sold in Asia.  So that gives us confidence because of course Asia hasn't really suffered from the slowdown.  And we believe, therefore, quarter two will be strong. And the final piece which is to your question about pricing, utilization rates in Polycarbonates and TDI are now above 90% and are therefore very strong in terms of pricing power. And on MDI, they're now greater than 80% which means that we are very positive about price movements in that area as well.</p>
          <p>Raw materials, you've seen that oil price has been bouncing around in the first quarter. As we go into the rest of the year, we believe the oil price will rise. There are different views amongst those forecasting oil.  We believe we'll see perhaps peaking at $100 towards the end of the year per barrel. If that is the case, then there will be a hit on raw materials which could be up to about 0.5 billion, but we would expect to try and offset that by price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arthur, you want the next one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, first of all we estimate the split between renal and liver is approximately 60% in favor of liver.  In terms of growth, we estimate the majority of our growth is coming from liver.  The recent negative head-to-head study that Pfizer had between Sutent and Nexavar, I think confirms two things, Richard. Firstly, that liver cancer is a very difficult cancer to treat and it underlines how significant an advance Nexavar was in liver cancer. And secondly, it confirms what we've always said, that Nexavar is a better tolerated drug than Sutent.  So I think you'll continue to see strong growth in liver and that will be the key driver of the brand.</p>
          <p>As in previous calls, we are prepared to give you the breakdown by region and if you have your pen and paper ready, in the U.S. -- these numbers are all in euros -- we sold 39 million in the quarter, that was plus 11; in Europe, 66 million, plus 9; and as you requested, the split in Japan and China, 21 million in Japan, plus 150%; 8 million in China, plus 19. In total, 155 million, plus 16%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. K&#xF6;hler.  Please state your name, your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, it's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst.  First question is regarding Betaseron, can you a little bit quantify the Russian tender effect? And as far as I understood, actually Extavia on Novartis made the business right now.  And I'm not quite clear, is it now a quarterly effect or will that affect the whole year?  Can you a little bit elaborate on that issue and how made Extavia actually that bid because their sales growth was quite low, meaning the pricing they seems to have offered to Russia, seems to be quite low.  So can you perhaps a little bit elaborate on that?</p>
          <p>Second question on the Pharma side is Aspirin Cardio actually was -- did not continue the growth path, at least not quarter-on-quarter.  And can you a little bit elaborate on that? Third question is actually regarding Bayer CropScience. You now lost the first case in Arkansas with punitive damage in the rights case.  How is the development here and how &#x2013; actually, how do you book that? I know you're appealing here, but nevertheless will we see special items on that in the second quarter and is there an insurance coverage on these cases?</p>
          <p>These are the questions.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Herr K&#xF6;hler let's start with Betaseron, Arthur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well let me first of all say, we stick to our guidance of a decline in mid-to-high single-digits in 2010 for the Betaseron franchise.  We still believe that is a somewhat conservative position, but again you'll recall we previously guided that you should take into account three factors: Extavia in the U.S. and whilst we've seen minimal impact, we have to look at the full year effect.  Secondly, the possibility we may face some of the oral MS drugs, and thirdly, we discussed at our first quarter &#x2013; our year-end call the loss of the Russian business.  For your information, the full year business last year in Russia was &#x20AC;48 million and &#x20AC;16 million of that were in the first quarter.  As to who we have lost the business to, it seems to be a combination of Extavia and a yet to be really understood generic interferon beta-1b, the source of which we're still trying to understand.  And as for Aspirin Cardio, I would not read anything into the quarter; we still expect double-digit growth for Aspirin Cardio for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Russia, just to make me aware, though you lost the business for the full year, is that fixed, so to say, as a tender or was it a quarterly tender?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a quarterly tender, however, clearly we are concerned about our ability to win back this business, so at the moment baked into our guidance is an assumption that this business does not come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Herr K&#xF6;hler, about rights and the rights litigation, first, one first comment from my side, we fully &#x2013; really we fully disagree with the four decisions so far and, of course, we will file appeals.  And perhaps one general comment, we believe that the outcome of the first cases does not have any direct conclusions on the outcome of the other cases since the claimed amounts and underlying facts differ significantly from case to case.  And of course we evaluate each case separately.  To the one-times, Herr Baumann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. K&#xF6;hler there will be &#x2013; the overall one-times we provided for &#x2013; they're provided for as special items with the amount of 77 million for both the Yasmin defense and for rights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the Arkansas case and the punitive damage payment is not included, I guess, and obviously I would be interested in any insurance coverage of these items actually if you lose a claim &#x2013; a court case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we accrued for &#x2013; we accrued also for part of the punitive for those. We did not accrue for those which were exceeding the legal ceiling in Arkansas because that is, I think, it a very valid judgment that that will not prevail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Herr K&#xF6;hler, one final comment, there is no insurance coverage available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>Cleo?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, the next question comes from Mr. Walton.  Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.  Mr. Jo Walton, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cleo, we'll continue here. Probably Jo will be back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, we will continue.  The next question is from Mr. Watteville.  Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi thank you.  It's me, Jean De Watteville from Nomura.  A couple of questions please, first of all on Kogenate, can you just give -- provide what you're looking for the full year? I mean, is the fact that third party sales and the phasing of distribution inventories will mean that you expect to recover in Q2 and still we should expect for Kogenate growth to be on the mid-to-high single digit or do you expect a full year impact?</p>
          <p>Secondly, actually can you -- a clarification on CropScience guidance, you are implying that you expect margins pressure this year.  Is that all related because of higher R&amp;D spending in BioSciences or there are other factors that we should be aware of? Obviously, I understand in Q1 there was an impact of idle capacity because of the poor volumes, but given that you expect volume growth this year, I would expect that there would be some recovery on the next quarters?</p>
          <p>And last question is actually on pricing in Crop Protection. You kindly gave the pricing for the overall CropScience, which is roughly flat.  But reading the press release, it seems you have nice price increases on seeds and price pressure on Liberty &#x2013; on Liberty so, just I'm interested in if you can give us the figure for Crop Protection and provide a bit of color or what area of your portfolio is experiencing the most price pressure and where you see the best resistance?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start with Kogenate, Arthur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean, I want to make it very clear, we are not changing our guidance for Kogenate, it remains mid single-digit.  The performance in the first quarter was purely due to timing of CFL and, in fact, our own Kogenate business performed very much in line with our expectations.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>In CropScience your first question was R&amp;D spending, what we have planned in 2010. It's overall around about 70 million more than last year; the majority will be clearly in BioScience.  Your other question was volume growth in 2010 and you asked the question in terms of Crop Protection and BioScience. It's very obvious that when you analyze our numbers our &#x2013; the performance was mainly affected by or influenced by the Crop Protection business in the first quarter as outlined.  So we are expecting overall that the Crop Protection market, this is based on our present assumption, would grow in the range of 1 to 2%, Crop Protection.</p>
          <p>Again under present assumptions, we are expecting that the seed and trait market will grow by around about 5% this year, that's our present assumption.  In terms of pricing, as Mr. Wenning outlined, we had basically a flat situation, flat development, some reduction in prices, but really limited so far in Crop Protection and good situation in BioScience.  What we discussed here in terms of price decreases, in terms of Ignite it's limited; it's here important product in the United States and Canada. Here we have a price decrease of around about 30% in order to compete with glyphosate and that's it so far. So having the look on the full year, what I would expect that there will be some volume growth from Crop Protection prices, it's basically reflect also small declines.  That's the overall situation based on today's situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch, thanks for my questions.  A few, please, first on the YAZ franchise, wonder whether you could provide some more color on your more cautious stance today versus the Investor Day, and why you are not expecting a recovery to occur there in the U.S despite the additional DTC and marketing effort?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on YAZ Plus, any color on regulatory discussions whether thrombosis risk in that product is representing part of the discussions and whether any caution or additional caution there is reflected within guidance for the franchise?  Thirdly, on Pharma margins, just wondering whether you'll be willing to provide any color on expectations for margins this year given declines in your guidance to both YAZ and Betaseron, the additional market support you're putting forward and, I guess, the impact you're absorbing on U.S healthcare reform?  And then just one quick question on Crop Protection. I may have missed it, but can you just outline your market share progression in Crop Protection through the first quarter?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arthur, let's start with YAZ and following questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Sachin.  I think with YAZ we are simply reflecting that the impact in the first quarter was more severe than we expected. We are clearly disappointed that good science and good medicine have been trumped by opportunistic fear mongering by litigation lawyers.  We are, as you mentioned, doing our best to address this. We believe the measures that we have in place will make a difference.</p>
          <p>And in answer to your &#x2013; the second part of your question, we remain very much on track with the approval of YAZ Plus.  The recent label update in the U.S., I think, was very positive and obviously this was taking place at the same time we are discussing the approval of YAZ Plus, led the agency to concur with our assessment that, based on information in evidence, there is no difference in the risk with drospirenone, the active ingredient in YAZ, than other OCs.  So I think that's the situation with YAZ. I think it's prudent that we are cautious until we see some recovery. We've seen a little bit of stabilization, but unfortunately we still see a lot of this negative advertising by litigation lawyers.</p>
          <p>Regarding Pharma margins, here again just so we don't lose the big picture, we are very fortunate in Pharma that we have a really strong late-stage pipeline, eight significant assets that will be launched between now and 2014.  So we expect to be able to invest in these assets, offset the negative impact of health reform, whilst we weren't as exposed as some companies, it was a still a significant impact as well as the negative margin impacts relating to YAZ and Betaseron. This year that will be done through a combination of further efficiencies in our cost structure as well as some tailwind from currency and going forward being offset primarily by operational efficiencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to say that those operational efficiencies would be sufficient to help you keep margins at least flat through this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be how I would take my comments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. CropScience and market share.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked the question in terms of market share based on quarterly results, and allow me, with all due respect to give a very general comment.  I never make any comment on the market share based on quarterly results in Crop Protection just due to the nature of our business, just a very short explanation.  Our base in the northern hemisphere in the first quarter it's mainly, mainly it's general feeling because the application of product in the northern hemisphere starts in April, basically, and ends in the majority in June.  So again it's just due to the nature of the business, coming to any conclusion in terms of market share based on quarterly numbers is really not meaningful.  In Crop Protection, our business, you really need to have look on the full year and then you need to compare performance of the companies with the advertising, so it's the only meaningful judgment if you're talking about market share.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  It's Fabian Wenner from UBS.  On U.S. healthcare reform, you just mentioned that you expect that and those tax to be offset by operational efficiencies.  Can you also give us an impression of the German healthcare what you assess the impact to be there? And also, the Pharma weakness in Europe, was that mainly due to YAZ and Yasmin?  And thirdly, is there anything new to share with investors on Xarelto?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Fabian.  You're right to point out that not only are we facing health reform in the U.S., we're facing health reform in Germany and other markets around the world.  We estimate at the moment the impact of the German healthcare reform will be approximately this year 10 to &#x20AC;15 million bottom line impact and approximately 25 million in 2011.</p>
          <p>And as far as Xarelto goes, I don't think there's very much that I can add to what we've said in the past.  The big news, I think, you want to hear today is that Xarelto remains on track for application of both SPAF and DVT treatment indications in the second half of 2010. And in anticipation of the question, when will we see data, as has been our practice in the past, we will share with the market top line data as soon as it becomes available, and then we present the full data set at the next available scientific conference.</p>
          <p>And then your question on Europe, the performance in Europe was not impacted by YAZ. In fact, as we indicated in Mr. Wenning's presentation, Europe continues to show very single --high single digit growth. It was primarily due to some timing and the impact of Betaseron in Russia and in Germany.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Cornelia Thomas here from WestLB.  Two questions please, some of your chemicals peers are more cautious regarding the outlook for 2010, particularly once government stimulus programs end. How much of that is reflected in your forecast for MaterialScience, please? And then the second question is on Nexavar. Actually if I look at the sequential growth, it looks to me that since the third quarter in 2003 sales have been falling, and I was just wondering if you could comment on that to tell us why  -- what the background for that is please?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, your first question, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Cornelia, the government programs are kind of staggered in terms of impact and we do factor all of them into our forecast.  One example, the Chinese are just putting around about half a trillion dollars into their transportation infrastructure and that is important to us because, as they build the world's largest railway system, they need specialist coatings for their trains and rail stock, but also very specialist coatings for the high speed train tracks and the stabilizing systems for the ballast.  So those are projects which will actually last for a number of years.</p>
          <p>So many of these incentive schemes that have been put in place, they're not having short-term impact, they're very long-term.  If you take the other extreme, the Cash for Clunkers scheme in America and that did have a relatively short duration impact, and similar schemes in Europe. But what we're seeing now is the car industry coming back. And if I just take the German car industry, for example, a very strong drive in the luxury car segment which is very important to our Polyurethanes business directly in to China.  So, it's a mixed picture. We do factor all of these effects into our forecast, and I think we have a reasonably good understanding of where the impact will come and over what time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Arthur, Nexavar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Cornelia, the sequential performance of Nexavar, I think, can explained firstly by the increasing number of competitors that we're facing in the kidney cancer market. I referred to the fact earlier now that almost all of our growth is coming from liver, which is more than 60% of our business.  Going forward, we expect to see that liver business contribute more sequential growth due to new approvals of reimbursement in Taiwan and South Korea, further developed &#x2013; big development of the Japanese market which is a very important liver market.  And secondly, I think as I referred to the fact the recent head-to-head data, I think, reaffirm the appropriateness of Nexavar in liver cancer. All of these effects give us confidence that we will see above 10% growth in Nexavar for the full year 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrew Benson here from Citi, thanks.  I just want to explore Crop Protection a little bit. You're basically saying flat EBITDA on the year and I don't know if there is seasonality and timing effect and this year things are a bit later.  But it is down, EBITDA is down on the order of 40% in Crop Protection.  I just wanted to explore what the &#x2013; what the building blocks behind that assertion are? And I know, obviously, most of them and the degree to which there is hope that you can recover position, and the degree to which current trends validate that assertion?  And secondly, just on cash flow and working capital, if you could just give us an update on where you think you're going to be in terms of net debt at the year-end assuming no portfolio change?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andrew, first Crop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first talking about Crop, Q1 was, of course, mainly affected by our sales decline; here we had a significant impact of the product mix.  And in the first quarter, it's a very important part of our portfolio, our herbicides, here mainly cereal herbicides.  So in U.S. where we have  really significantly higher margin and you are aware that the cereal business really was significantly down due to low wheat prices specifically.  So that was the main driver for the EBIT situation in Q1.</p>
          <p>On top of it, we had idle costs as outlined in the dimension of 30 million in Q1. And you asked about the trends.  So we had a weak -- generally we had the weak February, we had a record March and we are expecting now as we are close to the end of the month, we are also now expecting a record April in &#x2013; this year in 2010.  So the business is really now performing significantly better.  In terms of the full year EBIT, we so far it looks like that we will have currency gains in terms of EBIT as well, and finally we are implementing, of course, a very severe and strict cost control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The cash flow and debt expectations, Herr Baumann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all, of course, in line with our earnings performance, we expect better gross cash flow compared to last year in 2010, but certainly not the same level of net cash flow improvement because that was very much driven by the significant swing in working capital performance in 2009.  In 2010, we will continue to work on further improvement of our operational working capital management, means better performance in certainly inventory and days on hand, as well as to some extent also DSO and payables.  But that will be very much offset by the growth in business we expect this year and then the capital coming with it.  Overall, we do net-net expect a further decrease in net debt, but without further specifying at this point in time. Always also to be understood that that excludes portfolio activities.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Heine.  Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Andreas Heine from UniCredit in Munich.  I have two questions.  First, could you please elaborate a little bit more on the price trend in Polycarbonate NDI and TDI.  You said you have more pricing power in Polycarbonate and hopefully also in MDI.  So far the price trend, at least that I could follow it, have not shown as tremendous increase.</p>
          <p>Secondly on CropScience again, it is a very seasonal business so there is not much time to recover the earnings as you usually have very thin earnings in the second half and earn basically everything probably already in the BioScience business and will have higher R&amp;D costs in that sense.  So I'm a little bit puzzled how you can recover this high amount of earnings in this very seasonal business, because it mainly means that you regain most of that in the second quarter.  And even if it is higher than -- even if one month is a new record level, looking on the historic involvement you have, an increase of 200 million in the quarter would be very substantial.  So if you could give some more flavor on these please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start with the price trends in DMS, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Andrew. The first part you asked was really to do with individual price by product.  MDI we're seeing at pretty level pricing levels.  So if I look at end of quarter four '09 through to end of quarter this year, very much level in Europe and North America.  In Asia, there's actually been some slight increases.  There's some outages of facilities at the moment, which mean that prices have been pretty stable, to be honest, even though the op capacity level is round about 80 plus percent.</p>
          <p>In TDI, the price trends have been up in Europe, they've been very volatile in Asia, but around a very, very high pricing point at the moment, although I believe prices will go higher later in the year, because TDI is relatively short.  If we then look into Polycarbonates, the story is very positive.  All the major producers implemented price increases in quarter four and in quarter one, which were successfully implemented and there are now further price increases posted for quarter two as well.  So I think those price increases all around 20 to &#x20AC;0.30 per kilo.  So, these are quite significant price rises in Polycarbonates arena and probably only area where there's price flatness at the moment between quarter four, quarter one would be naphtha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Heine, your question of course is valid, but we should keep in mind that 2009 was a rather exceptional year.  I'll give you the numbers, clean EBIT: in Q1 we had a clean EBIT of 616, in Q2 374, in Q3 minus15 and then Q4 plus 41.  This means we made basically all our clean EBIT in the first half of the year.  This was exceptional, if you have a look on the years from 2004 to 2008, we always had a significant EBIT in the second half as well.  So this needs to be considered. The year 2009 was a very exceptional year in terms of the performance in the first half and then a significant decline in the second half.</p>
          <p>On top of it, we are expecting a significant increase of our business in Americas, in North America as well as in Latin America in the second half.  North Americas is mainly driven by our portfolio. We have, as you know, new herbicides, Tembotrione corn herbicides, for example, which basically are sold in the third and the fourth quarter in North America. And in Latin America and Brazil, of course, the second half is of key importance.  We are expecting a good business in Brazil as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Martin Fl&#xFC;ckiger from Helvea.  Three questions please.  Could you talk a little bit about the &#x2013; in CropScience about the reasons for the decreasing business in Brazil?  Sorry if I have missed earlier comments.  But that seems to be a new issue here, at least to me.  Then secondly, again in CropScience, could you talk a little bit more about the competitive environment that you're seeing, whether you've seen any changes since March due to the positive performance since then?</p>
          <p>And if I remember correctly at the full year's reporting stage, you said that you would expect to be able to raise prices in both Europe and to some degree also in the U.S. in 2010, and whether you still stick with that view?  And then finally that's my third question on MaterialScience, could you talk a little bit about the raw material price contributions to EBIT in the first quarter of 2010, both on a quarter-on-quarter as well as on a year-over-year basis?</p>
          <p>Also, in that respect, I'd be interested in sequential changes in sales prices in the first quarter. I know you've talked about a slight improvement here quarter-on-quarter, but I was wondering whether you could quantify that.  And finally with respect to MaterialScience, could you talk a little bit more also about the expected raw material price developments and EBIT contribution in 2010?  I know it's a difficult one, but I'd still be interested in your best guesstimate.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first Crop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Crop Protection in Brazil, I think it's important when we talk about Brazil that we realize that we are talking about the Southern hemisphere and the business basically -- the majority of the business is in Q3, and in January &#x2013; a little bit January and a small part in February.  So analyzing a performance -- Crop Protection performance in Brazil one basically should combine Q4 and Q1, because this describes the overall equation. And if you do this our performance in this season in Brazil was on last year's level, which is really not the best performance.</p>
          <p>Then we are also had an increase in market share last year, so we have no, let's say, performance problem in Brazil.  I think it's really important to understand the nature of the business here in Brazil.  Coming back to your question in terms of prices in Crop Protection, it's right.  We believed last year in the autumn time, for example, that we would be able to increase prices.  The market situation now is more difficult, why, because their whole industry, we have this problem with the long winter as outlined.  Secondly, that's the key issue, that commodity prices basically did not recover.  We have still very, very low prices in cereals, in wheat for example, corn prices are on a not very exciting level.  The same is true for soybean, for example.  So I firmly believe the chance to increase prices in Crop Protection this year again will depend very much on the development of commodity prices, and I outline the situation as it is today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Patrick on DMS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Martin, the bridges that you're asking about, if I can do it is an EBITDA bridge, just to give you some rough idea. If we take quarter one '09 to quarter one '10, then the biggest variance is, of course, on volume, which is about a third of a billion.  Then there is a negative impact on price year-on-year of minus 50 offset by roughly equivalent positive variance in raw materials.  So you have to remember that at this time last year, raw materials were actually lower, so we see a positive variance.</p>
          <p>If you then go to the sequential quarter-on-quarter, quarter four '09 to quarter one '10, we see both positive variances in volume and price, roughly equal low-end double-digits, offset by a raw material negative variance of around about 30 million.  So both comments are true about raw materials, year-on-year it's a positive effect, quarter-on-quarter a negative effect.  As we look to development of raw materials through the year, of course, there's a tremendous volatility which makes any forecasting extremely difficult. Our average crude oil assumption for this year is $90 a barrel for full year, which is higher than some people are forecasting, but I actually believe that will be close to the truth.  In quarter two, we expect raw material and energy prices to be higher than in quarter one, and overall full year we expect raw material and energy to be above 2009 levels. And I think, as I said earlier, the total impact of that could be a negative half a billion.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen, Florent Cespedes from Exane BNP Paribas.  And few quick questions, first on YAZ, in Europe it looks a bit soft in Q1, could you maybe give us some color of the dynamic ex-U.S. for this product?  Secondly, I will try this one on Xarelto, do you believe that the EINSTEIN-DVT results could be presented at the ESC Congress in August or do you believe it is a bit short?  And the last one on the HealthCare guidance, apart from the soft YAZ family Q1, is there any other specific product with a performance that explain the cut of the full year HealthCare guidance?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Florent, let me just comment again on YAZ. I mentioned that we are actually quite pleased with the performance outside of the U.S. with YAZ. I wouldn't read anything into YAZ performance in Europe.  We still expect, let's say, solid mid-to-high single-digit growth for YAZ in Europe.  As far as EINSTEIN is concerned, I'm not going to comment apart from what I said earlier which again is, I think, a very important message. We remain very much on track for the submission of both the EINSTEIN and ROCKET data which support SPAF and DVT treatment for this year.  We will present and make available to you the top line data as soon as we have it and we'll present it at the next available scientific conference and that's the status with EINSTEIN.  And then, really all I can say.  Hope that answers your questions, Florent.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look to the first quarter, the key issues, which we've already mentioned, that the largest of which was the performance of YAZ in the U.S. We had an impact on Betaseron due to the loss of the Russian tender, I told you was &#x20AC;16 million, but that was already factored into the guidance we gave you.  So the real issue we have, and again I want to reassure you, we're not taking this with any level of complacency. We're doing everything we can to recover YAZ performance in the U.S., but it's going to take time. So that's the issue that has really sort of caused the weakness in our Pharma business in the first quarter and the issue that we have to deal with for the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank, and thanks for taking my questions.  A few, if I may, and starting off with HealthCare. Two product related questions regarding YAZ and can you give me an update on the timeline for YAZ Plus launch in the U.S. and also potentially elsewhere? And then on Betaseron, just for clarification, and you realized &#x20AC;28 million in revenues in Russia last year and due to the lost tender that is gone.  Did I understand that correctly?  And also on Consumer HealthCare a question, the performance there looked quite good in Q1, I was just wondering whether any particular positive impacts which led to the very strong Q1 performance?</p>
          <p>And then a question on MaterialScience, I know you elaborated already a bit about the raw material and energy price developments, and when I look at the adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1 that appeared to be already quite strong at 13%.  I'm assuming your expectations for the full year of $90 per barrel for oil remains at that level. Is &#x2013; on a mid term basis 14 to 16% EBITDA margin assumption still a valid estimate going forward?  And then finally, one question on the exchange rate and the impact on 2010 guidance. You have now factored in $1.35 per euro versus 140 before. I was just wondering whether one can quantify -- whether you can quantify and the impact of how that has positively impacted your adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for 2010?  Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Arthur, first, HealthCare and YAZ timeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me first of all correct you. The number we gave for YAZ, sorry for Betaseron, in Russia for the full year was &#x20AC;48 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of which &#x20AC;16 million were lost in the first quarter. We &#x2013; I think for conservative reasons, are assuming we may lose that whole 48 million for the full year. We don't know that at this stage, but that was what we baked into our guidance.  As for Consumer business, as you were right to identify, that we had a very strong start with our Consumer businesses.  And really it was across the board. I think it's very consistent with a recovery in consumer confidence. We have strong brands that are performing well, and really I wouldn't highlight any brand. I would say this is an across the board performance and we are looking to a very good year. As we indicated, we expect all of our Consumer businesses to grow above market.  And the third question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me make it clear that we remain committed to YAZ Plus being launched. I mean, obviously at the end of the day, we're dependent on regulatory authorities, but as we speak, we have no reason to assume that we will not launch YAZ Plus and Qlaira in the U.S in the second half of the year.  And we also expect to launch YAZ Plus in Europe in the second half of the year.  Again with the caveat, we cannot guarantee regulatory authorities, but based on our discussions we remain, I think, committed to our guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Daniel, the exchange rate impact first quarter top line was minimum of 20 million negative, EBITDA effect was roughly 40 million against last year.  You also asked about the effects, if we included them our full year guidance. Yes, we have.  We have already indicated that based on prior guidance at $1.40 to the euro and then the corresponding baskets of other currencies. We've taken it down to 1.35 now.  If you look at sales, the full year effect is roughly &#x20AC;900 million positive, and we also expect the positive bottom line effect, based on clean EBITDA, is going to be around 300 million.  Yeah, that's what we expect for the full year.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jo Walton, I'm sorry I got lost off the line for a bit.  Could you tell us a little bit about the R&amp;D increase in Pharma, was it a significant factor in impacting the margin, could you give us some help for the full year?  And can I also on Nexavar challenge you a little bit more as to why there has been no growth sequentially for the past few quarters in China?  This is a liver only market, you seem to have it yourself, you're fantastically positioned in China, how come you're not getting this product to sell more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo, I'm really pleased you managed to get back on to the phone and I mean that sincerely.  Jo, in terms of R&amp;D we had an increase in the first quarter of about -- currency adjusted of about 6% that led to ratio of sales of 16.4% for the quarter, which would have compared with 14.7% in the prior year.  So it did have an impact on profile in the first quarter.  However, for the full year, we remain to target 15% for R&amp;D, so this was just a timing issue.</p>
          <p>And in respect to Nexavar, I have explained the reasons for the sequential performance, your issue specifically to China. As we mentioned in the past, we do not have reimbursement in China.  So, this is a self-pay market. We priced the product in line with the average prices in Europe and the U.S.  We are confident that we can continue to develop the brand strongly in China for both liver and kidney.  But until we get a broader reimbursement, I think we have to be, I think, realistic about the levels of growth that we will get.</p>
