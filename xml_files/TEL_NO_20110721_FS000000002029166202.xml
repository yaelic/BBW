          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the presentation of Telenor's Results for the Second Quarter of 2011, whether you are present here at Fornebu listening in on the phone or watching this via the Internet or on the mobile phone. I am Scott Engebrigtsen and I have the pleasure of guiding you through the presentation this morning. We have made some material available this morning as well. That is our quarterly report, the press release and a copy of the PowerPoint presentation to be used here. And you can find all of these on our website, telenor.com. There, you can also find other alternatives to follow this presentation.</p>
          <p>We will have Q&amp;A session directly after the presentation here as usual, and then we will start with the audience present here at Fornebu, then go on with the ones participating on the phone. And finally, you will have the opportunity to do individual interviews with the top management. And to present the figures today, we have our CEO, Mr. Jon Fredrik Baksaas; and our CFO, Mr. Richard Olav.</p>
          <p>And first, I leave the floor to you, Mr. Baksaas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone. We are here to address the second quarter 2011 for the Telenor Group. And I have to say that operationally the development in the Telenor Group in the second quarter of 2010 to a great extent follows the trends and the development that we saw in the first quarter this year. We had a strong revenue growth at the topline, and this has been driven by strong subscriber growth as well throughout this quarter. In addition to this and even a bit stronger than in the first quarter, we had executed extensive investments into management &#x2013; into network modernizations and preparing the &#x2013; and building capacities for the data explosion that the networks will receive in the years to come and that we are in the midst of. In addition, we are launching a 3% share buyback program that Richard will give some further details to in his presentation.</p>
          <p>So, let's have a look at the different geographical areas, and I will start as usual with the Nordics. And I want to give a comment initially then on broadcast. In fact, broadcast has also in this quarter done quite nice. There is a topline development here, 3% organic growth, and there is a margin development reaching 26% in this quarter. This is to a large extent driven by Norkring activities, both here in Norway as well as also in &#x2013; internationally, particularly in Belgium.</p>
          <p>In the Nordic region, we are managing the voice to data transition as sort of the prerequisite for moving the telecommunication activities further. Both in Norway and Denmark, we have launched new mobile price plans in this quarter and these seem to be well-received in the marketplace, at least to the extent that the customer development has been positive for us throughout this quarter. And this is of course a very particular feature that we can see healthy growth again in the mobile subscriber growth in both Norway and Sweden in particular. 18% &#x2013; 18,000 new subscribers in Norway in this quarter and 45,000 in Sweden points to that fact. I will get back to some deeper details in Norway a little bit later. But the 5% to 6% revenue growth in Sweden is &#x2013; on the service revenue is something that we see as an important feature for seeing Telenor keeping pace with the market development in Sweden. This is in line with our competitors for the time being. And the reason for us not having the &#x2013; this as visible on the organic growth figures is that we do not have that much of handset sales and that the roaming side of the business is weaker this quarter as it was compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>The competition in Denmark remains very intense. There is a continued price pressure, and as you know, that is a market where it has only been allowed to have a six-month contract period for new customers. As a consequence of this competitive situation, we have revised the subsidy model completely in Denmark. We did that in this quarter and we've seen reasonably good effects from that. We stopped the subsidizing of the handsets in the consumer segments, but there is a rental alternative available. The network sharing deal that we announced with Telia will also secure that we will in the future have a very competitive networks setup in the Danish marketplace, but of course it will take some time before we can reap the benefits of cost savings and more efficient investments into the network capacities in Denmark.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, this quarter is a strong quarter for us in the Scandinavian markets. Even in Norway there is a stable underlying margin this quarter. We do see however a NOK400 million revenue decline compared to last quarter &#x2013; compared to the same quarter last year. But this has direct explanations in the 100 and &#x2013; above NOK100 plus millions expense tag related to the outage that we had in June. There is a NOK100 million reduction in interconnect revenues because of the re-regulated interconnection rates in Norway taking the interconnection rate down to 30% &#x2013; NOK0.30 per minute for us. And there is a NOK150 million decline in fixed line revenues, which is a combination of lower number of lines connected as well as some lower revenues on wholesale revenues. So, this completes the picture from Nordics as such.</p>
          <p>But let me add some extra comments on Norway in this quarter. It has been a particularly busy quarter. And some of this activity we could definitely have been without; the serious network outage that we had in the beginning of June is of course to my reference on that comment. The root cause to this has now been identified. We have taken actions on it. And we will of course do everything we can to prevent incidence of the kind in the future. As a consequence also, of course, there is a lot of learning not only for Telenor in Norway but the Telenor Group as such, as well as industry knowledge in this event. We have then taken the decision to &#x2013; and implemented it to compensate directly to the marketplace from this outage, and this is one of those elements that takes the revenues down in this quarter by approximately NOK100-plus million.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for this compensation and if &#x2013; related to the network outage and the decline in interconnect rates, this fully explains the 4% reduction in ARPU figures for this quarter. That leaves us with the fairly stable average revenue per user from a service revenue perspective in the Norwegian marketplace. And we can also state that the voice volumes in the Norwegian marketplace are fairly stable and that the growth in data usage more or less compensates for full on the price pressure on voice.</p>
          <p>On top of these activities, there has been a quarter with intensive CapEx and investments into the network, into new technologies in this quarter as well. We're reporting a NOK1 billion figure for investments in this quarter, and this is particularly related to 3D &#x2013; 3G capacities, where have improved the high-speed mobile Internet usage for our customers considerably throughout this quarter. And, hopefully, our customers benefit from this along the coast in this summer holidays. We are also preparing for LTE and the next generations here. So, with more than 70% of the base stations now swapped, we are moving into another state &#x2013; another status in our networks in Norway as we move along.</p>
          <p>We then move to next region, Central and Eastern Europe. Also here, the trends are more or less the same as we saw them in the first quarter. Serbia is doing fabulously well; once again 18% revenue growth. This is a very strong figure. And it also serves Serbia to a good extent that it improves the EBITDA in the same way, because we have also a market &#x2013; a margin enhancement from 40% to 44% in the quarter. So, once again, we have to congratulate the management in Serbia for being able to position Telenor Serbia the way they are and that we hopefully also see some improved market share as a result of these good results.</p>
          <p>If we then take a look at Hungary, again more or less the same as first quarter but not of the similar kind of what we can see in Serbia. The Hungarian market, despite being sort of back in positive GDP growth, has not responded in the same way from a usage perspective on telecommunication services. And with the price pressure on interconnect rates, there is still a topline pressure on Telenor Hungary. From a margin perspective though, operationally the margin is comparable to previous quarters but with the tax &#x2013; the crisis tax that was instituted towards our sector, this fully explains the margin dilutions down to 36% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me then raise some few comments to VimpelCom. Not that much news to report this quarter. The acquisition of Wind has been done. It's completed by 15th of April. And as a result, the ownership of the Telenor Group has been diluted to &#x2013; by 20% to 31.67% to be exact. Although we do some &#x2013; we did in the first quarter see some slight improvements in the market share for VimpelCom in Russia, we are of the solid belief that the group needs to be operationally focused and really look for the new momentum in the Russian market in particular as being one of the key markets. And we are there to support the VimpelCom performance and its efforts in that sense. And we hope that the new management will be able to really set this direction. In parallel with this, the arbitration will continue and through that one, we are &#x2013; we have the ambition of protecting the rights that we had under the shareholding agreement and maintaining the position that we had before the transaction came through.</p>
          <p>Then some comments on India. There is a steady growth in India for Uninor in this quarter. We've maintained the growth factors quite steadily from first quarter. In second quarter, we added 4 million new subscribers, ending the quarter with a total subscriber base of 21.4 million subscribers. This results to an 8% to 9% market position in the best performing circles, which are U.P. East, U.P. West, Kolkata and West Bengal. And in these circles in particular, we have achieved to pass some of the other operators. We can say that we are on the fifth &#x2013; sixth place in that race. And this confirms the Uninor's ambitious &#x2013; ambitions of getting an industry position in the different circles in India. The growth in &#x2013; the economic growth in India maintains itself, it builds further, but still we see that the overall industry has due to competitive reasons not started to sort of follow that economic growth. And of course being in the midst of the turmoil on the regulatory issues, this is &#x2013; there is probably still a period to wait until this happens. But we are continuously working at bringing forward an ultra low-cost operator that's needed in the highly competitive Indian market. And that will include initiatives on distribution, network management and utilization, and also in particular the energy which is so important when the grid is of this weak quality that we have in this kind of market.</p>
          <p>The investigations into the 2G license award process back in 2008 continues. We have managed to confirm the Telenor entry to India as an industry initiative, and we have done everything according to guidelines set forth by authorities and we are doing everything based on approvals from authorities in that respect. And we are happy to note that there are comments' coming out that &#x2013; we see that authorities and other institutions understands this position. We therefore anticipate that the outcome of these legal processes should not affect our business activity in India in that sense. But there is &#x2013; still to see the final and new revised regulatory framework that we expect to see during this autumn.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me then give some comments to the growth figures that we see from our established Asian operations. These are quite phenomenal figures in this quarter, I have to say; double-digit growth in all four operations; in Bangladesh organic growth even by more than 20%. The unfortunate fact is that there is a weakening of the local currency.</p>
          <p>So, measured in Norwegian kroner, we don't see the same growth figure. But with a margin enhancement up to 53%, we can solidly say that this is a good quarter for both Grameenphone as well as other operators in the Telenor Group in the region. Data and Smartphones are driving this, in particular in DTAC and DiGi. And the customer demand for data services, in particular in Thailand, demonstrates that there is a need and that the market is ready for 3G. The unfortunate fact though is that the 3G licenses and frequencies have not yet been awarded. And also due to the governmental &#x2013; the election and the government &#x2013; the change of government in these days, this seems a bit of a blurred picture for the time being. But we expect and we do trust that Thai authorities will conduct any investigations into this and the question that has been raised on foreign ownership under DTAC. And in that sense, all our structures in DTAC have been approved and acknowledged by Thai authorities on previous locations. In Bangladesh, there is a 2G license renewal this autumn. The final terms around that has not been clarified, but we can expect that to happen during the next quarter because the deadline here is 11th of November.</p>
          <p>And finally, the operation in Pakistan has done excellently in this quarter as well, both on toplines and EBITDA margin; record high for that operation from a margin perspective having reached 36% EBITDA margin in the quarter. And this of course then also will expand cash flows going forward, despite many other type of challenges that one face in the Pakistani market. We also see that we do present very efficient and needed services on the financial &#x2013; mobile financial services side in Pakistan where Easypaisa is being very well-received in these days.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Richard on the financials, we are summarizing the second quarter 2011 in the following way. I do think we can say that we can confirm that we had &#x2013; that we for the time being &#x2013; in the Telenor Group can be ranked as one of the fastest growing European telco for the time being and we are in the midst of modernizations which will be tremendously important for us in the periods to come. So, we are building capacities for the future here. We've also taken strong initiatives on the customer-centric initiatives in such a way that we should improve competitiveness in the local marketplaces. In India, we're working continuously to establish Uninor as an operator in the marketplace and we do feel that we get recognition for that. But there is still a long way to go before we can reach the targeted breakeven milestone towards the end of 2012. And we do seek to INR155 billion investments case that we have been &#x2013; described before.</p>
          <p>Operationally, the operational excellence initiatives throughout the value chain in all the operations seems to pay us results, but of course this is continuous work and we need to work hard on it period-by-period. However, as a final comment to the whole presentation, the fundamental of the Telenor characteristics on this reporting is the growth factors that we see in the Asian marketplaces. We are able to feed that growth. We can and are enjoying taking part in it. And we do maintain market shares and hopefully also building some market positions while this happens.</p>
          <p>So, with these words, I hand over to Richard who will take us through the financials and details from that part of the presentation. Richard?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you, Fredrik. Indeed it's an honor and a pleasure to present such good results. It's indeed a strong quarter for the Telenor Group. And I will just highlight a few numbers. Fredrik touched upon the organic revenue growth in some detail and &#x2013; but you also have a consolidated EBITDA margin of 31% this quarter and a 20% operating cash flow. And we have to remember that approximately 5 percentage points goes out to India in the build-up phase. So, in fact just for India, Telenor runs now at a 25% cash flow on its established businesses. And this comes from capturing growth, operational excellence and good CapEx discipline.</p>
          <p>Going into the figures in more detail, starting with the revenue growth, yes, we have a 7% revenue growth, but approximately half of the revenue growth goes away in currency. So, the reported revenue growth is 3.4% and it's especially the Thai baht, the Malaysian ringgit and the Bangladeshi taka, that's declined in value towards the Norwegian kroner. However, we also see a very strong growth component in our consolidated figures from India contributing by approximately 2.5 percentage points of the organic growth. So, with the fast growth and the size of the Indian market, we see that that will add more and more to the overall growth story of Telenor.</p>
          <p>On the EBITDA, we have improved both the margin and then of course the absolute level of the EBITDA by the growth. So, compared to second quarter last year where we have an EBITDA of approximately NOK7 billion, we are now close to NOK7.5 billion EBITDA or an improvement of NOK450 million. Norway has a decline in EBITDA of approximately NOK227 million. Half of that comes from the outage that we compensated the customers and the rest is really related to the fixed telephony decline and somewhat reduced prices on wholesale. This is then compensated &#x2013; more than compensated by the strong revenue growth and margins in Asia, so more than NOK600 million improvements on the Asian operations this quarter. And also other units like Broadcast and Denmark and others also contributing in total with more than NOK100 million, taking the EBITDA up to close to NOK7.5 billion in this quarter and a margin of 31%.</p>
          <p>The CapEx; we have invested about NOK2.7 billion in CapEx this quarter, which is NOK200 million lower than the same quarter last year where it was NOK2.9 billion. That's despite the fact that Norway had an all-time high investment level over more than NOK1 billion this quarter or 16% CapEx-to-sales in Norway. The global CapEx-to-sales figure was at 11%. So, Norway increased their CapEx with NOK250 million, while the Asian units, despite that they are in the midst on preparing for network modernizations invested NOK100 million less and of course, we're investing less in India with about NOK200 million and other units with about NOK200 million. We'll probably increase the CapEx somewhat towards the rest of the year, but we're also taking down the CapEx guiding for the year. I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>So, that gives us then the cash flow. And the cash flow has then increased both due to the EBITDA increased by some NOK450 million and the reduced CapEx of about NOK200 million. So, the cash flow has improved by about NOK650 million year-on-year. And the effects are the same, as I of course then explained, under the EBITDA and the cash flow. Then we have further down in the P&amp;L. I've explained then the revenues and EBITDA before other items. On other items, we have an effect of NOK216 million this quarter. And the main effect is that we've reduced about NOK250 for time equivalent employees in Norway this quarter and we have accrued about NOK176 million for that. So, that's the main driver behind the NOK216 million. Depreciation is more or less on the same level. We have a high deprecation in DiGi due to the network swap but lower for the rest of the group.</p>
          <p>Then we have to spend some time on associated companies, because there we have some effects this quarter that are not recurring. One, of course, recurring is that we have taken in the first quarter figures from VimpelCom our share of that. That is NOK1.4 billion into the associated company line. Then, we have an effect of NOK1.6 billion related to the Wind acquisition. Under IFRS, the dilution that Fredrik informed you about, that we &#x2013; has been diluted 20%. That is under the IFRS to be deemed as a disposal. So, 20% of our shares is accounting-wise treated as a disposal and that creates a gain between the market value of the VimpelCom share at closing of the transaction and a book value of NOK1.6 billion. Then we have impaired or CMore investments due to lower subscriber development and revenues and earnings than we expected, and that is reducing in associated line at about NOK0.5 billion. So, in total, we have a contribution from associated of NOK2.6 billion this quarter.</p>
          <p>Net financials is also an IFRS effect. It's just internal loans that are moved and one part of the loan can be treated as hedge accounting and the other one cannot be treated as hedge accounting. So, that you should not pay any big attention to. The underlying financials are quite normal this quarter. And the same with taxes, the big effect of taxes comes of course that the VimpelCom accounting gain, VimpelCom contribution and the CMore impairment doesn't give any tax effect. So, taxes compared to profit-before-tax looks quite low but the underlying tax rate is quite normal.</p>
          <p>Also I want to report how we are doing on our operational excellence programs. And we have set an ambitious target for OpEx-to-sales of about 35% in year 2013. We started at 39% in 2009. We are not &#x2013; now exactly at the last 12-months rolling at 36.7%. That's the down from 36.9% last quarter, so it's moving in the right direction. On the CapEx-to-sales, the target is 10% and we are now at 11%. And what are we doing? Well, it &#x2013; tried to summarize it here in four bullet points. There is of course a lot of initiatives. Like Fredrik was saying, we are pretty much modernizing all our networks. The only big operation that is not started yet is Pakistan. We are downsizing and outsourcing. So, far this year, we have reduced the Telenor manpower base by approximately 1,000 man-years. Last year it was 1,500 for the full year. So, we are speeding up also the downsizing and outsourcing programs.</p>
          <p>Customer service and distribution is a big cost for us, and we see a lot of optimization possibilities there. And of course, like Fredrik said, continuous improvement is a part of leadership expectations and a strong feature in the Telenor value stock and relentless focus on improvement of all business processes are of course vital going forward. But I'd say, so far so good.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, we have a very strong balance sheet in Telenor. We don't hide that fact, of course. The net-debt-to-EBITDA now stands at 0.8. I think the industry average is around 2, so we're considered little bit better capitalized than our peers. However, net debt increased NOK7 billion this quarter. But if you look behind what rise &#x2013; the increase, we can see that we have paid dividends of NOK7.2 billion and we have accrued for the share buyback to the Norwegian Government that will be paid now in the third quarter after that. So, approximately NOK10 billion is going out to shareholders, and about NOK2.7 billion in income taxes is the contribution to shareholders and government's takeaway about NOK13 billion. So, the underlying operation before tax contributes with about NOK6 billion positive of cash flow. And this increase in debt was, of course, totally expected from our side due to renewed dividends and the buybacks.</p>
          <p>Then we are of course pleased to announce a buyback program also this year. When we set out the buyback last year, we said that this should be a part of long-term shareholder remuneration program. So, you should not be surprised that his comes out now. And we're building the shareholder remuneration policy stone-by-stone, increase the dividend this year from NOK4.1 billion up to NOK6.2 billion compared to last year. And with the share buyback program, if you use around NOK85 as the share price, that will cost another NOK4.1 billion in this year. And the total payout to shareholders on Telenor will be more than NOK10 billion. We have said that we want a shareholder remuneration that is competitive. This will take the yield to around 7.5% and that's slightly below the sector average, but with our underlying growth profile I think that should be okay.</p>
          <p>Then to the guiding, starting with India, we still guide separately for India. We maintain the EBITDA loss of NOK4 billion. The trends are the same as the previous quarters. We are generating the revenues according to plan, and the costs in total are more or less according to plan. But we are revising down our CapEx again in India to around NOK1 billion from before NOK1 billion to NOK1.5 billion. The main driver behind this is really operational excellence. We see that the Uninor organization due to that they lack spectrum and that also they are under tight cash flow constrains to meet NOK155 billion frame, that they are able to put more erlangs through the base stations than we have seen in any Telenor operations. So, I would say that's good news. Some is also timing that there are some license issues on getting CapEx and base station equipment in, but I would say the main part is improved efficiency on the base stations.</p>
          <p>Then for the group, we maintained organic revenue growth of above 5%; we're 6.8% year-to-date. And we're also maintaining the EBITDA margin around 31%, year-to-date we're at 30.6%. We are revising down then the total CapEx-to-sales from 12% to 13% to 11% to 12%. I'd say half of that comes from the reduction of India and the rest half comes from that we see &#x2013; that we will not spend as much CapEx that we expected earlier for the rest of the group. Finally, I'm please to say that this then will translate into an expected cash flow improvement of 1 percentage point or close to NOK 1 billion in improved guiding.</p>
          <p>Last to my presentations, some advertisement for the Capital Market's Day on the 22nd September; there we will do deep-dive into operational excellence. We will go then of course also more in detail to India, which I think will be a great story also on operational excellence and of course the voice-to-data transition in the Scandinavian and particularly focused probably at Norway. So, wish you all a hearty welcome to the Capital Market's Day on the 22nd September.</p>
          <p>And that ends my presentation. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Espen Torgersen, Carnegie. Just a clarification on the outlook; you've down &#x2013; adjusted down your CapEx but your guidance excludes license renewals, et cetera. So, could you comment on what your expectations are for the net effect when you include the renewal in Bangladesh in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; the final outcome of &#x2013; the final figure, so to speak, and when it's going to be paid, et cetera, is yet to be seen. So, it's quite hard to sort of give any view to that question right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I had another question on Norway. If you look at what happened during quarter, you have adjusted EBITDA margin of 39% underlying. You added 18,000 customers. Do you think you've seen the full effects of the network situation or the faults in the network in Q2, or do you think one should expect that you will, a) increase marketing or other marketing-related issues to try and reduce the effects of that event; i.e., is Q2 figures the same as you see it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The direct effects of the fault situation that we had in June is captured in this quarter. The &#x2013; one can call indirect effect that you're more or less pointing to, I think that is some &#x2013; that has something you do with the general competitive situation in the Norwegian marketplace. And seeing the effects before the outage of the revised price plans, et cetera, we feel that we have a quite solid momentum getting back and getting out of the somewhat weaker position that we had towards the end of last year from a competitive perspective in the Norwegian marketplace and into &#x2013; and that lasted into first quarter.</p>
          <p>So, from that side, I don't expect sort of extraordinaries. But of course, we have to give some efforts to regain the reputation of the Telenor Group &#x2013; the Telenor service package to the Norwegian marketplace. And in that respect, we are of course on top of the network operations in Norway in a different way, one could say, after the event that they had in June. And we are, as we did explain here on Tuesday, in the midst of preparing the final activities. And there is one of the nodes in the core system, the media gateway, that there still is some extra work to be done without sort of significant price tags attached to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have a question here from Arild Nysaether, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; Arild Nysaether, Fondsfinans. I have a couple of questions. First, with VimpelCom, you say you are commencing the arbitration that you have talked about before. I wonder, now that your partner has announced that they want to discontinue the shareholder's agreement after coming below the threshold of ownership, are you challenging that sort of statement or the decision by them to void the shareholders' agreement?</p>
          <p>And how would you look upon investing further into VimpelCom should it happen that the shareholders' agreement is not there anymore when the time comes for the arbitration decision? And the other question; with Pakistan, I seem to recall that you put out a longer-term margin target of 35% at some point. And seeing that you now successfully has passed that target, can you give some comments on how far you think you could go in developing profitability further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, to the first one, on VimpelCom, the arbitration process is independent from the actions from Altimo when it comes to having passed the 25% threshold. The arbitration process goes back to the process that happened when the transaction with Wind was defined to be a related-party transaction and in such a case, depriving the preemption rights that Telenor had. And that's what the arbitration is about. Then both shareholders however were in their full rights to pass under the 25% to threshold.</p>
          <p>So, there is no resistance or comments from us in that respect. That was the right of the shareholder that did it and it was sort of pure mechanics. And then there is sort of mechanics in the transition period for six month until the shareholding agreement is then shelved for good. And in that period, we can anticipate that the hearings and process on the arbitration will go on, but these are sort of parallel things. Then we &#x2013; it remains to be seen how the outcome of the arbitration will end. And to your question, we have to sort of ask that question once again when we know the outcome of that arbitration process, which can be estimated sometime next year.</p>
          <p>Then on Pakistan, yes, margin of 35% have been breached. Where do we go? Well, we have now been in operations in Pakistan for six years. We're in our sixth year. We are the number two player among five. We're very satisfied that we have managed to bring forward this kind of performance, with due consideration to the situation in Pakistan, the environment in general. Where do we go from here? Of course, we're not targeting to take it down again, and other markets in Asia are sort of moving at &#x2013; in the 40% bracket. Do I indicate that we will reach 40%? Well, we will at least push for further improvements. So, let me limit myself to sort of that kind of expression.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, question from here, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ole J&#xF8;rgen R&#xF8;d, First Securities. There are some particular negative revenue drivers in Norway this quarter, which will probably not repeat itself. But still it's obvious that there is significant pressure on revenues in Norway. On the other hand, you have positive drivers and the most important one probably being mobile data. My question is in the longer term, are the positive revenue drivers so forceful that we can expect positive long-term revenue growth in major telecom markets or do we have to live with slightly declining revenues over the long-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is the key question to the whole industry. I think that has been asked to all CEOs in Europe for the time being. The price pressure sort of on existing services, we have to register it will move on. Regulation will also make sure that there will be a price pressure on the roaming side &#x2013; the roaming aspects of the industry. And the initiative that Brazil took last week is among them, a structural solution to come probably in 2012. But on the other hand, the volume growth on data services here will be significant and the industry needs &#x2013; incented to entertain that growth and this is sort of inherent in your question. How will we see revised pricing structures coming forward when there is data driven activities in the network more so than a voice driven?</p>
          <p>So, to be sort of 100% exact on, say, to your question, I think we have to bear with the uncertainty for a period of time on how those incentives <mark type="indiscernible" /> in the industry as such. So, what we see here in Norway for the time being, we do compensate in rough terms for the price pressure on data growth. Data growth is compensating for price pressure. Then we have still sort of &#x2013; because we have this big voice &#x2013; fixed voice part of the equation in Norway still a declining curve originating primarily from that one, but from &#x2013; what we can see is that the &#x2013; in the Scandinavian markets data growth compensate for price pressure on voice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have one another question here at the back, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Chris Roth, NOR Markets. Just two quick questions; one with respect to Denmark, is that a preview with respect to reduced subsidies in other markets as well or is it just a function of the poor lack of availability of subscribers there? And second question, you mentioned the India base station efficiency on a per line basis. Is this something which is exploitable to other markets as well? And if so, what could be the effect of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Denmark, the driver for the reduced activities on subsidies is primarily coming from the competitive legislation that only allows for six months contracted period, whereas the same factor in Norway is 12 months and in Sweden 24 months.</p>
          <p>So, that's a sort of prime differentiator from the three markets, but since connectivity-only and usage-only has become more paramount &#x2013; important characteristics when people buy their communication needs, then the split between the handsets and the connectivity part is coming through also in other segments in both &#x2013; well, in Norway in particular because one operator in Norway is only pushing connectivity and voice-only and leave to the customer to take sort of part of their terminal, their handset criteria.</p>
          <p>So, yes, you can say that there is a development in other markets in the same direction. Will that embrace all segments? Probably not, because there will be segmental preferences here which will play out on what kind of balance you will find. As to base stations, I think Richard &#x2013; yes, there is a lot of learnings from India in that respect and into other markets, and maybe you can flavor that a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't think the learnings from India is not only related to 2G voice network. We see that those learnings can be exported to 3G and also 4G environments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Grameenphone has never done network sharing activities, if it hadn't been for what we have learned in India. So, that's &#x2013; that is one direct learning element.</p>

So, I will have to ask you to be please be so kind to limit yourself to one question each and eventually a follow-up question if something is unclear.

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. One question indeed with a follow-up that's certainly different. On Norwegian mobile, you touched to the extent on the competitive environment there and TeliaSonera highlighted yesterday that they thought MVNO pricing pressure was easing in Norway. I wonder if you could comment on how you see competition into the second half of the year and whether you believe your recent tariff refreshes that reduced churn in the second quarter will be enough to keep churn down through the year?</p>
          <p>And then a second question, if I may, just on Indian mobile; I wonder if you could just given an update on your perceived likelihood that you get the extra 6.2 megahertz of spectrum that you haven't received? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Norway, this &#x2013; the competitive situation in Norway is definitely driven by the asymmetrical termination rate structure that we have in Norway for the time being. This is what fuels the competitive strengths of the attackers for the time being. There is no doubt about that. The asymmetrical principle has been adopted by the government with the ambition of getting more investments into the infrastructures of the mobile systems and establish the ground works for the third operator. But what really happens is that you get a stronger price competitive marketplace rather than more and more significant investments, in particular in the outskirts of Norway. That won't happen. The guarantor for sort of the very good &#x2013; both coverage and capacity level that we have in the mobile systems in Norway is still Telenor and will be so for many years.</p>
          <p>The profile on the asymmetrical termination rate structure is so that they will be gone by June 2013. So, we are now in 2011 in this &#x2013; in the period with the highest differentiator, because Telenor is running on 30% &#x2013; NOK0.30 per minute on termination and the strong &#x2013; the widest differentiator, if I'm not mistaken, is NOK0.90 to some &#x2013; to our competitors. And this profile will be gradually reduced from now on through in January, and be changed on two occasions in 2012 and be taken away in 2013.</p>
          <p>So, we can expect this kind of competitive pressure to maintain through the autumn and into at least the first half year of 2012. But having said that, the revision of our own pricing structures and the repackaging on service packages in the Norwegian markets has been received positively at this stage during this quarter, as we have reported. And we do feel that we have a competitive price point under the present circumstances in Norwegian marketplace right now. Something to add on that?</p>
          <p>Then for India, on 6.2 megahertz, I don't think we can expect release from 4.4 megahertz to 6.2 megahertz before the regulatory framework that will &#x2013; is presumed to last and to be in play in India for the coming years will be declared. Earlier this year, this was expected to take place in March 2011. If we go back to 2008 when the new licenses were awarded, there was a three-year timeline until the regulatory framework should be revised in March 2011. But because of the turmoil this has been delayed and it was anticipated to be seeing something in August, but I won't be surprised if it will move longer than that. We feel &#x2013; as a last comment, we feel definitely that we have fulfilled all requirements and as such be eligible to receive the incremental frequencies to 6.2 megahertz in the circles that we have applied for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I may add to that, Fredrik, that the improvement we now see in the networks in India per base station also makes the 6.2 megahertz in the short-term less critical. In the original plan, in India we would have really needed 6.2 megahertz now to build &#x2013; to avoid building more base stations. But we're pushing so hard now on the base stations that we're having, so we can postpone when 6.2 megahertz is needed to build more. So, sometimes it's good to not have something.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. One other question on Norway Mobile from me; the new tariff plan seem to have a good impact on the half. I was just wondering, are you expecting much of a negative impact on service revenues going forward? Obviously, to get &#x2013; to regain the competitive position I assume you have to take a slight know on service revenues. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, certainly not. That's not the intention with the new tariffs plans. Of course, the whole point is here to have a tight bucket pricing and as the data consumption grow that the consumers will move up in the staircase to higher buckets. So, that is the philosophy behind this, but of course the competitive pressure and especially this asymmetrical termination rate, which is really subsidizing our competitors, make that more challenging, as long as we have that scenario. Haven't it for that scenario, I think really you would have seen a significant different service revenue development already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One quick follow-up, if I may; you've now refreshed your tariff plans for Norway and Denmark and delivering very good tiering on data, and Sweden maybe remains a bit of an exception with the tiering not really the sort of the initial bucket in 1 gigabyte of data; are you going to look at revisiting Swedish data tiering in the short term?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The competitive structure in Sweden is a bit different because we &#x2013; you don't have the MVNO structures in place in the same way as you have in Denmark and Sweden. Maybe that is sort of a differentiator that gives some light to your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, it is Andy Parnis from UBS. I just have one question. Just on your revenue growth guidance, you talked about it being above 5% now for the full year. You've given first half year you were running at around 7%. Do you expect to slow down in the second half of the year or is it obviously above 5% guidance that's sort of now being more of sort of above 6%, above 7% guidance? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I think we have stated in our guiding above 5%. So, I don't think it's &#x2013; we will go here into any detail and trying to nail that down to an exact figure. So, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it seems Andy might just have asked my question, but I maybe feel inclined to just push a little more. I mean you actually exited Q2 with an even stronger revenue growth rate. I think you only needed 6.6% and you're saying H1 6.8%, so that's implying a Q2 exit of probably around 7%. In which particular lines of business are you expecting more revenue pressure in the second half that's easy to &#x2013; that's more cautious guidance? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me then try to elaborate on that one. Well, above 5% is above 5%, so let's agree to that at least. But remember also that we are comparing second half of 2011 with second half of 2010. And the growth momentum started really in the &#x2013; towards summer 2010. So, in a way, we are comparing up against higher base line so to say. Maybe that gives some lights to your question.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Yeah, question for Fredrik. You have been through Norway and Sweden, Fredrik. So, question on Denmark where your margin has reached close to, I'd say, a long-term high. Is that the evolution of the handset subsidies or is it sort of underlying cost reductions that has boosted the margin there? At the same time, how do you view &#x2013; have you seen an improvement in the competitive environment in Denmark as indicated by some of your competitors? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with your dialect &#x2013; you know why, you know these things quite well I should anticipate. Now the Danish marketplace is as competitive as it was before, Peter. That's for sure. We don't necessary &#x2013; we cannot say that we see an easing off here. But the results that are being delivered from the Danish organization is coming from the change of philosophy on subsidies as well as cost &#x2013; general cost efficiency initiatives in the value chain as such. And this has to continue, but it's as easy as like that. And what we have done to prepare ourselves for that in the future is to join forces with TeliaSonera in such a way that the number two and the number three players should be in the position to, from a network perspective, compete both efficiently up against TDC with that kind of combination.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. On India, I was wondering on what you think in general about consolidations there, not specifically to Uninor, sort of the way I would phrase the question is of even the minister there is talking about sort of having fewer numbers per circle. The question is would you rather think this is a question of large operators hoovering up smaller operators or do you think the more likely way to fewer operators per circle would go along the lines of small operators joining forces and sort of building out the &#x2013; the small operator and greenfielders joining forces and sort of gaining scale through that? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's my impression that &#x2013; as many others are expressing, that consolidation is India &#x2013; in India will be the way to go. And that is easy to say. And what's needed before that can happen is that there need to be a clarification on the regulatory framework. And it's very good that ministers and others are indicating that this is the way to go. But still we need to see that framework. And the most important factor in that sense is the potential governmental or regulatory implication that might come when you consolidate spectrum.</p>
          <p>So, in other markets, this is generally controlled through the competitive legislation &#x2013; competition legislation whereas in India this has been controlled consciously by allowing small slices of spectrum to a high number of operators.</p>
          <p>So, it's this philosophy that needs to be changed before we can say that there is a climate whereby consolidation can happen. From a Telenor perspective, we would be completely open to all kinds of talks and potential structures and see what kind of window of opportunity that might arise when these things are being brought to more clarity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just one question, you were obviously in the bidding for Polkomtel and obviously you were not successful in it. Are you looking at any other assets out there? If not, could you maybe elaborate on why you perhaps didn't do a larger buyback, given where your balance sheet position is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we don't comment specifically on M&amp;A, but we have also stated that we will look at opportunities within our core regions. And of course we are doing that, like we said before. I think it could be a mistake not to look, but we are doing it through a very disciplined approach. And we have not seen then Telenor making any new significant moves on the acquisition sides since India. And I think you should take that as a credit that we are working very disciplined on M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the level of the buyback, I think it's very important for us to build stone-by-stone on the shareholder remuneration. And I don't think you will see us aiming at any special dividends or any single large buybacks, but we will build a competitive shareholder remuneration over time stone-by-stone without any big surprises in the negative or in extremely positive direction. That will be in line with our long-term policy for everything we do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just ask a follow-up in terms of balance sheet, I mean you &#x2013; obviously, as you mentioned earlier in your presentation, you have one of the less leveraged balance sheet, et cetera. Is that because you are waiting to find that what happens with the arbitration case for &#x2013; regarding VimpelCom or do you see yourselves kind of gradually building up over time or how do you see that leverage evolving over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have said is that we need to maintain a strong balance sheet and we have defined that as net-debt-to-EBITDA below 1.6. Right now, we are at 0.8. We also said when this conflict arose on the preemptive rights on VimpelCom that we would have no problems both maintaining a competitive shareholder remuneration and also execute on the preemption rights, if we were successfully in the arbitration and we'd like to use those rights at that point in time. So, I don't see any conflict on that scenario from my point of view.</p>

So, if VimpelCom continues to lose revenue share at the current year and if you then lose your arbitration case that you've just talked about and in &#x2013; over the next 6 months, 12 months you see your Board influence diminish as Wind gains seats, would you then consider selling down your stake in VimpelCom over time?

          <p>Yes, hello; couple of questions on India. First of all, you report stable ARPU and very high minutes of use in the quarter. I have picked up that there are talks about effective pricing environment in India with some tariff increases from some of the competitors, if that's something you are seeing at the moment and maybe that didn't happen already in the quarter. Can you say something about the pricing environment? Secondly...</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry &#x2013; I'll have to stop you there. We will have, please, just one question and a follow-up. So, let's have the first question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there are some initiatives seen on off-net tariffs in India. So, &#x2013; but these are very minor &#x2013; these have very minor effects on the revenue structures of the operators. But on the other hand, yes, we have seen some initiatives of price increases, which sort of opens up the pricing environment slightly better than what was the case before. So, we have seen it and we will respond to this from our side from what we see relevant from Uninor's position in the different circles. And this is not &#x2013; this is done circle-by-circle also by the way, so it's not necessaries of the national feature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A question on &#x2013; you explained the EBITDA improvement with improvement in gross margin and still you maintained your EBITDA outlook for the year in India. Is that explained by expectations of new launches, and when should we expect that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't plan any new launches right now. Of course, we are interested in lunching in the circles we are not launched, but in some circles like Delhi, we don't yet have spectrum and in some we just have partial spectrum. But I think we need to see the regulatory environment come more in place. And in the meantime, we will build operational excellence in the circles we're already in.</p>
          <p>So, with regarding this year, there is no significant CapEx in the circles we are not in. And will &#x2013; proper impact in the different circles, we are anticipating and expecting that we become a better potential partner to discuss with on structural changes in the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. One question on Norway and the network outage that you've seen in the course of the quarter; I'm just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on what happened, what kind of backup plans you've put in place, if necessary, to make sure that you don't see the same issues arising in some of your other markets as you are currently replacing networks pretty much everywhere, but Pakistan, as you said?</p>
          <p>So, I was just wondering if there is an element of risk that we can see that happening in other markets and if this is the case, what kind of backup plan you have. And as well, I'm just wondering if that is going to have any impact on the outlook you've provided for 10% CapEx-to-sales in 2013 in the existing operations excluding India. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a question which really have sort of a half an hour press conference in itself. So, I have to limit myself to sort of say that what happens was that in the core &#x2013; in the CS core, the voice part of the mobile system, we had components from suppliers that did not deliver at specified level and a very specific event that occurred when the outage happened. And we have &#x2013; we had a separate press conference on that two days ago. The material can be taken from there. I think I have to say that. What we have done on that in that case is that we have together with our supplier on &#x2013; in the field extended some capacities, we have introduced some patches to circumvent this kind of incident. And we are very sure that this particular incident will not happen again.</p>
          <p>As to the rest of those operations in the Telenor Group, we &#x2013; all the networks in the Telenor Group or the industry for that matter, none of them have exact the same configuration. And remember, the network is being built gradually year-by-year and as it happens because of also the competitive pressure and the type of frequencies that are available to each operator.</p>
          <p>So, there are no such things as an exact equal and similar configuration from an &#x2013; one phone brand operation to another. But rest assured, there is a lot of learning on what happened in the Norwegian network, both for Telenor and the industry are such. And a numbers of operators have taken interest in how this could happen and how it has been mitigated of course. As to the second part of your question, there is not any impact into our guiding figures from this outage event except for what we are reporting for in this quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a couple things just on Scandinavia; first on Denmark, just help us understand the development going forward; can you specify how much revenues and EBITDA you had from your contract with Onfone in the quarter please? And secondly, if I may, just a comment on CMore and the impairment, you bought that asset, I think about a year ago. What went wrong there and how could it depreciate so quickly, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to Denmark, you can really find our wholesale revenues in our P&amp;L. There you see that being disclosed. So, I don't think we should disclose specific customer revenue but other than saying that of course Onfone is a significant part of what we report on the wholesale there. And that will be of course transisted out of our networks as we go forward.</p>
          <p>When it comes to CMore, I think the development is largely due to lack of premium content in CMore and that &#x2013; the effect of that has given a higher subscriber loss and weaker results than at least both the company and we have expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's really related to sports content, I would say, that a lack of some premium soccer, in particular, has led probably to its higher subscriber losses than at least we expected.</p>

          <p>Hello, it's Mark Chapman from CreditSights. Just to return to the question of the shareholder agreement following Altimo's notification, I was just wondering what your thoughts are on potential conflict of interest between your own operations in South Asia and VimpelCom, or Orascom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in Pakistan this has been clarified by national authorities as being not of a problem in the Pakistani marketplace. These are parallel operations. Today they are run as parallel operation and that will continue. They compete in the daily marketplace and that will also continue. Bangladesh does not have the same legislation in place. So, that question is okay for the time being and the shareholding agreement and the principles under which this was done was so that the first-comer was &#x2013; in any market has the right to stay there and the second-comer would have to resolve the any type of challenges that might be &#x2013; that might arise coming from such a combination.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Maurice from Barclays. Obviously, lots of moving parts inside mobile Norway, but you have refreshed your smartphone tariffs. But presumably, a reasonable amount of base is on the old tariffs. So, would you help us understand the size of the back book in terms of those customers, how many customers currently are on much higher tariffs or if you have actually been actively bringing them down?

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, this is both yes and no really, because we're also actively migrating customers from old tariffs, as you called then, into relevant tariffs of sort of the present competitive field. So, this is work that continue &#x2013; that continuously is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Network OpEx, attachment modernization plan was one reason for the negative margin impact in previous quarters. Can you just clarify what that impact was in Q2 in Norway, for example? And does this spend completely drop away after 2011 when the network modernization is complete?</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the network modernization do not necessarily have a great impact on the OpEx side of the Norwegian operation. Of course, there are higher activities. But the bulk of that work is capitalized as investments. So, &#x2013; but when it's done and look to Montenegro where we'd done this &#x2013; we did this last year, then we see sort of at the back of a completion of such a network swap there is a higher degree of efficiency in the network that one can capitalize into competitive ability or improve margins as we move forward.

          <p>Hi, a question on India <mark type="indiscernible" /> just provide a quick update on the future funding prospect, you're still taking these short-term international loans I believe, which are at fairly punitive rates. I just wondered if there have been any further discussions with UniTech or any talks of equity raising. And also just perhaps help me understand if you're fully guaranteeing the loans &#x2013; these short-term loans, why is it exactly you're paying such high interest rates on them? Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think when it comes to the relationship with UniTech, we are of course pushing for rights issue as we feel that is a better funding than short-term loans guaranteed by Telenor. And yes, at this point in time all the loans of Uninor is guaranteed. When it comes to the interest rates, all the loans, I would say they are quite normal in India. You must bear in mind that the Indian interest rate regime is at the high level also due to special regulations. But I don't think we pay any higher interest than what would be normal to compare within &#x2013; in India due to the strong credit of Telenor.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just another question on India please; given that you're pushing harder on your network and that you now feel that you've postponed your need for increased spectrum, you're aiming to get to 30 million subs the end of this year, 50 million by the end of the next year. When do you think that need for spectrum will materialize and what is your plan b, should you not be allocated a spectrum in the course that you would expect to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are some factors that really need to be in place in order to run a mobile operation. Number one is spectrum and license. And given that we have not been able to get to 6.2 megahertz, we have been able to find sort of new ways of running higher capacities in the &#x2013; within the existing framework that we have. And these are both on tests for the time being as well as on commercial sort of initial phases. Then number two is numbers. You need access to number of capacities, sheer telephone numbers, and we are scares on telephone numbers for the time being.</p>
          <p>And the newcomers only was awarded per circle numbering capacity according to a sequence on when they entered. And we have numbering shortages now in some circles which is sort of bottleneck number two. And again, since the regulatory framework is in the turmoil that it is, it's difficult to get release both for the spectrum and numbers. And the ultimate consequence of that is that you have to run with your existing customer base at the existing capacities that you have in your networks and tune down the sales activities.</p>

          <p>But to just let me add one thing, let's be clear that some of the best performing circles, like Fredrik alluded to, like in the Hindi belt U.P. East and U.P. West, they had needed extra spectrum long time ago having to push the network. But they are starting to need it now. It's been postponed significantly, so we're applying for this spectrum and pushing on for it because we see that it's vital for the long-term business case, even if we're able to push more erlangs to the base stations.</p>

          <p>So, on a monthly basis, we're seeing your subscriber growth additions flow marginally over the course of the last few months. Is that deliberate then because you're pushing already as hard as you can CapEx and DTAC you don't have enough spectrum?</p>

          <p>It's deliberate in the sense that we &#x2013; customers &#x2013; we are churning out customers earlier than we under other circumstances would have done.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you. And I think that's what we have time for today. Other clarifications could be addressed to our Investor Relations department. I'd like to thank you all for paying attention to us this morning, and thank you.</p>
