          <p>Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone.  I'll start on slide three of the presentation.  Capital One earned $1.21 per share in the second quarter and $1.24 per share from continuing operations.  EPS from continuing operations was down $0.69 from the year ago quarter, driven largely by higher provision expense.  EPS from continuing operations was down $0.46 from the prior quarter, driven largely by lower revenues.  I'll address quarter-over-quarter revenue drivers both one-time and market related following the rest of the highlights on slide three.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense was down $54 million from the first to the second quarter, adjusting for the one-time legal reserve release last quarter.  Credit performance in the second quarter was largely in line with our expectations for a weakening economy that we laid out when quarter ago.  Our managed charge-off rate increased 19 basis points from the first quarter to 4.15%, and the 30 plus delinquency rate in our Managed National Lending book increased 14 basis points to 4.87%.  While these credit metrics reflect modest credit pressure in the second quarter, there was a more pronounced deterioration in broader US economic indicators.  We assume this will translate into additional credit pressure in future quarters, causing us to increase our allowance coverage ratios and revenue suppression in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>You may recall that we began tightening our underwriting during the fourth quarter of 2007 in anticipation of a weaker economy.  You can see the effects of this tightening on our loan growth this quarter.  Managed loans declined by $800 million, as we been more selective in originating new loans. Our originations in recent quarters have been focused on those business segments with greater resilience and lower loss profiles.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet remains a source of strength and stability for Capital One.  Our philosophy of holding significant excess liquidity and leveraging diverse funding sources is of particular value in the current environment.  During the quarter, we grew our readily available liquidity position by $3 billion to $33 billion, as we continued to accelerate funding originally scheduled for the second half of the year into the first half.</p>
          <p>We grew deposits by $4.7 billion in the quarter, and maintained continued strong access to the capital markets through $2.6 billion of credit card securitizations.  Finally, after paying dividends our ratio of tangible common equity to total managed assets increased 15 basis points to end at 6.18%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide four, I'll cover revenue trends. Our revenue and net interest margins experienced significant declines in this quarter, after having risen substantially over the course of the previous 12 months, due to a number of actions taken to protect the profitability of our lending businesses, and to take advantage of the yield curve and fixed-income credit market conditions.  Our risk-adjusted margin has been declining since net charge-offs began rising in the middle of 2007.  Revenue and net interest margins declined in the second quarter, due to a number of one-time and seasonal events, plus other drivers reflecting credit and market conditions.  I'll review these drivers and what they may say about future margin performance on slide five.</p>
          <p>I'll focus my comments primarily on the drivers of overall revenue margin, because I believe the explanations for revenue margin decline are largely the same for our net interest margin as well, since late fees, an important component of our national lending revenues are included in our NIM.  I would note from the outset however, that margins in our Local Banking business actually improved modestly in the second quarter, as Rich will describe in a few moments when he reviews segment performance.</p>
          <p>I'll start by discussing three factors that boosted our first-quarter revenue margin and then either went away or were substantially lower effects in the second quarter. The first such factor is the changing interest-rate environment.  Please recall that dramatic action by the Federal Reserve lowered short-term rates by 200 basis points within the first quarter.  This unprecedented decline in rates in such a short period of time, coupled with the repricing lag between our funding instruments and variable rate card assets, drove a temporary expansion of our first-quarter margins. This temporary expansion reversed in the second quarter, as the variable rate card assets repriced lower, catching up to our funding costs.  Meanwhile, funding rates were little changed in the second quarter, given the much more modest 25 basis point change in LIBOR.  The negative effect of these interest rate movements on our first to second quarter revenue margin is approximately 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>The second factor which boosted our first-quarter margin was the seasonality of revenue in our credit card businesses.  First-quarter margin seasonality is driven by the combination of high balances entering the year at elevated delinquency status, along with the seasonal paydown and delinquency curing a typically occurs during the first quarter. Second quarter margin seasonality is related to the absence of these effects, though margins typically decline to their more normal levels.  You can see these effects and some of our past your results, although I would caution you that 2007's results were distorted by the significant repricing actions we began in the second quarter of last year, which largely muted these seasonal effects.  We estimate seasonality of revenue margins from credit cards to drive an approximate 15 basis point drop from the first quarter to the second.</p>
          <p>The third factor boosting our first quarter margin was $109 million gain in Visa stock sales, coupled with the $52 million gain on early extinguishment of some higher cost debt.  Together, these one-time items added 35 basis points to revenue margin in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, we recognized a $45 million gain on the sale of MasterCard stock, which boosted revenue margin by 10 basis points in the quarter.  Netting these one-time gains creates a quarter-to-quarter margin decline of approximately 25 basis points.</p>
          <p>There were two factors that affected the second quarter margin more directly.  The first is the increase to the investment portfolio, an offshoot of our continued focus on building liquidity in the current environment.  Since these investments are much lower yielding than our loan portfolio, their inclusion in the managed asset book had the effect of lowering revenue margin by approximately 25 basis points.</p>
          <p>The second factor affecting quarterly revenue margin is the weakening economy, which we estimate drove approximately 35 basis points of the margin drop in the quarter.  When economic stress increases, more delinquent customers fail to make payments, and therefore, flow to the next delinquency bucket. This increase in flow rates is the primary driver of the increased level finance charges and fees that we are not recognizing as revenue.  You'll note from the first footnote to our financial tables that revenue suppression in the second quarter was some $68 million more than in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>While the collectability of assessed finance charges and fees has decreased as delinquent borrowers become less likely to cure, we are also assessing less because of a decline in the number of borrowers in the early stages of delinquency.  This reduction is probably related to consumers taking a more disciplined approach to managing their finances in light of the economic uncertainty. We've also taken actions over the past quarters to respond to the weaker economy, mainly tighter underwriting and more aggressive collections to play a role in keeping early delinquencies lower. Additionally, the economic stimulus payments that were provided to Americans in the second quarter likely had a negative effect on late and over-limit incidences, although it's difficult to model this impact.  Without these mitigating factors keeping early delinquencies low, margins would have been higher, but so would future charge-offs.  This is, therefore, a trade-off we're happy to make.</p>
          <p>Before moving on, let me note the approximate $80 million impairment to our interest-only strip valuation, which reduced non-interest income in the second quarter.  This impact is included in the revenue margin described on slide five, reflecting the quarterly change in interest rates and credit.  $42 million of the write down that relates to our US Card master trust and was driven by the factors I just described.  An additional 20 million of the IO strip impairment is related to our credit card trust in the UK, a market which is once again experiencing increasing credit pressure; and the remainder is attributable to a variety of other securitizations, most of which are experiencing some credit pressure.</p>
          <p>As this myriad of effects has run its course to our margin, we expect revenue margin to be more stable going forward, and continue to expect low to mid single-digit revenue growth in 2008.  The biggest factor driving revenue growth within that range will be how credit trends play out, especially on our early delinquencies. Should early delinquencies remain low, late and overlimit fees will also remain low, and will come in nearer the low end of our revenue growth range.  If delinquencies increase, then revenue growth will move towards the higher end of the range.</p>
          <p>With that, let's look at non interest expenses on page six. Adjusting for the $91 million legal reserve release related to the Visa IPO in the first quarter, second quarter operating expense would have decreased by $45 million versus the prior quarter.  We continue to focus on driving operating efficiency across the business, and are well on our way towards meeting the target announced in the second quarter of 2007 of reducing run rate expenses by $700 million by 2009.  We also expect to exceed $200 million in reduced operating expenses in 2008 versus 2007. Marketing expenses have also been declining modestly, $10 million less in the second quarter than in the first quarter, as we maintain our cautious approach to booking new loans in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Despite reductions in marketing and operating expense, the quarterly decline in revenue caused our efficiency ratio to rise by two percentage points.  For full year 2008, we continue to expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the mid-40% range or lower.  We also expect seasonally higher expenses in the second half of the year to put upward pressure on the efficiency ratio, but revenue trends will continue to be the primary driver of variation within the range.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slides seven and eight, I'll discuss credit and allowances.  As I mentioned earlier, credit performance in the quarter reflects both the weakening economy, as well as the actions we have taken to position our business to weather this cyclical downturn.  Rich will discuss credit at the segment level in more detail in a few minutes.  I'll discuss how these credit trends affect our allowance for loan losses on slide eight.</p>
          <p>Credit performance in the quarter was largely in line with the expectations we laid out one quarter ago.  Based on the combination of stable delinquencies, portfolio contractions, and stable performance in the now $700 million plus run off portfolio of HELOCs originated by GreenPoint and held in Other, our base allowance requirement calls for a reduction of more than $100 million. However, deterioration in key US economic indicators, such as unemployment, housing prices, consumer confidence and inflation continue to point to further weakening of our economy.  Given the weaker economic indicators, we are assuming credit pressure will rise in the coming quarters.  We're assuming that delinquency flow rates will further deteriorate as this pressure mounts, gross charge-offs will rise and recoveries effectiveness will degrade. Recognizing these factors results in our building, rather than releasing allowance by a total of $38 million. This brings our allowance for loan losses to $3.31 billion.</p>
          <p>Our allowance to delinquency coverage increased for most businesses as you can see on slide eight. These rising delinquency coverage ratios are consistent with an assumption that future credit pressure will be greater than that currently being experienced by our portfolio.  Our Auto Finance coverage ratio fell a bit in the quarter due to seasonality in the seasoning effect of the contracting portfolio.  Adjusting for these effects however, our Auto Finance coverage ratio also would have increased.</p>
          <p>Our allowance now provides us the capacity to absorb the equivalent of about $7 billion in managed charge-offs over the next 12 months. While we can't make a direct linkage between the level of future charge-offs in specific levels of economic indicators, we view this scenario as consistent with the views that the US is in recession.</p>
          <p>At this point I'll cover capital on slide nine. Capital One continues to generate excess capital, and continues to have navigated the current downturn without raising any form of capital in the market.  The ratio of tangible common equity to tangible managed assets rose in the second quarter by 15 basis points to 6.18%, above our target range of 5.5 to 6%.  Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be extremely strong as well, with our ratio of Tier One capital to risk weighted assets at about 11.4%.  We will continue to pay our $0.375 quarterly dividend but we currently view share buybacks as unlikely to resume until the economic outlook improves.  Given the volatility and strains in the financial system these days, we expect to continue retaining excess capital, despite the fact that our TCE ratio is above our long-term target range.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 10, I'll cover liquidity funding. Despite the difficult market conditions, we increased our readily available liquidity position by $3 billion to approximately $33 billion in the second quarter.  This liquidity is five times our capital markets funding plan for the next 12 months, a coverage ratio that has steadily risen over the last few years, as you can see on slide 10. This strong liquidity position results from our conservative liquidly management mindset, a lower asset growth plan, the lowest volume of maturities we have seen in many years.  Additionally, our holding company liquidity remains quite strong, with sufficient cash on hand today to cover more than two years of parent obligations, including our current stock dividend.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we increased our investment portfolio by $3 billion to $25 billion, as we built liquidity amid difficult capital market conditions.  While this incremental liquidity does reduce our margins a bit, current spreads between the bonds purchased and TDs issued this quarter, enabled this position to be put on at an above-hurdle risk-adjusted return and is not preventing us from deploying capital elsewhere. When their economic outlook improves, we expect to use this excess capital and liquidity to support future loan growth.  We continue to manage our investment portfolio with no exposure to SIVs, CDOs, leveraged loans, nor any equity or hybrid exposure.  Our portfolio is highly liquid and is 97% invested in AAA rated securities.</p>
          <p>On the funding front, the second quarter featured a significant improvement in market liquidity versus the prior quarter.  We took advantage of this improvement to issue $2.6 billion of credit card asset-backed securities, largely completing our 2008 credit card issuance plan. We may opportunistically issue modest additional asset-backed funding, as circumstances warrant.</p>
          <p>Despite the improvement in capital markets, we once again capitalized on the strong demand for insured deposits: we grew by $4.7 billion in the quarter.  Overall, and despite the significant pressure the current environment is placing on the profitability, liquidity and capital of financial institutions, Capital One remains rock solid.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Rich.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gary.  I'll begin on slide 11.  Significant cyclical headwinds drove the decline in our quarterly net income to $463 million.  I'll discuss our US Card, Auto Finance, and Local Banking Local Banking businesses over the next few slides, but before leaving slide 11, let me make some brief comments our international business, which is comprised of our credit card businesses in the UK and Canada.</p>
          <p>Our international businesses posted $34 million in net income in the second quarter, in line with first quarter profits and up from the prior year quarter.  Continued strong performance in Canada offset trends in the UK, where the credit environment grew more challenging in the second quarter.  We remain cautious about growth in the UK, given considerable economic uncertainty there.  Our UK loan balances continued to decline.  While revenue margin the UK is holding up, the lower loan volumes caused modest declines in revenue.  Modestly lower revenue, combined with increases in provision expense, pressured our UK profits in the quarter. Our Canadian credit card business continues to perform very well, with stable credit performance and solid returns.  Finally, we booked a $12 million net loss in the Other category.  The sequential quarter decline resulted from differences in the IO valuation and one-time items that Gary mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>I'll discuss our US Card business on slide 12.  Remember, the US Card business now includes our legacy US consumer card business, plus our installment lending, point of sale and small business card businesses.  To provide some additional context on the performance of the broader US Card sub segment, we released historical pro forma credit results on July 15, along with the June monthly credit results.  Second quarter net income declined to $340 million, due to continuing economic and cyclical headwinds.</p>
          <p>We're taking many actions to navigate the current downturn.  We remain cautious on loan growth.  We continue to focus our marketing and originations on the parts of the US credit card market that we believe provide the best combination of risk-adjusted returns and losses through the cycle.  We are maintaining increased intensity of collections and recovery operations and we continue to aggressively pursue operating efficiency improvements.</p>
          <p>Ending loans grew modestly from the prior year quarter and from the first quarter of 2008.  In contrast, average loans are down modestly from the first quarter, reflecting our cautious approach to growth in the current cycle.  We expect that our continued caution on loan growth will result in loan balances that are flat to slightly down in 2008.  Credit performance in the quarter was largely in line with our expectations.  The 30-plus delinquency rate improved in the quarter, continuing economic pressures on delinquency was offset by the expected tiering of the temporary impact of the pricing and fee policy moves we made in the second half of last year.  These offsetting effects allowed the typical seasonal improvement trend to show through in the second quarter delinquency rates.</p>
          <p>The managed charge-off rate increased in the quarter consistent with the low 6% range of expectations we discussed a quarter ago.  The increase in charge-off rates resulted mostly from the continuing deterioration of the US economic environment.  We expect charge-offs for the third quarter to remain in the low 6% range, then rise to around 7% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect charge-offs to increase as a result of three factors:  First, expected seasonal patterns would result in higher charge-off levels in the fourth quarter, all else equal.  Second, we've observed continued weakening in economic indicators throughout the first half of the year.  The impact of economic weakening is likely to be evident in our US Card charge-offs in the fourth quarter; and finally the initial impact of the OCC minimum payment changes I discussed last quarter are expected to begin in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense declined on both a year-over-year in sequential quarter basis.  This is the result of our continuing operating and process efficiency efforts, as well as our more cautious stance on marketing.</p>
          <p>Revenue and revenue margin declined from the first quarter of 2008, driven by three factors:  First, finance charges declined from their first-quarter levels.  First quarter finance charge revenue was unusually high as a result of the Fed interest rate cuts and contractual repricing lags that Gary discussed earlier.  A seasonal build in our finance charge and fee suppression in the second quarter also contributed to the decline in finance charge revenue.</p>
          <p>Second, fee revenue declined as our customers continued to adjust to the pricing and fee policy changes we implemented is the second half of 2007. We originally expected this customer adjustment to be a bigger factor in the first quarter, but we actually observed most of the effect in the second quarter. We believe that our customers have now largely adjusted to the new terms, so we expect the temporary impacts on both revenues and credit metrics have run their course.</p>
          <p>Third, we've seen a persistent pattern of delinquency flow rates during this economic downturn, with early stage flow rates remaining quite low, while later stage flow rates have increased, as Gary talked about.  The slope of delinquency flow rates has two negative impacts on revenue.  First, the stable early-stage flow rates mean that loan balances moving from current to the first delinquency bucket are not increasing, and therefore are not generating increased late fee revenues.  Second, finance charges and fees we've already charged on balances that are at later stages of delinquency are becoming less likely to be collected, so we suppress them and reduce revenues accordingly.  We expect the revenue margin to stabilize around its current level, with some month-to-month variability for the balance of 2008.  This assumes that the drivers of revenue we experienced in the second quarter persist throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Our US Card business continues to deliver solid profitability and generate excess capital for the enterprise, despite cyclical credit challenges &#x2013; and our US Card business remains resilient and well-positioned to successfully navigate near-term challenges and deliver solid results through the cycle.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 13, I'll discuss our Auto Finance business.  Our Auto Finance business posted net income of $34 million for the quarter.  The return to profitability this quarter was driven by the seasonal improvement in charge-offs, solid revenue margins, and continuing reductions in operating costs. But looking beyond the second quarter, our Auto Finance business continues to face significant challenges from the seasoning of 2006-2007 origination vintages and cyclical economic headwinds.  Additionally, auto resale values are falling as a result of declining auto sales and the rapid shift in consumer preferences to more fuel-efficient cars, as gas prices continue to rise.</p>
          <p>To address these challenges, we took aggressive steps to retrench and reposition our Auto business last quarter and we continue to take decisive action to position the Auto business to deliver above hurdle risk-adjusted returns over the cycle.  We're pulling back on originations and shrinking managed loans.  We're improving the credit characteristics of the portfolio.  We're leveraging pricing opportunities in the face of shrinking competitive supply, and we're reducing operating costs.</p>
          <p>Originations for the second quarter were $1.5 billion, 38% lower than the first quarter, and 49% lower than a year ago.  As we mentioned last quarter, we expect auto loan originations for the full year of 2008 to be at least 40% lower than 2007 originations.  The total auto loan portfolio shrank by $1.2 billion during the quarter, and by $1.7 billion year to date.</p>
          <p>By stepping back from our riskiest segments and focusing only on our best dealer customers, the credit characteristics of new originations continue to improve, as evidenced by rising average FICO scores and improving loan to value ratios.  Although it's still very early and the sample sizes are small, the first few months of delinquency performance of our 2008 origination vintages reflect the improved risk profile of our new bookings.</p>
          <p>Operating expense as a percentage of managed loans improved in the quarter, despite the shrinking loan portfolio.  However, we expect that the lower level of originations will result in continuing declines in loan balances over the course of the year, which would impact the optics of our auto business.  For example, declining loan balances would reduce the denominator for calculations of metrics like charge-off rates, delinquency rates and operating expenses as a percentage of loans.  This would put upward pressure on these ratios, making them appear more negative than the actual trends in charge-off delinquency and operating expense dollars.</p>
          <p>Seasonal credit improvements helped the profitability of the Auto business in the second quarter but expected seasonal increases in charge-offs will pressure the profitability of the business for the remainder of 2008.  We believe the aggressive repositioning of the business and our continued actions to navigate the downturn will result in a substantially smaller Auto business that can deliver above hurdle risk adjusted returns over the cycle. We're monitoring the business results closely especially the results of new originations, and will be prepared to take further appropriate actions based on the results and industry conditions we see over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>I'll discuss our Local Banking business on slide 14. Results in the Local Banking business remain steady and solid, even as we complete the final pieces of the major integration and launch our brand in New York.  On a sequential quarter basis, loan growth was largely flat, as expected run off of residential mortgage loans offset growth in the core commercial franchise. Local Banking deposits grew modestly in the quarter, despite the planned run off of public funds.</p>
          <p>Profits declined as the economy continued to weaken the quarter.  Profits for the quarter were $67 million. Rising provision expense in the current economic downturn is the largest factor in both the sequential quarter and year-over-year decline. While charge-offs have increased modestly, non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans has risen more sharply, driving an allowance build in the quarter.  We also added to the allowance in the quarter, based on the qualitative economic factors that Gary described earlier.  With the Local Banking charge-off rate at just 34 basis points, we continue to believe that our Local Banking loan portfolio is very well positioned, and is delivering solid credit performance as compared to other banks.</p>
          <p>Credit performance is supported by our favorable mix of loans.  We've included additional detail on the composition and credit performance of our Local Banking loan portfolio in the press release schedules.  We have relatively low exposure to construction lending, residential mortgages and other types of lending that are being hardest hit at this stage of the economic downturn.  In our $28 billion commercial loan portfolio, we have less than $3 billion in construction loans, and only about half of that amount is for residential for-sale construction.  And although we've observed increasing risk in our legacy GreenPoint small-ticket commercial real estate loans, it is a small, $2.8 billion portfolio from a business we've discontinued, and it's in run off mode.</p>
          <p>On the consumer side, Local Banking includes about $11 billion of mortgage and home equity loans. We hold approximately $8 billion of residential mortgages, which are well seasoned, low LTV first mortgages, with a charge-off rate of 36 basis points.  We also have about $2.5 billion in home equity loans which are included in the branch-based home-equity, and other consumer categories in the press release tables.  The branch based home equity portfolio is about half first liens, and has a charge-off rate around 35 basis points.  The remaining $900 million of other consumer is comprised of miscellaneous consumer loans, with a charge-off rate of about 3.5%. Outside of the Local Banking portfolio, we have less than $1 billion of the remaining GreenPoint home-equity loans which are held in the other category.  While these loans continue to perform poorly, between reserves and marks, we hold the equivalent of about a 21% reserve against future losses and this portfolio continues to run off.</p>
          <p>So in total, Capital One holds approximately $12 billion in residential mortgage and home equity loans, about 8% of our total managed loans.  In addition to a favorable loan mix, we have the good fortune to have our branch network and banking relationships in states and regions that are holding up well in the current downturn.  Texas and Louisiana are bolstered by the energy economy, and the fact that they were never really part of the boom-and-bust cycle that is impacting other parts of the Sun Belt and metro New York has a strong local economy that continues to perform well.</p>
          <p>Net interest income improved during the quarter, as net interest margin on loans and deposits increased slightly.  Loan spreads have improved due to mix and better pricing in the market, while deposit pricing came down in the second quarter following the Fed's first quarter rate cuts.  Revenue was negatively impacted in the quarter by reduced volumes at Capital One home loans as the mortgage market continued to suffer from weak demand.  In addition, home loans recorded a $9 million increase in its reserve for repurchases based on an increase in repurchase requests received in the quarter.  Finally, we wrote down our mortgage servicing rights by $10 million during the quarter to reflect the changes in the fair value of our servicing portfolio.  Without these mortgage related items, banking segment revenues would have shown a slight improvement from Q1 levels.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense declined from Q1 levels due to reduced integration costs and reductions in salary and benefit costs in the segment.  Offsetting declines in operating expenses were increases in marketing expenses to support our brand launch and Q2 marketing campaign.  We expect loan growth to remain flat for the remainder of 2008, as growth in commercial loans continues to offset the expected run off of residential mortgages and the small-ticket commercial real estate portfolio.  We expect stronger Local Banking deposit growth in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on building and maintaining relationships with our commercial and small business customers. And although it's an early read, we've seen strong consumer results following our platform conversion and brand launch in metro New York.  In our Local Banking business, we're building on our recent integration and brand launch to develop and execute new growth strategies and continue the tradition of providing great customer service to our banking customers across the franchise.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 summarizes our updated outlook for 2008.  For the last three quarters, we've provided guidance on key operating metrics.  We've updated our expectations based on results and trends we've observed in our own portfolio and the broader economy through the first half of the year.  Specifically, in 2008 we expect a low single-digit decline in ending managed loans, and double-digit growth in ending deposits.  In the current economic and capital markets environment, we remain cautious on loan growth and bullish on deposit growth.  We expect low- to mid single-digit revenue growth. If revenue margins remain at or near second-quarter levels, we'd expect to be towards the lower end of this range for the full year 2008.</p>
          <p>We expect efficiency ratio for full-year 2008 to be in the mid 40% or lower, with the quarterly efficiency ratio drifting up modestly in the second half of the year.  Revenue trends will be the biggest driver of efficiency ratio.  We expect 2008 operating expenses to be at least $200 million below their 2007 level.  From a credit standpoint, we expect continued pressure as the economy continues to weaken. And, as Gary mentioned earlier, we expect our TCE ratio to remain above our 5.5 to 6% target range until our economic outlook improves.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude tonight on slide 16.  Despite continuing economic headwinds, Capital One continues to deliver profits, generate capital and build resilience.  As a result, we remain well positioned to navigate the current economic cycle.  As I said last quarter, it's the decisions one makes in the good times that largely determine how well one does in the bad times, and that's why, in many ways, we've been preparing for an economic downturn like this for years.  We've chosen resilient businesses, and avoided many of the significant exposures and risks facing other banks.</p>
          <p>Residential mortgage and home equity lending is about 8% of our total managed loans, and construction lending comprises less than 2% of our total managed loans.  We have no CDOs or SIVs, and no exposure to leveraged loans.  We moved decisively to exit businesses we didn't like, such as the GreenPoint origination business.  We've consistently embedded conservatism into all of our underwriting decisions.  We've built and fortified our funding and liquidity, and we've completed our transformation from a capital markets-dependent lender to a diversified bank.  All of these moves have put us in a strong position to successfully manage the company through today's near-term challenges.</p>
          <p>Of course, the decisions one makes during the bad times are also critical, and we continue to act decisively and aggressively to manage the company for the benefit of shareholders in the face of cyclical economic headwinds.  We've been through cycles before, and we're tapping that experience to inform and shape our actions today.  We've tightened underwriting standards across the board, and we've pulled back sharply on the most challenged housing markets and in the least resilient credit segments.  We've retrenched and repositioned the Auto business.  We've dialed back to the highest ground across the business, and in parts of the business like near-prime Auto, we've essentially exited entirely.</p>
          <p>We've continuously tweaked our underwriting models to recalibrate variables that may be unstable in this environment.  For example, having a mortgage in California used to be a positive risk indicator, but not anymore.  We've adapted our models and approaches as the economic environment has changed.  We've gotten more conservative on credit line assignments and line increases.  We've increased focus on collections, with earlier entry, higher intensity and new tools.  Even as we've invested in increased collections, we've made great progress on our efforts to reduce our cost structure, and improve operating efficiency to enhance our long-term competitive position, and build resilience to rising credit costs.</p>
          <p>We've further strengthened and diversified the balance sheet in the quarter, adding to our solid liquidity and capital positions.  We've raised our dividend last quarter, and our TCE ratio now exceeds the top end of our target range.  Our balance sheet strength and our confidence in the future capital generation of our businesses allows us to maintain our dividend, while also keeping our TCE ratio comfortably above our long-term target range until our economic outlook improves.</p>
          <p>I should note that our core tenet in underwriting is to always assume the future will be worse than the past.  That doesn't immunize us from the cycle, but it does help ensure that we are well positioned to absorb the punishment of a down cycle from a capital and earnings perspective.  Our experience in the last two down cycles is that as the economy worsens, recent vintages tend to perform worse than the rest of the portfolio, so we are being extra careful with new originations in this environment.</p>
          <p>Finally, I should note that we also believe that some of the best business tends to be generated as the downturn bottoms out and credit starts to improve, but until we see signs of the bottom, we are going to be very cautious.  Like all banks, we face significant cyclical economic and market headwinds. But when I look at how we're positioned and the actions we're taking, I remain confident that we'll be able to navigate the near-term challenges and put our company in the position to deliver strong shareholder value through the cycle.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good afternoon.  My question and follow-up both are tied to regulatory and accounting issues. I just wondered if you could give an update on your thoughts on the potential effects and where you think FAS 140/146 (sic) [FAS 140, FINRA46R], securitization assets moving back on balance sheet, where you think that's going to end up and the effect on you, and then any thoughts you have on the regulatory adjustments potentially being made to the credit card business as a whole?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, it's Gary.  I'll start with a view on the proposed change to FAS 140, and I know Rich will pick up on some views about some of the other pending regulatory changes in the credit card space.  Certainly with FAS 140, we are at a situation now where we don't have an exposure draft yet, and of course the timing is uncertain.  But as you might imagine, this is important to us, and we're actively engaging with those who will shape the outcome.  I should say we have sympathy and understanding for the desire to improve transparency on off-balance-sheet vehicles, and ensure there's a clear picture of financial institutions risks to all investors.</p>
          <p>That said, not all off-balance-sheet vehicles are created equal.  Plain vanilla revolving credit card trusts are fully disclosed; we give monthly performance data, credit profiles, and of course they remain firmly off balance sheet. And until we see the implementation details, it will be hard to know exactly what the impact is. Which is why our efforts and focus of late have been on trying to make sure that all those involved take the necessary time to make sure that all of the work is done to make sure we understand the impacts before moving to the finalization, and, of course, the implementation of the new FAS 140.</p>
          <p>There are a lot of imponderables both on the accounting side and on the capital side.  Certainly we, like you, can come up with an absolute worst case of an initial impact on the accounting and capital side, and let me just cut to the chase and say that if you took the most conservative assumption on the accounting side, in terms of no grandfathering, valuing all assets at par and needing to build  allowance for everything that's currently off balance sheet. And assuming that there is no regulatory relief in terms of how that's treated, put all of that together, and we would be in a position of not needing to raise any common equity.</p>
          <p>So we know just as well as you do, Bob, and you've look at it carefully, how to calculate the worst case and we've done the same.  But I think it's important that we recognize that there will be lots of decisions to be made that will affect the final outcome, and we certainly stand ready to work with FASB and with the regulators to try and get to the policy results that I think everybody really would like to see happen.  So that's our view on FAS 140.  Rick?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, with respect to the proposed Federal Reserve regulations on credit card practices, as you know, the proposed Fed rule is in a comment period, and we of course plan to provide our feedback directly to the Federal Reserve as part of this process.  Many of the practices covered by this proposed rule are things that we have never done &#x2013; I mean practices like universal default, double-cycle billing, but we're still analyzing the expected impact of the regulations.  Our current view is that implementing the regulations as proposed, would have potentially significant costs in the near term for Capital One and certainly for the credit card industry. In addition to the proposed rule, it likely will result in a reduction of resiliency in the industry, as the ability of issuers to reprice existing balances is restricted.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in the longer term, it's very plausible that the regulations could create some competitive opportunities for Capital One.  As you know, Bob, we have not been comfortable with some of the prevailing practices in certain parts of the market, like the prime revolver segment.  And we have for several years sat on the sidelines of very significant portions of that entire market.  So if the new regulations level the playing field, we could find some sizable opportunities to reenter parts of the market, like prime revolver, with practices that we think enhance customer loyalty and drive long-term profitability.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of regional differences in spending and payment, and maybe in the uncollectible fees and interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We, David, we certainly, purchase volumes are weaker.  Just as a general comment on -- the most striking thing that we see regionally is weakness on the credit side of the business.  So delinquencies, charge-offs, recoveries, bankruptcies, these are significant -- these are now above portfolio averages for the 25% of the country that is going through the boom and bust.  And they are worsening at a more rapid rate.</p>
          <p>We also do see mild effects on declining payment rates, a little bit higher relative utilization rates, although those are more modest.  I don't think the primary news is really what's happening on the purchase side or in any of these usage-based metrics.  The striking thing to us, again, is that folks in the boom-and-bust markets are certainly having a tougher time in this downturn. And we haven't seen any relief of that effect or any really any recent closing of the gap between the rest of the country and their problems.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I can speak to June with respect to the boom and bust, but I think that when I've looked at just all the charts on annual trends, it again is -- this effect we've talked about for some time, we certainly see.  I guess one other effect I would say that we have seen, David, that's a little different from what we talked about last year, is that the challenges consumers in the boom-and-bust markets are having are differentially hitting the mortgage holders more than the non-mortgage holders.  Now in many ways, this is intuitively plausible. it's just that we said last year in many ways it was more a universal effect we saw in the boom-and-bust markets across mortgage holders and non-mortgage holders. But lately, we have seen, actually, more of the struggle concentrated with respect to the mortgage holders themselves.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys.  I just want to go back through something; some comments have been made and just try to reconcile a couple of things.  You made the comment that credit is generally in line with your expectations.  You made the comment that you built the allowance by about $38 million during the quarter.  Last quarter, you said that on a next 12-month basis, you expected about $6.7 billion of charge-offs, so you have an allowance comparable to $6.7 billion of charge-offs.  This quarter, you say 7 billion allowance over the next 12 months, and again, there's slippage because the 12 months aren't quite comparable.  But the question I have is this: basically the implication is there is a $300 million increase in terms of allowance expectations.  I'm not sure how that relates to the $38 million, but more importantly, when you look at the three quarters that are in common for those comparable periods, Q3, Q4 and Q1 of next year, is there any increase in your loss expectations for those periods? Or is this entirely driven by higher expectations for Q2 in '09, which would be a huge increase on a year-over-year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Rick, it's Gary.  I certainly understand that every quarter that we have been talking about an allowance build or release and trying to relate that to an equivalent level of managed losses over the following 12 months, remember that that is a bit of an approximate calculation, because we only build allowance for the losses we expect for the loans which are on our balance sheet and, therefore, appropriately reported.  So for example, in this quarter, where we built allowance by $38 million, but can absorb losses of an extra 300 million over the course of the next 12 months. Part of the reasoning behind that -- in fact, the single biggest driver &#x2013; is that as of the end of the first quarter, given the capital market conditions at the time, we assumed that we would not be able to securitize any additional loans.  We thought that was the appropriate and prudent assumption.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we had better opportunities over the course of the quarter.  We securitized $2.6 billion worth of loans. And therefore, with a higher level of securitization for a shrinking loan book, a smaller number of dollars of allowance against the reported balance sheet can actually absorb a higher level of managed losses. So again, we feel it's important to give you both a loss outlook through the managed number, but also to give you a sense of how that might affect the allowance itself.  So I think it's important to keep that in mind.</p>
          <p>In terms of the pattern of losses that we might expect, again, as you've heard us say before, when we take a look out six months, we have a relatively good view of what to expect because we've got a situation in the -- for folks who are already in the delinquency buckets.  And, therefore, the comment that I made, and you repeated, about our outlook not having changed dramatically means that for the third quarter of '08, the fourth quarter of '08 and the first quarter of '09, our charge-off outlook hasn't changed very much.  Those were already captured in the 12 month forward view at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>What we have done is to swap out Q2 '08, which we've just finished and now we're capturing the second quarter of '09 in our 12 month outlook.  And as a result, that does assume that with rising loss rates, we're simply going to have a higher level of losses in Q2 '09 than in Q2 '08.  And that's the reason that we've gone ahead and increased our coverage ratios to anticipate all of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go to Brad Ball with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Just to clarify, Gary.  Did you say that you did not expect to issue any credit card ABS in the second half of this year?  And I wonder if you could talk about the deposit growth expectations?  Are those deposits coming mostly through purchased money through Internet offerings?  And what kind of rates are you offering there, and what are the implications for your net interest margin if you're purchasing those deposits through the brokerage channel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Brad, happy to take both of those.  With respect to our funding plan, as I've said, over the course of the second quarter, we were able to access sequentially better and better terms on asset-backed funding.  We did a total of 2.6 billion going from, everywhere at about 175 over down to 110 over.  And so what we did was to accelerate to the early part of the year some of our funding plan that would have normally come later in the year.  So my point here is that we have no need to securitize during -- to issue asset-backed securities in the second half of the year.  But, again, if market conditions turn favorable, we'll look at our other alternatives in terms of private conduits and so forth.  And we may find that it's opportunistically appropriate to go ahead and do some additional funding, but there's certainly no need to do it, and that's why I wanted to give you that update on our plan.</p>
          <p>Part of the overall funding plan, of course, is what we expect in terms of deposit growth, and Rich reiterated for you our expectations for deposit growth.  We expect that we will be using all of our channels to grow deposits.  There is as you know well, Brad, a good demand for guaranteed deposits, and we're seeing it in our branches, we're seeing it in our national direct bank.  And we've also done some brokered CDs, as well.  I think we will be tilting more towards branch and national direct bank deposits over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>And as far as the terms and the price at which we're operating, if you take a look at even our brokerage CDs have been, with weighted average maturities, well beyond two years.  So I think you have to recognize that we're being very price sensitive there, and not doing anything to speak of inside of one year with the national direct bank.  Again, some of the longer maturities, although we have some new money market accounts that we've been putting out there.  And, again, we expect we're going to get some more business in the branches, now that the conversion is behind us and a lot of the new products that Rich mentioned are being rolled out.  You can see the prices certainly for our national direct bank on our website. And if you take a look at the results in the second quarter, you'll see that deposit margins have improved.  So, although we've been able to get a good volume deposits, those have not come at the expense of margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, fair enough, and just a quick follow-up for Rich. I wonder if you could talk quickly about your strategy in the U.K.  We note that you haven't grown there for a while and you're indicating credit conditions have gotten worse; where do you expect the U.K. franchise to be a couple of years down the road?  Where do you see it positioning relative to the High Street banks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brad, right now we are very focused on being in the most secure position possible to weather a potential storm in the U.K. And we've been in that mode for quite some time because, of course, there was a fair amount of credit pressure through insolvencies in the industry, as a warm-up in a sense for a downturn, that happened a couple of years ago. And that put us even more so into a very extra-cautious, only grow if we're very comfortable at well above hurdle rate, against some pretty tough assumptions.  So really ever since then, Brad, it's been a very -- there really hasn't, not a lot has happened in terms of the metrics.  We spent a lot of time working on the business and have rebuilt some of the operating infrastructure and so on along the way.</p>
          <p>We remain really, pretty cautious about the U.K.  Just looking at the U.K. environment, it's certainly challenging, consumer indebtedness is still at record levels and more certainly, the declining home values, inflationary pressures are certainly something that we worry about.  There are some other factors, actually, that make the U.K. quite a bit better than the U.S.  The other factor that the industry is still adjusting to is the cap on fees that was implemented over the past year or so.  So generally, we're just being very cautious, make sure that we can weather the storm resiliently. But to keep our optionality on the other side of this in terms of the ability to go back and do what we have done in credit card businesses over the years.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, that's a bit of an anomaly, because typically what we've done with that portfolio is rather than have it go to charge -off, we have sold the assets prior to that point.  We just didn't happen to do any sales in this particular period, and none of the business on the portfolio actually made it to charge-off. So that's more of an anomalous performance in the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The $0.03, Brian, again, there was no additional rep and warranty charge for the GreenPoint book that is in discontinued operations. So really, all you're seeing there is the expenses related to maintaining that book, and also some advances on a couple of HELOC deals that had been previously securitized by GreenPoint.  So that accounts for the $0.03.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, thanks for taking my question.  With regard to account attrition in the credit card portfolio, you mentioned low receivables growth. I'm just curious if that's targeted attrition, and if it is targeted, maybe what credit tiers you're targeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, in terms of attrition, well, first of all, just an overall comment about our attrition, Scott. Even despite the change in terms and repricing actions that we took in 2007, we actually are seeing the lowest account attrition rates that we've seen in years.  So we're quite positive about that.  The relatively, well, the low to negative growth that you generally see going on recently with Capital One in the card business is a matter of just our picking our spots selectively, really one customer at a time, and one segment at a time.  We generally have had the least growth in the prime revolver space, and so net-net, that is still &#x2013; and net-net, our portfolio is suffering some attrition there. Because it's not getting replenished as we're staying out of much of that part of the marketplace because of the same issues we've been talking about for years. We don't think the risk-adjusted returns in that market clear our own estimation of some of the risks.  So -- but generally it's pretty much the same story we've said for a long time.  I mean with this business is, generally we find it resilient and continuing to be profitable.</p>
          <p>One other striking thing I'll say is that recent vintages, the universal principle that I've seen in prior downturns and I've seen in this one, that recent vintages tend to not per &#x2013; as the downturn really takes off, tend to not do as well as prior ones.  We see that effect everywhere, but it's probably, we see that affect the smallest in the credit card business where again, I just think a manifestation of the power of some of the underwriting choices we made and to some extent the performance of the business.</p>
          <p>We've also, Scott, just across the board tightened up our underwriting.  We have continued every quarter to raise the bar on the boom-and-bust markets with respect to credit policy.  Within the segments that we have been in, we've kind of gone to the highest ground and in our own forecast, even our baseline forecasts, we put a worsening in and then worsened that by another 40%.  So the net of all of this is kind of doesn't generate much growth, but I think it puts us in a very solid position to be ready for the turn in the market.</p>

Is 1.5 billion &#x2013; I think that's the number &#x2013; is that a good number to use going forward, or do you expect more, a further reduction in originations.?</p>

          <p>We'll go to Chris Brendler with Stifel Nicolaus</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Just a little follow-up on the revenue margin, if you could, or revenue trends. I think if you look back a little bit you had a really good first quarter, 17% growth, all of a sudden it drops like a rock.  I think you actually raised your revenue guidance last quarter from low to low-to-mid, and now you're saying if trends stay stable, that you're going to be at the low end of the range, which means that revenue margins on a year-over-year basis are going to fall even further from here.</p>
          <p>What changed, in the sense that from the time you put the Q out mid-May to today, I just wanted to know of those factors you detail in the presentation, is it really just the credit performance that changed so dramatically and specific to that late stage roll rate?  Or were there other factors that you didn't anticipate that caused the revenue margins to collapse so quickly?  And if it is the late stage roll rate, what do you think is causing that?  Is it housing that's causing people to go from the delinquency to charge-off more quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Chris.  Yes, we're not changing our range of guidance with respect to revenue that we had last quarter, but certainly you can see our commentary relative to the very plausible conditions that could take us to the low end of that revenue range.  So let me comment on what we see happening with respect to revenue.  We're at moment of time when I think there's a lot of moving parts and more than usual level of uncertainty about the forecasting of this number, but let's talk about a few factors.</p>
          <p>Certainly economic stimulus payments, which, particularly in May they came out, but they're still coming out over this period of time, I don't think anybody's got a measure of that effect, but you know, we see in various news reports that some people are using it to pay off their credit card balances and I think that's been a downward stimulus on the early delinquencies, which of course affect revenues.</p>
          <p>A very important Capital One effect that we've been talking about for really, I don't know, four quarters now, something like that, is the impact of our pricing and policy changes that we did last year.  If you look at the -- see the series of conversations we had in the latter part of last year and every quarter, in just about every conversation with Wall Street in the first half of this year, we've said, look, this is a very beneficial thing to do but it's going to make it, put some noise into the credit metrics and into the revenue metrics.  And I think we've really seen on the credit side how we've deviated from the norm in the credit card industry, and it's pretty much now come back to the pack.</p>
          <p>Chris, we were kind of surprised by the lateness, how belated it seemed that the revenue effects seemed to manifest themselves.  And we definitely outperformed our own expectations in the first quarter as the customers adjusting, and that impact on revenue just still was stubbornly not manifesting itself.  And we think certainly, importantly that effect played out in the second quarter.  Probably net-net relative to our expectations at the time we launched the pricing and policy changes, we have outperformed our own revenue expectations, but certainly there was a significant falloff between the first and second quarter with respect to that and we believe that thing has mostly run its course.</p>
          <p>The other one, I think, is really probably the most pivotal one to talk about, and one that we'll continue to talk about every quarter as we watch it unfold in this downturn, is what's happening with respect to roll rates of delinquencies.  The conventional wisdom in the credit card industry, I think certainly, or among outsiders, certainly, has been that when consumers worsen, it shows up as early delinquencies. Then it rolls through, and six months later there are charge-offs and that there is, along the way to higher charge-offs, significant claw-back, or significant, in a sense, automatic resilience, if you will.</p>
          <p>We've spent a lot of time studying this over the years. Even before this downturn, we had been more skeptical from our analysis of just how much automatic resilience there is, but certainly I would say during this downturn I don't think we're seeing a lot of automatic resilience. What's actually happening, Chris, is if you picture the roll rate curve, what we call the roll rate curve, which is the rate at which consumers move into each stage of delinquency. That curve has pivoted, so that the rate at which they're entering the very first bucket, which is the bucket before the one you see. You see the second bucket which is the 30 to 59 days of delinquency, but the rate at which they enter the first one is strikingly low, and that is a very important component in the total revenue equation.</p>
          <p>As Gary and I talked about, the rate at which they're moving between delinquency buckets into the later stages has in fact increased. So what's happened is the delinquency roll rate curve has actually pivoted, in a sense, around the very first bucket, which if anything has actually dropped.  Now what this would mean for a given level of charge-offs, is going to be less revenue than certainly conventional wisdom would have.  We are taking the interpretation that this pivot is the same effect and not declaring victory from early-stage positive delinquency, but in fact saying that this is probably a natural effect of how consumers are behaving in this downturn.</p>
          <p>And we see other manifestations of this effect too. We see it on the overlimit side, but I think what's going on, Chris, in consumer behavior is the consumers who can manage their finances are, in fact, really going to extra lengths to be very careful on all fronts, but being careful not to pay overlimit fees, being careful not to get a late fee, whereas those that are well on their way to charging off are at a more distressed and less empowered situation than normal.</p>
          <p>So I would counsel you to take our view that it's more likely that this pivoted roll rate curve will stay this way. But one thing I want to say about claw-back is I've spoken a lot about the resilience of the credit care business.  There are two types of resilience: there's the, to whatever form there is automatic resilience in the form of what we call claw-back; and the other is proactive resilience. The overwhelmingly big effect is proactive resilience. You've seen it in our own book,  with respect to the ability to dynamically manage the portfolio, most importantly in terms of pricing, but also very much into credit line management and so on.  The proactive resilience in this business is very much on display at Capital One, and is the dominant form of claw-back.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just real quick, it sounds like it could be housing related. If you think about the last cycle that you had, people were taking equity out of their house, the home equity loans. If they ran into trouble, they ran into some delinquency and some hardship, they could just use the house to fall back on. Now you're just not seeing that, because once people get into trouble there's no other options; the roll rates are deteriorating in the later stages.  Do you see that more the regions that were hot housing market, this effect, or is it nationwide?</p>

          <p>The fact that we have increasingly of late seen a differential performance with respect to delinquencies and charge-offs of mortgage holders in the boom-and-bust markets versus the renters, would suggest your hypothesis is correct and it's very plausible.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>HI guys. First question relates to the allowance in the quarter. Gary, you mentioned that some of the observed delinquency trends in the quarter were a factor in reducing the base allowance requirement. I'm curious if you're able to quantify any impact on delinquencies in the quarter from stimulus checks? And the natural follow-on to that is do you think that the stimulus checks did reduce delinquencies, and therefore directly reduce your allowance requirements this quarter, which might serve to be caught up in the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As both Rich and I have said, Bob, we'd love to be able to give you more insight on the impact of the stimulus payments. Unfortunately, it's just very hard to model; it's something out of the ordinary. Certainly one can read various accounts in newspapers and so forth on how people are using the checks. It's reasonable to believe that people are using it in a defensive way, either to purchase necessities or to manage their debts, and it's not inconsistent with the behavior we're seeing. I don't think we can get to the point of suggesting that there is a clear correlation there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the calculation of the allowance again, different impacts in different businesses so as Rich said, with the old GreenPoint HELOC portfolio, for example, Rich described that, although at a very high level of losses that's stabilized and that portfolio is running off pretty quickly, that's the kind of thing that would tend to have us reduce the allowance.</p>
          <p>Again, in the Auto business, where we're seeing some contraction, what you can assume is that with the allowance staying pretty stable quarter to quarter, the contraction is more or less offsetting for any degradation that we may be seeing or assumptions from recovery rates and those sorts of things.</p>
          <p>I think by and large, if you take a look at the big drivers loss outlook, which is in all these macro statistics &#x2013; whether it's housing prices, unemployment, consumer confidence, and so forth &#x2013; that is consistent with greater weakness going forward than we've seen in our portfolio up till now and that's why you see the coverage ratios of allowance to 30-plus delinquencies going up, and it's about as good as we can do, particularly when we have to capture that back six months of the 12 month outlook, where we have to make assumptions about people who are going to charge off between months seven and 12, who today are current. Again, all we can do is use our best models to come up with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a follow-up and a point of clarification, when I look at the Other segment there was about $4 billion increase in core deposits. Is that out of the direct bank? And where is the new online product offerings housed, in the banking segment or separately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, all of the deposits that are in the Other segment are deposits raised through the broker channel, because that is considered a Treasury instrument; it's simply a funding instrument.  You would see all of the national direct bank deposits in the Local Banking segment, as Rich described it, but when you add them all together and you can take a look at the margins, you can see that where we're obviously very proactive in managing the channels to get the best possible pricing among the various choices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening.  My question relates to your capital retention strategy. I'm hoping you might be able to add some additional clarification. You're generating capital internally which is frankly a very anomalous event in the financial services world these days. You have been very capable of growing deposits, reducing receivables, your ABS is fairly stable. Can you give us some additional insight into your decisions to want to retain capital going forward, please?  Then I have a follow-up as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Ken, you should pretty much speaks for itself.  We are in the same boat as everybody else, to understand that our economy is under great pressure. Hard to know exactly how deeply pressured the economy gets, or how long it lasts. As a result, while our allowance obviously will reflect our view of expected losses, one can only assume that the level of unexpected losses is higher today than it was. Therefore, holding capital at this point in time, beyond that which is used to pay our dividends, is the appropriate thing for us to do from a defensive standpoint, but the same capital that we're holding onto today, Ken, for defensive purposes, is available to support the growth in the book that Rich described us to expect to pursue as we see the economy improving.  So think of it as defensive in the short run, but it's also my need to be able to make sure that when our businesses see the opportunities to grow, I don't hold them back by virtue of not having the right amount of capital for them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in summary, your <mark type="inaudible" /> in the short term gives you some drag on earnings. But that's a reasonable price to pay for (1) just the protection on the downside and (2) the growth on the flip side of this cycle should ultimately see nice margin expansion. So you don't need to borrow was much at that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, drag on returns not on earnings, but certainly a drag on returns, and as I said, even in our investment portfolio, because that capital is available to us and because of the anomalies we're seeing in the market, we've been able to generate some pretty good investment returns there.  Normally, we would prefer to use that capital towards the building of our loan book.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  I was just wondering in response to a couple of the recent questions, it seems like you're reserving methodologies, you've kind of rolled forward this loss over the next four quarters; you don't really assume an improving economy.  So given the fact that a number of your competitors actually have worse results than you now, what is going to be the signal that it's time to start investing that capital and growing the receivables again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Moshe, from my experience of 20 years of doing this consumer lending business, I think the term we use is the inflection point, how will you ....  If you believe the thesis that is the, probably the worst business is the business booked during the latter part of the boom and then into the down cycle. And the best is that which is booked past that inflection point, I think the key indicators would be first of all, obvious ones looking at the economy and so on. Although we certainly have seen, Moshe, that a lot of times our own, say, credit card performance is an early indicator of economic indicators, and not the other way around.</p>
          <p>So we'd certainly have an eye to the economy although my hunch is that might be a little late to the party from a metrics point of view. Obviously a big one is just looking at our own portfolio.  But I think looking at recent vintages is very, very important, and the nature of positive or negative selection that we see coming right over the transom at the origination stage, because what I've found over time, you don't necessarily have to wait a year to sort of figure stuff out.  There's a lot of signs associated with the flow of applications at the point of origination; that looking at distribution of scores, looking at the credit profile, and a whole variety of metrics that we have, that I think that ...</p>
          <p>The challenge we put out to all of our businesses, Moshe, is how will you know it when you see it, when the inflection point has come, and what are you going to do about that?  I don't think it's necessarily a universal Capital One moving at all times across all businesses. I think certainly between our commercial business in local geographies and nationally on the consumer side, these may come at different points.  My key pitch is this is asymmetrical risk until you hit the inflection point, and I think back to Ken's question, we are best served by being extremely conservative, stockpiling capital, funding and credit capacity, if you will, to take advantage in a weaker market that comes on the other side of this.</p>
