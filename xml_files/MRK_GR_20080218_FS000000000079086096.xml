          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, it's a great pleasure for us to have you here. Unfortunately, yeah, some delays for the people coming out of London, so therefore, the appearance from our London coverage is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, again, welcome here in Darmstadt to the Full Year and Fourth Quarter Results Presentation 2007. It's a great pleasure for me today to be with here to &#x2013; with Dr. Kley, the Chairman of the Executive Board, and Dr. Michael Becker, who is the Chief Financial Officer of the Group. And they both will explain you details of our full-year results during their presentation, and later on, according to the normal procedure, we will open then our Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>But, before we start, I'd like to draw your attention to the disclaimer. Nowadays nothing is without it. The worst part to mention here, it's outlined on page two, that the return on sales are calculated since the Serono acquisition on the total revenue basis and it's also important to recognize that the 2006 comparable numbers are all based on pro forma, i.e., this is including Serono, although naturally, the acquisition was only concluded and closed on the 5th of January, '07.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I'd also like to ask you to switch off your Blackberrys and mobile phones, so that we have here the full attention in that room.</p>
          <p>And then, I'd like to hand over to Dr. Kley.</p>

          <p>So good afternoon. And when I learnt that our friends from London, they're not on-time, I was, of course, asking whether it was Lufthansa or BA and I was luckily informed, it was BA, which is very good, because part of my later-to-be-paid pensions &#x2013; pension will, of course, be paid by Lufthansa, so I still feel some responsibility. So I hope the BA flyers that have learnt their lesson and switch their airline. For the pharmaceutical and chemical investors, there's no need to switch, they are with the right company.</p>
          <p>I will concentrate actually on the few remarks on the full year. I've never been a big fan of quarterly pulse measuring, particularly in this business model, which we run, I think for full year, it gives the flavor and so I'm very happy to unload all interpretations of Italian tax issues and so on to my dear colleague, Michael Becker, who's looking forward to answer all your questions in that respect.</p>
          <p>If you look at the year, 2007 was an outstanding year for Merck. Revenues, &#x2013; let me say, this maybe at the beginning, everything &#x2013; but really everything worked out the way we planned it. Certainly, this has to do with good planning and excellent execution, but it also has to do with luck. I mean, we knew exactly when subprime was coming, so we structured the sale of generics just before Mylan would possibly be hit by it.</p>
          <p>I have to say for those who don't know me, I am a German with British humor, it's difficult to find and hard to understand. Somehow it &#x2013; from time to time, it works. Anyway, we planned subprime with the sale of Generics on time, we planned our capital increase on time. So luck, good timing, and good execution were the cornerstones of the year 2007.</p>
          <p>Revenues basically up 10%, first time exceeding 7 billion in the industrial business. The core operating results that Michael Becker has introduced last time increased by 25% to 1.8 billion. And the core ROS, which is an ROR, but for terminology reasons, we call &#x2013; continue to call it ROS, nearly 25%. Profit after tax doubled to &#x2013; more than doubled to 3.5 billion. I would not repeat the statement of Mr. Wiedeking of Porsche who said that he is striving that profits would exceed sales, we will not manage that. In our case, sales will always be the bigger number.</p>
          <p>In addition, and based on that good underlying business, we propose to increase the regular dividend to 1.20 from &#x20AC;0.90 and in addition, &#x20AC;2 per share for the disposal of Generics, so it will be a total dividend payment of 700 million. This chart should just put '07 in perspective, it's not an isolated year, it's not that the events of '07 came out of inspiration. They are perhaps a consequence of strategic decisions, which can be traced back over the last four years. Within these four years, Merck has changed considerably. We've shown this slide before, but it's important to remember that the portfolio changes have brought us where we are today.</p>
          <p>The four divisions, which we have today, constitute the platform for Merck's future growth. We have formulated a strategy based on those four divisions, which reads sustain, change and grow. Behind each of the word, there's a certain straight path of the strategy behind it. The key issues mainly are for change the way the company operates. We are restructuring, we are reorganizing the processes, the less you read about it, the better, and that you don't read much about it, we are making quite a lot of progress.</p>
          <p>The terms are more efficiency and globalization and profitable growth was introduced by me already when we met last time as the measure for future success. We will explain our strategy as we go forward, as we take actions. So we try to deliver first, explain second, rather to explain -- to explain first and deliver second or never.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to Pharmaceuticals, our biggest division today. Merck Serono provides more than 60% of revenues incorporating result of today's Merck. The acquisition of Serono lifted us to a new league in terms of profitability and operating result and cash flow contribution. And it was very important and encouraging for us to see, and I think Michael Becker will explain it in more detail, when we analyze the results that one off on day one was delivering, what we had hoped for and what we partly expected. So we are quite happy with that.</p>
          <p>On a comparable basis, total revenues grew by 11% organically, reaching 4.5 billion and the return on sales, ROS, exceeded 25% and this is the first time in Merck's history. Gross drivers have been Erbitux, 41% growth in its current indications, which still has in no way unfolded its full potential up to now. For me, it is always very important that Rebif continues to grow, it is our major drug, it delivers the major part of our sales in Pharmaceuticals, it's our biggest product in Merck and we're quite happy that we gained further market share and grew organically by 10%.</p>
          <p>The market position in the US was strengthened, that was part of the acquisition and it was explained. I recently visited Japan; we are on our way to close this white spot on our map, we are hoping for an Erbitux launch this year and that would be launched in addition to the current product  Alza Warner products we finally could also get a foothold in Japan, which makes us more than a sales office, but which would make us into a real company also in Japan. You know, and you have been informed at length that we reviewed the pipeline and the portfolio and defined the four core therapeutic areas, I will not go into that in detail, but we also use the integration process to redefine processes throughout the company including some of the corporate processes where we used some of, say all our processes through redo things as we have been doing in Merck.</p>
          <p>The bigger size, the bigger cash flow, the strong position, the defined core therapeutic areas, the portfolio and the pipeline as it stands today gives a small opportunity to negotiate partnerships and comparing with old Merck, we have moved into a different world. So from this year, we have concluded nearly 20 agreements with different partners in various areas; some were published, some not. The ones, which for me seem to be the most interesting is the one is Ambrx on the growth hormones. And then this Archemix, which has been published I think also on the aptamer research and with Idera on the agonist for cancer therapies. Of course, that's all early stuff, but the direction is clear and the quality of our partnership agreements is increasing as we go on, and we can see it while we're working. And this is a very strong signal that the new league Merck is in, which does not only refer to financials, but also to quality of the portfolio and the partnerships.</p>
          <p>Consumer, small but fine; growing faster than the market, or has increased. The moving, I have the dream of concluding a small but lovely acquisition at year-end, unfortunately didn't materialize, so let's see whether we can make up for it. But despite that, we are moving the strategic brands, are penetrating much faster than the other brands, so the increase in sales is carried exclusively by the strategic brands.</p>
          <p>And also in the regional expansion, we have moved forward, we have arrived in China, and we concluded also the necessary agreements to market our products in Japan, a market where we, as you know, will not go into ourselves simply to expense the same, just to repeat it, press for the United States who not invest in the United States, but have others to do that.</p>
          <p>Final word on Generic is basically not necessary. You have been informed on that lengths and details, and Michael Becker will explain the financial implications when he speaks. Chemicals, a lot of excitement about Liquid Crystals in 2007. We are happy to contribute to further excitement. Organic growth, 14%, and return on sales, 53%, even better than we expected. So, our people seem to keep it better than we know ourselves, which is an encouraging sign as we move forward.</p>
          <p>We are the number one in this industry and we will remain number one in this industry. We have invested over the years, 400 million in production. We will invest this year a number which will be certainly more than 50 million into production as well. We will keep the distance between our competitors in production facilities, quality of management, which is not a trivial issue in this business.</p>
          <p>And you might have read today that <mark type="inaudible" /> announced to move stronger into liquid crystals and the cost of plasma. So, quantities would rather increase than decrease, and we will make sure that we have all the quantities the customers are asking for.</p>
          <p>We continue also to invest in quality and to technology, monitoring the business development very extensively also from the Board's point of view. So &#x2013; and if you look then at the &#x2013; so from our point of view, we are doing everything which we can do to continue with the success story of Liquid Crystals. The only thing which we do not have under control is the currency, but as you can see from the results, we are managing it quite well.</p>
          <p>There might be economic concerns as we go forward, the display manufacturers are positive. They expect the Olympic Games and the European Football Championships to drive demand and we expect Germany to become European Football Champion this year. And I do hope that all our British friends will watch the competition very extensively on flat screens, driving our business further as well. And I also hope I never have to sit here and Germany does not qualify, because then probably you would hit back.</p>
          <p>In addition to what we are doing in Liquid Crystals, we have also invested in OLED, organic light-emitting diodes. It's not that we expect this to happen in the foreseeable future. The Liquid Crystals will continue to dominate the market for a number of years into rather higher number than lower number. So, the bet is on Liquid Crystals, certainly in the next decade. But in one way or the other, OLED will come. We have all ingredients for its success. We've focused on the materials, can supply the materials. We have the technology and most of all, we have the consumer know-how. We know what the customer wants and what he needs.</p>
          <p>We are the biggest European currently. But you have to look for the turnover with the magnifying glass. So, it's not a business today and for nobody a business today. But if it becomes a business, we want to be participated, leverage what we have now in Liquid Crystals. But probably in talking about that, we would have to talk to your successors in your jobs. I think we will not see that in the next five years as a major business emerging.</p>
          <p>Performance &amp; Life Science, our backbone business, organic increase of 4.6, ROS of 11.7%, could have been better. I mean after all, it's a chemical business, so we don't expect wonders, still could have been better. We are not fully satisfied. We have all the reasons to believe that next year will be better. There have been some special effects in December, but as I told you, quarterly effects will be explained by Michael Becker. So I withdraw from PLS at this stage and move on to the financial strengths.</p>
          <p>Both on the finance aspect, it was an extremely successful year. As you know, we acquired Serono on January 5, for 10.3 billion. And a year later, nobody talks about net debt anymore. Strong cash flow, capital increase and net proceeds of 5.1 billion from the Generics disposal led us to this good financial position.</p>
          <p>As we go forward, we will keep this financial discipline. So we are not running wild outside medicines to find great result. I'm very proud of that.</p>
          <p>So let's move forward, again, to 2008. And as I said, we have worked hard on the strategy, execution is ongoing and we will report on the results as we move on. But despite all these global processes, which we introduced, one thing which has made Merck strong and different is that really all business is local and local entrepreneurship is somehow in the genes of Merck.</p>
          <p>You can see that because without this local entrepreneurship, the company would not have survived period so long in which not very much came out of the pharmaceutical R&amp;D, still bringing up to 2 billion sales, which is purely local entrepreneurship. So what we try to do in globalizing R&amp;D, the globalizing marketing, developing global products and strategy to keep our local entrepreneurs what they are local entrepreneurs. It's a delicate balance, I think we will manage it.</p>
          <p>The success of Merck Serono will ultimately judged by the productivity of the R&amp;D organization. So how many compounds we are able to bring to the market and if in a few years time, I would have to judge my personal performance and that of Elmar Schnee and the companies certainly, that would be the key measure which you would look at that and see whether we could deliver on that. We have worked our new processes in R&amp;D, we've replaced the management and done the necessary portfolio work, now give us the time to deliver we will.</p>
          <p>We'd like to talk about our best of world's approach and you find it many things publicly listed and managed, privately controlled, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, bio pharmaceuticals and NCEs. So there are number of issues where we try to combine the best of both worlds. And other than from business, it supports us in two directions. One, there are a number of -- in partnerships. I mentioned that already before what I see a number of partners who do not necessarily want big pharma knocking on their door. And for those type of partners, we are kind of an ideal partner. And with a sharper corporate positioning, we have also seen that Merck has become more and more interesting for people on the labor market. We have become an employer of choice, there are not many like alikes. And we try to leverage this very consciously, getting the right people on board.</p>
          <p>Well, this is the agenda, the way forward is quite clear. 2008 is the Erbitux year, you're very familiar with the indications, with the applications, what we have applied for, what we expect, what we will apply for during the course of 2008, and while we will see not much of the additional growth coming into -- falling into 2008 as we're talking second half and later this year, 2008 will be a decisive year for Erbitux.</p>
          <p>Rebif is expected to grow continuously. We've looked at the plans, we've looked this life cycle management. So we are quite comfortable. We expect ongoing volume growth for Liquid Crystals and we also expect high profitability levels in 2008. It will be another wonderful Liquid Crystal year. All in all, we will also deliver in 2008, maybe not in each quarter the prognosed number, but if you look at the 12 months, Merck will deliver also in 2008.</p>
          <p>And with this, I'd like to hand over to Michael Becker. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Gentlemen, Karl-Ludwig Kley's closing remarks that Merck will deliver as a solid foundation in 2007 as Merck has delivered what was promised for 2007. Overall, we're pleased with the health of the Group results for 2007, as reflected in the quality of our growth, a strong core EPS and high cash flow generation for the year.</p>
          <p>Revenue from continuing operations increased by 5.4% and exceeded 7 billion, which was in line with our guidance at &#x2013; of 4 to 6% nominal growth. Excluding the negative currency impact and the divestments, organic revenue growth was 9.7%. Merck Serono contributed 85% of the Group's revenue growth for the year, and the division also had a significant impact on Group operating result improvement.</p>
          <p>The operating result growth exceeded our target of over 20% on the basis of both the legal view at 22% and on the core operating result versus pro forma 2006 view growing by 25%. Core operating result excludes amortization on intangibles and Serono integration costs and was 1.7 billion for the Group. This translates into a return on sales of 24.8% for 2007 for the Group compared to 21% for 2006 on a pro forma basis &#x2013; so, including Serono.</p>
          <p>The strong return on sales in Liquid Crystals, which at 53% exceeded our guidance, was obviously an important factor on the operating result. Free cash flow was almost 1 billion and we should generate sizable cash flows in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Due to the disposal of Generics, our capital increase, and operating cash flow, we concluded 2007 with a very clean balance sheet as already mentioned and only &#x20AC;355 million of net debt. As predicted, net debt is not an issue anymore and the balance sheet and cash flow outlook gives Merck a solid footage and strategic flexibility.</p>
          <p>The trend in our revenue and quarterly views has generally been upward even though currency has been an important scene for 2007. Our revenue saw a foreign exchange impact of minus 3.8% on Group revenue and of minus 9% in Liquid Crystals, due to the fact that all the LC business is in Asia and dominated in Japanese yen, US dollars and other currencies linked to the US dollar.</p>
          <p>Half of Group sales come from Europe, but the acquisition of Serono added approximately 700 million of sales in North America and we are seeing strong regional growth in Latin America and in Asia for all divisions, so more non-Euro sales.</p>
          <p>We can foresee currency adversely impacting top-line growth again in 2008. In accordance with IFRS, the exchange rate we use at a given time is the year-to-date average and you can see the development on the right hand side graph. Since the actual rate steadily went down during 2007, we see an elevator effect in January, 2008. You can see the jump from 137 to the &#x2013; just a dot in January to 148 in January. This is due to the fact that we need to use average exchange rates in the year.</p>
          <p>As to hedging, we have been following those who believe that the US dollar and the Japanese yen had reached the end of their decline and have reduced the hedging of our expected receipts in those currencies accordingly. We still have a hedging gain of 8 million included in our final cash position, but that is 23 million less than in 2006, the comparison is within our other operating expenses. Going forward, we share regular review our hedging policy and of course, the transaction risk is always covered and the same way, of course, the translation risks cannot be covered.</p>
          <p>Regardless of currency, Merck has generated quality growth due to strong operating leverage characterized by higher margins and modest-ever operating expense growth as summarized on this slide. Gross margin for the Group improved to 77.9% of sales for 2007 versus 76% last year, mainly due to cost improvements and also to product mix. Marketing and selling cost grew slower than the top line. Administration expenses even dropped and that by more than 11% due to synergies or eliminating of overlapping activities of the Serono acquisition and the divesting of the Serono stock. The healthy P&amp;L structure is demonstrated by the fact that core operating result grew 24.7%, well above the 5.4% increase in revenue.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I show the reconciliation of core profit after tax to EPS of &#x20AC;5.21 per share. It demonstrates the impact of the various adjustments we made to reflect the performance of the underlying businesses. The two largest adjustments are the purchase price allocation of Serono and 734 million Serono inventory step-up, which is included in exceptionals. Q4 exceptionals include environmental protection expenses of 38.5 million, which results in total exceptionals of 776. Restructuring cost for Merck Serono came in at 153.6 million, above our 122, 130 million guidance for 2007.</p>
          <p>We now expect integration expenses for Serono to only reach 175 million rather than the former outlook of 200 million. So we have accelerated our spending and reduced the total as well. Tax effects for the adjustments are also taken into consideration to reach core profit after tax on the far end right hand side of this slide.</p>
          <p>While the amortization of the intangibles will remain with us for over ten years, the exceptional charges related to Serono inventories are finished and integration expenses are winding down. So the adjustments should not be as large for 2008 and the core EPS covers this; 2007 will be more straightforward.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the balance sheet, our strong balance sheet, which is one of the objectives of the company as a whole; of course, the total assets of the Merck &#x2013; of Merck have nearly doubled to 15 billion due to the Serono acquisition. The Serono acquisition also added 6.8 billion of intangible assets to the balance sheet with the remaining balance around 6.2 billion at year-end. So, the difference has been depreciated during the year and the purchase price was also reduced by an impairment booked in 2007.</p>
          <p>I'd like to highlight in this connection that intangible assets must be regularly tested for impairment, which could lead to immediate write-downs. The Merck Serono P&amp;L includes an impairment charge of 43.6 in Q4 because circumstances had changed slightly, but because we're talking about big amounts also slightly changes have a significant impact. And since a significant portion of the assets are subject to impairment testing, further impairments are always possible and maybe triggered by events such as clinical setbacks and changes in launch timelines or market conditions that reduce a project's potential or even currency fluctuations since we're dealing with over 6 billion, the amounts can be big from relatively small impact.</p>
          <p>Like the purchase price allocations, impairments is part of the SG&amp;A and reduced the remaining balance of intangible assets. For that reason, we treat impairments of Merck Serono like purchase price allocation and excluded from our core EPS calculation.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to the divisions now, most importantly with Merck Serono core operating result was up 48%, and here we highlight for the first time synergies of 65 million, which are in the P&amp;L already in 2007. So the run rate that we have achieved was of course higher, but in the whole year, P&amp;L, we are 65 million and this offsets a portion of our integration expenses. The division produced a 10.7 organic sales growth with declining cost of sales, and quite substantially, decline in cost of sales, and of course, most of the big synergies in administration were realized in the Merck Serono division.</p>
          <p>Excluding integration and impairment charges, SG&amp;A was up only 1.5% in the division rather than the 14.2% shown in the P&amp;L. R&amp;D was actually down 4.2% for the year due to the termination or acceleration of programs following the portfolio review. The R&amp;D expenses were down 20% in Q4 versus last year because we reversed some accruals for anticipated program expenses that did not develop. Q3 &#x2013; Q4 should not be taken as a new run rate for Merck Serono R&amp;D expenses, we still expect to target R&amp;D expenses around 20% of revenue or 1 billion, whatever is the greater.</p>
          <p>Return on sales was 24 -- 5.2 for the full year and 24% for the fourth quarter, and that compares very favorable to the 18.4 ROS in 2006.</p>
          <p>Rebif, Merck Serono's largest selling product, at over 1.2 billion grew 10% on an organic basis for 2007. The US remains the most robust geography with 18% growth coming from both market share gains and higher price. The roll out of the new formulation is on track in Europe, patients and doctors are giving very good feedback due to its tolerability profile. So this should have sustained future sales growth.</p>
          <p>Erbitux, as already highlighted, had another great year with strong sales growth and clinical success in three large Phase III studies in first-line settings, colorectal, lung, and squamous cell head and neck cancer.</p>
          <p>As you may remember, we previously expected to get approval for first-line and mono &#x2013; metastatic colorectal cancer regardless of the KRAS status. Our original study design did not intend to distinguish between KRAS status, the wild-type and the mutated tumors, as the distinction did not seem to be important at the time. However, following increased evidence from retrospective analysis of other studies which we did in the light of the increased prominence of KRAS and expert discussions, we now believe that Erbitux probably does not have remarkably higher -- that probably does have remarkably higher efficacy in colorectal patients with KRAS wild-type than in those with mutated tumors. If the KRAS hypothesis is confirmed, the authorities may limit the use of Erbitux to patients with KRAS wild-type tumors. However, we do not expect lower peak sales if this outcome occurs, as the efficacy of Erbitux in this patient population should lead to a higher market penetration.</p>
          <p>Raptiva is continuing to grow rapidly based on long-term efficacy data and market education initiatives. We have regained some market share with Gonal-f, particular in the US and Q4 finished the year with good strengths. We now have a few thousand SCCHN patients who are using easypod, a new electronic injection device that was launched in the US in December and is now available in 24 -- 25 countries. The device strategy for both these brands is helping differentiate products in maturing markets. The classic products have continued the trend of higher sales as we implemented regional strategies to address local markets in Asia and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Moving on to pipeline changes, the integration of Serono has made us more attractive alliance partner. We have all ready heard that, we have been very active with the pipeline over the last quarter, initiating a number of trials, including the late-stage trials listed here for lupus and Parkinson disease. We also announced collaborations such as the Idera deal in oncology.</p>
          <p>Please also note that today, we announced that Merck Serono and Takeda decided to no longer jointly pursue development of matuzumab. Consistent with our decision to suspend development projects in diabetes, we have returned the rights of the DPPIV inhibitor to Glenmark. As far as the Merck Serono pipeline catalysts for 2008 are concerned, we foresee a number of regulatory responses, clinical filings, and clinical study advances, many involve Erbitux including regulatory responses in Japan for colorectal cancer and Europe for first-line colorectal cancer, both of which should contribute to sales toward the end of the year and accelerate growth in 2009. We will also start other important Phase III studies. In addition, the CLARITY study of cladribine tablets for multiple sclerosis will finish in early 2009. This will be the first Phase III completed for an oral multiple sclerosis candidate. So we look forward to that.</p>
          <p>Consumer Healthcare next, this business continues to grow at a rate above the broad over-the-counter market due to its focus on four key health themes where sales are up 7%. We have stronger gains in certain regions, including China and Latin America. The ROS improved to 14.2% due to higher gross margins. R&amp;D expenses increased 16% in 2007, reflecting an increased effort around new products. Free cash flow was reduced by higher working capital. We believe sales and margin performance is sustainable in 2008 and we are happy to have risk diversification and keep the cash flow CHC offers.</p>
          <p>Liquid Crystals, after a year where there was considerable level of public excitement about the business, finished nearly in a mundane way. On a reported basis, Liquid Crystal revenues was 960 million. Excluding the adverse effects of 8.7 currency and 3.2 divestments, organic growth was 14% growth, the difference to what we expect happening on a yearly average, the 20% volume growth was price pressure.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was also a good development and exceeded at 14% growth. Revenue had also shown good sequential growth from Q1 with Q4, the strongest quarter, aligned with the general market trend. Q4 however could not match the extremely strong Q4 of 2006. Return on sales was 53, both the full year and Q4, so slightly higher than the 50% reported in Q3, and also as already said, slightly higher than our predicted 52%, which is obviously sort of a threshold margin. And this was in spite of higher SG&amp;A during 2007, which is due to the absence of hedging gains that already mentioned as well as 18% higher R&amp;D expenses.</p>
          <p>The ongoing capital expenditures that we have already indicated in this year, 49 million, this is due rates, not approval, so 49 million, which is on the lower end of our average of the last four years; on average, we invested 77 million in that business, that includes all CapEx related to infrastructure as well. And I think we will see capital expenditure on the other side of 50 million also looking forward.</p>
          <p>Our market position is based on product quality, modern production technologies, an innovative product portfolio, and excellent customer relations, and I do not expect this to change.</p>
          <p>Performance &amp; Life Science, the division generated 4.6% organic revenue growth, as a result of good sales performance in a few application niches such as pigments, food and environmental analytics, as well as some strength in Asia and Europe.</p>
          <p>The operating result declined versus last year due to mainly restructuring cost in some countries including the US where we are closing sites and R&amp;D expenses on the other hand decreased over 12% as several new product programs advanced to the launch phase. We do expect a significant improvement in the operating result in 2008 due to the absence of restructuring cost that hit us in the last quarter of 2007. This already brings me to the outlook.</p>
          <p>PLS and <mark type="inaudible" /> performance should show modest improvements over 2007, but the other two divisions will drive overall Merck Group performance. So for 2008, we provide total revenue growth and operating result outlook ranges for the Group, Merck Serono and Liquid Crystals.</p>
          <p>The expected revenue growth for Merck Serono is above our 2007 result and the margin outlook is in line with 2007 performance. We are likely to incur some additional marketing costs as we prepare to launch new indications for Erbitux and other new products. Additionally, R&amp;D spending will for the division come closer to 1 billion as we advance products in development and initiate new studies. And I repeat, our target for R&amp;D spend of 20% of sales or 1 billion, whatever is the greater, remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>In Liquid Crystals, we expect normal &#x2013; nominal revenue growth of 5 to 10%. Again, that compares with 20% of quantity growth, volume growth of that growth and expected currency impact and a little bit concession on prices. The 2008 ROS can still reach the 52% level, but this will be a lot -- or this will be not a lot, this will be more difficult than we thought before due to the ongoing currency impacts that will not be balanced by decreasing manufacturing cost as our production this year in Germany. So for the Group, we foresee steady revenue growth of 5 to 9% and an operating margin between 23 and 27%, so generally in line or slightly better than 2007.</p>
          <p>Since we have reduced our debt here and our financial result should drop significantly from 311 million for 2007 to under 100 million in 2008, most of which is attributable to pension provisions.</p>
          <p>Due to the consolidation &#x2013; the consolidation of Generics and special effects from Serono integration, our 2007 tax rate was very volatile and included the impact of exceptional items. The average underlying tax rate for this year was 28.2% and we expect the underlying tax rate to decrease modestly during 2008.</p>
          <p>This concludes my financial overview and hand back to Sascha Becker.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have three financial questions. Maybe I had missed them in the presentation. Erbitux had a net sales, do you disclose this number for 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. And then, sales split for Rebif and an indication for the tax rate for 2008 and then, going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 2008 tax rate, as I said, modestly below the current underlying tax rate which is 28%. So, en route to 25, but I don't think that we will be getting there in 2008 already. So slightly lower tax rate would be in order. And I am afraid I didn't get the Rebif question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The sales spilt, US and rest of the world. Yes, US and --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We indicated that our US business is about 700 million. So, that includes other products as well, but it's an indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue then with Andrew Baum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on Erbitux and the KRAS comment that Dr. Becker gave. We're clearly in a dynamic environment here, because when we last spoke at your R&amp;D meeting, there was a strong answer that we didn't anticipate this outcome, which is clearly after Vectibix had got its approval. So I guess, my question is, in your assertion that you don't see any impact on the ultimate potential of Erbitux, is there some concern that that's premature, given things are fairly fluid, and does that statement capture the fact that you may get a risk or label change to the second and third line label that you have for Erbitux in Europe, again on the KRAS? So, I guess my comment is, can we just gauge your level of confidence and why you feel so confident that in fact, the revenue of this product isn't going to be negatively impacted by this biomarker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, we try not to give premature statements and I think we have a history of not giving premature statements. So the KRAS optimism is based on our data and we have the result of this analysis, and this includes all potential effects of the KRAS outcome of our analysis. And all the effects that you mentioned are included and still lead to our optimism that our expected sales level will not be affected, and this optimism is linked to the outcome of the trials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the second part of my question, does that statement also capture that you have no biomarker impact on the second and third line, so the already approved indications or do you anticipate that that will also in the market start to reflect the biomarker-led approach?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our optimisms regarding the sales includes all effects of the KRAS distinction that you can see in the analysis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had some add on if your first line, third line over the years becomes much less important. So even if there would be a change, it's basically of no relevance.&lt;</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then continue with <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So three questions, if I may. In terms of Merck Serono, if you strip out the restructuring and the Serostim write-off in the fourth quarter, SG&amp;A has gone up to 510 from 397 in the third quarter. Is this just phasing, or is there something that we need to be aware of and is this the right run rate going forward? The second question is on the MOTION trial in early Parkinson's, will you have sufficient data for this to file if the trial is positive? On the advanced Parkinson's, when do you expect data &#x2013; I think the expectation was for middle of 2008 and also what is the timing on the filing of that? And then lastly, in terms of your FX assumptions, basically, do you have any hedgings in place and in terms of euro yen and euro dollar, can we get a sense of at what levels are you hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Q4, SG&amp;A is not a run rate, there's nothing to go by, it included a lot of non-recurrent items and other operating expenses and it included a very high level of promotional expenses, especially through accruals. Having said that, the marketing expenses will go up next year for the reasons mentioned, new products and product advance, and that will more than balance probably the decrease in other operating expenses. At least, it will take away the biggest chunk of the decrease in other operating expenses. As to hedging, at the moment, our hedging levels are very low, because as I mentioned in my introduction, we had followed predictions in the market that we are hitting the bottom of the trough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For the MOTION, I think the story has just started. We have targeted 2010 at the moment. We think we can stay with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will the one trial be enough, in early Parkinson's?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since it's designed to, it looks like yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the advanced Parkinson's, do we expect data in the middle of the year and what are your guidelines on filing for that indication?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No indications compared to what we have said before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we continue then with Amit Roy from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first question on rebates, what is the status of the new formulation application in the US with, I think, the last we heard of was the beginning of last year? And following on from that, what is the &#x2013; what is your NRx in Europe of the new formulation? And secondly, on the FLEX study, not asking for any numbers, but what was the logic behind using the VC chemotherapy, the vinorelbine bis chemotherapy, when in Europe the paclitaxal-based or gemcitabine-based is quite more commonly used? And lastly, on &#x2013; actually two more, sorry. On synergies, there has been a little bit of confusion as to what the synergy level is meant to be and whether it's been realized quicker or slower, on some press releases earlier this morning, just a clarification if where we are on synergy realization? And then, lastly, just a comment on the Chisso situation, what do you know as to when or if they're going to arrive? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll deal with the synergies and Chisso. On the synergies, you always have to distinguish between things you have identified and then you have a measure introduced and then you have a run rate of your synergies. And the addition of all these measures add up throughout the year, so you have -- at the end of a month, you have a certain run rate that is the monthly rate but this is not the rate for the year. So that's the distinction. I had referred to things that are fully in the P&amp;L and these are the 66 million for 2007. So this is money in the box, saved money, really safe money. The run rate is for higher. It's over &#x2013; it's around 100 million, but this year, measures that we have initiated and which are now taking effect. And the amount in the next year's P&amp;L will about double what we have now. So about &#x2013; around 130, 140 million. And then in 2009, we will have the full amount and we still stick to our prediction that that will be 200 million.</p>
          <p>As to Chisso, I think it needs to be highlighted that the competitive situation between Merck and Chisso is as far as the advance of Chisso into the VA technology is concerned is based on announcements. There is no &#x2013; when Chisso announced that they can deliver VA, that didn't mean that they had delivered VA. They said they can deliver VA and we know that they are qualified with customers so that their mixtures are suitable to enter in certain customers' production lines. We have our own view what sort of production lines that may be, low quality, middle quality, high quality, but I think you should ask Chisso what they think where they are qualified. So the penetration of Chisso material in the market at the moment is not very high and it remains to be seen how quickly Chisso will gain a share there and whether they need to let go of share somewhere else. We will do our best to make this share for Chisso as small as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For the -- for the FLEX, there have been a number of studies, publications which have made clear that there's no difference -- no statistical difference, at least here in the different regimens for chemotherapy and non-small lung cancer. So I think let's wait for ASCO '08 and then they will look at the data. And for RNF in Europe, we launched it in September, take off was good. We started in Scandinavia for some reasons. Market took it on very well. It's now launched in 23 countries, I think the big five are still missing, coming soon. The feedback from the market which we get is excellent. United States, in the course of the year, I can't tell you a precise statement it will be, we'll get the approval.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Peter D&#xFC;llmann, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions if I may. The first one is on the KRAS issue, do you think that the whole discussion on these new filings is going to prolong the regulatory approval process in EU on the line extension into first line colorectal cancer? And maybe as an add-on to that, does your FLEX data package really cover that issue sufficiently? And the second question there, although you have left the Generics business by divesting it to Mylan, the situation in Germany may allow to make a little bit of business in that area given these tender business that is going to be executed, if not this year then maybe next year, and you may participate with Glucophage or Concor, perhaps leveraging your overall existing economies of scale there. Would you do that or maybe does your contract with Mylan prevent you from doing so? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take up <mark type="inaudible" /> Generics. I don't think that we have divested Generics to re-enter a cutthroat business. I think we have said in no uncertain terms that the main motive to leave the Generics business is that we feel uneasy in cutthroat businesses, and I can't see any change in the rank and files and if there is a change, then we're probably prevented to become the leading school of thought. I can't see us taking part in tenders at cutthroat prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an ongoing application. <mark type="Inaudible" /> respect for the authorities we can't and will not comment. Our current mindset would be that we would not expect any delays but of course, it's in the hands of the authorities for the non-small lung cancer as we noted of course that the mutations are much rarer. One talks of 20% in non-small lung, and you then move on to head and neck, it's 5% or so. The relevance is much less than NSCLC. So, may I then ask <mark type="inaudible" /> to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just some questions again on KRAS, I was just wondering if you could tell us what your estimation is of the percentage of tumors in colorectal that are KRAS wild-type. And obviously, if you think that this potential limited approval is not going to affect your peak sales, you must then be expecting to get &#x2013; to capture market share within the KRAS wild-type segment. So can you give us an indication of how much better the efficacy is in this sub population? And I was also just wondering if you could remind me, I may have missed this with the data analysis, was that requested by EMEA or did you provide it to them voluntarily?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We, of course, do only what is requested, the authority is running the process. Prevalence 65%. And your assumption on the efficacy is right, but data can only be presented once they are &#x2013; to the public once they are analyzed, set up and properly presented. So we can't give you any data today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's realistic to assume that data will be presented at a big oncology congress sometime this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask a follow up, is that okay, just on the Rebif new formulation. My understanding was that what many clinics were doing is allowing the old formulation inventory to run down before switching patients over to the new formulation. So what proportion of patients would you say now across Europe are actually on the new formulation Rebif?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can't give you a number, but as we have started only in September, and started with the smaller countries. I wouldn't think it's &#x2013; your assumption is right. So we should move into the new formulation as the year goes on. But can't give you a number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. First question is on matuzumab, I'm not sure I understand, is this product officially dead or do you plan to keep on developing it on your own? And the next question, can you give us more details about the potential acquisition targets you're considering in the Pharma division in terms of size or therapeutic areas, not the names?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, matuzumab. The decision on matuzumab is that for Takeda and for Merck, matuzumab is of no interest and will not be pursued other than finishing the current trials so that the patients get treatment. For us, this -- the outcome of the trials made matuzumab too risky, it's too far behind Erbitux and Erbitux is simply too good. I think that's all set to matuzumab.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On acquisitions, the first thing one should also keep in mention and I said it before, is financial discipline. So, they have a strict financial framework in which we move and we did not go outside of it. Second, with the acquisition of Serono, we have built a new platform and we strongly believe that this platform has to be fully integrated and exploited before you add on further pieces here and there. So, don't expect us to do anything similar to Serono in the next future, provided of course, Mr. Vasella doesn't come to us and tell us, please buy us, then we would consider. But that's unprobable to happen. What we look at of course are regional expansions, you do have some countries where we think we need further support to the current business and we'll particularly look at research platforms, new interesting technologies and are working on that, but I ask for your understanding that we first do the deal and then talk about it.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, a question on Kuvan. I'm not sure I can pronounce it's chemical name, so I'll stick with that one. Your outlook for the potential of the product is distinctly less than your US co-party. Could you just help us explain the rationale for that, and I know pricing is a part of that. But could you just give us your current understanding and presumably you've started speaking to some of the payers, as to how you think this is going to shape out and put some kind of estimates on the potential of the product long-term?</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm just checking with Sascha Becker whether I should answer your question, no because, we're in a very, very early stage of discussions and I rather would say, give us some more time to evaluate, it's very early.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Holger Blum, Deutsche Bank. Just two questions. One, could you talk about special items or non-recurring items in the quarters that you mentioned in December in PLS? Could you quantify the amount for all the divisions where you think there had been some figures distorting the results or is everything we've seen on paper more or less a clean number? Secondly, on Erbitux, when you expect the new plant to be finished and the positive benefit from that plant on the bottom line? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The non-recurring items and other operating expenses, they are many. I think, if you take the run rate of the first three quarters, then you have, I think a correct picture. I don't think that it leads anywhere if you have non-recurrent items to list them out, and say, this was that. We don't do that and we don't think that you lose transparency with not knowing. Any individual item, we have disclosed the most important, and I think the rest is always a thing of volatility. And therefore, I think you should really concentrate on, what I call, the quality of growth, namely the two big items, selling and administration, that they are in good shape.</p>

          <p>Just a question on pricing in LCDs. I know earlier, in the middle of last year, we talked about renegotiating forward contracts. I think this is something you do on an ongoing basis, and sort of every two years, it appears. Are you done through a price negotiation for '08 or do you expect some more pricing decrease?</p>

          <p>I mean you will see the effect of new contracts only indirectly, obviously. And what you see then is a mix of measures and the improvements in cost of goods sold or whatsoever suddenly changing the picture. Also the mix question is something which influences the top line very importantly. Generally, a period -- a long period for a pricing negotiation would be three months. So to your precise question, are we through with '08, no way, no way. There are at least three more rounds of price negotiations in '08. It's one of the rare cases where quarter matters.</p>

          <p>And there's actually no additional topic that needs to be addressed and once again, thank you very much for joining us today here in Darmstadt. It was a great pleasure. I hope now the results get much clearer as we probably looked at the first slide this morning.</p>
          <p>If you have any additional question, as always, feel free just to contact the Investor Relations team. And I just would like to use the opportunity to draw your attention to the 23rd of April, where we'll actually publish the first quarter 2008 numbers. Thank you very much again and bye-bye, have a safe trip home.</p>
