          <p>Well, good morning to all of you here. Good something else to others who may be joining us from elsewhere, and welcome to this Rio Tinto 2007 Annual Results presentation. Clearly, Tom Albanese, our CEO, is with me here in London, and Guy Elliott, our CFO, is joining us from Melbourne, we've been talking to Guy earlier, but perhaps Guy, could you just confirm you're there -- you are.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Well, 2007 was a year of significant achievement for Rio Tinto. In an environment of strong demand, we set our fourth consecutive record for underlying earnings, which came in at $7.4 billion, up 1%; a fourth annual record for cash generation, $12.5 billion, $1 billion a month, up 15%, which I think underlines the very healthy operating margins which attach to the high-quality assets we have.</p>
          <p>Our continued focus on strong operational performance delivered record production of many of our key products, and this was reinforced by a substantial program of further investment in the growth of the business. We spent $5 billion on sustaining and expanding our business in 2007 and committed a further $8 billion during the year on capital projects on a 100% basis. And it's this investment which will underpin the value-adding growth of the business in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Reflecting our -- and particularly the Board's confidence in the future outlook of the Group and our ability to deliver substantial cash return to shareholders, we decided in November to announce a forward dividend commitment program. In 2007, the dividend has increased in the full year by 30% and we're committed to increases of 20% in each of the next two years, which I think is as strong a statement as we can make about our confidence in the future of the business.</p>
          <p>Last year we completed the transformational acquisition of Alcan, which gives us a global leadership position in the aluminium industry. We now have assets of the highest quality throughout the aluminium value chain and, as you will hear, integration of these businesses is going well.</p>
          <p>We also, and I think importantly, achieved an absolutely seamless transition in our executive leadership during the year, and believe me these things do not just happen. They are the results of careful planning and management focus and I think its great tribute to the quality of Tom and Guy and all of our other senior leaders. But they've delivered this string of performance records after transition and against a backdrop of heightened co-productivity. It just reinforces our view as a Board that we are very fortunate to have one of the strongest teams in the resources sector.</p>
          <p>The outlook for our markets, which in 2008 are entering a fifth year of record demand growth, remains very positive. We've see, of course, some turbulence in financial markets related to credit concerns and their potential recessionary impacts in the United States, but we expect this to only have a limited impact on the demand for our products. The principal driver of demand for natural resources is the industrialization and urbanization of countries like China and beyond that India. That's a trend, which we think will continue for decades. The linkages between these markets and western economies are related primarily to trade, whereas demand for natural resources is much more closely tied to domestic consumption and infrastructure development in these countries. There is much debate these days about the decoupling, if you like, of East and West. But we do believe that this is a reality in the resources sector.</p>
          <p>We anticipate continued rapid economic growth in China of around 10% in 2008, leading to further exceptionally strong demand growth for our products. On the supply side, there are continuing constraints, long lead times for securing critical capital equipment and consumables, and increasingly long periods of engagement with governments and other stakeholders to get access to have opportunity and secure mining project approvals. That's typical in my experience of the resources business in periods of high prices. But all of this reinforces a positive outlook for mineral commodity markets and I would commend the paper, which Vivek Tulpul&#xE9;, our Chief Economist, has published as he normally does, which gives you, I think, an excellent overview of our insights into some of the key drivers for our industry, and I am sure Vivek will be happy to talk to any of you individually about that paper. As you know, we recently received a pre-conditional offer from BHP Billiton to acquire all of the shares in Rio Tinto. We considered it carefully, but our Board has unanimously rejected the offer on the basis that it is not in the best interest of our shareholders. The offer, while it was an improvement on what we'd seen before, still fails to recognize the underlying value of Rio Tinto's quality assets and prospects.</p>
          <p>We've got under Tom's leadership a very clear strategy, which the Board fully supports to deliver value to shareholders by developing assets of the highest quality and we are executing this strategy very effectively. I think the results tell that story. Our plans are unchanged. They will remain unchanged unless somebody makes a proposal to us, which fully values Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>Today we are focused on 2007, a string of records as I indicated earlier, which underline a lot of what I've said about our future positioning. Put very simply the Boards, because we have two Boards even though they are the same people, Boards of two companies believe that Rio Tinto has an exceptional portfolio of assets and significant stand-alone value opportunities, particularly as we'll come through in iron ore, copper, and aluminium. These assets combined with our strong record for value delivery, project execution, and successful exploration positions Rio Tinto very well to take advantage of strong global markets in the industry. We believe we have no doubt that this will create significant future value for shareholders and we would need to see a very compelling alternative to depart from this base case. Value and only value is what matters to Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>On the 1st of February, again as you know, we were informed by Chinalco and Alcoa that they had acquired a 12% shareholding in Rio Tinto PLC at a purchase price of around &#xA3;60 per share. They've stated that they made this investment because they think highly of our assets and our management, and that the prospects for Rio Tinto are attractive. We believe this acquisition by primarily aluminum-focused companies underlines our overall value proposition, as well as the value of Alcan, which we acquired, of course, towards the end of last year.</p>
          <p>I must repeat what I said in our announcement of the 1st of February, this investment was not solicited by Rio Tinto nor did we have any prior knowledge of it. Shining Prospect is now an important shareholder, and we look forward to developing a good relationship with them as we aspire to have with all of our shareholders. You can imagine that all of these developments place an additional burden on the leadership of the company. And I'm delighted to say that I've seen no resultant dilution in their level of focus and commitment, if anything the reverse.</p>
          <p>And with that, Tom perhaps I could turn it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. For the past several months, I've talked about our need to do everything faster, smarter, and better, and I'm really pleased to see this showing up in our results today. I've also stressed my high level of confidence in the business and its prospects, and these excellent results bear out my conviction.</p>
          <p>First, I'd like to talk about safety. In 2007, we saw further improvement in our safety record, as measured by both All Injury Frequency Rates and Lost Time Injury Frequency Rates. Since 1998, both of our injury and lost time frequency rates have fallen by about 80%, as our relentless focus on safety has continued to deliver results.</p>
          <p>Safety is the core of our business, and a zero harm working environment remains our goal. Safety continues to be a key part of management remuneration, and in our opinion is one of the best indicators of overall management confidence and commitment of leadership capability and of operational excellence. This is particularly important as we integrate Alcan and combine what are two strong safety cultures and drive even further improvement in the safety of every one of our employees.</p>
          <p>We maintained, this year, the upward trajectory of our Group's earnings again in 2007 with another record year of underlying earnings, record year of EBITDA, and record year of cash flow. This reflects our ability to deliver strong operational performance and volume growth in a period of favorable market conditions based upon a foundation of large, long-life, low-cost resources in key sectors, the essence of our strategy. This strong second half performance reinforces that we can continue to drive our businesses faster, better, and smarter. I was particularly pleased to see the acceleration of the Group's earnings in the second half of the year. Second half earnings of 3.9 billion rose 11% on the first half and 9% against last year's second half and were a record in their own right. Certainly this is a positive indicator of performance as we have start off in 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning now to product groups, I'll start with copper, which was again our largest earner. Copper EBITDA rose strongly to a new record as we benefited from higher sales, refined copper, and continued strong copper, moly, and gold markets. As a matter of fact in 2007, positive buying co-product credits reduced our overall cash cost for copper to less than zero. A combination of rising gold volumes and prices contributed $235 million. Our gold production in 2007 was 1.2 million ounces. Now it's worth recalling, during this time of $900 plus gold, that we are a very substantial gold producer in our own right.</p>
          <p>Underlying earnings were largely unchanged from the previous year, reflecting the absence of U.S. tax credits and the Copper Group's record spending on new development projects. Project evaluation expenditures were 141 million in 2007 compared to 25 million in 2006. You'll recall that we have an interest in many of the world's largest undeveloped copper resources. And we will continue to invest to realize the benefits in what we believe is an unrivaled platform for copper and gold growth into the future.</p>
          <p>Just last week, Bret Clayton is in the audience today, our Copper Group CEO is visiting the Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia. And we've just announced that we're putting one of our top Copper executives, Keith Marshall, who is coming over from Palabora over to Mongolia. We're quite confident that this will be one of our top copper and gold mines in the Group in the years to come.</p>
          <p>In November, we highlighted the success of our exploration evaluation program at La Granja in Peru, where we've seen an increase in targeted copper mineralization for about 4 billion, which is what we reported in 2005, to up to 8 billion tons of copper mineralization. Here again we'll see the application of novel metallurgy driving cheaper and more efficient forms of beneficiation.</p>
          <p>At Bingham Canyon, near Salt Lake City in the U.S., the Kennecott deposit is over 100 years old and still going strong and continues to deliver upside. We believe the ore body itself and the surrounding area are proving prospective for additional mineralization, and we will operate for at least three decades to come. Also in December, we announced approval for the $300 million Eagle nickel project, which will provide an entry into the nickel market with great upside potential from highly prospective surrounding area and including six adjacent targets, which we're currently exploring.</p>
          <p>Our Copper Group has very low-cost, large-scale asset base with the highest EBITDA margins, the highest EBITDA growth, and the lowest cost increases on the top-five copper producers. We are well positioned to benefit from the next generation of high-quality assets in several which we have an interest. Copper remains one of the fundamentally strong pillars of the Rio Tinto value proposition, and they're a leading contributor to the earnings since 2004.</p>
          <p>Now, for our second pillar, iron ore. 2007 was another year of records for our iron ore group. Underlying earnings rose 18% and set a new annual record, as did production and sales. Safety performance was also the best year on record with a 35% improvement in the LTIFR despite new projects, despite a heated environment in the Pilbara, and despite ramped-up activity. And that was quite a testimony to the management team and everyone in the Rio Tinto iron ore organization.</p>
          <p>The market continued to be strong in 2007, but the outlook for 2008 is even better. The markets the tightest we've ever seen it. In 2007, China imported 383 million tons of iron ore, an increase of 57 million tons or 17% on the previous year. This increase only met about half of China's needs for incremental iron ore with the balance derived from increasingly high-cost domestic ores.</p>
          <p>The rising cost trend of this supply reinforces the competitive position of Rio Tinto's low-cost operations. In December, we announced the decision to sell more to the spot market in 2008 in order to capture the current differential between spot and contract prices of about $100 per ton. And the differential between 2007 contract prices and current spot prices has not escaped our notice during the upcoming and ongoing 2008 iron ore price negotiations.</p>
          <p>We are offering our customers a range of pricing and contract terms, which provide pricing transparency in combination with the continued security and supply of a well-established producer. Our Pilbara operations are firing on all cylinders. In December, we hit a run rate of 190 million tons per year, as we ramp up toward 220 million tons per year by 2009 on a 100% basis. Beyond that our next target in the Pilbara is 320 million tons per year by 2013.</p>
          <p>And despite continued cost pressures in the Pilbara, our EBITDA grew by 38% in the second half of 20007 compared to the first half of 2007. We continue to invest to expand. Overall capital spending in 2007 was 2.1 billion and we approved an additional 3.6 billion of expansion projects during the course of the year. These are high-quality, low-risk, high-return brownfield projects.</p>
          <p>The challenge of operating at full capacity while building these major expansions should not be underestimated. I want to credit Sam Walsh and his iron ore team for doing an excellent job at delivering these projects on time and on budget. Meanwhile the team is looking ahead to develop automation and develop technology for that mine of the future.</p>
          <p>This is particularly important in Western Australia where labor shortages and cost pressures are acute. The integration of a series of remote monitoring and control technologies is truly groundbreaking and reinforces our technological and innovation leadership, visiting just over the past few weeks what we've done and what we thought we would do over the past year has been just tremendous. I think what you'll be seeing over the next several years is more and more of the control and the automation being pulled out of expensive locations in the Pilbara to areas within Perth where it's easier to base people and easier to attract people.</p>
          <p>We've recently announced that one of our top iron ore executives will be running Simandou. We plan to move this along as fast as we can; it's a tremendous first-tier asset, a new high-grade iron ore province, a strategic importance within the Atlantic basin.</p>
          <p>Overall, iron ore continues to be an outstanding business for Rio Tinto. We have some of the premier assets in the sector, growth opportunities based upon excellent resource and mineralization positions in Australia and in Guinea. We have the infrastructure in the Pilbara to allow us to expand rapidly in the near term, proving project &#x2013; we have proven project execution capacity and a market very much eager for everything we can produce.</p>
          <p>Our intention is to treble production from greenfield and brownfield growth, and these are just the right conditions for iron ore to deliver continued and substantial increases in shareholder value in the years and in the decades ahead.</p>
          <p>Our third pillar, the aluminum product group has transformed in scale and potential during 2007. On a comparable basis, the Group achieved record aluminum production. If Rio Tinto had owned Alcan for the whole of 2007, we would have produced 4.2 million tons of aluminum. Earnings were strong, with Alcan making its first contribution for the end of the year. And of course, due to routine fair value inventory adjustments following the acquisition like any acquisition, the first month of 2008 will be more representative of the future earnings contribution.</p>
          <p>For 2008, our portfolio will be even better balanced and even more evenly balanced between the earnings of copper, iron ore, and aluminum. And the demand outlook for aluminum continues to be very positive; consumption is currently growing at the fastest rate of all the major metals due to the multiple usages and favorable properties of strength, durability, and lightweight. Global consumption grew by more than 10% in 2007, with Chinese growth at 38%. The forward price outlook for aluminum is well supported by rising marginal cost, particularly in China, where coal and electricity shortages and rising bauxite needs are actively reducing production at the moment.</p>
          <p>Marginal Chinese smelters with operating cost of about $2,500 per ton will struggle to generate a return at today's spot prices, even though their higher spot prices just a few months ago. The continued revaluation of the renminbi will make the cost curve even steeper, reinforcing sustainably higher margins, lower down the curve where our assets would be located.</p>
          <p>When we announced the Alcan transaction in July, we set out our belief that the aluminum pricing would benefit from rapid consumption growth and the rising cost at Chinese supply. In the last six months, the forward price curve has moved from backwardation to Contango, supporting every one of those macroeconomic assumptions we made back in July. The Alcan transaction has established Rio Tinto as a leader in the aluminum business. And the Group now has two primary natural advantages, the outstanding bauxite resource at Weipa in Australia where we have over 100 years of supply at current production levels, and the low-cost hydropower position available to us in the Saguenay and Quebec and in British Columbia. And of course, this is reinforced by the recent decision by the British Columbia Utilities Commission to accept our energy purchase agreement with B.C. Hydro, which opens up the opportunity to upgrade the Kitimat smelter as we had planned. And all this is supported by the depth and the capability of the organization and our leading technological position, particularly all ranges of the AP technology, and now the development of the AP50 next-generation smelting technology. Integration of the Alcan assets continues to go well, and I've spent some time with the team just last week. And we expect to soon start realizing these synergy benefits. Back in November, we increased our targeted annual synergies to 940 million after-tax from the end of 2009 and we are confident more is to come. And we're already beginning to see real benefits from procurement, operations, and SG&amp;As pre-mining.</p>
          <p>Of course as we plan for the sale of the Alcan downstream businesses and their 45,000 employees, this will further strengthen and simplify the business, allowing us to focus on the core of bauxite, alumina, and smelting. For target synergies, the target synergy that I'm asking to be held against with the Board of Rio Tinto and the senior executive team will be held against for their own remuneration performance purposes is, in fact, 1.1 billion per year for the end of 2009. We are also in the process of beginning to assess post-2009 synergy opportunities beyond the first two years and I believe these will also be quite meaningful.</p>
          <p>For energy, 2007 was the bellwether year for our uranium business, where we are the world's second largest producer and we're beginning to enjoy the benefit of higher uranium prices. Our Australian core businesses however were disappointing, as they were affected by broad industry infrastructure constraints in Eastern Australia. Starting with uranium, uranium earnings trebled as the prices realized at R&#xF6;ssing and ERA rose sharply. For example, the realized price at ERA was $31 per pound in the second half. And we expect this trend to continue as legacy contracts expire and as we are able to establish favorable pricing floors in new long-term contracts. In addition to rising realized prices, we plan to capture additional value for accelerated brownfield production at both R&#xF6;ssing and at Langer. Feasibility studies are underway with the aim of doubling our combined uranium production at 2015.</p>
          <p>In coal, we are now seeing record prices for both seaborne thermal and coking coal. To speak with Preston Chiaro who is in the audience today, we're seeing prices now well over $100 for our thermal coal and well over $200 for our coking coal at the moment. We are seeing strong prices as a consequence of strong demand for these products in Asia coupled with infrastructure problems in Asia and rest of the coal-producing basins and recent supply side disruptions due to a range of poor weather both in Australia and in South Africa, and of course in China. And to give some background, we announced $1 billion expansion and life extension of our Kestrel coking coal project, which will add 50% to existing coking coal production and extend the mine life from 2012 to 2031.</p>
          <p>Of course, as we've highlighted the biggest negative impact to energy earnings in 2007 has come from the continued externally managed infrastructure issues in the eastern seaboard of Australia both in Queensland and New South Wales. Last year, severe weather in June affected real operations causing substantial vessel queues. The existing Capacity Balancing System led to some improvement during the course of 2007, but a longer-term solution in the form of fixed and firm long-term contracts between the infrastructure operators and the coal producers remains to be required. And that remains in addition to additional infrastructure investment.</p>
          <p>We believe that mine, rail, and poor capacity must be brought into balance, and we welcome the appointment of a facilitator by the New South Wales Government to address these urgent and important issues. Not just for us as a coal producer, but the entire Australian economy.</p>
          <p>We do expect some alleviation to the current conditions will be achieved during the planned expansions at Denver, Bell Bay, and Queensland in 2008 and in New Castle, New South Wales in 2009 and 2010, but this will need &#x2013; also be matched by improvements in publicly-owned rail systems both in Queensland and in New South Wales. And, of course, further port expansions and development over the medium to long term.</p>
          <p>On a positive note for coal in Australia, the recent weather events in Eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland, have had little impact on our operations, and we appear to have weathered the storms much, much better than most of our competitors. We intend to put as many tons of coal into this current lead supply constraint market as we can enjoying these very strong coking coal and thermal prices.</p>
          <p>Our Diamonds and Minerals Group performed well in 2007. The Diavik diamond mine had an excellent year with record production and record earnings. In November, we approved additional funding of $563 million to extend the life of the Diavik operation beyond 2020 with underground mining. Diavik is one of the world's most profitable diamond mines with strong EBITDA margins of 74% in 2007.</p>
          <p>At Argyle, the underground development is progressing well, with over eight kilometers of tunneling completed during the year. By the end of 2007, we were 40% complete with the total tunneling development program, with a total of 14 kilometers completed. And I was especially pleased to say the construction team has certainly picked up the pace in the second half and we expect to improve upon the cost estimates we provided in mid-2007.</p>
          <p>At our Bunder diamonds project in India, a new project for us, our team is expanding as we move this project into a diamond development phase. This demonstrates our proven capacity of delivering diamond pipes in discovery and then taking them from discovery into feasibility. We did it with the Argyle in the 1980s, we did it with Diavik in the 1990s, we did it with Murowa five years ago, and we are doing it now in Bunder as we speak.</p>
          <p>For the mineral business, we saw volume weakness in North America offset by rising prices for borates and for talc. Titanium dioxide prices also firmed, as we began to see China making its mark as a consumer of high-grade pigment feedstock. Our 750,000-ton ilmenite project in Madagascar is on track for first production at the end of this year. And we're now setting a second phase expansion to 2 million tons of ilmenite production per year. Given the significant upfront cost to develop the port and the infrastructure at port to farm, progressive phases of expansion will be strongly value accretive during this phase. And there is no doubt given the high plus 60% TiO2 content in the Madagascar ilmenite, but this is one of the best undeveloped deposits in the world today.</p>
          <p>Finally, with our 2 million ton per year potash project in Argentina, we have the opportunity to enter the potash project &#x2013; potash market. With the price outlook, it looks increasingly favorable. The spot prices for potash close to $300 per ton and very few quality projects on a greenfield or brownfield basis in the world, PRC has a natural advantage in its proximity to the rapidly growing Brazilian agricultural market, especially as we see continued strong demand for soy products and increasingly biofuel products. We are also looking at larger production options in light of the size of this deposit and the strong potash demand.</p>
          <p>Now with that, let me introduce Guy and turn it over to Guy.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, and good morning everybody. Let me start with an analysis of how we achieved our record earnings using the normal waterfall format. Higher prices benefited earnings by $1.4 billion as we experienced sustained strong demand for virtually all our products. We've included a breakdown of the price variants in the appendix of the book you've got.</p>
          <p>Volume increases across the Group added a further $516 million to the bottom line. Again, we've included a breakdown of this in the chart book. The most significant rises came from higher refined copper and gold production and record iron ore production following the completion of some of our expansion projects. For these results, we've decided to split out the impact of mining inflation in a similar way to some of our peers. This is intended to show the rate of cost increases above normal CPI specifically related to mining activities and inputs. These cost increases lowered earnings by $140 million, and they relate mainly to labor and contractor rate increases in mining hotspots such as the Pilbara, as well as rising input costs for key mining supplies across the industry.</p>
          <p>During 2007, we invested further in the future of our business through exploration, evaluation, and technology. Much of the $309 million increase in costs was from our iron ore and copper evaluation projects, as we outlined in our Investor Seminar at the end of November. And as our projects such as the iron ore expansion come on stream, we incur higher non-cash costs through depreciation. This was the case in 2007 with a net $201 million impact. So overall, these are a good set of earnings showing that our investment in volume increase is delivering results at a time of strong prices.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take mining-specific inflation, freight, and other costs excluding &#x2013; other cash costs, excluding energy. We can see that their collective impact on our business was to increase our costs by 2.4% in real terms in the first half of 2007, and 1.6% in the second half. This is in line with our peers. Inflation in the mining sector is undoubtedly running at a faster rate than inflation in the general economies of the countries in which we operate. We've shown here some examples of the pressure which we are seeing in Australia, in the cost of people, goods, and services. We remain very focused on attacking costs across the board whether it be in corporate functions or through the line in production. IPT, Improving Performance Together program, is contributing to this effort and it delivered an after-tax cash benefit of $256 million in 2007.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to our cash flow, the Group's cash flow from operations increased 15% in 2007 to a record $12.6 billion, that's to say over $1 billion a month. Now, this strong cash flow enabled us to invest at record levels in 2007 with capital expenditure of $5 billion. This continued with the impressive expansion of our Pilbara Iron operations, the construction of the greenfield ilmenite mine in Madagascar, and the underground developments at Argyle and Diavik diamond mines.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, our estimate of future capital expenditure is in the region of $9 billion in each of 2008 and 2009, including former Alcan operations, which represent about $2 billion. Of course, this number does not represent committed capital expenditure. All investments are required to undergo our strict evaluation discipline before commitment.</p>
          <p>Now of this amount, $2 billion represents the capital required to sustain our businesses at their current level. The remainder relates to new projects whether they're brownfield or greenfield. If we segregate the Alcan component of this increased sustaining capital expenditure, it's approximately $800 million. Our strong cash flows also mean that we can comfortably support the higher level of debt that we took on for the Alcan acquisition. The $38 billion that we raised to finance the acquisition, and the $5 billion acquired as Alcan's own debt, have resulted in total debt at the end of the year of just over $45 million. This results in a ratio of debt to &#x2013; or net debt to debt plus equity, of 63%. We expect that our continued strong cash flows and the proceeds from potential divestments will enable us to reduce this debt. Our target is a single A credit rating, but no higher than that.</p>
          <p>Now, let me remind you that our debt was secured on terms that would now be unobtainable. The average premium is 35 basis points above LIBOR, the details of the terms are set out in this chart.</p>
          <p>When we assessed the earnings impact of the Alcan acquisition, we used a rate of 6%. But we're currently paying less than 4% under our acquisition facility. I should also stress that although $15 billion of this debt has a maturity of 364 days, we can elect to extend it out for a further 12 months on the same beneficial terms. As interest rates fall, we stand to enjoy significant benefits from substantially lower interest costs.</p>
          <p>At our November Investor Seminar, we increased our target for asset sales from $10 billion to at least $15 billion. This is from a pool of assets, which might potentially be worth in excess of $30 billion. The process is well underway for many of our assets and we're targeting around $10 billion in 2008. The group of assets under review is still evolving and we've recently added our Rio Tinto Minerals' borates assets to the list. It's important to recognize that our intention is to sell at the highest attainable price. We have formal processes in place for all these assets and I can tell you that there is no shortage of interested parties. Yesterday we announced the sale of the Greens Creek silver-lead-zinc mine in Alaska. This asset fetched $750 million. It's an impressive value for an operation, which may be unfamiliar to many investors, and it shows the value that's embedded in Rio Tinto's portfolio of assets.</p>
          <p>I'd like to stress that each of these assets is excellent in its own right with strong margins, competitive market positions, and options for growth. But, some of them may be not valued more highly in the hands of others.</p>
          <p>Now turning finally to our dividend, as you know we have a multi-decade record of progressive dividend increases. In fact, we've consistently increased our dividend since 1992, in spite of the difficult period in the 1990s when many companies in our sector cut their dividend. At our November seminar, we committed to rebase our ordinary dividend for 2007 by 30%, with further increases of at least 20% in each of 2008 and 2009. The total 2007 dividend declared today is a $1.36 per share, which runs up to an increase of 31% compared with the prior year. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 25% since 2005. It's a very clear indication of our confidence in the commodity outlook in general and in the future prospects of this company in particular.</p>
          <p>Now back to you Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Guy. By now, we are all quite familiar with the story of rapid economic development in China and the transforming effect it has had in all of our markets. This slide shows the trend in consumption growth in China and in the U.S. as a portion of world totals. China has replaced the U.S. as a dominant consumer in almost everything that we produce. And this position will only go stronger as the trend for industrialization and urbanization continues over the next several decades in China. And it's important to recognize that this Chinese growth is largely driven by domestic investment and domestic consumption, not necessarily by net exports. Of course, a notable exception to this is oil where the U.S. market remains the key driver and China represents only 9% of oil consumption.</p>
          <p>At this moment, of course, the global financial markets are understandably concerned with poor credit conditions and potential economic fallout in the form of a recession, especially in the U.S. While we cannot be complacent about the rising risks of the world economy, it's also very important to keep this in perspective and recall which economies are the motor for our commodity demand. And it's fair to say that aluminum, copper, and iron ore will be less affected than other sectors like oil. And certainly taking today's prices into account looking at copper prices in the 360 range, looking at record 60-month aluminum forward prices, looking at progressively increased consensus numbers for iron ore very much shows a strong market for each of these commodities despite increasing concerns for the U.S. economy. Modeling suggests that a recession in the U.S. would have limited impact in the rate of Chinese growth, given the consumption &#x2013; composition of Chinese GDP and the weighting toward domestic consumption and domestic investment.</p>
          <p>We are not saying that China is immune from the effects of a U.S. recession, if there were one, but those effects are buffered by strong domestically-driven economic forces within China itself. Consumption and investment together represents 80% of Chinese GDP with net trade only about 6%. And the relatively modest proportion represented by trade reinforces the decoupling hypothesis. Maybe the specific example relevant to Rio Tinto, we show at the pie chart of copper tube production in 2007. As you know, China consumes about a quarter of world's copper and accounts for almost all of the global growth in copper. Most of its consumption is for &#x2013; much of it is for copper tube, and copper tubing's main applications would be for plumbing, air conditioning, and refrigerators.</p>
          <p>In the past a lot of the air conditioning, a lot of refrigerators would have been tested in for exports into the U.S. markets, but more and more you're seeing those air conditioners and refrigerators actually being consumed in China itself. And as it is now in 2007, only 6% of the tube production was re-exported back to United States. If the U.S. entered a recession, we would expect flows of capital to faster-growing parts of the world economy, including China. We believe the net effect of a U.S. recession might well be a reduction of 1% or less of a percentage point in terms of overall Chinese GDP growth. And given the Chinese GDP growth is now in excess of 11%, a reduction of less than 1% still gives us a lot of running room in terms of the consumption and the demand for the things that we produce.</p>
          <p>Of course to some extent, this reduction would serve to dampen some of the inflationary forces we're seeing in the overheated Chinese economy, which is probably a better event for the long run. And of course, we cannot forget about India. Commodity demand in India in an economy, which is growing at over 8%, which is also fundamentally decoupled from changes and activity in the U.S. will be the next story to watch.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe the price outlook for metals and minerals is a positive based on rapid Chinese demand growth and continued supply constraints. However, it is also important to distinguish between the individual metals and individual products, as we believe the outlook for Rio Tinto's key distinguishing products is particularly favorable.</p>
          <p>The slide shows the average of analyst forecast for the FOB iron ore price to Asia for the next three years, and recently published forward prices for aluminum, copper, nickel, and oil for the same timeframe. I showed this slide a few weeks ago in the Pilbara where we're hosting a group of journalists in the Pilbara. And since this time market expectation for the outlook of iron ore, and of course copper, and of course aluminum have grown if anything even stronger. And in particular the iron ore market continues to look very tight and market expectation of a strong price increase in 2008 contract year continues to rise. Aluminum price remains in Contango and the future price is well supported by rising marginal costs of fourth quartile aluminum smelters in China, which would be driving the long-term equilibrium pricing levels.</p>
          <p>Copper supported more by supply and demand imbalances and the continued inability of producers to meet production targets much less grow their production. So, overall, we believe the forward markets, this is not our view, this is the forward markets' view, it shows that we relative to BHP have an ideal portfolio to benefit from what looks like a strong market and strong pricing environment. And looking forward, Rio Tinto will only strengthen relative to BHP and these half-year results certainly bear this out. In the last half year, we've seen a relative shift in underlying earnings in our favor of nearly $2 billion between ourselves and BHP.</p>
          <p>Our current position for each of the three main products is very strong. We have large scale, if not leading positions in each one of them, and competitive operational costs in the first or second quartile, and that's a lower second quartile. We have an excellent set of growth opportunities with the potential to double or even triple the production of our key commodities. And all of this is unpinned by a reserve resource, mineralization position will allow us to maintain continued and rapid growth rate well into the future. And of course, let's not forget, our important sector leading positions in uranium, coal, industrial minerals, and diamond.</p>
          <p>We have an excellent set of advanced stage, high-quality growth projects. Here are key projects just out to 2012, but don't forget the math of early stage and conceptual projects beyond this date La Granja, Simandou, Resolution, and Sulawesi nickel among others are not shown. We talked about them in November 26, if I were to try to put these in the chart, there would be so many bubbles, you won't be able read any of them.</p>
          <p>When we reviewed this pipeline of growth opportunities, I'm pleased to look at the proportion of these generated from our exploration activities both greenfield and near mine. We've highlighted here these projects, which have their origin in our exploration and evaluation activities. It is often our ability to think creatively about an existing asset or a known prospect or something, which someone else has walked away from and look to opportunities to unlock value and unlock opportunities for Rio Tinto. And PRC and La Granja are good recent examples, and the recently announced open-pittable coal resources in South Africa in an area that had been considered overexplored is another potential future example.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in the area of exploration and evaluation, on which our total pre-tax spend was $570 million in 2007. And in 2007 we were also particularly successful in selling second order exploration royalties and second order exploration assets, which were quite attractive to smaller and intermediate companies. And we actually covered our entire greenfield cost with the proceeds from those smaller royalty and smaller exploration asset divestitures.</p>
          <p>The outcome of a capacity to add high-quality resources plus a proven project execution capacity is clearly evaluating growth. And based upon our portfolio of projects, we estimate the compound annual growth rate of our volumes from 2008 to 2015 is over 8% per year. This is based upon volume growth rate of our individual products indexed and comparable monetary equivalents using consensus long-term prices.</p>
          <p>In our estimates, this is double the rate of BHP Billiton's growth over the same period and it is in commodities, which we believe look great as I mentioned on a forward-pricing perspective. And again, this reinforces what we said back in November that BHP Billiton needs Rio Tinto more and Rio Tinto needs BHP Billiton. And of course, as I've said, the recent earnings momentum in the second half just bears this out. This is growth in value, not growth in production, and that's the key driver for the company, growth in value. However, we do believe the volume growth from competitively positioned assets at a time with strong demand will lead to substantially enhanced returns for our shareholders. All of our investments must pass a rigorous appraisal process and rigorous discipline before they ever see approval.</p>
          <p>As I said, we have a unique position with a strong demand for everything we produce. We have the operations, we have the prospects, and we have the capabilities to deliver this growth. Rio Tinto is delivering value today, with record earnings of 7.4 billion and record cash flow of 12 billion in 2007. We are setting production records in many of our key products like iron ore and like refined copper.</p>
          <p>With the acquisition of Alcan, we now are the leader in the aluminum industry or have outstanding competitive position, great synergies, and market outlook, which just keeps getting better and better. We are investing in record levels, as Guy said, in evaluating growth of our business, the planned capital expenditures of 9 billion in each of 2008 and 2009. Our large-scale reserves, resources, and mineralization continue to generate options for our growth. We have a track record of delivering that growth on time and on budget.</p>
          <p>The long-term demand outlook for all of our products remains excellent, based upon profound structural and demographic shifts in the world still taking place and expected to continue to take place in the world economy, not just in the years, but in the decades in front of us.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto is well positioned to take advantage of each of these opportunities. We remain totally focused on value and our results to make the business work faster, meeting the world's growing demand, better at leading and shaping the industry, and smarter and creating value for our shareholders. Our results show that we are accelerating away from BHP Billiton, and we are investing to maintain this momentum. Our response to BHP Billiton offer has only been about value as Paul has said, and the value of leveraging our assets, our prospects and our organization in a very strong market environment.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Paul McTaggart from HSBC Equities. Just wanted to follow up on Alcan's contribution to the results.  I think it was 424 million to net earnings, but that included a tax benefit. So, if you could give me a sense of what the tax benefit was? And you didn't provide pro forma numbers for the full year. Are you ever give us a sense of what earnings would have been on a full-year basis? And secondly, following up on aluminium, however there's been South Africa has got lot of airtime around power issues. Can you give us an update on Coega, how you see that goes forward and whether there's going to be power to supply that project? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Paul, thank you. I perhaps might ask Guy to get to the detail of the tax point, Tom to comment on the broader question of how Alcan &#x2013; Rio Tinto Alcan now is performing and then also the South Africa question. Guy, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the tax benefit is significant at Alcan, it's about $330 million. Now you must remember that we didn't assume that there would be this tax benefit when we bought Alcan. It's going to be a benefit, which accrues to the business over the long term in cash terms, but we've made an accounting adjustment of that number I've just given. So, I think that's the position on the first question.</p>
          <p>On the question of pro forma 2007 numbers, we haven't given that. There are &#x2013; there is a third quarter report, which Alcan has produced, which is with the SEC. We are in the business just for nine weeks at the end of 2007, and I really think it's a bit premature to judge the future of Alcan on that basis, because there are a number of important accounting adjustments that affected the result. So I think we're investing for this for a very long period ahead and the first half of this year will give a much clearer indication of the quality of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Guy.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe first talk about Alcan, how I see it in this first nine weeks and so far, where we've been going with it. Certainly these are without doubt the premier aluminum assets in the sector, and certainly the performance we've been seeing so far this year has been bearing it out. These are quality production assets being driven by hydropower, which has not been effected to some of the issues we've seen in some of the parts of the world. We've continued to work very closely on a very effective Rio Tinto Alcan integration team, I've been very pleased with the mix and match Alcan people going over to ex-Rio Tinto businesses and vice versa, and the mix nature of the leadership team of Rio Tinto-Alcan made up of both people from Alcan and Rio Tinto. This is as good as an integration, as we or some of our consultants who've been involved with lots of integration, have ever seen before. And for that reason, I'm quite confident in doing better than the synergy targets, which we have talked about.</p>
          <p>And also identifying additional synergy targets that will be kicking in beyond 2009. As we look ahead, we're continuing with a series of growth projects, and I think that the market environment is as I've said, only reinforces what we have been saying back since July that it's got a great consumption story and the supply story will continue to be constrained by access to stranded power, which is getting more and more difficult to find anywhere in the world today, and increases in cost -- increased cost for variable production. I think that's what caused us to see this runup in the forward prices, and I think we've seen some of the shortages of electricity both in China and in South Africa, leading to some of the recent increases we've seen in spot pricing.</p>
          <p>Now getting on to the &#x2013; so, I think everything that we've said about the investment assumptions leading into Alcan have been bearing out if anything, for example the Chinese renminbi appreciation, have been moving even further than we would have hoped for back in July.</p>
          <p>Looking at South Africa and Southern Africa, it's important to look at the context of the fact that we like others have seen that Eskom wasn't necessarily keeping up with strong economic growth rates in South Africa with their own power generating capacity. And over a period of about 5 to 10 years, you've seen expected power surpluses rapidly narrowed down to what has now been, as a consequence of some seasonal events, power deficits, and that's created a situation of rolling brownouts across the country, some power interruptions, and primary metal and mining producers being asked to cut back by 10% electricity consumption for the undefined future.</p>
          <p>Now, this is clearly having effect on current producers of aluminum in South Africa and in Mozambique. And so that's going to have an effect on their production and their costs.  That will have some effect on increasing pricing and certainly benefiting the Rio Tinto Alcan businesses. But, we are not unmindful of the fact that if that generating capacity is not built up by the time we would expect to have Coega, we would be in that same position. So, as we've said, we'll continue to engage with Eskom and look at matching the project at Coega with the Eskom power generation. In South Africa, a few months ago, I said that we would want to see, not just conceptually and on paper, these power generation assets been talked about, but we want to see them actually being built on the ground and the transmission capabilities being built on the ground before we were to commit to construction at Coega on the ground.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thomas, Jeremy Gray from Credit Suisse. First question is, are you surprised by the strength of prices of your commodities so far this year given all the doom and gloom out there in the media about the world economy? And can you give us an exact sort of number of your iron ore production.  Obviously you're running at a run rate in Q4 of 190 million, and you go to 220 in '09, but obviously, every ton at these kind of prices if we get, what the market's saying, could make a meaningful impact, but could you give us a target for this year's production rate for iron ore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, why don't you take that iron ore question, and let's have Vivek just give a very short response on the continuing strength of prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think on iron ore again, as we've said, we are looking at a run rate of about 190 million tons going into the latter part of 2007, and certainly from my perspective I see now that's a new target for those production people to beat.  I literally get weekly rail reports from the rail team so they know I'm giving them close care and attention as we go forward.  But I do see us progressively ramping up from that 190 level through to the 220, which we said during the course of 2009. And I think you're absolutely correct that we are in a position that every single marginal ton delivers quite a bit of incremental profit, particularly as we've been selling more material on to this larger spot market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  What we've seen essentially is a whole range of factors affecting prices for all our of commodities, essentially we've seen very, very strong demand and supply constraints, and both Tom and Paul discussed those, and they differ across the range of commodities, but there are a range of underlying themes there, essentially difficulty in getting capacity build, and at the same time, the development of our projects that are currently on stream facing difficulties in terms of getting equipment. And on the demand side continued very strong growth.  And I think that that's what people have been surprised by, but not &#x2013; I don't think that I've been surprised by that particularly, because we've been saying continuously, going back through a range of papers that have been produced, that we're not terrifically concerned about a slowdown in the United States and its impact on China because as both Tom and Guy had mentioned, China &#x2013; Chinese consumption of metals and minerals is, for the most part, essentially decoupled from growth in the United States. And so are we surprised to see that a big slowdown or a potential slowdown in the United States isn't having a big effect on commodities?  Well no not really.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Vivek and I would again commend the read of Vivek's paper, which we're issuing today, which covers this all in a lot more detail.  Did you want to top that off with a comment, Tom?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Paul. Thank you, Vivek, but I find it very interesting, the parallels between market sentiment at the beginning of this year compared to the beginning of 2007.  Beginning of 2007, going into then the Chinese New Year period, people talked about copper had peaked in 2006, copper was at 250 on its way down, all of the metals complex was basically in -moving nowhere, but down. What actually happened in 2007 was a continued strong period of market environment. As we got into December, market started to get soft a bit going into the holiday season, people beginning to ask questions about the U.S. economy, saying well if 2007 was the peak.   What's happened now?  We're back up to over $3.50 for copper.  We're at record prices for iron ore, we're at record prices for gold, just about everything we're producing, record prices of the forward market for aluminum. In many ways we're seeing just a same type of repeat of the strong market conditions that we saw at the beginning of 2007.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. I just wondered if you could give us a couple of comments on bauxite as a commodity, particularly given that a large potential customer is now a shareholder of yours.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have very large bauxite resources, we have some of the best bauxite resources in the world. And from time to time we have sold some of our material for bauxite, they haven't necessarily met the spec of our refineries into Asian markets. So, it gives us a real-time sense of what this materials trading for, and it's also given us than a real-time sense of the marginal cost of Chinese aluminium. And I would say that it's not a bad business in itself, but again, bauxite, moving from bauxite to alumina you get, you move roughly from say 30 &#x2013; 30, $40 a ton to 300, $400 a ton. Moving from alumina to aluminum metal, you're going another 10x. So, each of these steps you got a 10x value add and that's why it's important to have a balance of all components of that. I'd say again that there is a continued interest by Chinese aluminum producers in getting access to the resources and that's been all the more compelling for our Alcan investment population.</p>

          <p>Well, I think we're, as you know we have announced a new contractual arrangement with the Koreans. I think we do see value in the benchmark pricing and the mechanisms associated with that.  We also recognize that there needs to be a mix of other pricing type options, so that you can ensure that there is always a see through between those various pricing mechanisms.</p>

          <p>It's Sam Catalano from Macquarie. Similarly with coal, Tom you mentioned the record spot prices for thermal and coking coal. How much of your product is actually being sold at those prices, obviously it's going to affect the negotiations upcoming for next year, but what portion you're actually realizing at those sort of levels?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for the question. The majority of our coal is indeed sold on long-term contracts. And what we're looking to do now with the weather events in Australia opening up some opportunities for port and rail allocation that we hadn't anticipated, we're trying to slip as much of our production into the spot market opportunities as we can. I don't have exact numbers for you right now, because as you know it's a very dynamic situation with rain falling sort of as we speak in Australia, but we have been able to get some spot cargos out for prices as Tom said well over $100 a ton for thermal and over $200 a ton for coking coal. As we get additional information on the market and what might open up in terms of the capacity, we'll release that information.</p>

          <p>Tobias Woerner from MF Global. The first question is about gearing, you obviously intend to reduce your gearing by 10 billion through disposals this year. What sort of gearing target do you have in the mind by the end of the year? On the back of that, the second question relating to disposals as well Greens Creek was sold for $750 million, just remind us of the mine life of that mine, and also the ongoing cash generation of that business? And, well, these are the two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, first question I trust you heard it. Gearing target by the end of the year, would you like to respond to that, and follow on with Greens Creek in response to the potential cash generation of that operation, but Tom, we want to allow you a nostalgic comment on that as well, I think having been its manager. Guy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tobias, thanks. Look we haven't got a gearing target for the end of the year. What we have is a rating target, which I've already mentioned. I think that we're confident that we can reach that in the medium term, that target, because we're selling this $10 billion worth of assets, and because also we're going to have very strong cash generation during this year. We've had over $1 billion a month this 2007. And as we've been saying, prices are not falling, in fact we think some of them are rising.  And so, you can see that 2008 is starting in a very encouraging fashion. So, taken together, we can see that the gearing is going to come down quite rapidly.</p>
          <p>Now on the subject of Greens Creek, first of all we're very pleased with the price that we've attained. This is a business which generated EBITDA of about 100 million in each of 2006 and 2007. It's a fine business, but I think it's much more suited to Hecla, our joint venture partner, and we're very pleased with the sale. I think it illustrates how quickly we've been able to bring about the first of these sales, there are processes underway for all the other assets that you know are on the list. But back to Greens Creek and its resources, that's one for Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. When Nerco was sold and acquired by Rio Tinto in '93, my first job coming into Rio Tinto was basically to go up to what had been a shutdown mine and basically told to fix it or kill it. And then, they only got 25 people there and over the next two years, we basically discovered new resource and brought it back into production. I have been very pleased with the team there basically delivering consistent profits ever since then and delivering consistent value. This is a small, but very high-grade ore body and a complex ore body where you are always needing to sort of roll out the next couple of years of resources, couple of years ahead of you. You don't unnecessarily drill the whole thing out at one point in time. I think that they've done a great job on Greens Creek, and I think it's something that we will continue to produce, but recognize, it's not something that really moves the needle from a Rio Tinto perspective, which is why it's more suited for a company like Aqua. And like Guy says I think there was, it was a good price achieved, very good price achieved. The EBITDA over the past two years benefited from very strong lead prices, zinc prices, and silver prices, and certainly I'm very happy with the outcome.</p>

          <p>Hi, It's Damien Hackett from Canaccord Adams. A question about the proposed merger, if I may, that the results are similar, is that possible to ask that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>An observation into BHP Billiton presentation similarly, recently was that in the written presentation is that the proposal quite had support of the shareholders of both companies. And when Marius delivered that presentation he added the word many shareholders had given that support. And I asked him if many was equal to majority, and I was given a fairly lengthy answer, but didn't really answer the question. I'm sure you've had many discussions with shareholders and I was just wondering if you would like to comment on that. Because one thing I have observed about this presentation is that you seemed to have spent very little time putting up as bigger as a defense as Marius was putting up a case two to support his proposal. And I'm wondering whether those discussions with shareholders reflect the confidence that you have in the position that you've taken in respect to the proposal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give a short response to that to which Guy and Tom are free to add clearly since the idea was first launched by BHP not by ours at the beginning of November last year, we have had more or less continuous interaction with our shareholder base right across the register. You would expect with a spectrum of interest you get a spectrum of views, but I think the net position is that we have received a great deal of encouragement from our major shareholders as to the position that we have taken, and lot of them have are actually added materially to their position over that period of time. I think what is happening in Rio Tinto and has been happening over the last twelve months with the change of executive leadership, the building momentum in the company, the acquisition of Alcan, the focus of operational delivery. I think our shareholders have greatly heartened by what they are seeing, and the Board is similarly heartened and extremely supportive of everything that the team are doing to drive value for shareholders. You want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Certainly from my own personal perspective, I have spent a lot of my own personal time meeting with key shareholders and all of our key markets, all our geographic areas. And based upon all of the dialogue, all of engagement I am as confident in the business and confident in everything I'm saying now as I was back in November.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, would you like to add anything you've seen a lot of our shareholders in recent times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have and I think you reflected that very well. I think that just that Marius rate that for me, this is all about value and what we presented today are some results, which I think demonstrates focus on value and the growth prospects that we've got, all of which will add to value. So, that's the reason for the confidence, which we are expressing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much for the question. Anybody else? Yes. Tobias again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, two follow-up. With regard to the Chinalco, Alcoa stake in the plc shares, do you see that, first have you spoken to them, and do you see that shareholding complicate matters to you in anyway shape or form?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me perhaps again start that. Chinalco is a company which we know very well, because we've been in the aluminum business a long time as well and there have been many discussions in the normal run of business with them. Their shareholding, I can assure you is something we did not solicit, and came as something with a surprise. We were, however, immediately hopped in by their public statements about the reasons for their investment in the company, an investment of a strategic nature in a great company with good assets, extremely well managed. And they were quick to say that they did not want to seek any Board representation or any intervention in the management of the company. They came to see us on the following day. Many of you will know they were in London and took a big media conference, and reiterated exactly those points to us that we take entire face value. We look forward to a constructive relationship with them as we would with any of our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That says it well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. <mark type="inaudible" />. Just a question more on sort of overall strategy, I can understand the reasons for the disposals of Alcan Packaging, Alcan Engineered Products. It's a silly question, could you sort of discuss how easier it will be to exercise the Engineered Products business out from Alcan, because as I understand there was a lot of overlap between what the smelters produce and what goes into the Engineered Products operations, for instance, that's been sold to Airbus. But, also in looking through what you're planning to sell, you owned a 100%, 80% pretty much substantial stakes in these businesses, yet what some of the other assets that you are keeping, and here perhaps I'm thinking about coal, you don't necessary own a 100%, and dividend leakage out of the business to minority shareholders. Should you really be thinking perhaps to selling the Australian coal business rather than the U.S. coal business so that you can retain a 100% cash flow control?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I suggest Tom that Guy who is coordinating this disposal program addresses the very specific issue about the packaging and engineered products assets and, the new light get on to the wider sort of portfolio issue in choice part of the question, if that's okay, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look you do raise a fair point <mark type="inaudible" /> in a sense that these are complex businesses with large numbers of people, large numbers of individual facilities both in packaging and in engineered products. In some cases there are overlapping facilities although the overlap is more as between packaging and engineered products then it is between engineered products and primary metal, the smelting business. So, in fact most of the metal that is sold as it were between primary metal and engineered products is not sold within the same complex, it is transported. In fact engineered product uses quiet a lot of scrap another bolt in metal. Now, having said that it is complex as you say, and the engineered products especially serve. So, the de-integration of engineered products is one of the reasons why we think that this sale is going to take a bit longer and be a bit more challenging than some of our other sales, but I'm still confident that we can sell both these downstream businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I add just one comment, which is not much to do with aluminum, but about the generality of embedded complex transforming businesses. I mean I'm reminded as the question was put, and I was listening to Guy, my experience in the petrochemical business, where I was at Shell I think you know for many years, and we had many complexes which were refining petrochemical complexes with downstream petrochemical operations sitting right in the middle and connected by multiple pipe work to the rest of what was going on, posing all sorts of issues about transfer, values and so on. And frankly we cut through that very easily, and enabled the sale of the number of those businesses in many of our sites. So, I think it's a challenging issue, but it's an issue, which other industries have solved pretty straightforwardly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean just one thing sort on that, of course, is that certainly when a lot of these broad operations were in by passionate. They didn't want to show to the customer, the eventual customer like Airbus what the cost of production were, and so they were able to hide it either in the engineered products business or in the aluminum smelting operations, that if you are splitting the business it would become more transparent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's a fair point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I just may --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on real quickly on the AP side, I mean again the plants; there are no physical overlaps in the plant to become almost like that pipeline, picking the point in the pipeline for the transfer. In terms of the broader portfolio question, when we announced the Alcan acquisition in July, we basically announced that we're setting on a path of business reviews, and we basically announced the first outcome of that in November. We said at the time that we're going to look at the competitive nature each of those sectors their size, they are fit with the Rio Tinto's strategy whether really move the dial from a Rio Tinto perspective, and if these are assets that may be more valuable, seemed to be more valuable in someone else hand than for ours for a variety of reasons.</p>
          <p>And I think I said also at the time that these are all good businesses, they are all very good businesses that they are not necessarily big from a Rio Tinto perspective, but they could be big from an intermediate size company perspective. This is very much a sweet spot, and I think the Hecla transaction with Greens Creek very much with -- this was a sweet spot for that particular sector.</p>
          <p>Now in coal specifically, I think there is a difference between any domestic coal market including U.S. and what I would say the seaborne thermal or the seaborne coking market. And in terms of the numbers of customers, the range of markets and our customers, the global dynamics, I think that was part of the bearing of it. And I would say what we looked at was again whether it's a partial interest or a whole procedure the net affect of the interest that we're having there, where can we see the leverage going forward. It' certainly from a Australian coal perspective, I see a lot of leverage going forward as this debottlenecking begins to run its course which it is doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I ask just, we maybe take couple more question, and then draw the line. Anybody got something that they would like to raise with us. Yes, there is another question here.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. It's Damien Hackett again from Canaccord, a very quick question this time. It relates to that 600,000 million ton iron ore number, that I think you words had demonstrated capability or something, you're going to be little bit more brave on that and pinpoint a point adding time there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we've said, I think we provided in November some guidance of the work we were doing to get to that point in time. And basically we laid out a pass-through 320 million tons to Pilbara with the further pathway to 400 million tons. That we're beginning to assess how that fits into the market, because we do it &#x2013; once you get passed 2015, what will be the rate of growth in China, and when will India begin to pickup. And we need to look at those market dynamics as much as the supply side, once you get passed that point. In addition we talked about Simandou to 70 million tons, I believe by 2014, and then we are looking at another phase of activity to get that to 170 million tons passed that point is, where we have invested and the key real important infrastructure to get to that first tranche of production. But, I'd say that during that period of the decade when we are going through the expansions to 400 million tons, we will be looking at sequencing in tranches of further expansion passed that point.</p>
