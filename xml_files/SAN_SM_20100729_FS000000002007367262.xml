      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning. We're going to begin the presentation of the results of the first semester 2010. I'll be reviewing the essential aspects of management this quarter and then of course, Jose Antonio Alvarez will review the group's results and will examine the business areas in more detail. I will finally sum up and give you our outlook for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And the first point is that the Santander has once again had an excellent quarter and also an excellent first half. This table summarizes the key aspects of the group's management, which I will discuss and review in the next slide. I have divided it into four major sections.</p>
          <p>First, the group's ability to continue to generate high recurring results in a difficult market environment. Second, the focus during the second quarter has been strengthening our balance sheet. We maintain limited credit and market risks. We have improved our liquidity position. And we maintain good capital ratios with tier one at over 10%, which according to the stress tests for European banks, even in the most adverse scenario, we suffer no impact and would continue paying dividends.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we continued to provide shareholder return and fourth we have continued strengthening our strategic position. Taking advantage of opportunities to boost our position in markets where we operate. Let's now look at each of these aspects in more detail.</p>
          <p>In the quarter attributable profit was 2.23 billion euros, which is slightly higher than in the last three quarters. We have closed the semester, therefore at &#x20AC;4.445 billion in profit which is 1.6% less than in the same period of 2009, but it's 0.5% more than in the second half of 2009. These profits are equivalent to earnings per share of &#x20AC;0.26 in the quarter and 0.51 in the semester. These profits are the results of managing different macroeconomic scenarios in the countries where we operate. We see a dual word divided into two large blocks.</p>
          <p>On the one hand we have those economies in which the private sector needs to say and the public sector needs to contain its deficit. That is economies which are de-leveraging the U.S the U.K Spain and most developed countries. And this is reflected in low or moderate GDP growth. On the other hand we have the emerging economies which do not require significant adjustments. And this block includes Latin American economies, with countries such as Mexico and in particularly, Brazil which is growing strongly after a quick recovery. Our strategy in this deal the world is to adapt our business model to the momentum of each country and each economy. And that strategy is reflected, as you will see in the next slide in the group's results and volumes.</p>
          <p>In results and starting in the right hand side, emerging markets have shown significant profit increases, Brazil's profits were 27% up on the first half of 2009 in local currency and fully impacted minority interests. Significant growth also in other Latin American countries, 10% up overall in the first semester in local currency and before minority interests. Units like Chile have shown accelerated growth in the second quarter, 17% up on Q1 2010. In the U.K. and the U.S. earnings have increased significantly at rates of 35% year on year and 10% if we compare the second quarter of 2010 with the first. These increases have been possible; because for the group these markets are undergoing restructuring that is their trends depend to a larger extent on our own internal drivers and our management than on the environment.</p>
          <p>As a result, only Continental Europe more affected by a harsh environment has shown a year on year decline in profits with respect to the second semester of 2009. To ensure it, profits in the three of our four larger markets are growing and this view of world is also seen lending trends. Year-on-year growth has been around zero or negative in all cases.</p>
          <p>In Europe because of de-levering, in Latin America because of the impact of the crisis in the second half of last year which brought about lower volumes and in Sovereign because in previous quarters we have gotten out of non-strategic segments. This picture, however, is changing in 2010 particularly in this Q2, which has been a lot more dynamic. And so on an annualized basis this quarter we have seen a slight recovery in Europe. In the U.K. and the U.S. greater increase because in Sovereign there are business lines which are beginning to show first signs of growth and in Latin America the improvement in fundamentals is reflected by strong in growth in lending in all countries. In Brazil, lending is growing at around 20% and in Mexico, Chile and the other countries that around 21%. This acceleration is activity particularly in Latin America is not yet seen in revenue growth which is affected by the four I mentioned in the second half of 2009, but which will be seen in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>As for bank savings, deposits plus funds, the trend is the opposite. That is much greater growth in de-leveraging economies. I should mention particularly Continental Europe which savings rose 33% year-on-year mainly in Spain. We have stepped up our campaigns to attract deposits in order to gain market share by taking advantage of the greater propensity of households and companies to save.</p>
          <p>In the U.K. we've also been very successful with products. In America total savings did not grow because our strategy there was quite different. There we were focused more on profitability with strong rises in demand deposits and mutual funds, but less growth or in fact some decrease in some cases of time deposits. In these later deposits, we have seen a reduction in institutional balances in Brazil, which are not very profitable given that the liquidity position in the unit is so good. We have loan to deposit ratio of 90%.</p>
          <p>The second item in that initial chart was the strength of our balance sheet and here I refer to four issues: liquidity, risk policy, solvency and stress tests. Starting with liquidity, in this quarter the most important aspect was the campaign to attract deposits carried out by several of the group's units which have enabled us in four months to attract &#x20AC;32 billion. The success of this campaign is seen in a rise of over two percentage points in market share in Spain or in other words, market share increase in relative terms, 20%.</p>
          <p>We have also attracted over 100,000 new high-end customers, whose future business potential is very strong. With this campaign we've accelerated the growth in customer funds although from the beginning of the year the group had already been very active taking advantage of opportunities in both retail and wholesale markets. Since December the group's total deposits rose by 88.3 billion in the first half and we've carried out medium and long term issues for over 17 billion to which we must add, an additional six billion in securitizations.</p>
          <p>This means that in this semester we have attracted a balance, which is greater than the total maturities of medium and long-term debt we have for the rest of this year and for the coming two years. This two-fold strategy has notably improved our financing structure and so the ratio of connecting deposits and medium, long-term financing to lending has increased up to 111% and our lending to deposits ratio rose from 150% at the end of 2008 to 122% today.</p>
          <p>As for credit risk, the policies we implemented have moderately &#x2013; have seen a moderate increase in NPL ratios and stable coverage in the last few quarters. As a result we continue to compare favorably with our peers. Net NPL entries reached a peak at the end of 2009 and beginning of 2009 and have been declining since.</p>
          <p>On risk premium the cost of risk has shown a change of trend in the last few quarters where the widespread improvement in all units as Jose Antonio Alvarez will explain, which should reduce the demand for provisions in the future. In this context, the group continues to provision. Our provisions have continued to rise in the second quarter and are already at almost &#x20AC;20 billion of which 6.679 billion are generic provisions for loan losses. Of these numbers &#x2013; that is of the 6.679 billion, 1.849 billion are generic provisions for Spain. And as you can see from this chart on the upper right hand side, quarterly provision consumptions is between 400 and &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>The third item I'll refer to when speaking about the strength of our balance sheet is solvency. We ended June with core capital at 8.6%, the same as in December 2009, basically due to two impacts &#x2013; positive one, through the generation of free capital, 21 basis points in the semester, but a negative impact in Q2 of &#x20AC;709 million, that's down 12 basis points from the mark-to-market valuation of our portfolio available for sale which in our case is charged directly against core capital.</p>
          <p>I remind you that we do not have investment portfolios held to maturity. These are all very solid risk ratios &#x2013; capital risk ratios, well adjusted to our risk profile, as the stress tests have shown. The results of these tests are well known, so I will not go into too much detail, but I will emphasize a few aspects. The adverse scenario includes more negative projections for Spain and for other countries with GDP dropping 2.6% cumulative, high unemployment rates at 21% and strong write downs in realistic prices down 28% in finished residential property down 50%, in essential property under construction and down 61%.</p>
          <p>And then in this scenario Banco Santander would continue to generate net operating income of &#x20AC;43.59 billion in 2010/2011 which together with the almost 21 billion in existing loan loss provisions and foreclosed asset provisions would give us 64.38 billion to face the potential crisis. Deducting the estimated impairment for these two years the group would have a surplus of 10.97 billion after tax. That is the group would continue to obtain profit, pay dividends with payout at around 50%. And again I say pay dividends, we build generic provisions and even so we'd still be creating over 2.2 billion in capital. As a result we'd be able to absorb an impact of the increase in risk-weighted assets and leave our Tier 1 ratio intact at 10%, that is, 53 billion above the 6% requirement.</p>
          <p>If we compare ourselves with the 25 major banks analyzed using like-for-like information from the CEBS, we could see that in the most adverse scenario, Santander would be the bank that would generate the largest results, defined as the difference between net operating income and provisions needed to cover impairments. And in relative terms, in terms of capital, it would be the most profitable of all the major banks analyzed.</p>
          <p>And this profit would enable us in this adverse scenario to pay out 4.4 billion in dividends, rebuild 1.8 billion in on-balance-sheet generic provisions and maintain our Tier 1 ratio intact at 10%. If we did not include our voluntary dividend payout and the impact of generic provisions, our Tier 1 would actually have grown up to 11.1%, that is, 107 basis points.</p>
          <p>Third point I referred to in that initial chart was shareholder return. Total shareholder return for the bank in the last 12 months is at 14%, above reference banking, in excess, and at the top of our list of peers. Strong profits and solvency together with our payout policy have enabled us to maintain high remuneration via dividends during the crisis. Our last four dividends represent a yield of around 6% at current exchange rates, and the average return over the last 3 years was 5.9%. In 2010 we will maintain our scrip dividend program or Santander Dividendo Elecci&#xF3;n which we started in 2009 which was accepted by over 80% of the shareholders for second interim dividend which can be paid in cash or shares. And depending on market conditions, we might also offer it for the third dividend in February 2011.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I will spend the next few minutes describing the fourth basic pillar of this semester, that is, management of our business portfolio. We are constantly adapting our business portfolio in order to keep investing where we see growth potential and adequate return on capital. As a result, given the crisis, we have managed to improve our strategic position in some of the economies with more potential in the world.</p>
          <p>In Europe, for example, we've reached an agreement to acquire the retail branches of the Swedish bank, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken or SEB in Germany. With these 173 branches we almost double the number of SCF branches in Germany. It's a good operation, because it fits well with our presence in that market and it's a growth opportunity which will enable us to begin developing a retail banking model and not just the consumer finance model in Germany, which I remind you is the second largest banking market in Europe.</p>
          <p>In Mexico we have acquired the 24.9% stake in our unit, which was in the hands of Banc of America. This was also a good opportunity as the bank is growing and it will have a positive impact on earnings per share from the first year.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. our Consumer unit is taking advantage of opportunities to acquire at significant discount near prime portfolios, which enable us to access in larger and better quality market. Lastly, we're still awaiting the outcome of our bid to acquire 300 branches of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which we expect to be resolved in a few weeks. And now Jose Antonio Alvarez, our CFO will review the group's results and the results by business area.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As we usually do, now that our CEO has explained the highlights of the quarter and of the first semester. I will first review the group's results and then briefly each business area. I remind you that on our Web site you have all the details of the presentations for our main units in Spain with a lot more detail than I have time to present here.</p>
          <p>On the screen you can see our income statement with two columns, as usual. In the first column we have the accounting data and that reflects the perimeter affects which are small and the exchange rate effects. And since exchange rate effects are somewhat significant, not very large, but somewhat significant, in order to make understanding these accounts and comparing them with previous quarters more easily we have included this second column without these impacts.</p>
          <p>The account shows basic revenues which have grown less than in previous quarters. This is due to an environment in which inter-annual comparisons, not so much quarterly comparisons in growth in lending are low. And where interest rates are record lows in developing markets, plus there's the financial effect of the campaign to attract customer funds, our CEO has mentioned. Which has been a great success in terms of volume growth, but which has had a financial cost, which you can see in the different units that were involved in this campaign.</p>
          <p>The second point we've had strong cost discipline Costs are flat for the group except for apparent 9.4% growth in our accounts, but if you subtract the exchange rate and the perimeter affects costs are basically flat. Provisions are finally showing a change of trend. We will see when we review the different business units that one of the most significant changes in this first semester is the growth in volumes in some units and the change in the trend of provisions and the impact is not yet fully felt because you will see that in the quarter RF has been substantially lower than in other quarters and minority interest in Brazil are also absorbing four points in the lower lines of our income statement, but forgetting about RF gains on financial transactions and focusing on retail revenues, the picture is the one you see on this slide. Lower growth and basic revenues, flat costs and significant drop in loan loss provisions which are beginning to decelerate strongly and as a result basic revenues minus costs minus provisions are growing at double digit rates and accelerating quarter-on-quarter, semester-on-semester.</p>
          <p>If we review our most commercial revenues, if we look at net interest income plus fee income evolution has been very consistent. Net interest income basically is over ATM are &#x2013; ATAs are still showing strong resilience. In some lines the environment has had a bit of an impact, but in most cases our strategy has been &#x2013; the one that has had biggest impact, lending has hardly grown for the group as a whole, while deposits have grown 18%.</p>
          <p>If we look at the different areas on the bottom of the slide you can see Continental Europe showing a decreasing trend in revenues, but the other areas are accelerating their growth and showing a very positive trend. And Continental Europe in spite of that deceleration is still quite stable.</p>
          <p>As for costs, there's not much to add. In Europe, the U.K. and Sovereigns Uruguay for slightly negative, Mexico and Brazil have increased below the inflation rate and Chile grows a little more because of the earthquake and also the new collective bargaining agreement, which has been signed, but without with perimeter and the exchange of affect costs have basically remained flat growing only 0.7%.</p>
          <p>The third point I mentioned earlier is the slowing down in provision growth. Excluding the perimeter and exchange rate impact, total costs fell 4%. So the details, specific provisions have remained quite stable at 2.8, 2.9 billion in the last quarters and generic consumption has been basically 400 million a quarter for the group.</p>
          <p>Going down to the different business areas, I'm going to go into the different geographies, starting first with Europe, then the U.K then Brazil and the rest of Latin America, and finally Sovereign.</p>
          <p>In Europe, starting with Continental Europe, we see that in Q1 our income statement reflects the difficult environment for our business. Gross income down 1% and in an environment of low growth and lending interest rates are at record lows and our campaigns to attract &#x2013; the process which we carried out at the end of the second semester and during the first have had an impact. Costs have declined by around 1 to 2%. Provisions have remained stable, consuming generic &#x2013; the rate I've mentioned. And the profit was 2.55 billion, that's 6% less than in the same period of 2009, but 10% up on the second half of last year. By units there's been a slight drop in the profits of our commercial networks, 2% increase in GBM Europe, global banking and markets.</p>
          <p>I wanted to emphasize this, because it's a very positive trend, since in the first half of 2009 results were exceptionally good in this unit. And an excellent performance of Santander consumer finance, as we will see later, as profits have increased by 30%. Looking at the different units, the Santander branch network &#x2013; the numbers show the effort that has been made to attract deposits. Seven rose by 32%. You can see the trend in rise in deposits, by 50 billion in four months. Growth also accompanied my significant gain in market share.</p>
          <p>Annualized growth 4%, internal drop of 4% in lending, but in the quarter I have to say that there's been more activity than in Q1. The results show pressure on revenues from lower activity, some impact on spreads from prioritizing deposit recruitment and fee income still affected by low volumes of business. Growth in costs still negative and as a result our income statement is as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>As for Banesto, I'm not going to go into too much detail. The underlying trends are basically the same. They've attracted deposits, eight billion through their deposit campaign, flat lending, although the trend looks better than in Q1 and results moderate fall in gross income, declining costs, flat provisions, so slight falling profit, but clearly better evolution than the sector.</p>
          <p>As well a little bit on credit quality in Spain, that's an important point, I want to point out that in the annex we've included all the details about the Property sector in detail which we've provided other quarters too, but it's not in the main part of the presentation.</p>
          <p>As for credit quality in the Spain, we've seen a deceleration in NPL ratio rises in Spain, ending in June at 3.71%, better than the sector's average. As usual coverage, well above 60%, additions or entries remain at a level clearly below the previous quarters. The risk premium is declining. And so it seems that, as I said, we will need less provisions in the future. As for the new letter from the Bank of Spain on provisions, and although this is only a preliminary estimate, the impact on the group would be 400 million in Spain, for the group as a whole.</p>
          <p>As for property risks in Spain, we have sold property for 200 million; coverage is 33%, with losses of 26% in the real estate sold. In foreclosed assets, our stock is at 1.8 billion, coverage is 28%. We're selling at a loss of the same level, 26%. We've given you this information quarter-on-quarter, as I've mentioned, what the Bank of Spain has called problematic assets are all listed in the annex &#x2013; in the appendix on the Property sector.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Portugal, the context in the Portuguese market is fairly similar to Spain's. We see pressure on margins, which basically comes from dropping spreads in deposits. Fee income and gains from financial transactions clearly improved, thanks to mutual funds and GBM activity. Cost discipline continues, provisions remain at reasonable levels. And there's been a very selective growth in lending, up 3%, and a strong focus on attracting customer funds, which have grown strongly over the last months.</p>
          <p>Finally, as for Continental Europe, Santander Consumer Finance has shown excellent performance in the last few quarters. There have basically been four drivers. Basically volumes are growing, differently in different countries, lending growing 5%, especially in the Nordic countries and the U.S with significant growth figures. Weaker growth in Germany because of the fall in the sale of new cars in Germany, although we've gained market share and grown in second-hand cars, sustained improvement in spreads, costs declining, especially if we exclude the perimeter affect in the U.S. In fact the European units costs down 4% and a lower demand for loan loss provisions due to improvements in credit quality. And all of that has meant that Q2 was the best of the last eight quarters and we believe that this trend is consistent and will continue in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>With regards to credit quality, most probably this business, because of its nature is the one that reflects changes in the market trends sooner than in other sectors. We see that NPL is contained, the coverage is going up, provisions are below 60% and the risk premium is falling also which means that the trends that we saw in the income statement will continue in the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>If we talk about the United Kingdom now, this point is that it has been a very good quarter. Growth of profits are very much based on retail banking which increases by 10% its profit, over the first quarter of 2010, because of this better credit quality.</p>
          <p>I would say that in the income statement we see sustainable income, more than 6% in local currency with flat costs. The cost to income is 39% better than our peers. We are market leaders in this regard in cost to income, better trends in provision and attributable profit was 11% higher. If we look at the different activities in the U.K. unit we see that our stock of mortgages is growing 6% and lending to companies are also growing at a very good rate, 11%. Spreads still have a trend to go up, not as much as we saw a few quarters ago, but we do see a sustainable trend. And this is reflected very clearly in the results.</p>
          <p>We're earning market share in mortgages, as well as in deposits and in lending to companies where activity in the U.K. is weak. It's falling. So we are gaining market share.</p>
          <p>With regards to credit quality, I already said that the mortgage portfolio is one of very high quality. The stock, as well as new mortgages, quality standards are very high. With these securities portfolio we're still managing it. When we acquired it, it was 11.5 billion and we said that by the end of 2011 we would have no portfolio. We have brought that down and we're on the way of complying with what we said, reducing this portfolio. The NPL rate is basically stable. We don't see any situation to be worried about. And the risk premium has fallen significantly in the quarter. Therefore in the U.K. we continue with the sustainable trend.</p>
          <p>Brazil, in the case of Brazil we had attributable profit of 1.294 billion, 10% more in the first half at constant exchange rates, after deducting the higher minority interest from the last October's IPO. Before that, the unit is growing 27%; the profit is growing 27%. And this is based on revenues in lending, it's almost 3% more than a year ago, fees are growing better at 7%, and the trading gains remain flat as compared to last year. Costs are under control; we're growing our costs 2.5% as compared to 4.8% inflation rate, and provisions, which have declined for three straight quarters. All of this produced sustained growth in net profits, as you can see in the chart.</p>
          <p>In terms of activity, there were some doubts in the market on the growth potential, the lending growth potential. Well lending is growing at annualized rates of 20%, so we're more or less doing as we expected. There's a year-on-year growth, was still weak though, 3%. Selective growth in savings adjusted to the current process of rises in Brazil's interest rate. So lending is growing, but if we compare to last year's figure, then our stock only grew by 3%.</p>
          <p>In savings we have been much more selective. Margins are very low in Brazil and we're being very selective. In time deposits, it's a matter of liquidity because a significant part of the term is with money market rates.</p>
          <p>With regards to results to key drivers, the year-on-year rise in the net interest margin as a percentage of assets and the sustained decline of provisions. With regards to credit quality, we have good news. Credit quality is improving; we have coverage for NPLs of about 100%. The absorptions of provisions over net interest income is also improving. We think that this will continue to fall in future quarters. New entries into NPLs remain stable. Therefore we could say that in Brazil after a few quarters where we didn't see any growth on the side of lending, we have started to see a better quarter. So the figures will be much more positive in terms of fees and net operating income in the future.</p>
          <p>Latin America, without taking into account, Brazil, the rest of the region the profit was $1.145 billion. Mexico is growing at 15% in local currency. Chile is growing at 4%, improving commercial revenues trend and lower provisions. There is a certain impact as I mentioned earlier, from the earthquake provisions, as well as in expenses. Argentina is growing at 36%. We are taking advantage of the strength of the franchise. Uruguay we're &#x2013; we have increased our profit by 17%, sorry 27% and Puerto Rico where our profit has increased 5%.</p>
          <p>I'm going to say a few words now on Mexico and Chile. In the case of Mexico, we see that in the second quarter lending has grown 21% in annualized terms. It doesn't compare very well with last years figures, because of the credit card business, which fell by 25%. There you see the performance. We've followed the 35%. There's also good dynamics in savings and the interest margin still shows good trends. Costs remain flat. Provisions declined. So after the problem we had with the fall in volume of credit cards we have now left that behind and are improving. In risks, all indicators are in the right direction, the NPL ratio declining and the coverages going up. The decline in new NPL entries and then improved debt risk premium. So we're also very positive in the trends.</p>
          <p>In the case of Chile, I would say it's very similar than in Mexico. The business performance was similar. Better growth in lending, 8% year-on-year. Depending on the segment, that varies, there are different percentages. Interest rates were low, but now they're going up. And in resources, we also have more growth, particularly in time deposits.</p>
          <p>And in results, the solid management of balances and spreads is reflected in net interest income, and the improvement in credit quality resulted in reduced need for provisions, pushing up growth in net operating income after provisions in the profits.</p>
          <p>With regards to risks, well we have stability in the NPL rate, the coverage is stable while the risk premium is going down, new entries into NPLs are also going down. There is a trend, very homogeneous trend in all countries with activities improving in the quarter and less provisions are required, which reflects the situation of these economies where the GDP is growing throughout the region.</p>
          <p>With regards to Sovereign, I would say that the performance has been very good. This is due to the restructuring carried out in this unit. There's a certain pickup in lending, very small, only 2%. Taking into account that part of the portfolio has been discontinued; we see that there is growth in the core segments for the first time ever since we acquired the franchise in February of last year.</p>
          <p>The deposits, time deposits are growing well, 6%. In retail deposits, we still continue with our policy of bringing that down. In 2009 it had expensive CDS so that we have not &#x2013; we haven't been that aggressive in our pricing, and because of that other deposits have fallen. The business margin is going up, there is new improvement in costs and provisions.</p>
          <p>All in all the profits are $132 million, 40% more than the previous quarter. Therefore, good revenue, the volume is growing a bit, costs are under control. And in terms of risks, there has been a change in the trend, a clear change. Now coverage is going up, the NPL rate is going down and the risk premium is falling in a sustainable fashion. Therefore I would say that the trend is solid, end points &#x2013; to in the right direction for the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>In Corporate Activities, there is a variation of minus 595 million, which basically comes from three effects. The most relevant is exchange rate effect. In the income statement there was a positive impact of the exchange rate here for the first &#x2013; for this quarter we have losses for exchange rate, because of the coverages. There is a trading gain less than in 2009, because of the selling of some portfolios and some additional contingencies. Therefore in amount of &#x20AC;70 million, these are the three impacts that of the exchange rate, less trading gains and 70 million in provisions for future contingencies, the capital gains from the sale of Cielo. The credit card operation in Brazil which is 233 million were not recorded in this quarter.</p>
          <p>With regards to secondary segments, I'll go over these very quickly. In retail banking there has been a change in the trend, sustainability of results and the change in the trend and the weight of Latin American units in Sovereign, which show very good trends, as reflected in this increase of 7%.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking, with minus 22%. I would like to say that the quarter is a normal one. The second quarter of 2010 was exceptionally good. This is a normal one, &#x20AC;649 million in results. Now the revenue from customers increase at 16%, sorry 6%. There's a fall in trading gains, trading gains fall. I think in wholesale banking we are consolidation positions in markets, consolidating the gains in market shares that we obtain in 2009. In asset management and insurance, the second quarter was much better than the previous three quarters for both items. Volumes and revenues continued to recover, beyond the profits obtained in the second quarter of &#x20AC;120 million, I'd like to emphasize total revenues amounted to one billion.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to hand over to the CEO, so that he can draw the conclusion of the presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have looked at the group's strategy and evolution and the business areas are summarized in the slide. I will finish with six ideas and a reflection, which sums up my view of the first half.</p>
          <p>Number one, we have a structural strategy, which has not changed with the crisis, but we have adapted to the demands of a dual world and provided different responses to different environments. Point number two, this adjustment combined with our geographical and product diversification has maintained our capacity to generate profits intact, &#x20AC;4.445 billion in the first half.</p>
          <p>Point number three, the distribution as a base of Santander's banking model has shown all its value in this period. Only if you have a strong network can you have a campaign to attract deposits. Two additions, very few banks in the world have muscle to increase by 20% its share of its natural market in four months and having 14,000 branches is a life insurance in the face of global liquidity tensions such as those experienced in recent years.</p>
          <p>Number four; the solid balance sheet and prudence in risks have always been a hallmark of Santander and a priority. We passed the stress tests with top marks. Five, we continue to review our portfolio of businesses in order to invest where we see opportunities until when we no longer see them. This provides our strategic position quarter after quarter, laying the foundation for the income statement three years from now.</p>
          <p>Six, lastly, as a result of these policies, we have kept up our dividends policy despite the crisis. For years we have been one of the banks with the best shareholder remuneration.</p>
          <p>Now, a final reflection which shows what makes Santander different, because many of our peers can also fulfill some of these points, profits, strength, dividend, diversification, but few or none can attain all of them at once like Santander and looking ahead, first, we will continue to watch very closely the trends of each market and adapt to the new liquidity and capital regulations from our already very good situation. We will have four drivers, which are not very different from those of previous quarters.</p>
          <p>First, consolidate the increase in lending registered in the first half and which is still not reflected in the revenues of many units. Particularly in Latin America lower revenues, because of the fall in volumes in the second half of 2009 and the change of trend in the quarter should reflect in greater revenues in coming quarters. It will also be important to extract value from the linkage of new customers captured by deposit campaigns.</p>
          <p>Second we will have to manage the pressure on revenues in Spain and on GBM business, Global Banking and Markets, given the increased cost of liquidity and of lending which must be passed on to loans. Third we will strengthen control of costs. Lastly, management of risks and recoveries should reduce pressure on provisions. All of this makes me confident in the group's future performance within the difficult environment.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As usual we're going to begin the Q&amp;A session, starting with the questions that we have received over the Web. And we will try as usual to answer all of the questions that we have received. And then if there is time for it we will take questions over the phone. Otherwise, we will be answering your questions after the meeting. So we're going to organize the questions by subject. First of all strategy and regulation and there's the first question from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Although it seems that Santander is the only bank that is presenting an offer in the RBS deal, there is no announcement yet. Can we expect something and when will that be? And linked to that what is our approach regarding a possible growth of Santander in the U.K</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are in the last phases of the negotiation to acquire the branch offices of the Royal Bank of Scotland. We still have things that we are negotiating, but my personal opinion is that these are points that I don't think will be a problem. I do think that we will find an agreement and most probably in August, we will have the final result. With regards to the listing of our U.K. unit, we are looking into that, but we have not yet made any decision for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca, which is related to the listing of the U.K. With all the M&amp;A transactions that we read about in the press, I have two questions. How do you see the possible discount for the Santander holding? What is your policy in the listing of subsidiaries and how do you see the stability of the capital position of the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the Santander model is a model where the configuration of our group is done through subsidiaries, and this comes from its origins and we don't grow through branches. So based on the reflections of the regulators, we see that this is a model that they prefer. And so regulators prefer this subsidiary model than over the branch model. And I think this favors the entries into the minority shareholdings and the subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>We think this is positive. We think it's positive, first of all, in terms of management, for our management teams of the local units, and it's also very positive for the local franchise itself, for the consolidation of that franchise. And these are amongst other reasons, the reasons why we like to have minority interests. Of course this also favors our capital position because our capital is distributed among the different subsidiaries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question from David Vaamonde from M&amp;T (sic) [Fidentiis] on a possible update of the M&amp;T deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you know that we cannot answer questions on deals that have not yet been announced. And there's a question on the Bank of Spain's provisions, regulations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the impact since Banesto already mentioned an amount. How that would affect their income statement. If you're going to offset the 400 million with generic provision or what is our policies when it comes to accounting for that impact and do you have any further details on that impact of 400 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the only thing I can do is confirm this and then I will hand over to Jose Antonio Alvarez, but I can confirm to you that the impact after taxes is &#x20AC;400 million. Obviously in the income statement there are 400 million of more cost, well obviously the daily running of the business will try to obtain other revenues or cost reductions, so that we can maintain our goal in terms of profit. We will try to offset that. The year is full of this type of thing, but it's also full of opportunities. And I think that where we do better than we expected. So this is just another item that we have to take into account when obtaining our results and fulfilling our budget. I don't know whether you'd like to say anything else, Jose Antonio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this does not change our view for the remaining of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a question from Neil Smith on the stress tests. What are the hypotheses for the growth of lending and net interest income in 2010 and 2011 and the adverse scenario?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 2% growth in risk-weighted assets per year and the net interest income will respond to the different cases we announced in the conference call and that we can share with you later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look at the financial area, there are two questions on the deposit campaign, from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous and Antonio Ramirez from Keefe, ask about the impact of this deposit campaign and how we have invested the liquidity that we have raised in Spain with these deposits and linked to that was the cost of funding and the cost of lending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we already gave the figures of this campaign, 32 billion in Spain, and I even broke it down into the different units. The impact depends on the unit. It's replacing wholesale funding, therefore we are replacing market funding. It's a mix between short and long term. It's not all inter-banking. It's wholesale funding with an average term of two to three years. Therefore the impact between what we pay, the cost might be 3.5% or 3.75% as compared to wholesale funding in a year whose cost you know about.</p>
          <p>And that impact in the quarter, well, we have the different units in the Santander network and Banesto and other units like Direct Banking in Banif and the other units as well and we will see what that impact is in the future, but there haven't been any specifics, separate advancements too much deposits, if that is what the question was suggesting. We have not changed our Alco policy. We didn't do this too much, the yield on deposits, if that was what the question was about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question linked to this last point on Alco from Antonio Ramirez. Can we update the composition of the Alco portfolios volume and duration in Spain and then the different geographical areas? And what is the contribution to the net interest income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well here we don't usually see significant changes. In Spain we have portfolios available for sale of about 23 billion or 24 billion or 25 billion, out of which 21 billion are in the banks and three billion more or less in the insurance company. In Portugal there is a portfolio of three billion or four billion. In Mexico $6 billion, in Europe we're talking about euros, in Brazil 12 billion, and in the U.S. $2 billion.</p>
          <p>The spread of &#x2013; well short duration, 100 or 150 basis points in Europe, and Mexico is probably 250 basis points, and in Brazil, it's changing because interest rates are going up, but the portfolio has a yield of 12.30 or 12.40 in Brazil as compared to the current rate. I don't know what the global figure is but I know it by units. But there you have all the different elements to see what the contribution of these portfolios are to the net interest income. They don't change very much, these portfolios, they remain relatively stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's a question from Jaime Becerril from Redburn about the use of balances in central banks. Can we explain how much &#x2013; have we used the lines from the Central European Bank, the whole thing about cash and central banks? And then Antonio Ramirez is asking too about 4X coverage or hedging levels, book value for major geographies. And what have been the losses obtained through these hedges in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that I mentioned it was &#x20AC;200 million &#x2013; the loss incurred with those hedges in the quarter. As for cash in central banks, I can tell you that since the crisis began and I'm referring to 2007, we have seen a consistent increase in the balance of central bank deposits and the bank, basically because we've done some retail activity there and also &#x2013; or some marketing there and also because of our rating. There's very few banks in the world really, which have an AA rating with all three agencies. And so that's why the central banks consider us to deposit their balances. As for the ECB position, it has not changed in the last 8, 9 months. There's not been any increase really or any variation there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca about Basel III. Basically asking that one of the major beneficiaries have been the investment banks and might this require that we increase the kind of risk and extend our business focus towards this sort of banking business or do we expect to see any penalty for non-investment banking activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now our investment banking or wholesale banking, as we prefer to call it &#x2013; business, has not changed nor will it change its focus. Our wholesale banking is focused on providing service for our major customers in products, transactions, basically credit products and transactions which are basically what we always do in our Commercial Banking business and that's not going to change.</p>
          <p>That's as far as our basic strategy and as far as the specific question about the impact of the new Basel III regulations, I'll just take advantage of this opportunity to say that, although in general these new regulations are stricter and require stricter solvency ratios, liquidity ratios and so on, nevertheless, there's a long adaptation period, and second, it's not quite detailed yet, most of those measures. There are some criteria or principles that have been defined, but the details are still to be worked out, so we'll have to wait until that happens. However, again, on whether this might benefit particular banking business over another, there would be no reason for us to change our strategic focus or our DNA, which is what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's a question from Matteo Ramenghi from UBS about the stress test, the adverse scenario. Could we say something about impairment in the net operating income and the assumptions about emerging markets? Is the impairment sufficient given the business performance? And about our exposure to Sovereign risks, we can give you the details through investor relations, Sovereign exposure outside Europe, unless you want to talk about our exposure to Sovereign risks outside Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as I said, all the Alco portfolios I mentioned are Sovereign debt. Mexico, the five billion is Sovereign risk. In Brazil, so local currency, Sovereign risk in Chile it's a smaller amount, but the majority is also Sovereign risk. So that's the Sovereign exposure we have.</p>
          <p>As for the assumptions for emerging markets, I can't remember off the top of my head but I think that in Brazil the growth that was planned for 2010 was 0.4 and the next was 1% and it was kind of the same for Mexico. And given where the central baseline scenario is, it has to be somewhat similar to market consensus, the distance is huge. In Brazil, 0.4, when the economy is actually growing at 9%, it seems pretty adverse scenario given where the economy really is. Well of course it's all relative &#x2013; always.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question from Antonio Ramirez about core capital and tier 1 capital and valuation adjustments and exchange rates, but I think we've answered that. I think it was in Slide #14 where we talked about the impacts on capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Raoul Leonard from RBS is asking about the evolution of our cost income ratio. He says that it's risen from 42 to 47 in the quarter. Does this include a perimeter affect or is there some kind of short-term impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our cost income ratio is 42% in the semester, not 47 and actually costs have risen more or less by 300 million and about 400 is the income, but the income has gone less because of less of an ROF contribution in this quarter and that's why the cost income ratio has gone down very slightly, but the underlying operating business is growing, as has cost income ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question from Jaime Becerril about evolution of risk-weighted assets in Brazil and the U.S why they're growing so much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's an exchange rate affect. I don't need to go into further detail, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Britta Schmidt from Autonomous is asking about our funding strategy for the remainder of the year and how stable do we think will the deposits we've attracted be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as for the deposits we've attracted, they are of course very diverse. We've given you total customer numbers and you can estimate the mean volume per customer, diverse enough to consider that &#x2013; the funds are large enough to think that stability will be high. Of course it's never 100%, but in any case it's up to our branch network to achieve that stability, but mean volume makes us feel quite optimistic about this.</p>
          <p>As for our funding strategy, in general, if you analyze trends the last quarter &#x2013; well actually for the last five or six quarters now, we've seen a clear underlying trend where in the markets that our CEO called mature or de-leveraging, growth has been significantly higher for deposits and for lending. And therefore the needs for wholesale funding in these markets are tending to decrease. And we think that in this economic scenario this will continue to be the case.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, volumes are beginning to grow significantly on the lending side. Last year it didn't but now they're growing significantly again. As for our funding strategy, we are still on budget, our funding budget follows our retail budget and our refinancing volumes tend to be lower, in some cases significantly lower, than our maturities, but we adapt to the markets from there. Currently, markets, after the volatility we saw with Sovereign debt, markets become relatively expensive.</p>
          <p>We are trying to issue today, and we will issue to prudent liquidity management so that we can be in a position where we can have a surplus of a certain size. We're always usually at 10 billion or 15 billion but from the market as a policy on our short-term programs are really small. Both for Europe and for the U.S so our strategy is still not to focus very much on the short term, and to match the development of the business with minimal long-term financing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's question from Raoul Leonard from RBS. He's saying that growth in deposits is excellent in the first semester. Do we expect it to continue in the future?  And we have a loan-to-deposit target ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Rohith Chandra from Barclays is asking about net interest income, which in Spain has dropped significantly but for the group not so much. And can we discuss more about that at the group level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the first part of the question I can answer. Okay. The campaign to attract customer funds has now ended, so we're on a business-as-usual strategy now, but my impression is that in that context we will continue to gain market share. Of course not as quickly as we have done when the campaign was underway, but we will continue to grow market share simply because of tensions in the market and the weakness of some of our competitors. We are stronger than most of the rest of the sector in Spain and that's been clearly demonstrated recently. So I think we'll continue to gain market share.</p>
          <p>Plus we have a very positive acceleration in our network, because of the campaigns and with the business volumes and customer volumes that have come in. It's 120,000 new customers and so of course now we can start cross selling. And for all of these reasons I think we'll continue to grow our market share in the coming months, even though we're not implementing any campaigns right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There were some questions about whether we have a loan to deposit target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't, but we do think that given market conditions &#x2013; I think two years ago it was 150 and now it's going to be 220 something. And we think we finished the year between 115 and 120, but it will depend on the circumstances in the different units. Basically the units that we make a difference here are those in developed markets.</p>
          <p>And then there was something about net interest income. There are pressures on margins in Spain and Portugal, reflecting the numbers we've shown. I wouldn't say that's not at the group level, because at the group level we have very different trends. We have some with low stable rates in mature markets, but also rising rates in Chile and Brazil, in &#x2013; not yet in Mexico. We have different volume trends too. So I think it's going to be as I explained &#x2013; when I talked about the units, there are some units where net interest income will grow at a good rate in the coming quarters, basically Latin America.</p>
          <p>And we feel that as &#x2013; if interest rates continue to stay low, although of course it's true, but right now that mortgages in Spain have ended at 1.2 or 1.25 has now been the rate at which all our mortgage portfolio has been re-priced, but maybe in the next months we might have slight raises. But I guess it will depend on what happens wit the rates, but with low rates there is a pressure on deposits and in lending of course we could see some improvement through mortgage re-pricing, but also because the spreads for certain market segments are improving, spreads for the SME business and for the Consumer Finance business are improving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There's several questions about Basel III. Sergio Gamez at Merrill Lynch is asking, what do we think might be the potential impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I think we've talked about this already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs is asking, what is going to be our leverage ratio under the new Basel III proposal? What would be the treatment given to minority interest, the impact on Santander? Does this change our focus on subsidiaries? Marco Troiano from S&amp;P is asking about the rationale hurting Brazil and buying minority stakes in Mexico. Is this due to Basel III indications? So it's all about Basel III really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you've I think answered already maybe about minority interests.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daragh Quinn from Nomura is asking about capital ratios. Are we comfortable given potential acquisitions and are we generating enough capital organically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Capital ratio is 8.6, core capital. Again of course core capital is not the same as Tier 1, as has been amply demonstrated by the crisis, but 8.6 for our kind of business profile is more than comfortable for Tier 1 capital ratio, and we are generating capital. Although as we said, Mexico will be consuming the acquisition of our &#x2013; of the Bank of America stake will consume 30 basis points, the German operation nine basis points, that's true, but we will be generating significant capital organically, and we start out with a very comfortable position. Again you only have to look at the stress tests.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've answered that too already. Well for Alco I mentioned what portfolios were and the mean spreads. I think I answered that. As for wholesale funding, I think we've already elaborated on that, our monitoring of that and we just want to make sure that wholesale financing have a mean maturity of 3.5 years, 4 years, which is generally our target internally.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going down, even though NPL ratios are not rising much and you are provisioning more, but the trend is very similar if you look at the different quarters. NPL ratios rising more or less the same per quarter around 15, 18, 12 basis points, although of course coverage is down four percentage points, but we're also provisioning around 25 million. So we're more or less at the levels of impairment of this quality that we mentioned, reasonably stable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And someone is asking, what do we expect for NPLs in the group, in Spain. Francesco Riquel is asking about sub-standard risk in Spain and coverage, so trends and outlook for NPLs, in Spain and in the group in both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Our outlook on NPL, of course it's hard to predict, but we think in the group we're seeing NPLs reach a peak. We don't think that from now on NPL ratios in the group, as a whole will continue to grow, maybe for one more month, but we think we are reaching close to that peak.</p>
          <p>I'm not so sure about Spain. In the case of Spain, I said &#x2013; I think it was when I reported the results last year in February, I said that, I expected NPL ratios to reach a peak in Spain around Q2 or Q3 2010. We're at the end of &#x2013; we're in Q3 now and I don't have that impression now. I think that NPL peaks in Spain will not be reached probably until the end of 2010 and so into 2011. That's my outlook.</p>
          <p>As for numbers, I could get it completely wrong. The numbers for the group will remain at the current level and will start going down at some point. In Spain, possibly we are now at 370 isn't it? 371, approximately and I said some months ago that I thought we wouldn't reach four, but I think we will reach four. And we might even go slightly above four, just a couple decimal points, only very slightly when we reach that peak, but again I think we will reach in Q1 or Q2 2011. That's my best take on NPL ratios for the group and for Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Looking at business areas, in Spain, there's some questions about net interest income, which have been answered already. There's a couple of questions from David Vaamonde from Fidentiis and Marc Sanara from Bernstein, about market shares. About where we're gaining market share in Spain with our customer fund campaign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Will this campaign continue? We've already said that it's done, it's over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is the underlying trend in our market share on lending and in customer funds where are we gaining market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think we're gaining market share, 65% from savings banks and 35% from other banks. So we're having deposits come in. Because this is not really measurable accurately, but that's more-or-less what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a question about how long are we going to continue with the campaign, does not apply because it ended a few weeks ago. And now we are business as usual which again since we're seeing strong acceleration from that previous campaign. It will be bringing in lower growth of course, but gains in market share will continue, but in Spain we have gained 220 basis points in market share in Spain, as I said in the presentation. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marco Troiano from S&amp;P, he is asking whether in Spain we are seeing weaker competitors, especially on the mortgage side withdrawing or being less active. I don't know if you want to elaborate there. And also a question about evolution of spreads in new production, that's Alejandro [Ruyra] from Kepler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not actually seeing any competitors withdraw from the mortgage market. A mortgage market, although with lower volumes is still a market where every actor is present and producing new operations. And the answer clearly is yes, as we are seeing and we are promoting ourselves as a major part of the system and because of the rise in wholesale funding costs we are promoting improvement of spreads in all market segments. Perhaps in the market, in the mortgage market it's less visible, because it's the hardest to get spreads to improve and the most competitive. But in the other market segments we do see very clearly improving spreads, constant improvement of spreads month on month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Going on to &#x2013; there's a question, before we move to Brazil, about Portugal. Irma Garrido from Ahorro Financial Funds is asking are we being price aggressive to attract customer funds in Portugal as we have done in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in Portugal we are not being particularly aggressive with respect to general conditions in the market. And Portugal traditionally has been strong competition for customer funds. It has been a very aggressive market, because structurally it's always been rather tight with liquidity. So every bank has been very active trying to attract customer funds. So that's my interpretation. I don't now if that's what you were asking really.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Brazil, there's a question from David Vaamonde from Fidentiis says that net interest income has not changed very much in the markets and do we expect financial income to improve or Arturo de Frias is asking how our lending volumes moving, are we seeing impact the competition from publicly owned banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I said that the Brazilian financial margin was not moving very much, but I also mentioned two facts in Brazil. Net interest income, a very large part of that comes from lending and into annual lending growth in Brazil has only been 3%. Although it's true that in the quarter we've seen strong growth, but the impact in the quarter itself if you work out the average is still small. I did explain in the presentation that we expect to see a growth in lending to consolidate and therefore, for its impact.</p>
          <p>Of course in Brazil, there's major differences in net interest income from individuals, where net interest income is maybe 20% to wholesale where it's only 2%, but assuming that we might expect growth rates around more or less the kind of level I mentioned that should be reflected in the coming quarters. And we hope that will mean an improvement in net interest income. So the best proxy I think for that will be the growth of our lending portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Brazil there is another question just to finish talking about Brazil, asking for an update on restructuring in Brazil and synergies. How's the process going? It's Sergio Gamez from Merrill Lynch asking this and Daragh Quinn from Numoro is asking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've already talked about this, volumes in Brazil compared to our peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will we be growing more or less than them and what is our outlook? Do we predict volume to keep growing at 20%? I think you talked about that sufficiently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as far as growth I think we've talked about that already and we do still have the same outlook for growth that we've seen this quarter. And as for restructuring in Brazil, we expect to see the branch switch over I think at the end of this year &#x2013; in November this year and in technology integration &#x2013; systems integration by about February next year.</p>
          <p>And financially for the synergies to be obtained, I don't have the number, but I think we're above our target and &#x2013; about the plan that we presented when we presented the ABN AMRO offer. Yes, it was 4.5 billion reais if you remember that target and we're at 1.4 &#x2013; 1.5 in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question about Sovereign from David Vaamonde from Fidentiis, asking about guidance since net profit is up $350 million &#x2013; sorry the $350 million guidance &#x2013; it wasn't 350, it was 250 for 2010, given how the year is going are you changing that guidance? Does that fall short? What do we expect to see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Sovereign is exactly on target and in fact you can see it quarter on quarter. If you follow the quarter, the evolution it's exactly on target. As Antonio explained earlier we expect to earn 250 million and we're exactly on target and accelerating. It is possible we may exceed that, but we are not going to change our target or our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well that I think concludes all the questions we've received. There are no questions over the phones. So that ends here. Thank you. I'll see you next quarter.</p>
