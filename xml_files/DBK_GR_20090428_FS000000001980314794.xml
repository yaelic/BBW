          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am the operator for this conference. Welcome to the First Quarter 2009 Analyst Conference Call. Please note that for the duration of the presentation all participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Wolfram Schmitt. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Maria, thank you. Welcome to Deutsche Bank's first quarter call. With me is Stefan Krause, the CFO of Deutsche Bank. Before we proceed, let me say a word of apologies for the postponement of the call. By now all of you know why this was the case. We wanted to react appropriately to the strong demand for information, not only from the capital market but also from the media. And therefore we had a press conference this morning which was invited for on a short-term basis. So thank you for your patience on that one.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, this gave you more time than usual to study our disclosure products, the interim report, the earnings release, the financial data supplement and in particular, the set of slides which Stefan will use in a minute. I have to point you and tend to the cautionary statement, the disclaimers which are on all our products with respect to forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that having said, I would like to ask Stefan to take us through the numbers before we come later to the discussion. Stefan, it's your call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Wolfram. And I would like to add to the apologies. I am sorry, but on a short-term notice we decided to invite the press this morning to cover some of the information needs, of said audience, at this point in time. Let me start with page three on the first quarter highlights, and as you know we have had a very good result in the first quarter, that even at the second half we'll show that it was much better than this number.</p>
          <p>So income before income taxes was at 1.8 billion, net income of 1.2 billion. We had a provision of credit losses of slightly above 500 million. We have a diluted EPS therefore of &#x20AC;1.92 and based on our target definition a pre-tax return of 25%. We are happy, as Joe also said, in the press conference today that we could further evolve our Tier-1 ratio, which now is at 10.2% and which is above the target that we set at 10%. Our total US GAAP pro forma assets were again down to now slightly below &#x20AC;1 trillion.</p>
          <p>With that, we achieved our target early, the leverage target of 25 that we had set out to be our mid-term target. Right now we achieved the target of 25 and as Joe verified that this will be the level at which we plan to stay in the near future. And what continues to be very important for us, as important as the capital discussion, it's our liquidity and funding position, which remains extremely strong.</p>
          <p>Of our diversified unsecured funding position of 495 billion, 85% are from deposits and capital markets and only 15% short term wholesale funding that is completely covered by liquidity cash and liquidity results on the balance sheet. Our funding status you will report to you how has gone from, we have raised seven billion in capital markets out of a plan of about 16 billion. And in retail deposits we have raised 13 billion out of a plan of 17 billion already in the first quarter which shows you how strong our funding position is.</p>
          <p>If I turn to page four we show, disclose the results as a whole. I will go into the revenue decomposition a little bit later because we have some good messages there in terms of the underlying performance. I will cover all the topics separately. I did want to go here again into our targeted definition.</p>
          <p>Our pre-tax return on equity is 21.9% and on our target definition it's 25.3%. The difference, as you know, on our target definition, we normally take out the gains that we had on the sale of industrial holdings, which is, are not part of the target definition. In this case we had a impairment on an industrial holding position that was substantial and that was eliminated from the profits, leading to the fact that the target equity return is higher than the normal pre-tax target.</p>
          <p>Our net revenue, as shown here, is &#x20AC;7.2 billion. We did absorb a billion in additional markdowns which are related mainly to the 841 million to monoline additional reserves that we took and impairment on a property that you may be familiar with, which is our Las Vegas casino that is left over out of our funding, financing business.</p>
          <p>As you see, we were therefore very well able to recover, and a further analysis of the net revenues, which would show that we recovered very well, came back almost to record levels, historic record levels.</p>
          <p>I also would like to add that our net revenues showed more than even regional distribution again, with the U.S regaining their earnings power, which is also good in terms of our risk position. And again, while our CIB revenues were up versus the previous year comparison, our PCAM revenues were slightly down.</p>
          <p>If I move on to the next chart, the provision for credit losses, that I'm sure we see further questions as we move on, we have disclosed to you separated IAS 39 related reclass provisions we did, and then you see the number of 526 million of reserves we did in the quarter. This number contains a release of a provision of about 60 million in PCAM. It was an historic provision we did not require anymore. Then obviously you have the reclass related effect that is a nonrecurring effect, but we also see some higher than expected losses especially in the German and the Spanish retail portfolios.</p>
          <p>As we move on to the noninterest expenses, a couple of words to our general cost situation, our net noninterest expenses were up 2% versus Q1 '08, which compares, we had a slight increase in the comp expenses which you made up in the light of our significant increase in performance. It does reflect lower accruals for performance related compensation.</p>
          <p>So despite the fact that we did have a better performance than Q1 '08, as more or less it's only a slight increase in comp that we have accrued a little bit less for performance related compensation. This we do according to the industry trends we see on compensation and our own expectations right now for how the year will go.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for our higher litigation expenses and currency impacts, cost actually decreased. And I also want to mention that as our cost reduction efforts continue, some of these cost reduction numbers should show their first impact in later quarters, did not show them as materially in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Our head count is slightly down by 179 on a group basis to 80,277 heads. We do have quite a different structure. While in the CIB we had a significant reduction in infrastructure, we are up as we continue our offshoring movements to reduce our cost base.</p>
          <p>If we move on to page eight, on the income before taxes, this shows the development over a nine quarter period. We did this in these charts to give you a better feel for how our profit in Q1 compares to our longer term run rate. And I think we had a favorable result. But I will go later in how much additional markdowns and reserves we have taken to get to this profit.</p>
          <p>On page nine, we show our net income. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.9%, which was at the upper range of our mid-term guidance. For the full year right now it's difficult to give you a guidance because the number will be predominantly driven by how profitability will develop in the United States. We expect again, and that's our, on a longer basis onwards the range of 30 to 35% in our ETR, but again we expect some volatility due to geographic rate mix.</p>
          <p>On the capital ratios and risk-weighted assets, a few words: first of all, we were able as I already told you to maintain our Tier 1 ratio at 10.2. Also good that our core Tier 1 ratio also moved slightly up to 7.1, our risk-weighted assets, I will show later mainly moved to one item, which we show on the next page.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side chart, you see the Postbank transaction added to the risk-weighted assets, while our ongoing reduction efforts continue and we were able to reduce our risk-weighted assets according with the balance sheet reduction, and process improvements and measurement improvements as well as more protection, collateral protection on risk-weighted assets as well. This was good despite because we had an increase in risk-weighted assets based on the exchange rate situation in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Tier 1 capital is shown on the left hand side of this chart. You see the main items that drove the increase in our Tier 1 capital for the quarter was not only the positive net income, but then the compensating effect of the shares issued to Deutsche Post and the deduction for the Postbank transaction, which were both results of the restructured Postbank transaction. And here again that's what we like to point out, the reason of the restructuring was mainly for Deutsche Bank to protect our Tier 1 development, which in this strategy we were able to achieve.</p>
          <p>On the total assets, as in the initial slide, it's continuous, as you can see. You can see the development of our derivatives and other net-in positions comprise more than half of our balance sheet according to IFRS right now, but we see, we saw in the quarter a reduction of the IFRS balance sheet from 2.2 trillion to 2.1 trillion, as well as a decrease from the US GAAP pro forma balance sheet calculation we do to allow you better comparisons to our U.S. peers, that moved down from slightly above one trillion to below one trillion in assets, total assets.</p>
          <p>Very good, we achieved our 25% leverage ratio already at the end of Q1 despite some unfavorable exchange rate effects in this number as well. And I would like to again put out the word of caution as we will try to remain at this position of 25%. Exchange rate volatility will continue to impact this number significantly. So we'll have to see how that develops over the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>On the funding situation, here an asset and liability comparison of our balance sheet, because we continue to believe that not only capital but also our funding position, liquidity position is key to continue to survive the crisis and to continue to show strength within the crisis. Here you see our unfunded IFRS as well as our funded IFRS balance sheet items, and a very good match between our loans and our non-bank deposits funding position.</p>
          <p>On page 14, I take out the unsecured funding by source. Here you see that since the beginning of the crisis we have been able to halve the short-term funding positions from 30% of the unsecured funding by source to 15. And these 15% are fully covered by cash and liquidity reserves on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Let me now move into the segment results because we have some key &#x2013; quite interesting developments, and on chart 16, for your benefit with we have done a quick review of the different businesses. I will go into each one of this business in the following charts, but you see that definitely it was our CB&amp;S &#x2013; CIB, the Global Markets business especially that drove the strong profitability of Deutsche Bank in Q1, whilst other businesses had either slightly lower profit before taxes or like in the case of Asset and Wealth Management a loss.</p>
          <p>The Sales and Trading revenues that we show on page 17; you see how strong the quarter was. If you take out and consider the markdowns that we absorbed within our revenues in the first quarter of '09, you see that we are back to the record levels of Q1, 2007, which definitely is a very encouraging development.</p>
          <p>As we move on, in the next chart, I told you that it's quite interesting to give you some feel for the strength of our underlying earnings power. We have on the right hand side chart, also added further to the one billion in markdowns that we had on the reported revenues, also some &#x2013; the losses from exited or repositioned business, like of what some of our competitors had disclosed to you, which were &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Some of it are old propositions that we are de-risking, some of them also global Equity Derivatives that are in de-risking. If you take out these additional reserves we took to protect us from losses there and if you look at the significant additional monoline reserve we did, the true underlying revenues were &#x20AC;6.1 billion. That shows you the strength of the quarter in this area.</p>
          <p>So where's it coming from? Let me try to show an illustrative mode on the right hand &#x2013; on the left hand side of the chart. As we have told you the strategy in Global Markets is to go away from the structure to complex products, which used to be the strength of Deutsche Bank, moving now into the flow businesses that are, due to the strength in pricing, very profitable. And that strategy basically as we saw it in Q1 2009 is yielding extremely good results as you see it on the strong revenue development.</p>
          <p>At the same time, you see that in the Sales and Trading in the flow businesses, as we show chart 19, come out of mainly three areas: foreign exchange, money markets and rates business. For which we in very short period of time have achieved significant revenue increases.</p>
          <p>Whilst on the revenue line items you we see the success in the Global Markets arena. At the same time, we continued to successfully de-risk the platform. We continued to successfully manage legacy exposures and the head count whilst continues the success, we have taken out costs of the business. So at the end of Q1, it's the story of very rapid reaction to the Q4 situation and the correction of it, coming back very quickly to success.</p>
          <p>On the Sales and Trading debt in other products, we show where it's coming from. We had really record client flows across all products and again we continue to see a favorable margin development and favorable trading conditions in many of the different businesses, so definitely recovered from the loss situation in Q4.</p>
          <p>On the Sales and Trading equity, you see that we certainly have significantly recovered from the losses suffered in Q4. In a competitive comparison we certainly don't have here yet the strength that some of our competitors have shown. That is something definitely to do with the fact that traditionally we had &#x2013; we were a house that was strong in terms of our derivatives in this area and was strong in terms of our prop trading activities. And as we've told you this area is now suffering a little bit from the de-risking strategy, which we continue to believe is the correct one.</p>
          <p>But we have now agreements in place on how especially moving into the prime brokerage arena and others, we will be seeing much stronger revenues as we move on. But in an initial step obviously the de-risking and the repositioning of businesses has had an effect on our Sales and Trading equity business.</p>
          <p>Also, as you saw the rallies going on in the equity businesses benefited more the strong US businesses. We have gained market share in the US, but we continue not to be the biggest player. We are a strong European player and the rally in European equities was much slower so we did not have the benefit in this area as well.</p>
          <p>So, next we move on to the Origination and Advisory business. In corporate financing, the underlying revenue was up 17%. So a positive development and here you see, if we were to take out the significant markups and write-backs that we had in Q4, we saw a good development, especially as we are market share gainers. On the chart, we highlight, as Joe also told in the press conference, that we have achieved improvements in our positions as well on a global basis as well as in Europe, which also shows how this business is recovering as we move on to our next quarter.</p>
          <p>In the next chart on Global Transaction Banking, the conditions obviously were somewhat challenging in terms of the environment. This is a business that's certainly closely linked to the direction of asset and FX values and interest rates, which have affected the revenue performance.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest into the infrastructure of these businesses to provide a better service to our clients. Under those circumstances we did have somewhat a satisfactory quarter and we see continued flight to quality here in this business, which is also promising for the future of this business area and we continue to see a particularly strong performance from the Trade Finance business.</p>
          <p>On the next chart, we show you a little bit how strongly we have been impacted by the lack of client activity in our PCAM businesses in PBC and Asset and Wealth Management. In Brokerage we were down 136 million versus the previous year's first quarter. In Portfolio and Fund Management we were down 186 million. So you see how significantly the slowdown in customer activity has impacted our PCAM results.</p>
          <p>Then we go into the different business areas. Asset and Wealth Management, here we had -- we recorded a loss. Some of it one time items, but some of it is also underlying performance due to the lack of customer activity that I described before.</p>
          <p>If I go into the Private &amp; Business Client business, also here depressed customer activity and somewhat more higher loan loss provisions are driving the slowdown in profitability in this business. We have deteriorating credit conditions in Spain, a little bit also in Germany, but again as we are not in the consumer credit-cut finance type business, the lower end business, we continue to -- not to be too concerned about the profit development in this area as these critical retail business activities we don't have. And therefore we might not be as impacted as some of our competition is in this arena.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to a couple of key current issues we wanted to cover for your benefit, and the first one is &#x2013; I did want with the chart on page 29 to go a little bit into our cost cutting efforts. They continue. They go on. This chart basically describes to you what we are doing in the different business areas. So these efforts continue. Some of the activities that have been launched of course don't show their effects in Q1 yet, as we were either planning or getting prepared for those issues.</p>
          <p>So there you have to expect a later impact, significant impact starting in Q2. And then moving into Q3 and Q4 of the year you should certainly see the effects of our further head count reductions and other cost cutting processes ongoing. We're also involved in a significant process to simplify our platform to take some of our legacy costs out of the platform. That's also an ongoing exercise, as well as we continue our off-shoring effort in order to reduce our cost.</p>
          <p>One of the questions you may ask is what the impact of the Postbank transaction was on our results. We show here at the closing date how the Postbank transaction impacted as a whole our results. We had assets, asset increase based on the acquired shares and the mandatory exchangeable of 4.9 billion. We have liabilities that are at the carrying value of the put/call structure of around 900 million. Here also the risk-weighted effect of the 11.4 billion that I disclosed in the development of the risk-weighted assets before. Tier-1 capital deduction of 1.1 billion, versus the capital issuance in kind to the Post of about one billion, which then meant a Tier-1 ratio impact of 42 basis points, as of the closing statement.</p>
          <p>Let me now go onto the monoline topic, which is certainly the other topic that has been greatly discussed. In the first slide, slide number 31, we take the assets plus, which are the residential mortgage-backed securities, subprime and Alt-A risks. Exposure decreased slightly at an overall level throughout Q1. However, within, there are two separate and partly offsetting effects.</p>
          <p>The first saw a reduction in non-investment grade exposure, reflecting the accommodation in the settlement of a particular monoline counterparty exposure. That did result in a decrease. And secondly an increase in AA rated exposure, largely driven by the ongoing deterioration in the market value of our Alt-A provisions in Q1.</p>
          <p>The protected assets are almost entirely Alt-A and obviously despite the ongoing market decline, the quality of the majority of the portfolio remains high with good subordination levels. As you can also see the great majority of our remaining monoline exposure here is to AA rated counterparties.</p>
          <p>If we move on to the next slide on page 32, it summarizes our current exposures to monoline counterparties in respect to the other asset classes. The change in the rated composition of the monoline exposure reflects the internal downgrades of three monolines we had to do in Q1. The overall increase in exposure from 5.2 billion to six billion through Q1, reflects mainly some of further deterioration in market value of TRUPS-CLO and CMBS positions during the quarter.</p>
          <p>These positions for protected cover a broad range of generally in then we really have to have very high quality asset classes with strong levels of subordination relative to current and expected default rates on the underlying assets.</p>
          <p>We have, by the way, made additional provisions of about 600 million in the quarter where we had concerns about counterparties' ability to fully or partially perform on their obligations, based on in-depth reviews of the current financial position, any likely degradation of wealth assets and the possibility of any permutation of transaction.</p>
          <p>So in summary, overall in Q1 further declines in the value of wealth assets increased our monoline exposure overall by some 1.6 billion. This together with FX movements and the internal downgrade, that I just referred, drove additional CDO results of approximately 841 million.</p>
          <p>Total exposure in CDOs were reduced by 850 million and 750 million as a consequence as the settlement with one monoline counterparty, but we continue to review the situation very closely and are acutely aware of the risk implication. We have really to say we continue to believe that our approach for reserving monoline exposures is appropriate, given the relative quality of our assets and counterparties.</p>
          <p>On page 33, we go into the level three assets. As you see, we had about a reduction of 10% from 88 billion at year-end, to about 80 billion. And I again refer you to the composition of it, being largely positive market values of derivatives.</p>
          <p>As we move on to our credit position in the context of peers, with the last two remaining charts I just wanted to make you aware and give you a little bit of a view on what we expect and how we expect some of our topics to develop. But again, in our loan book why we're not so concerned about additional loan loss provisions that we certainly have to, or will have to take based on the development of Q1.</p>
          <p>They will not be substantial. If you look at the size of our book and especially at the composition of our book, that's highlighted on the chart on the left hand side, you see that on the critical loan areas we're not very exposed as compared to many of our US and other peers. And therefore our provision for credit losses, that may seem low in the context of this comparison, actually are adequate.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, again to the favorite topic of many of you, the Tier 1 ratio. We again have to say if you take government funding out of it and do the comparison, our Tier 1 ratio looks pretty good in that context. And again we continue to believe that it is and was the right strategy to stay out of government funding as long as we could.</p>
          <p>We will continue to focus on Tier 1, and it is the guiding principle now within the management of the bank and our target of 10% remains.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much and I'm looking forward to your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Huw van Steenis, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two quick ones. Firstly on page 18, you mention there's 1.1 billion of losses from repositioned businesses. I was wondering if you'd be able to share some color on splitting up between credit and equity, in particular so we can get a better sense of what the underlying equity numbers were before write-downs of derivatives.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I couldn't see it in the release, but could you share what write-downs you have from RREEF, and also what net exposure Deutsche still has from its balance sheet to RREEF?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, maybe just a more philosophical question, some of your competitors took the opportunity of the strength of Q1 to take a much bigger hit to legacy assets, in particular they sold some of the leverage finance, whereas I notice that you really didn't. So I was just wondering why you chose not to externalize more of the legacy assets in such a strong quarter. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the last question first. Actually, we have taken a very conservative approach. We did take additional monoline hits. We have taken markdowns as I tried to allude on the chart on legacy positions, above the 1.1 billion disclosed on the revenues, 1.1 billion in the global market arena. So overall we have absorbed about 2.5 billion in additional, more than 2.5 billion in additional hits in Q1.</p>
          <p>So definitely I think within the context of what you can do and can do within the accounting rules, I think we have taken a conservative approach and have used the strength of a strong quarter. Technically, every competitor has different issues. There's different issues, different exposures, different risks, different quality of assets. We have done it in those areas that we feel are most exposed.</p>
          <p>The 1.1 billion in losses are related especially that you referred to. The decomposition is, some of it is, or the larger part is related to our old prop credit position that is in the process of being de-risked. And some of it is related to our global equities derivatives, a smaller part. The markdowns in RREEF that you asked about are about &#x20AC;120 million in the Q1.</p>

          <p>Hello, good morning. Just two or three quick questions, please. Firstly, could you just give us a view on &#x2013; a number of your competitors are talking about target levels of headcounts in Investment Banking. You've come down in the quarter from 10,045 to just below 10,000 and I just wondered what view you have from here in terms of head count trends?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you come back on that slide on the other monoline? I wasn't very clear why the credit value adjustment is relatively limited on the other monolines.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, I just wanted to come back on to Private Wealth Management, which seems to be loss making within AWM, and I just wondered what the plan is for restoring that profitability, what you think is broken in that model that is going to get fixed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start on, we don't have a target level of head count for our Global Markets so far as you see, IB area. We have had a target now for the Group, where we want to go that's for obvious German public market reasons we have decided not to disclose. Also, we don't plan any significant reductions in Germany itself, it's a sensitive topic.</p>
          <p>But we will continue to drive down especially in that, should expect to give you some guidance at least, Jeremy expect some cuts in the infrastructure platform mainly. Our businesses for a large part especially global area, market area, has gone ahead already with the cuts and most of them are past them right now. And as we see obviously, revenues in the business coming back, the need for further head count may not be there. But based on the fact that they have already done a significant resizing of the platform as we speak.</p>
          <p>Let me move quickly to your last question that's the Private Wealth Management, we actually were breakeven for this business in Q1. I did show you on the chart, so we see Private Wealth Management is a business that does rely on customer activity, on customer income. We have the benefit and good thing that we are gaining in terms of numbers of customers, but as most of the customers are not moving their portfolios, we don't see transactions, we don't see customers restructuring their portfolios at this point.</p>
          <p>So that, the equity market levels continue to be lower in terms of the valuation of these assets, so therefore that's what impacting this business. So we actually believe that in this business area, as we have started to build out our sales force, as we have started to gain customers, we are building profit increasing capacity and therefore in this business areas we definitely should see a significant increase and return to profitability, maybe even in the near future, as customer activity in equity markets develop further.</p>
          <p>To your monoline question, we have, the fair value of the credit position is two billion for the AA rated monolines. And we reserved on the non-investment grade. I am not sure if I got your question correctly, Jeremy, can you maybe help me? What are you looking exactly at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, just the observation was that on the slide 31 the carry value of the monoline fair value is lower, particularly on the non-investment grade. You've taken a credit provision of 600 million against 800 million fair value, so you're carrying that effectively at $0.25 on the dollar, whereas on the slide 32, you're carrying your monoline exposure with much less of a markdown on it, much less of a credit provision. Does that reflect your &#x2013; and are you factoring in a view on the underlying into.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a view on the underlying and then it's a case-by-case credit evaluation of the counterparty. So it's why all the averaging doesn't always work because it's really a case-by-case and it's both on the assets as on the counterparty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it is factoring in a view on the underlying and the likely &#x2013; yeah, okay. All right, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. Thanks Jeremy.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next one, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Derek De Vries, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have three areas of questions. The first two are numbers questions. Starting with the 6.1 billion of revenues you show in Sales and Trading. You've been very clear in quantifying some of the exceptional losses or non-recurring losses or whatnot from the, in that 6.1 billion. But I'm wondering if you could quantify the recovery of basis risk. You've been very clear in previous presentations that you had a big recovery of basis risk is in Q1. And I'm wondering how much I should strip out of that 6.1 to get a normalized run rate? So, that's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question goes to your disclosure on the legacy assets and specifically you have this line item, which is say loans related assets sales. So you show 6.3 billion of leverage finance, and 2.2 billion of commercial real estate. And I assume that relates to assets where you've sold the underlying to a private equity firm or another investor and you've provided funding equal to roughly three quarters of the sale price.</p>
          <p>And what I was hoping for is an update on where does that lie today. So if it used to be those guys had 25% of the equity, today have they lost half of that equity or have they lost two-thirds of their equity, on average? And then, how does the accounting work? If the equity is wiped out from a private equity investor do you give them the opportunity to put more equity in? Does that return to your loan book? How do you treat that or do you just treat it as an impaired loan? So, that's the question there.</p>
          <p>And my final question, I guess I was a little bit surprised by last night's announcement that Mr. Ackermann contract is being renewed through 2013 AGM. And my initial reaction is that this is probably an indication of a lack of an appropriate internal replacement. I was wondering if you could give us some insight into the Board's search process, and in particular how many internal candidates were considered. And given the importance of this, I'm a little surprised Mr. Ackermann himself wasn't on the call, so maybe you can touch on that in broad strokes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Loaded question there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try to do my best to go through. Let's start on the basis risk question. Yes, there is some recovery. Yeah, and I will say some recovery, but we were not prepared now here to quantify. So, and we expect obviously some more to come in the future quarters. So there was only some of it, but again I don't have any numbers for you right now here.</p>
          <p>Okay, next. Was the topic of how these different instruments function. And yes, some of this equity as been wiped out by now, and yes the counterparties have the risk to put in some more equity, or otherwise, yes, we -- this might come back to us in our balance sheet. Some risk -- there could be some risk that these assets will return to our balance sheet, that's how the accounting works in case of the whole equity being wiped out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just so I'm clear on that, if the equity has been wiped out do you still show that in the 6.3 billion of leveraged finance and 2.2 billion of commercial real estate, or does it move up one line in terms of your exposure. How do you show it optically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not -- right now we don't have the event in the number so --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we would have to then look into the accounting specifically...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If this event occurs. And again some of the equity is wiped up. We're not at like all of the equity has been wiped out or not nearly close to that situation at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, on the succession question, at the end there is a big debate whether you should have a change in captains in the middle of the storm. And to describe the situation and the whole discussion around it was really more driven by -- the bank does have, and I think if you read the media, does have several viable candidates for the succession. You saw internal names, you saw external names.</p>
          <p>So definitely it's not a lack of candidates. It's just more the fact, it is having a discussion, if you were a Supervisory Board member you'd rather bet on a known horse that you try to do a management change. I think in that regard, I think the preferred solution for Deutsche Bank was especially to keep the captain at the ship and don't forget that generally obviously these management changes also lead to some further changes in management team.</p>
          <p>We had understood from rating agencies, we have understood from many investors that it is one of our big assets that we have been able to maintain the team at the top. And I think that's why the two key statements that you might have heard this morning in the press conference is not only Joe has committed to stay on, but the team has committed to stay on as a whole, as we have to put the bank here in the priority and any individual issues right now as we continue to navigate the crisis.</p>
          <p>So I think this is more a case of never change a winning team that the Supervisory Board took, not less &#x2013; not a decision that we don't have strong players in our field that could do the job. And that hopefully gives you &#x2013; or sheds some light on the discussion that was going on at Deutsche Bank right now.</p>
          <p>Let's, we were also worried about and Joe alluded to it, you saw already the press discussing candidates, bad-mouthing candidates, and to cause a disruption in the management team in such an environment where we have to continue to certainly face challenges despite this extremely good quarter we've had. And we don't know how the crisis in the real economy will further evolve. I think it's at the end a very prudent and very wise decision.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, three quick ones, please. Could you maybe explain little bit on the NPL increase? How much was actually due to the reclassify -- reclassification of the trading assets? And then also, could you comment on your risk provision guidance that you gave on the fourth quarter and maybe update us on -- so like where you see that going through this year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you be a bit more elaborate on how actually margins and volumes impacted the revenues on the Transaction Banking side? I don't know if you could provide any figures on volumes and on margins levels.</p>
          <p>And then finally, is it possible for you to recognize any tax loss carry-forward this year, in case you will deliver German GAAP earnings? And could you maybe give us an indication on tax rate for this year, in case I missed that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the tax loss carry-forward. I'm going to answer your questions from the back. Obviously, I hope we can use a lot of it and that obviously will be contingent on the further development of the year. We do have, as you know, some significant positions in the US mainly and we definitely would like to develop to use those carry forwards. And if &#x2013; the profit development continues as it is and we've also made a slight sense that April has continued about the same, then hopefully we can use some of it.</p>
          <p>I did disclose for the tax rate this year for the ETR, this year that we are not making any specific projection at this point, because we have a lot of geographic volatility in the ETR. And that geographic volatility is very difficult to predict at this point on time. But again, I've given you a longer term range, I think that you could use for now, yeah, in terms of &#x2013; but you saw that we, due to the geographic arrangements we stated a higher end of this range in Q1. That will now really be a factor of how strongly profitability comes back, especially in the United States, which higher profitability in the United States means for us higher end of the range.</p>
          <p>On the margins and volumes in GTB, we are very good as I said in Trade Finance, that's a strong volume business play. On generally, at the last -- at year-end, profitability was good, we had good interest rates. Now we have a low interest rate margin environment and therefore obviously our margins are down despite we continue to see the flight to quality. We definitely get more customers, we definitely see more volume going through, but the fact that interest rates are down is the main factor for a slowdown in profitability and actually we don't see the interest rate environment increasing right now.</p>
          <p>So we believe that maybe this business might have some lower profitability than in the previous year, on an ongoing basis, unless we see a significant change in margins. We see fee margins go up in Trade Finance and we see volumes up in Trade Finance. So it's pretty much that &#x2013; pretty much kind of different development in the different business areas.</p>
          <p>Your risk guidance, I expected the question to come much sooner actually because obviously we had given you a specific guidance. It was based on our assumptions we had in our model and we have to just admit that we see a higher run rate. Not significantly higher run rate. I will therefore abstain to give you any other significant number guidance, but it will be higher.</p>
          <p>But let me clearly say that based on the quality of our book we don't expect it to be significantly higher than the number we had disclosed to you, taking out the IAS 39 reclass effect, that at the end would certainly depend on how our reclassification rules are applied and how many of those assets qualify for reclassification throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Without the reclassification, by the way, and that's on your NPL, the ratio would be 57% and again on the NPL, I always caution and I like to add that obviously we have significant collateral protection additionally through this coverage that you should consider in terms of protecting our risk on the non-performing losses.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, a question on Sales and Trading revenues. In the fourth quarter you indicated 5.5 billion of trading and hedging losses and you outlined the challenges. A lot of the challenges seemed to turn into positive issues in the first quarter looking at indices. Have these 5.5 billion, or part of it, has it helped you in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not, okay. Kian, hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if with your question you refer whether we have a significant markup that are related to the losses we had and the answer clearly is no, not significant. And again it's, you outlined that we have result positive. We've had an excellent performance in the Global Markets area in this quarter, truly exceptional. I did refer to the one or other issue in the equities arena where through the restructuring you see some lower profitability. At this point we expect recovery there and market share gains and development in the near future there as well.</p>
          <p>So we still have to work through some of the challenges you saw that I disclosed to you, that some of the losses we had to take and markdowns we had to do were related to the assets out of our prop trading activities that still remain in the books and hedged to be de-risked, which has the other effect it's going go away. So that's why we're actually are pretty happy as a Group with the development in the Global Markets arena. And we have to further work through the one or other issue, which at the end then will provide great opportunities as we move along throughout the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the equity line, even if I adjust for part of the repositioning, your equity revenue line looks maybe weaker than I expected. Can you elaborate a little bit on what is the driver for that in the Equity Derivatives business? Is that more on the flow structuring or maybe on the convertibles side, can you be a bit more specific?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually historically Deutsche Bank has in that arena made money out of prop trading activities. That was always a strong contributor in this area. And again, there we have taken a strategic decision to de-risk and in the Equity Derivatives business we remain to be a European house. And some of the benefits that occurred in the US, where Europe was much weaker, is a driver why we are down there.</p>
          <p>But again we have been able to also gain market share in the US. And we have built this business and developed this business, actually Global Markets has put a plan together to address our competitive position in the whole Equity business that certainly will yield good results, I'm fairly convinced about it, and it poses a great opportunity on top of the strengths of the credit part of the business we have to also benefit from the Equity side of the business. But they had -- this business area, obviously suffered the most from the strategic decisions taken by the Group to get out of the prop trading activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly on fixed income, can you talk maybe little bit about the month-by-month movement through the first quarter? Was every month similar or did you see any change through the quarter in the way the revenues moved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. I have to think about how the things &#x2013; I think we were strong throughout the different months. There was not really &#x2013; we saw some volatility like in the most cost-cutting there was strong throughout the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, just a last one. If I look at, from an analyst's perspective, looking at the revenues, how would you tell us how we should look at the CB&amp;S revenues going forward in terms of just subjectively considering clearly you had a superb quarter, how should we take that into account going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that's always a difficult question to ask, but I definitely therefore like to talk in terms of positives and negatives. Definitely we were able, as disclosed to you, to significantly further de-risk. And that's definitely a positive on a going forward basis. Because you will see that we will not have as many markdowns as we move forward as we see now.</p>
          <p>Again, all this forecast is always comprised what is the underlying market going to do, but if I assume that the market stays where it is, the second positive we have, we have opportunities in equities, as we're addressing the legacy issues in the equities arena and we have put this plan together to strengthen this business overall. So, there's definitely another positive.</p>
          <p>And on the negatives, as Joe said this morning, we can't exclude any event risk to drive nervous markets, again down, that's I think the biggest risk that we have out there. But we continue in terms of the different businesses we have. We see by the way a flight-to-quality in the prime brokerage area here as well, another plus in terms of opportunities. So overall, we look at very positively at the development of our Global Markets revenues, unless obviously we see a major effect again on the overall market. So difficult to make predictions, longer term predictions right now.</p>

          <p>Thanks Kian. Before we move on, may I ask the next callers to focus on one or two questions in the interest of time? Next please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Kinner Lakhani, RBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Just two questions, actually. Firstly, on the Investment Bank, where if I look at your cost base, it's roughly flat on a year ago, despite the underlying, let's say, ex-marked down revenues being up over two billion, suggesting that there has been a massive compression in terms of the bonus accrual. So my question is here, is the 60% reported and 42% ex-marked down cost income ratio a sustainable level?</p>
          <p>And second question relates to slide 51, where on the basis of the 38 billion of assets that have been reclassified, we're now looking at a, let's say, marked down avoidance for not knowing a better word actually, being 22% of your tangible book value. Now, I can understand that maybe part of that is, let's say, illiquidity premium and the way assets are in the market, but does that not concern you in terms of the size of that relative to your book value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start. Obviously, you're absolutely right that we have, as I said in my presentation, we have despite the much better performance, our accrual for performance-based compensation is effectively down because we do expect a restructuring in terms of the performance compensation. And we have observed obviously, the market in which at this point at least we expect based on the public pressure et cetera to be down in terms of it.</p>
          <p>On top of it, we have a technical effect that our retention, especially the Korea retirement acceleration funds, are significantly down here due to the fact that this program is in place. And therefore, this is a technical effect of -- this has been, by the way, a several-hundred million effect on the Korea retirement acceleration. So, that makes the broad numbers more comparable if you would take that out. Now, help me again on your second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question was just looking at slide 51 actually, where I think you have 4.5 billion of, let's say, markdown avoidance having reclassified the impact, the, let's say, 38 billion of trading in AFS assets, and obviously the 2.2 billion benefit combined post-tax looks like 22% of your tangible book value, which is a pretty high number I think even in your competitor space to have avoided through your capital. Just wondering what your level of concern is on that?</p>

          <p>There's nothing to question, to be honest. Because I would contest and say these assets are now correctly assessed. And this is an incorrect valuation avoidance number and therefore, we could debate this all day long. We have very tight rules, very, very tight rules in terms of this reclassification. We actually have IFRS filers treated unfairly because we have to disclose this number which generates these types of questions, while our US peers who do a similar reclassification, don't have to disclose their valuation differences.</p>
          <p>This number, to be honest, is somewhat meaningless because we feel, honestly, I feel our assets are correctly valued and we continue obviously to do the regular impairment reviews that we have to do like in any other of these assets. And as we move along, we're not concerned. I know the quality. We know the quality of these assets. The reason why we reclassed them is because their intrinsic value was so much higher than the potential traded value. And therefore, they don't have any more stronger or lower risk than any other asset of that type that somebody may hold in a banking book.</p>
          <p>And therefore, the answer to your question is no, we are absolutely not concerned. We are a little bit concerned that we are forced to report causing some confusion, whilst US GAAP filers don't have to report the reclassification effect. But at the end, philosophically, believe me, these assets are now more properly valued in a fair value context than if we would value them based on just trading asset pricing on the markets right now. So that's why I'm not concerned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just want to ask a question on these talks about the potential bad bank in Germany. And I would imagine that you &#x2013; on the one side, it could help you, on the other side it will probably help more your competitors that have much more troubled assets than you do have. Can you give us an update on what you think of a discussion and if you have any view, and what you think the timing of this is expected to be released? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Number one, we definitely think that's a very good discussion, and we definitely think that Germany needs a bad bank, yeah. And to be honest, if we look at our competitors, not so much because we believe it will strengthen competitors but actually this is a systemic question. And I think from a systemic point of view, we need to definitely look at a bad bank in Germany to be very healthy.</p>
          <p>We have lots of Landesbanken and Sparkassen that hold assets that are a problem and we have no benefit. I think, we &#x2013; for us at Deutsche Bank, it's better to have a healthy German banking system around than to have an unhealthy competitive environment. Unhealthy competitors is the worst you want to have on the one hand. On the other hand, let's not forget that many of these banks are our customers as well, and we are really intertwined with them. So from a systemic perspective, we definitely welcome a solution to this bad asset problem in Germany.</p>
          <p>The discussions are going on. It is a complex topic. The German government has not made a decision what structure, form, et cetera, to elect. There's different views and opinion on how that specifically would look. We definitely can tell you we do not have any assets within Deutsche Bank at this point that we would send to a bad bank or will apply to a bad bank. We therefore for our own bank reasons don't see the need, but definitely welcome a structure of this type for the German banking market from a systemic point of view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Carsten Werle, good afternoon. Two small questions. The first one, you indicated that you have significantly reduced the exposure to designated prop trading areas. At the same time we see that your value at risk is actually higher on average than it was in the quarters during 2008. Perhaps you could elaborate a bit why it is the case and where does it come from?</p>
          <p>And secondly, with regard to Asset Management, I think this morning you indicated that you expect a return to profitability in H2. So could you perhaps give us an indication what the likely charges will be that we still have to expect for Q2? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you be more specific on your last question, Q2 return of profitability, where?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Asset Management business, I think you indicated this morning in the press conference that you expect this for H2 but not for Q2. And I just wanted to know what the likely charges might be that we still have to face in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not &#x2013; number one, it's not so much one-off driven, the situation in assets management. We certainly still have some of the stranded assets. We have taken and de-risked significantly. We have taken significant markdowns on these assets &#x2013; stranded assets. So it actually is more a function of customer activity coming back. And that's &#x2013; so it's more the underlying business. It's equity markets improving, and therefore us seeing more improvement.</p>
          <p>But we're not earning any performances for sure right now, we're not earning any fees as per se. So it is really more a function, it's not a function of expected losses to be honest. There might be the one other, but nothing big or substantial to expect there. So it's really coming back in terms of markets coming back and customer activity coming back.</p>
          <p>And in terms of your VAR question, it's the volatility input figure that has caused this surge in the VAR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wasn't that highest in autumn? That was &#x2013; I just checked and it looks to me as if volatility actually was highest in October after Lehman and then since then it gradually came down. So I'm a bit surprised that it's now higher actually than in Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Couple of questions, the first one is on monolines. To return to your slide 31, just the first bullet point that you've settled the exposure 850 million, and you had a credit provision against it of 750. Just that suggest you've settled at $0.12 on the dollar. Is that calculation, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. Mathematically yes, but we valued &#x2013; we were correctly provided, there was no loss on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So yeah, that that would have been the second question. So basically you've settled for $0.12 on the dollar, but you did not have to accrue additional loan loss provisions against it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we were correctly reserved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how do you then bridge the gap that you've settled with one non-investment grade monoline at $0.12 on the dollar, but the other ones are carried at $0.60 on the dollar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah because --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's such great divergence among the counterparties. And could you maybe disclose the credit rating of the monoline you settled with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I understand your concern in our discussions. We do understand that. But, if we were talking auto companies, you wouldn't say that because we took a hit on one auto company of General Motors, we should take a hit on BMW, as well. So we do a case-by-case analysis like you always do with counterparty risk. Yeah?</p>
          <p>The fact that in industry as well, and that's how our providing system is and it is very typical of how you rate counterparty risk. Again we look at the asset class because there is a risk in the asset class, and then we look at the counterparty, we look at external ratings to do our internal ratings. As we would do with General Motors, as we would do with BMW, I'm sure you wouldn't ask us the same questions on these counterparties, why is the one or the other one &#x2013; should be in a certain relationship as well.</p>
          <p>So our view is we have taken just on a case-by-case basis, we do this evaluation. And we could settle. To get out and resolve the issue we will go ahead and settle. But that doesn't mean for us that either one or other valuation is driving it because we have this different system of looking at a case-by-case basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And could we come back to the equities Sales and Trading point? You've mentioned that basically there was a lot of prop within Equity Derivatives apart from your normal prop desk. This was basically under the explanation how I got it in terms of the &#x2013; because historically you disclosed that prop was roughly 15 to 25%. So I was just wondering is your Equity Derivatives business just suffering from a wrong position within the book, or is it a &#x2013; do you view it as a restructuring case? And do you think there will be further burden to come the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right. Number one, our prop only refers to -- not to derivatives. It was equities prop trading, and there were designated parts we closed. And that was the one effect. And the other one on the Equity Derivatives, yes in some legacy positions that has created these losses and the contraction.</p>
          <p>But again, as I said, we see some positives coming at us, as we have now addressed and as Global Markets is addressing in restructuring this business. And we had obviously the negative results of the restructuring in Q1. So we definitely are looking at a better development in the coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just a quick one at the end. You flagged I think at Q3 results that the increased risk weighting for the market risk related risk weighted assets would be 50 billion. Do you have an updated number of this given that you shrunk the book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about the same number. There is &#x2013; we don't have an update on it. And again this was just a general outlook to give you some idea of what we need. But we don't have an update on this number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Philipp this was just a calculation assuming that nothing happens and no management action taken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is why I'm asking what the management action has led to in terms of a new number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We talk very long-term here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you've seen us reducing risk-weighted assets. You've seen us -- how we have managed risk-weighted assets throughout the whole crisis actually. And we will continue that process clearly. So, on a net basis we don't expect 50 billion to be added to our risk weighted assets in holdings.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Fiona Swaffield, Execution Limited. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just one question on the Tier 1 ratio linked in with incremental risk weighted assets. When you look at the 10.2 and your slide on 35, to be honest it doesn't look that great versus the other market share gainers. Are you truly happy with that because obviously, it's in the lower tier compared to three of them, and in pretty much similar to most?</p>
          <p>And then in terms of going forward, is your plan to boost that number if you've got risk weighted assets coming down versus the new incremental. How are you looking at it, and has there been any dividend accrual in Q1? Is there anything in the Tier 1 ratio we should know about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The dividend accrual, by the way, to start with that first question you asked is we accrued $0.50, which is traditionally we accrue previous year's because at this time it's too early to say what our dividend policy will be. And just out of &#x2013; therefore technically the easiest way to go ahead is just accrue for the previous year's dividend, that's what's in that number.</p>
          <p>The second answer to your question is the best way to gain market share and go back to a growth pattern definitely is by being profitable. And through profitability and retained earnings, risk capital and therefore grow the business again. And therefore obviously we are very happy about the profit situation in Q1, because certainly over time, if this is sustainable it will allow us to go back to grow and use a percent of the market opportunities that are provided.</p>
          <p>On the peer comparison to be honest, I hear more of my colleagues wanting to pay back the government funding that brought them up to these Tier 1 ratios, than necessarily that they think that this is really the right number or the necessary number to run their business on. And to be honest on this capital discussion we always like to point out, I think we should look at the entire liability side of the balance sheet, because it's about liquidity where banks go bust and not about their Tier 1, as we've seen in some of the recent examples of our banks going under. So we feel comfortable, the 10 is significantly above the requirement that is established by regulators.</p>
          <p>There is some logic behind this regulatory requirement. For other risk we are significantly above that. And therefore as long as we are able to continue to maintain it and we're managing the bank to it, we should be okay. And regarding therefore our business mix as compared to some, if you look at Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs that are pure Investment Banks and have a different risk profile than we have as a mix &#x2013; a more mixed outlook, I think that our Tier 1 ratio is actually where it should be and it's comparatively conservative versus all the other ones. Because what we didn't put down here is pure play retail banks that generally show much lower Tier 1 ratios. And therefore, I think that we feel very comfortable with where we are.</p>
          <p>And again to your other question, again, on how we think it will develop. Obviously Tier 1 10% will be the guiding principal as we move along and then the question is if profitability returns we might be able to then grow and if profitability does not return we will have to further de-risk our balance sheet. So I think I can put it as simple as that.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Jon Peace, Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi everybody. I just wanted to ask a couple of quick clarifications. First on that last point on Tier 1, Mr. B&#xE4;nziger did say at a presentation in the last quarter that Deutsche may need to raise the Tier 1 in the future from 10 to 12. Are you suggesting that's not a very likely development?</p>
          <p>The second question was just back to the IAS 39 reclassifications and the difference between the fair value and the carrying value, which is 6.7 billion. With your impairment tests does there come a time, where the fair value has been below the current value for a sufficiently long period, whether that's six months or 12 months, that you have to recognize a write-down even if you don't agree with that fair value? I'm just trying to get a sense of what the drag might be in future quarters through the provision line from the partial recognition of that difference? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both of the questions are no. No we don't expect a 12% at this point in time to be realistic. There's a lot of discussion and speculation out there and it's difficult certainly to make a prediction. But from all that we know, we at this point rate it rather unlikely that we will see adjustment. But, let's not forget, I think the adjustment that's more likely to come is the one we've outlined; that there will be a higher risk weighted assets charge for market risk, which the banking system has certainly somewhat misjudged.</p>
          <p>Then if there additionally, on top of providing more risk weighted assets charges for market risk, there is an additional increase in the ratio necessary, I think that we rate unlikely, because obviously then it will be provided for. But this is a discussion at this point it's always very difficult to know. But it's definitely something we don't expect to come to fruition in near future, because our discussions with regulators have positioned us, have taken the question.</p>
          <p>With bank capitalization being such a big issue, also in terms of the general economy, why should they throw the banks to any further pressure at this point in time. That I think doesn't make a lot of sense. And on the IAS reclass for launch, it's -- we do this testing when we reclass the assets, yeah, and we have had not &#x2013; we haven't had this situation that you outlined, so we're not worried at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So did &#x2013; in your impairment tests there is no requirement to adjust the &#x2013; if the fair value stays below the carrying value for a very extended period. Because obviously we're only six months into this reclass process. If at the end of 2009 we still recognize this difference, is that something you auditors would make you to recognize in the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because for loans this test is not valid, you don't do the fair value versus carrying test for loans. It's AFS securities only.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Good afternoon. Couple of questions on the stable divisions. Firstly, in the Transaction Bank costs were up fairly steeply year-on-year despite the revenues being flat, just wondering why costs were up? Whether they're going to stay at this first quarter level going forward?</p>
          <p>And then second question, similar on the Asset and Wealth Management division, you said that it was breakeven if you strip out the RREEF loss. So I get to making a 50 million loss. And I'm just wondering, it's, something seems wrong to me if the division needs to be generating performance fees in order to be profitable. And are you considering any greater restructuring of that division or sale of loss making divisions to competitors that could allow it to be more profitable? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the second question, of course we are looking into improving the asset management situation. There is a plan in place to, as Joe's outlined also in the press conference, to bring this business back to profitability. And at this point, as you know, sales are anyway difficult. There's lots of asset management type businesses on the market. You can't really make money on sales so that's not something we are really considering. We are looking at some restructuring of it, that's correct.</p>
          <p>To go back, but especially we need ultimately every business needs customer revenues to be generated to go back to profitability, and that will be the driver as we have resolved most of the issues around this legacy position that we have to deal with. By the way, we've also reclassed some of these assets into our Corporate Investment category. And you know, we will administer and then run them down or sell them out of Corporate Investment. So in that sense we should see the improvement on the asset management business, based on customer activities.</p>
          <p>In GTB we are investing into profitable growth. We should see higher transaction related costs. We see increase, some increase in staff levels across all business lines, in order to support the business growth, because we have seen here that obviously that's a business that we have gained market share, that we are continuing to gain market share. So it did make sense for us to do some further investment into the platform to, on the one hand better serve our customers, in the second to be a market share gainer.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Dieter Hein, Fairesearch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Guten Tag Herr Krause und Herr Dr. Schmidt. I have two questions on the Asset and Wealth Management business as well, where you released losses for the first quarter. You wrote that you transferred infrastructure investment from Asset and Wealth Management to Corporate Investment. Could you explained to us why you transferred this business beside that you want to reduce the losses in the Asset and Wealth Management business? And how big were the losses in the first quarter from that business you transferred?</p>
          <p>And secondly, when my interpretation of your red arrows on slide 26 is right, then Private Wealth Management is continuing to producing losses. So my question is or I do not understand how you can make losses with private wealth clients. That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's all. Well, number one, let me start. We transferred some of the business-stranded assets. These were assets that were supposed to go into funds. And the stranded assets are things, for example, like ports or hotels in construction. That's not the business that asset management traditionally gets involved with, and therefore we decided that all businesses, or business activities that for example we got stuck with, that at this point are not sellable, that we have to improve to be able to sell it et cetera, are not the core activity of an asset management group. That's the background of the transfer.</p>
          <p>We transfer and also we manage it out of teams and groups and managers that are more capable in terms, and whose job it is to run these type of assets, and therefore we decided to put it into our Corporate Investment area, where we can now keep the teams together that are going to run these assets, going to administer these assets, be it construction, be it running of businesses like ports and things like that. So that's the background of the transfer. So Asset Management can concentrate on the business that they are best at, which is their core focus. We have about 50 million in losses in CI out of these activities. And we have about 80 million in Asset Management out of this in Q1, which is part of the weak losses of 120 million that we communicated to you.</p>
          <p>And again on Private Wealth Management, of course, this business can make losses because you have the cost base that you have to cover with the fee income. And what's happening right now that we see. And again that's why Private Wealth Management, I want to make sure that we don't get the wrong spin in here, because we see a great future for this business, as many of our competitors are gone.</p>
          <p>And right now, as soon as customer activity comes back in this area which understandable, customers are holding off from making any portfolio and investment decisions right now, and we see the revenues come back. The benefit we're building in this business right now is substantial, because we are investing in this business, we're not divesting from this business. We're building up potential. We are, we see the great potential to really, once markets and of the return to normality to really have a good running business as we had before.</p>
          <p>So it's more of a timing of issues, when revenues and costs are hitting us P&amp;L-wise and less an issue of the basis of profitability in the Private Wealth Management area.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have time for one last participant, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Christopher Wheeler, MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Two quick questions, first of all, on the non-performing loans, obviously we've seen them go up by about 53 basis points since Q1 '08. However, the coverage ratio's come down about 13 percentage points or to 12.3 percentage points to be precise, from 52.3% to 40%.</p>
          <p>I just wondered if you had any view on what you considered to be an appropriate coverage ratio during a period of rising non-performing loans. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, and I know we've been flogging this dead horse of Asset Management, but if we put Private Wealth Management to one side as a core business, I mean, do you actually need to be in Asset Management?</p>
          <p>Since 2004 when we had the management changes, it's being a long stream of changes, restructurings and you really aren't where you want to be. Do you actually need to manufacture the products or could you just become a distributor? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as we are in light of a new strategic discussion, I don't want to make any strategic going forward question on that because I think our current strategy is pretty clear; we want to be both and we were successful at both and we got hit by the worst financial crisis ever in this business. And as we had some funds and we had, DBS was very successful, as we had credit some funds in the U.S. and we had secured some infrastructure assets.</p>
          <p>That's what caused this business to go in trouble, since the fact that market activities stopped while we were stuck with certain assets. And on top of this they very quickly lost their value, because of the general crisis. So I wouldn't take this specific now crisis related effect to be something that judges us over the longer term profitability of this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Stefan, I did say since 2004 we've had ongoing discussions about the level of profitability in this business, not necessarily losses. This is not just a credit crunch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But look at our, look at the business that we run in Germany, it's a very successful and profitable business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't argue. We don't know that, because you don't disclose it. But obviously what I'm interested in is this has gone on for a long time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just believe me now, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our Germany business is a very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I'll make a note of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a successful business. So I think there is living proof that you can make money in this business, and even longer-term living proof. And the fact that in some of our U.S part of this business, we have not had the performances is something that the management team there is addressing. And therefore, our current view is that yes, that it can be a good business, because if it works on this side of the ocean it should work on the other side of the ocean as well in the crisis of only specifically hit this business badly.</p>
          <p>And the real estate business, we also have the different cycle than some of our Investment Banking business. So in that sense there is &#x2013; that is not a fundamental strategic question, it's more of an operational, fixing some of the challenges in this business area we're facing. The plan is put together, as Joe alluded to this morning, and there's also a belief that we could see some of the positive results of this plan in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on non-performing loans. You know that we don't have any specific percentage that we can say. I could allude to the fact that regulators assume 55% recovery for our unsecured corporate exposures, to make an example. So between the collateral protection we have and the coverage ratio we have, we're probably there around there where you should be. And obviously we have in that arena. So if we especially take out the loans coverage ratio ex the IAS reclasses, we're at 59%. Therefore obviously it's -- I think these numbers seem to be fine from our current perspective.</p>
