          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the News Corp. second quarter 2011 earnings release. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> And as a reminder, we are also recording today's conference.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2011 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer and Dave DeVoe our Chief Financial Officer. First we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we will be happy to take your questions first from the financial community, and then from the press.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2010, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements included in such filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP measurements, the definition of, and the reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.</p>
          <p>Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as adjusted segment operating income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted net income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of segment operating income, and the EPS and net income reconciliation is included in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to Dave.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, we are pleased with our continued progress in fiscal 2011. We reported second quarter segment operating income of $1.29 billion, a 6% increase over year ago's levels when excluding last year's $500 million litigation charge. This improvement was led by the continued strong growth at our Cable Programming and Television segments that more than offset a difficult comparison at Filmed Entertainment and higher losses at the Digital Media Group.</p>
          <p>During this year's second quarter, the company recorded a $275 million pre-tax charge related to the impairment of assets in an organizational restructuring at Myspace. Also in the most recent quarter, the company recorded pre-tax losses from the disposition of certain businesses, including Jamba, and the FOX Audience Network, the internet ad sales group. Excluding the net income effect in both years of one-time items, principally consisting of the items just mentioned, as well as the litigation settlement charge last year, the second quarter adjusted earnings per share this year are $0.29, compared with last year's result of $0.25.</p>
          <p>The press release includes a reconciliation of our GAAP results to these amounts. This 16% adjusted earnings per share growth reflects the higher segment operating income, lower net interest expense from 1.9 billion less debt outstanding, and modestly improved equity earnings from higher BSkyB contributions.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to provide some additional context on the performance at a few of our businesses. Let's first start with cable, the Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results. Generating nearly &#x2013; this segment generates nearly 60% of News Corporation's total segment operating income. Our second quarter cable segment operating income increased 22% over last year, to $735 million this growth continues to be top line driven, with segment revenues up 12%. Advertising revenues at the cable networks increased 17% over year ago levels and affiliate fees grew 11% reflecting particular strength at the Regional Sports Networks, FOX News and our international channels, including STAR.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that our strong revenue and earnings growth was generated despite the adverse impact from a one-month blackout on the DISH Network of our Regional Sports Networks, FX and National Geographic Channels due to a distribution contract renewal dispute with EchoStar. While a new deal was successfully executed, the blackout reduced cable segment operating income growth by about $30 million in the current quarter.</p>
          <p>At our Film segment, second quarter operating income was $189 million, as compared to 324 million we reported a year ago. This anticipated decline reflects the very successful worldwide home entertainment release of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, which is in last year's results. As we look forward, keep in mind that close to 75% of Avatar's record-breaking worldwide box office receipts were generated in last year's March quarter. As a result, we will have a difficult comparison to the prior year in the current March quarter.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $151 million increased by 122 million, driven by top line growth at our television stations and our broadcast network. Our station revenues were up 20% in the quarter, compared to a year ago, reflecting significantly higher political spending, and overall improved local advertising levels. Political spending was approximately $45 million higher this quarter than a year ago. After politicals, automotive advertising increases represented the next largest portion of our revenue growth.</p>
          <p>At FOX Broadcasting, we also showed improved results, driven by advertising increases in both general entertainment and sports. Higher NFL ratings and stronger pricing more than offset weaker ratings and one fewer game from this year's less favorable World Series match-up. These improvements at both the station and the network were despite lost ad sales and expenses related to the Cablevision blackout that reduced segment operating income by nearly $17 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to SKY Italia, recent financial and operational trends indicate that we are making good progress in restoring our growth trajectory and towards our next milestone of 5 million subscribers. In the quarter, segment operating losses improved 60% to $12 million from last year's loss of $30 million, resulting from higher revenue in local currency terms and lower basic programming and movie costs.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased about 2% in local currency, as compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily due to a higher average subscriber base, which increased total subscription revenue, despite a slight decrease in our monthly ARPU. Our monthly ARPU in the quarter averaged approximately &#x20AC;42, as compared to &#x20AC;43 in the year ago. This decrease reflects the migration of some existing subscribers among the new package choices that we announced over the summer.</p>
          <p>This slightly lower ARPU, which was anticipated, and we are very pleased with the overall result to-date of the reorganized programming packages. In fact, this quarter's gross additions total approximately 214,000, or 43% higher than gross additions a year ago. This improvement combined with a 33% reduction in churn subscribers netted SKY Italia 71,000 additional subscribers. This sub growth represents the highest quarterly net additions in the last two years, and Sky ended the quarter with approximately 4.87 million subs.</p>
          <p>At our Publishing segment, segment operating income of $380 million decreased $30 million from last year's second quarter, when excluding last year's litigation settlement. Increased advertising revenues in all three of our major newspaper markets were more than offset by lower contributions at HarperCollins, costs associated with the investment in The Daily, and the absence of the Dow Jones Index business, which was sold last March. The year-ago results included about $17 million in segment operating profit in the quarter from the index business.</p>
          <p>And at our Other segment, we reported a second-quarter segment operating loss of $156 million, $31 million higher than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects lower search and advertising revenues at Myspace, partially offsetting this decline were improved operating results at FOX Mobile, which we sold in December, and higher contributions from our international outdoor business.</p>
          <p>And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011, and as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2010 the $500 million litigation charge resulting in a base of $4.46 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes.</p>
          <p>In early November, we reiterated guidance anticipating our segment operating income growth for fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2010 adjusted result. Since that time, results at Myspace have been below our expectations and our new film releases were somewhat below our original expectations. On the other hand, our television cable segments continue to outperform our expectations, due to the buoyant advertising markets and recent retrans and cable affiliation agreements. As a result, after taking all of these items into account, and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our operating segment income guidance for fiscal 2011 to a growth rate range in the low double-digits above the fiscal 2010 adjusted result.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to now turn the call over to Chase.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. I'd like to spend a few minutes adding some operational context to the financial results Dave just discussed. Clearly, we feel good about the quarter's overall financial performance, but we feel even better about the progress we're making in positioning our business for long-term growth.</p>
          <p>The largest drivers in the most recent quarter, namely the Cable and Broadcast channels' earnings, and the business momentum at SKY Italia, will not only help us deliver our segment operating profit growth target for the year, but should also continue to be drivers of our earnings trajectory for several years to come. As Dave pointed out, our channels business, consisting of both Cable and Broadcast, is the lead engine powering current earnings. The operating momentum of our Cable segment is underpinned by the multiyear distribution contracts already in place, as well as a highly developed international expansion plan.</p>
          <p>Assuming a relatively stable advertising environment, this segment should continue delivering at least solid double-digit earnings growth for the next several years. Currently all of our local, national, and international TV businesses are benefiting from very strong advertising markets, however, our longer term cable network growth is not reliant on advertising increases, but rather is supported by unique competitive programming strength at virtually all of our networks.</p>
          <p>The power of local sports continues to drive momentum at our Regional Sports Networks where this year's MLB baseball ratings finished up 9%, compared to the previous season, and the Big 12 national football package scored a 13% increase in ratings. While the season is still early, basketball ratings are up 13%, compared to this point a year ago.</p>
          <p>At FX, this season's Sons of Anarchy achieved the channel's highest 18 to 49 ratings for any show in the channel's 16 year history and we just renewed for a fourth season. FX's ratings going forward, will also benefit from a considerably stronger movie lineup. Additionally, with the new DISH and Cablevision agreements, FX is now a fully distributed network reaching almost 100 million homes.</p>
          <p>FOX News in the most recent quarter beat CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and Headline News combined in prime time total viewers making it the number four channel across all of basic cable. And given the strength of the channel and its passionate viewership, we expect to get appropriate increases on the renewals we have coming up with all the major MSOs over the next few years.</p>
          <p>At FOX International Channels, where the majority of our 200+ channels are in high growth, under-penetrated markets, we have the scale, and the expertise to more than double profits over the next few years, generating $1 billion in operating profit income by fiscal 2015 and that $1 billion target does not include the rapidly escalating profits being generated at STAR India. Following a reorganization and re-branding a year ago, STAR is now on pace to deliver its highest annual profit ever.</p>
          <p>The growth of our business is not solely being driven by cable properties. It is also the result of a rapidly improving broadcast business here in the U.S &#x2013; While we were pleased with the high single-digit ad pricing increases we achieved in the current season's upfront, we are delighted with the current strength of the national scatter market. This advertising strength clearly reflects the potency of a broad audience delivered by high profile entertainment.</p>
          <p>And no programming is more high profile than American Idol. We are absolutely thrilled with its return, which has been received well, is performing well and continues to be the most dominant show on television. American Idol along with Glee and The X Factor, which premiers this fall, provide a really powerful foundation for FBC's future success.</p>
          <p>Equally as significant for our broadcast business is the strength of FOX Sports. In fact, FOX Sports finished 2010 as the number one sports network for the 14th straight year, and the 2010 NFL on FOX regular season was the most watched in FOX history. We have a great match for this weekend's Super Bowl XLV! That said our expectations for this year's NASCAR performance are more tempered given last year's ratings decline. We will have a better feel for that following the Daytona 500 race in two and a half weeks.</p>
          <p>On a local level, our TV stations continue to do a great job increasing their market share and driving cost-efficiencies. Local advertising trends point to a growing and stable market ahead, supported by sturdy auto, telecom and financial advertising demand. And as I mentioned on the last quarter's earnings call, potential for the broadcast business, and the fees we are starting to collect from cable and satellite distributors that reflect the importance of our network to consumers. We have a retrans agreement in place with four of the larger distributors and have now set the market for our broadcast business.</p>
          <p>As we continue to secure new agreements over the next couple of years, we will be taking this business to a whole new level of profitability. In fact, with these distribution fees, we expect our U.S. broadcasting business, including the stations and FBC to generate at least $1 billion in annual operating income within the next couple of years, assuming relatively stable ad markets.</p>
          <p>While the channel business is our biggest growth driver today, we are equally bullish about our international pay TV platforms. In Italy, through technology leadership, effective marketing and new pricing and programming offers in the last summer we have rejuvenated this business. As Dave mentioned, SKY Italia just achieved its highest level of quarterly subscriber net additions in the last eight quarters through a combination of higher gross adds and lower churn.</p>
          <p>In Germany, the most recent operational trends suggest the management team there has taken the right actions by leveraging the powerful combination of content and technology leadership to capitalize on this significant market opportunity. In mid-January, Sky Deutschland pre-announced a number of December quarter operating metrics showing considerable improvement. They added 131,000 net additional subscribers in the quarter with gross additions up 24% from the same quarter ago, and their lowest annualized churn rate in 21 quarters.</p>
          <p>We also continue to be excited about our 30% interest in TATA SKY in India, a market offering significant potential, given its size and anticipated economic growth. Similar to our platforms in other markets, TATA SKY, boasts superiority in technology, customer services and innovation, and currently has more than 6 million connections.</p>
          <p>Before I move off beyond our platform business, I should also mention that we are currently working through the regulatory process towards a full acquisition of BSkyB, but at this time, there's nothing more I can add to what's already been reported in the press.</p>
          <p>On our content side, our TV studio is doing great. As I said, last quarter, Modern Family is on course to generate the largest first cycle sales in history, Glee ranks as the number one scripted series on TV and continues to grow. We have a great set of pilots we are looking forward to across the four networks for the coming season.</p>
          <p>Our film studio has not had a year to remember, but that's the nature of the business. We have a great management team with a great set of upcoming films, headlined by our animated Rio, and the X-Men sequel. We also recently announced three strategic actions, which will enhance our release slate and risk management for years to come. Specifically we extended our long-standing co-financing deal with Dune Capital, second we renewed our partnership with New Regency providing co-financing opportunities, as well as distribution fees for FOX Film through 2022 and we agreed with Jim Cameron that Avatar 2 and 3 will be his next films.</p>
          <p>Also on the content side, I would like to take a minute to touch on our new digital news product The Daily, which we formally announced earlier today and for which Rupert is still providing some briefings as we speak. I think this is exactly the type of initiative we should be pursuing to take advantage of the digital revolution. We should be leaders in using our content strengths and brands to build extensions of these for the new wave of digital platforms and technologies. The digital revolution craves our content and brands and we need to focus our efforts on being leaders in developing digital businesses for our news, sports and entertainment franchises around the world.</p>
          <p>That leads me to the final topic, Myspace. We recently completed a rebuild of the business with a focus on entertainment and restructured the organization to right-size the company. With the new content, focus and structure in place, we believe now is the right time for News Corp. to consider strategic options for this business. The new Myspace experience has been very well-received by the market and we have some encouraging traffic metrics in the last several weeks, however, we recognize that the plan to allow Myspace to reach its full potential may be best developed under a new ownership structure and we are evaluating those strategic alternatives</p>
          <p>In summary, I feel we are on the right track with virtually all of our businesses and have the critical building blocks in place to generate long-term earnings growth and value in this fast-moving digital world. Thanks, and now we are happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have one for Chase and a quick one for Dave. Chase, you mentioned a target of $1 billion in OI in TV a couple of years from now. I wonder if you could give us a sense of how big retrans will play in that role in terms of the size of retrans for you and reverse retrans given you have done some deals already. Can you take us from what it looks like now to two, three years from now on retrans and reverse retrans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say reverse retrans, you mean, the affiliates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly. How much of that 1 billion, or so is coming from those two new revenue lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a revenue. Look, the 1 billion is a profit number. Obviously, the retrans is revenue. But, I mean, I'm not going to put a specific dollar on it. There's a fair amount out there about what we're looking to get for it, and so I will let the, you know, speculation speak for itself. I think we are pretty &#x2013; you know, pretty well sort of define the market for us in terms of the O&amp;Os, and the affiliate side is probably more actively engaged in right now. This is a big number. It's certainly hundreds of millions of dollars. It changes the nature of this business, and, you know, in many ways I think the broadcast network should look like a cable network and should &#x2013; and should have two real meaningful streams of revenue, subscription and advertising and we look for this to, you know, be a significant part of the revenue for that &#x2013; for that broadcast business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what type of &#x2013; a follow-up, and then I'll move on. What type of ad growth is assumed to get to 1 billion in OI? When you said modest ad growth, are you talking low single-digit growth all in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're not assuming &#x2013; we are assuming &#x2013; essentially our view of the economy right now would be probably you've got a pretty low growth economy and, obviously we look at the short term, the ad market is great. We're sitting here with scatter pricing that's more than a third above the upfront. We're not assuming that. We're assuming you're going to have an ad market that's, you know &#x2013; you know, is pretty modest growth that sort of reflects an economy that, I think &#x2013; you know, we think we would assume right now, you know, is pretty modest growth.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have two questions. One was just sort of a follow-on to Michael's question. Could you give us color, Chase, on advertising completely across the platforms? It sounds like there is strength pretty much on every platform in every market and I was just wondering if you could give us some color going into the March quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, can you talk to us about &#x2013; you know, just give us your views on TV Everywhere. Do you think it's important for your channels to participate, and where are you in deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the advertising markets, it is really strong. I mean, TV is leading, I guess I'd say national TV in particular. So, when you look at the broadcast network, I mean, I touched on the scatter, the cable networks. Right now the cable second half growth looks stronger than the first half growth. And so, you know, it's &#x2013; you know, it is certainly very good. You know, it's good on the station side, I mean, the comps get tougher on the station side, so year-on-year, we are not going to have the type of year-on-year growth in the second and third quarter that we did in the first two. But, it's really, you know, good, solid growth, and, you know, really across the &#x2013; you know, across the broadcast platforms, ad revenues &#x2013; I mean, across the newspaper, you know, both Dow Jones, U.K., Australia, are all up. They are not up like the TV business but -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's double-digit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are up and continue to look pretty good. And obviously, we have the Super Bowl on top of it, you know, falling on Sunday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the international cable networks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The international cable networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The international &#x2013; you know, international, it's somewhat higher than the domestic, you know, so &#x2013; international networks, on pretty almost any front you want to look at are doing great. The fact that we have this quarter observed the fight with EchoStar and fight with Cablevision, which were both whacks in the quarter and come out with those results it affected both profits, ad dollars, and the like, I think it speaks to the strength of those businesses, but the international cable networks, you know, would be &#x2013; you know, would be leading it and certainly, there doesn't seem to be anything slowing it down as we look at the second &#x2013; you know, the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>What was your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was on TV Everywhere, just your views on where you are.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I prefer to call it authentication because I think it's a better phrase as you move forward into an array of digital platforms, how you package it and try to create value out of it. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a bit of &#x2013; you know, it's a struggle to get going. I think to some degree, it's been encumbered by a cable industry that tries to &#x2013; you know, tries to create too many walls around it. I think it would be enhanced if it was approached in a more open way, you know, where &#x2013; you know, where it had a more open opportunity for an array of digital platforms to consist in an authenticated world. And, I think it would be &#x2013; I think it would be a good thing if it gets some traction. I do think it's &#x2013; but I think it's got to &#x2013; look, at the end of the day, its success is going to be built on making it a good experience for consumers and if you don't, they will, you know, find other options, which is why I think the cable industry ought to &#x2013; cable/satellite &#x2013; the distribution industry ought to find a way to make it more open and, you know, enticing and appealing and, you know, an opportunity for consumers and, you know, let those who do a good job succeed because then the consumers are going to migrate to where &#x2013; to the experiences, you know, they value and value and like. But I think authentication, you know, is an important initiative and something we would like to see succeed. It's been frustrating, it's been talked about for two years and still hasn't gotten very far.</p>

          <p>No, I &#x2013; just &#x2013; I mean, authentication, I'm really talking about sort of the ability &#x2013; you know, to have that sort of add on to the core programming package of whatever we talked about, what you want to see when you want to see it, you know, where you want to see it and provide that experience and provide it in a rewarding way. And I think that rewarding way isn't simply saying you can see it on cable-company.com or Fox.com and that's your only two choices as opposed to saying you can get that type of experience in an array of places.</p>
          <p>I'm really talking about this sort of &#x2013; you know, the enhanced experience, which I think is what authentication is about, it's about adding the enhanced experience of getting what you want, where you want, when you want it, on top of the core programming package.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Chase, I just want to pick up a little bit more on how you are thinking about monetizing the content at FOX, in particular. Disney did a deal with Netflix and I think the press reports were sort of $150 to $200 million for a year's worth of programming and I would argue most of that value, if that number is close to right, it accrues to ABC. So, how do you feel about that kind of a deal with FOX, just in terms of making prior season's shows available online, and whether it's Netflix or Fox.com, or Hulu, you know, there's been that argument from the Turner folks that Modern Family being available on Hulu made it less attractive for them, I just wanted to get your thought process and strategy on using these platforms to build value at FOX's TV studio and at the network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for content owners, having players like, you know, Netflix emerge, and, you know, certainly &#x2013; has real pop to it in the sense they are another buyer of our product. I think that's, you know, largely what somebody like &#x2013; you know, I distinguished Fox.com, which is really &#x2013; I think there's a line between sort of current season product, which is really more where the Fox.com's, you know, reside, and sort of a delayed access to you know, current product, which is different than sort of the &#x2013; you know where the Netflix type reside, which is really more what I would consider library product. You know, product that may &#x2013; obviously those things can change, but I do think they are &#x2013; you know, they are different and to the degree, you know, Netflix is, you know, which is I think this type of deal, I read the Disney deal. I don't remember the specific product, but to the degree it's &#x2013; where you talked Modern Family to the degree they are looking to compete for sort of library rights. I think largely they are competing with other sort of, you know, network-type buyers and I think increasingly you're going to have &#x2013; you know, them be competitors &#x2013; not co-sharing, they will be competitors and I think probably, a channel is right to say if I'm going to pay a lot of money for Modern Family, I want to buy enough rights that it's not showing up on a competing platform. At least I know what it is for adjusting my value. I think for us as a buyer, because we are a buyer as well on FX, I would not be buying reruns syndication rights to an expensive piece of programming and letting it go reside on Netflix for 20 million homes.</p>
          <p>I think that's &#x2013; the place they reside is &#x2013; you know, I think how I look at it, what we have to make sure is that we are getting fair value for our product. We shouldn't be selling it cheap. But I think at times people have sold their product cheap. I think the STARZ deal with Netflix is probably the ultimate example of product being sold beyond cheap. I think if we can get fair value, you know, for our product, they are another buyer for our product, another medium for our product and you may have sort of you merge for library values or you have cable channels, syndication and digital networks that are competing for these rights. And I think the buyers of those rights have to shake out.</p>
          <p>I know where we are a buyer on the FX side, I know how we'll approach it, and I think we will certainly look at all of those distribution platforms and adjust what we're willing to bid or what we're willing to bid on, and what we're willing to pay, based on where it's being distributed. So I'm &#x2013; I mean, I think that's how I look at it. I think obviously we need to &#x2013; but I think the core is we need to make sure that we are getting fair value for our product in whatever one of these distribution channels we are dealing with.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of questions following on the technology side. When you look at doing things on the movie side with your content, in terms of early release, video on demand, or selling your content earlier in a digital window, wondering how your plans are evolving on that front.</p>
          <p>And then, two, when you talked about the strength of the RSNs, with the prospect of an NBA strike next year, how do you look at &#x2013; a) how big of an impact is basketball to the RSNs overall? And is there any plans in terms of other programming that could be shifted around? And just how are you thinking about that overall would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the movie side, I guess early windows specifically &#x2013; you know, electronic distribution, I guess, more broadly, I think it's very important for us. I think the early window, it's not 30 days. Some are 60 days, I think is &#x2013; you know, is an important opportunity for us to create something that is different experience. I think it's different than the theater, theatrical is tremendously important to us, and we need to make sure that we protect the strengths of that, but I think that window to get it properly priced, and I think it's something you will see in the short term. And certainly I think in the first half of this year, you will see people moving forward with that.</p>
          <p>I think the broader electronic distribution is equally important. I think we need to make sure &#x2013; the most attractive part of it is we can price our product and &#x2013; the price experience in a way that gets us fair value and, I mean, obviously I don't think sort of whatever short-term windows that get us a dollar rental is fair value for our product, and these electronic distribution platforms enable us to get fair -to put, appropriate pricing, fair pricing on our product and in various windows. So, I think we should be aggressively, developing these distribution platforms.</p>
          <p>RSNs, it's really tough to sort of &#x2013; you don't know if it's going to last &#x2013; a) is it going to happen, is it going to last a day? Is it going to last a month? Is it going to last what-have-you? I don't think it will last forever so you're not making &#x2013; there are limits to how much you could really make plans for something that &#x2013; probably has a realistic outside to it that isn't that long. Look, basketball is important to us, I think we try to do what we could, whether it means extra college games or things we could go after. We try to mitigate it, but we're not in these &#x2013; we hope these strikes don't happen. We hope parties reach settlements, but I think because we have so little visibility and predictability to the time, you sort of probably do what you can in the very short term to mitigate but it's tough to really make significant plans given just the nature of the uncertainty around it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Chase, when you talk about digital rights or the value of digital rights, how do you think about your current relationship with the content you sold, both TV and movies to Netflix for the streaming platform? We've heard a lot from other executives talking about the fact that old deals maybe were not done at the proper values? Is that kind of your thinking, or how do you think about how you're going to deal with Netflix, and how soon can you renegotiate with them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've been pretty judicious on what we have done with them. First, our movie product is really old. So, we are not one of the studios that has more aggressive &#x2013; I think even our TV products were pretty limited. So, yeah, I think they have grown enough, probably anybody who deals with them, probably to their credit &#x2013; to their credit, they did a deal and probably exceeded everybody's expectations on growth. So, probably very few deals you would end up saying, predicted the type of the growth they've had. So, they probably made them, good for them.</p>
          <p>But in all honesty, our deals &#x2013; we've been pretty judicious and I think we value our product highly.</p>

          <p>Great, thank you for taking my question. SKY Italia had a very strong gross and net add trends in the quarter.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, it wasn't &#x2013; there was nothing unusual in the quarter. I think we sort of talked about it in the middle of the calendar year that we had digested in the prior time a number of events, and I think we got our footing and came out with some packages and made some adjustments to the fact that we can't buy ad time and media wholesales ad time, and the like, and got our mojo back. And I think they did a good job. We got the better package. we've got the offering that should be the dominant one there.</p>
          <p>And I think they are doing good things. I expect that momentum to continue. I think the focus right now is really on growing the business. This is a country still that is not &#x2013; is still sort of a third penetrated in terms of pay. It has got a lot of growth left in the market, and we think it's important at this point in time, that sort of says where is the focus, we have to take share, and we have got to manage all the lines, but I think there's real opportunity, yeah, for us to do that. And Dave mentioned the 5 million sub milestone, but it's a big country that loves TV so we feel great about the long-term future of this business.</p>

          <p>And second, could you talk a little bit about, now that we are halfway through the year, the Myspace restructuring is in process. What do you think is embedded in your guidance, kind of a base case expectation for Myspace losses for the year? Or earnings? Thanks.</p>

          <p>And then as a second question, we keep hearing from other studios like Warner Brothers and CBS, that the TV syndication market continues to be a robust market in terms of value.

          <p>It provides opportunities, and I think the digital marketplace is going to continue to evolve, and I think, look, Hulu has created a fabulous brand. I think they have done a great job creating a great experience. They can obviously speak for themselves. I'm not going to speak too much about their strategy. I think they have developed an enormous following and set of fans, and I think they are well-positioned to continue to try to figure out how you take advantage of these emerging digital marketplaces. But, we like the dual revenue, I think it's important for them and it's built on content so it's important for us. I think what we're going to try to continue to make sure is we feel our content is being &#x2013; I will use the same phrase, properly monetized in all of those digital models, including Hulu.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess I talked about Modern Family. I guess we'd second that, given Modern Family I think, will be the highest first cycle show ever sold into the marketplace. And I think what's driving it is we have good shows. I think in this &#x2013; as people get more and more choices, I think where you get hurt is if you are sort of chopped liver in the middle. And if you've got hits, I think the value of hits is bigger than ever. If you got the NFL or American Idol or Glee, the ability &#x2013; an owner of Modern Family it's not the only show on our network, but when you have those types of shows, they have extraordinary value, importance, and power, and I think TV continues to prove itself as a sort of &#x2013; something of importance to consumers and a value to advertisers second to none. I mean, you look at the ad market today. As I said, on these national &#x2013; the broadcast or cable networks, demand from an advertising perspective is incredible.</p>
          <p>And I think it shows the power of television and importance to consumers or the power to advertisers, and if you've got hit shows that stand out in a world of 200 channels &#x2013; it's value &#x2013; sort of -</p>

I would argue today the TV experience is a much richer one and a much more rewarding one for consumers. You get choice all the time and an array of things. More ways to access the products, more technologies get put out there, so I think it's sort of &#x2013; it is a richer experience, but I think equally, you could end up saying it's, as you get more choices, the hits just become more unique and more important, but I don't know. You can probably &#x2013; could argue it from the left or the right, it's sort of a glass half full, or glass half empty kind of thing.</p>

We're in the news business, just as FOX News is news and I think &#x2013; we said it today at the launch of this. You know &#x2013; it's a news product that's taking advantage of a new technological platform, the tablet or the iPad, and I don't think you should think about it as sort of a part of our newspaper business, or as part of our television business.</p>
          <p>It's &#x2013; I think we have great expertise in news across an array of existing platforms, and this is taking advantage of that expertise in news to create a product for this new digital world. I think we should be doing with that with all of our brands and our content. I think to me that's the sweet spot for us in digital. It's not sort of &#x2013; you know &#x2013; I think there may be &#x2013; I'm not going to rule out finding things in the dot-com world. I think for us the digital play is we bring unique strengths or when we can take our brands and our expertise and our content and figure out how do you develop digital extensions or digital experiences based on the content brands that we have. And we've got fabulous ones around the world.</p>
          <p>And I think one of the great things about these digital platforms, which will get to the bat, is realistically you can create them in a whole different &#x2013; at a pretty modest level of investment and a whole different scale, because you don't have all the other things that go with it. You don't have &#x2013; compared to newspapers, you don't have paper and distribution and returns and all the rest and a lot of the infrastructure that goes with all of these &#x2013; with all of these businesses.</p>
          <p>I think they put out &#x2013; we're five hours into its launch, I'm probably not going to put a break even date -</p>

          <p>What Rupert said today, we are investing around $30 million in the first year. We have a run rate of about $500,000 a week of cost, and the breakeven obviously will depend on how we do. The leverage, obviously in this is pretty good. Can we, I guess, apps or downloads today -</p>

          <p>I have a question for Mr. Carey. You talked about retooling your businesses for a digital world. And it seems like there's a &#x2013; maybe it's not a new business, but a tweak to the existing industry practice that makes a lot of sense to me and I would just love to get your reaction. Your affiliate fees are all charged on a per household basis, which makes it expensive for people that live alone to watch television relative to families. It also sort of exposes you to piracy if you go down this authentication model where people could sort of share passwords with one another. Why &#x2013; why won't &#x2013; why wouldn't the industry sort of move to an affiliate fee per connected device and sort of make TV more affordable for singles and extract more money from families with five TVs and three iPads and also, sort of limit the piracy risk from this authentication model that's emerging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess two different questions. I mean, I think on the per device, I mean, I think actually in some degree &#x2013; I mean, if you go back to my DIRECTV days. We don't as a channel provider, but you take DIRECTV, I they do have a per device because you need a set-top box. They charge you $5 or $6 for &#x2013; and I think the cable guys now that they've moved to digital, it wasn't true in analog because you just plug it in, and they can call it a box fee or something, but there is an incremental &#x2013; there is an increment at the consumer level for whether you have one, two, three or four TVs hooked up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking more on your Cable Networks business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure there's a lot of upside in that. I guess I would say for all of us, we have a pretty good business model today, and I'm not &#x2013; and I'm not sure sort of trying to figure out how do you move the deck &#x2013; the chairs around on the deck to get to a better place. you're not going through a lot of dynamics to &#x2013; you know to get to &#x2013; roughly the same place on a different set of business models. So, I'm not sure what you &#x2013; I know what you achieve. I don't know that it makes a difference to the consumers since they're paying, so it's really just between us and distributors. You just sort of can say, I will charge you less this way, but more this way and if you get to the same place, I guess you went through a lot to get &#x2013; I'm not sure where since their business model already contains it.</p>
          <p>I think piracy is probably a different &#x2013; piracy is tremendously important for us. You talk about something like authentication, and there's no question, I think your early &#x2013; I think your early generations of &#x2013; whatever can get some traction, proper traction, will probably be imperfect at best but I think it's important to start to move and get the habit and have it &#x2013; you've got to make it user friendly and easy to sign in and use, and then figure out over time &#x2013; you close the holes and you get to better and more honest. I think people honestly &#x2013; you've got to deal with piracy and likely to create a good experience and have a fair price and people will pay a fair price.</p>
          <p>but &#x2013; you know &#x2013; I'm not sure the piracy issue &#x2013; I don't see that as part of the per &#x2013; per device because that really is dependent on the infrastructure to &#x2013; you know to deliver things and the like. I'm not sure how are you charging would address the piracy issues, but I think the piracy issue as you move to these multiple platforms, and the like is going to be something that is going to be a work in progress, but I don't think it should disturb us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen, two quick ones. Give that your international cable growth was so strong, add growth of 27% in the quarter, operating growth, profit growth of 37%, is your expectation that that too can accelerate in the second half of the year? Is there something that's going to cause that to moderate?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, now that you sit here at the midpoint of the fiscal year, is your expectation for the mix of operating income for the full year now more weighted to Cable and TV or is there something in the seasonality for the second half that &#x2013; that's left kind of your expectation for that mix relatively unchanged versus when you originally gave your guidance? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the international channels, it was strong in the first half and I'd probably say we expect it to sort of sustain largely similar strength through the through the second half. It's been strong enough. I think at this point, we are pretty happy to just keep rolling along like it's rolling.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Sorry I couldn't make it today, but I wonder if you could go back to The Daily financing for a second and clear up something. Can you say what the first year expected costs are, and how the 30 million fits in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first year's expected cost is 30 million, approximately. So, 30 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, within that, is that a half million a week?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. You have more costs in the short period of year because you've got start-up costs associated with it. You've got marketing -</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Yeah, I think I said before, I think Hulu is continuing to evolve obviously in some ways the launch of Hulu Plus is an evolution to add a new dimension to Hulu. And right now we are pretty much dealing with Hulu the same way we historically have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. So, back to Myspace, you mentioned that that company's interest may be best served with another owner. Since the company is currently under your stewardship, I wondered if you might care to comment on what kind of company might best serve Myspace's interests and visa-versa, what value Myspace could provide to a potential bidder?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I got all of that, but &#x2013; but let me try to answer it by telling you &#x2013; yeah, I'm not &#x2013; look, there's been a lot of interest because there's been some indication we are &#x2013; we are pursuing this path and we are going to consider all options that can range &#x2013; it's not just a sale, but it could be &#x2013; a sale, it could be an investor coming into it, it could be us staying in with a restructured ownership with management. We're just thinking fresh &#x2013; we think a fresh perspective would give them flexibility and opportunity to really &#x2013; get a &#x2013; a new &#x2013; new life consistent with the re-launch of the product and the &#x2013; and the right-sizing of the costs. the interest to-date has ranged from A to Z from industry players, financial players to you know &#x2013; foreign to domestic and that's without really being out there. It's sort of incoming. We're not soliciting anything at this point, but we think we'll look at all of those. I'm not going to speculate on value. We think it is &#x2013; we think it's a business that is &#x2013; has got a unique level of reach, and &#x2013; and while it's in a restructuring place has proven has put forth a path that we think has a real future to it, and that we think has an opportunity to really be something special, but we think we ought to put it in the right place to really maximize that opportunity. I think management &#x2013; the senior management there is excited I mean, obviously it's been a lot of challenges for them, but I think really believe that they can do something special.</p>
          <p>But I think there's the interest sort of ranges from A to Z.</p>
