          <p>Thank you, Geoff, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me remind you again that my comments this morning may contain forward-looking statements. Today, CIBC reported solid results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Net income was $678 million, and cash earnings per share were $1.62, or $1.75 adjusting for items of note. Return on equity for the quarter was strong at 19.9%.</p>
          <p>Turning to our business results, CIBC Retail Markets reported net income of $553 million, up 14% from a year ago. Revenue was $2.5 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2010, supported by volume growth in all of our Canadian segments. Loan losses of $279 million were down 16% from a year ago. Personal banking volume growth was solid across most lines of business including deposits, mortgages and cards. In business banking, which has been area of focus, the increased market share with funds managed growth of more 9% from a year ago. Wealth management also performed well this quarter in what continued to be a strong equity market. Revenue was up 15% from a year ago. We enjoyed strong sales and performance in our mutual fund business. Year-to-date long-term fund sales of $2.5 billion surpasses the sales record set in all of 2010 in only six months.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Retail Markets continued to invest in providing sound financial advice and greater access and choice for our clients. We introduced three new MasterCard credit cards with PayPass contactless tap-and-go functionality. We continue to expand full service banking on weekends, allowing customers to bank at over 500 branches on Sunday &#x2013; on Saturdays and 50 branches in select urban markets on Sundays. And we launched a new marketing campaign focused on deepening customer relationships by offering them more reasons to switch to CIBC for expert advice, innovative products and services as well as added convenience. David Williamson and Victor Dodig are here this morning to talk about our progress in personal and business banking, and wealth management respectively.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking also performed well this quarter, despite more challenging market conditions compared to Q1. Net income was $112 million. Excluding items of note, net income was $162 million, down $23 million from a very strong first quarter. Wholesale Banking participated in a number of significant client transactions across our capital markets, investment banking and corporate lending businesses. These included continued success in leading government bond offerings and key roles advising on merger and acquisitions, particularly in the mining sector and the IPO activity in the energy sector, demonstrating the capability of our new global energy team based in Calgary. These core client-focused businesses continue to report consistent and sustainable results, aligned with our risk appetite. Richard Nesbitt is here this morning to talk about our progress in wholesale banking.</p>
          <p>We continue to actively manage down the structured credit runoff portfolio. During the quarter we reduced our exposures by $2.4 billion, which had a positive impact on Tier 1 capital ratios of 9 basis points. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we've already taken further action that is expected to have an additional 9-basis point positive impact to the Tier 1 ratio. The current primary determinant of disposition is capital and funding characteristics. Therefore, if conditions remain unchanged we will continue to dispose of this portfolio with neutral to positive capital and funding characteristics.</p>
          <p>Our strong earnings this quarter contributed to further growth in our capital ratios. Our Tier 1 ratio increased to 14.7% from 14.3% at the end of Q1. Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 10.6% from 10.2%. Also this morning, we continued &#x2013; we announced two capital initiatives. First, we announced that we intent to seek to have our series 26, 27 and 29 convertible preferred shares treated as non-viable contingent capital under Basel III. While this announcement has no impact on our Basel II Tier-1 ratio, it improves our long-term Basel III capital ratio by filling in a portion of the non-common Basel III Tier-1 capital requirements at an attractive rate. We also announced our intention to redeem our series 30 preferred shares. The effect of this redemption is expected to be accretive to earnings by about $0.03 per year. CIBC continues to be well capitalized to support growth in our core businesses and assess market opportunities, with a focus on Canada. Our Q2 pro forma Basel III common equity ratio is estimated at 7.8%, exceeding the 2019 minimum standard of 7%. We believe our capital strength to position CIBC well for long-term growth and success.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn this meeting over to Kevin Glass for his financial review. Kevin?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gerry. I am going to refer to the slides that are posted on our website starting with slide five, which is a summary of results for the quarter. As Gerry mentioned, we reported strong results this quarter that were helped by lower loan losses, volume growth in CIBC retail markets and higher treasury results. And we're hurt by lower wholesale banking revenue relative to a strong prior quarter, lower retail market spreads and lower reported FirstCaribbean revenue. Earnings per share this quarter were $1.60 or $1.62 on a cash basis. As listed on the top right of the slide, our only item of note is related to structured credit run-off and totaled $0.13 per share. I'll provide more details on this in a few moments. Our cash EPS excluding this item was $1.75, which while down from the prior quarter was well up from the second quarter last year. As Gerry mentioned, our capital position continues to strengthen, and as you can see on the slide, we finished the quarter in a very strong position. Slide six provides a summarized statement of operations on a reported basis, showing net income for the quarter of $678 million.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to our business results starting with CIBC Retail Markets on slide seven. Revenue for the quarter was $2.45 billion, up $118 million or 5% from the same quarter last year. Solid year-over-year domestic revenue growth was supported by strong market-driven growth in wealth management and by volume growth in personal and business banking. Looking at the results of the specific business lines on this slide, personal banking revenue of $1.6 billion was up $60 million or 4% from the same quarter last year due to solid volume growth in most products including the acquired MasterCard portfolio and higher fees, partially offset by narrower spreads on lending products.</p>
          <p>Business banking revenue of $337 million was up $13 million or 4% from the same quarter last year with strong volume growth of 9%, partially offset by narrower spreads. Wealth management revenue of $397 million was up $52 million or 15% from the same quarter last year due to higher asset values and trading volumes.</p>
          <p>FirstCaribbean revenue, as reported in CIBC's consolidated statements, was $116 million, down $49 million or 30% relative to the prior-year quarter. This is primarily due to lower gains on sales of securities and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, which negatively affected both the value translated results as well as the accounting for certain available for-sale securities which did not qualify for hedge accounting under Canadian GAAP. Excluding these items, FirstCaribbean results were actually in line with both the prior-year quarter and previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Other revenue was up $42 million, primarily due to higher treasury allocations. As part of our recent treasury activities, we've taken advantage of favorable market opportunities and accelerated our term funding. A consequence of taking this action is larger liquid assets on the balance sheet and higher funding costs, which are primarily allocated to retail markets. Had we not accelerated this funding, our treasury allocation to retail would have been higher.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide eight, net income this quarter from CIBC Retail Markets was $553 million, up $66 million or 14% from the same quarter last year. Revenue was up $118 million for the reasons previously discussed. Provision for credit losses at $379 million was down $54 million from the same quarter last year as a result of improved economic conditions. Tom Woods will discuss credit quality in his remarks. Non-interest expenses were $1.4 billion, up $89 million or 7% from the second quarter last year. This was primarily due to increases in performance-based compensation, higher pension expenses, the impact of HST and higher servicing fees related to the acquired MasterCard portfolio.</p>
          <p>Retail margins were down 6 basis points versus the prior quarter, largely due to mix, much of which was caused by seasonal declining cards balances as well as the effects of more competitive pricing in mortgages and lending. We expect that near-term margins will continue to be pressured by competitive rate. Given the recent organizational announcement to separate the management of CIBC Wealth Management and FirstCaribbean from CIBC Retail Markets, we expect to commence reporting on a revised basis beginning next quarter. We are currently finalizing our disclosure, but in any event we do anticipate reporting Wealth Management as a separate segment.</p>
          <p>Turning to Wholesale Banking on slide nine, revenue this quarter was $393 million, down $78 million or 17% compared to a strong prior-quarter. Excluding items of note from both the current and prior quarter, wholesale banking revenue was $441 million, down $80 million or 15%. During the second quarter, our core wholesale banking business of capital markets and corporate and investment banking revenue was $452 million, down $48 million or 10% compared to the first quarter of 2011. The main drivers for this decrease were reduced market activity, which lowered revenues in both our advisory and equity issuance businesses; and lower merchant banking revenue. In the other segment, we had a loss of $14 million, primarily due to credit valuation charges in the current quarter compared with reversals in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, Wholesale Banking net income was $112 million this quarter, down $24 million from the prior quarter. Revenue was down $78 million from the first quarter for the reasons previously noted. Credit quality continues to remain strong with the provision for credit losses of $1 million this quarter. Non-interest expenses were $271 million, down $32 million from the prior quarter, mainly due to lower performance-based compensation. Excluding all items of note, net income for this quarter was $162 million, down $23 million from the prior quarter on a same basis.</p>
          <p>This next slide summarizes our structured credit run-off results. We had a pre-tax loss of $70 million this quarter versus a loss of $68 million last quarter. Starting with row one, here we had a decreased in the CVA resulting from improvements and changes in the underlying value of holdings hedged by financial guarantors. On row two, we had a loss of $57 million on purchase credit derivatives that are mark-to-market and which hedge loans which are carried at amortized cost. This is largely a timing issue and there was a loss this quarter due to improvement in the market value of the underlying loans. On row three, we had a loss of $19 million, resulting from the sale of securities and termination of written protection totaling $1.2 billion as well as terminating $900 million of purchase protection. This resulted in a total reduction in notionals of approximately $2.1 billion and lower capital requirements resulting, as Gerry mentioned, in a net positive impact on our Tier 1 ratio. Loss on row four represents a net effect of gains and losses on unhedged positions as well as interest and expenses.</p>
          <p>Subsequent to the year-end, we sold certain securities positions, terminated unmatched protection purchased from financial guarantors and agreed in principle to sell the residual value of the USRMM positions hedged by the limited recourse note. These transactions are expected to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $24 million and lower regulatory capital requirements for a net positive impact on our Tier 1 ratio of approximately 9 basis points.</p>
          <p>In summary, our second quarter results were strong. Compared to the second quarter of last year, we experienced strong revenue growth in our Canadian Retail Banking business and compared to a strong prior quarter our Wholesale Banking results declined in line with market conditions. This business continues to deliver steady and risk-controlled performance as a result of our client-driven strategy. During the quarter, we continued to have good loan loss experience and our capital position continues to strengthen.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention, and I would now like to turn the meeting over to Tom Woods.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everybody. With respect to credit risk on slide 18, specific loan loss provisions in Q2 were $210 million, down $16 million versus Q1. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to lower write-offs and bankruptcies in the credit card and personal lending portfolios and the favorable impact from the credit card securitization that took place in Q1. This was partially offset by higher losses in the MasterCard portfolio we acquired from Citicorp in Q4 2010. You will recall that we acquired only non-delinquent accounts. New delinquencies are occurring as expected and have rolled through to write-off for the first time this quarter.</p>
          <p>General loan losses were a recovery of $16 million, similar to the prior quarter. The reversals in the business and government and personal portfolios were partially offset by an increase in provisions in the credit card portfolio. Gross impaired loans were down $87 million in Q2 for two reasons. First, new formations were down for the seventh consecutive quarter; and second the amount of loans returning to performing status was higher.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, our cards portfolio loss rate in Q2 was 4.8% versus 4.5% last quarter and the peak of 7.1% in Q3 2009. Losses were up $3 million versus Q1, as expected, due to the MasterCard portfolio. On slide 20, our U.S. Real Estate Finance business has CAD1.9 billion of net drawn exposures and CAD699 million of undrawn exposure. In Q2, we took loan loss provisions of CAD4 million, down from CAD5 million in Q1. We had CAD170 million of net impaired loans in this portfolio. Losses have trended down now for the four consecutive &#x2013; successive quarters. The outlook for losses in fiscal 2011 continues to be positive. However, we could see a slightly higher loan loss rate in the rest of the year. Our U.S. leverage finance run-off loan book has CAD167 million in net drawn exposures and CAD211 million in undrawns. There were net recovers of CAD1 million in Q2 in this portfolio. Our European leverage finance run-off book has CAD476 million in net drawn exposures and CAD104 million in undrawns. In Q2, there were net recoveries of CAD2 million in this portfolio. The outlook for losses in both leveraged finance run-off portfolios continues to be positive.</p>
          <p>Turning to market risk on slide 22, it shows the Q2 distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios. In all but three trading days in Q2 where 95% of the time we had positive results.</p>
          <p>Slide 23, as Gerry said, our Tier 1 ratio was 14.7% in Q2, up 40 basis points from 14.3% at the end of Q1. Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 10.6%, up from 10.2% last quarter. The higher Tier 1 ratio was mainly due to earnings net of dividends, equity issued in our dividend reinvestment plan and a decrease in risk weighted assets. Basel III guidelines will be effective starting January 1, 2013. CIBC is well positioned for the Basel III transition. Our pro forma Basel III common equity ratio as at April 30, 2011 is 7.8% exceeding today, the announced Basel III 2019 minimum requirement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just want to talk about commercial lending. The balances were up over 4% on a linked-quarter basis, but you're also talking about pressure on spreads. Can you give me a sense of what your strategy is there, if you're taking some lower spreads in order to gain market share, which appears to be the case? And then on the capital front, could you &#x2013; I mean it's encouraging to see your disclosure on Basel III, the non-viable or contingent capital stuff, I guess to about 1% contingent capital, if you will, ratio. Is that &#x2013; how should we look at your capital structure on a pro forma basis? Are you going to manage to a 7% core Tier I and then have 3% non-VCC or something along those lines? And then also, do you have any further plans to reduce your preferred share capital base? There is a lot of &#x2013; basically, one of your peers did was targeted rate reset preferreds, I was wondering if you're going to adopt a similar strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Gerry here. We'll take two and three first and then David will handle number one. On &#x2013; I think the questions were &#x2013; you're interested Basel III positioning and then you're interested in our intent as to our existing non-common Tier 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Basel positioning, first of all the NVCC we think has a value in the area of 70 basis points in terms of a contribution to what will be the new Tier 1 under Basel III. So &#x2013; and if you want a little briefing on the calculation of that we can make someone available to you after the call. So I think that's part one. Part two is that today we took action to indicate redemption of our Series 30. In our schedule of other preferreds, there are preferreds coming up for redemption dates, some of them at slight premiums to par depending on the timing. And in general, our intention is to look very closely as we get to those redemption dates to exercising our right or redemption. These securities are still qualified under Basel II and do have a phase-out period under Basel III. So I wouldn't say that &#x2013; I don't want to notify you in advance. There is always uncertainty around these matters. But in general, if conditions remain the same and there were no surprises, we will be looking very closely at exercising the redemption rights that you see in the schedule of all of our Tier 1 &#x2013; excuse me, non-qualified for Basel III Tier 1 securities. That's part one. Part two is that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just pause you before the part &#x2013; oh, sorry, part 2 and not the commercial stuff but the &#x2013; just on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No part two on this is that it is possible that at a future date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...we would look at purchase of securities in the marketplace. You have seen that certain other of our peers in the banking industry have looked at that. So that's always a possibility, and I did want to make clear that whatever the means, the reality is that we have a tremendous excess of Tier 1 under Basel II and other than what we've converted today through this NVCC security, which we're very pleased with, the rest of it under Basel III subject to the phase-out period is not useful to us from a core capital level, so whatever method we can find to reduce that unnecessary excess that we will be pursing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to clarify, how do you see capital structure, 7% core Tier 1 &#x2013; minimum you're going to manage to in non-common Tier 1, what kind or ratio are you looking for there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I want to emphasize that the new Basel III regime only starts in 2013 and then there are phase-in periods that allow a variety of the elements of the final 2019 to be phased in over the intervening period. And so, that's &#x2013; the first thing is that we're not there yet. So when one talks about what one might have as targets that could be different than the regulatory requirement, I think it's a bit premature to get there now because we are not even in the period. So to try to get to what's required in 2019 early and then to have targets above that at this point I think is a bit early from viewpoint of establishing that. However, I would say that when we do come to that period of time, we would be looking at qualifying and we've been trying as much as possible to qualify in 2013 for the 2019 requirements, which we think is way at the upper end of best practices. Part one and part two, we would be looking at when you're trying to stay above these levels you do require some differential in order to manage from quarter-to-quarter. So it is reasonable to assume that we would have some form of internal target that would be above what the regulators would have out there. Lastly I would say some of this I think is still subject to change at a regulatory level. There is a lot more clarity now than there was recently, but it is possible there will be further development regulatorily. There is still the discussion around strategically important financial institutions as opposed to globally strategically important financial institutions that is taking place, and we really do need to see the outcome of that before we would give you much further indication as to the size of such buffers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gerry. Yes so the question on commercial lending volume growth and the recognition that there is pressure on spread, so couple of points I'd make there; one is in commercial banking I think some of the key factors have allowed us to get some traction on our volume growth. We brought in a new leadership for this space sometime ago and then beyond that we deepened the team and then after that changed the sales team structure with the intent of just putting more focus on this spectrum of borrower and make sure that we were giving it due attention and had our sales team structured in a way that we're more focused on the need of this customer group. And I think that's allowed us to get some traction in this space &#x2013; in the commercial lending space.</p>
          <p>Now with respect to rates, in actual fact we increased our lending rates during the '08, '09 timeframe. So we had our &#x2013; actually took action to improve our structure for sales but actually took action to increase lending rates. But what we're seeing now, as you identified, is some give-back in that space, competitive pressure in the lending space is increased right now and there is some give-back on the lending spreads. In addition, on the deposit side in a lower interest rate environment as rates continue to decline, it just puts pressure on the spreads we're getting on business deposits, which also affects the overall spreads in the sector. So overall, I'd like to believe that some of our actions on the team and our sales structure is helping us to get traction on volumes and the current environment is putting some pressure on spreads.</p>

          <p>Thanks, just a question, Gerry, on these conversion of the pref shares to NVCC; do you expect to do that given the current coupon? Are you going to have to &#x2013; dividend rate, are you going to have to change that?

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gerry. Good morning, John. I guess first thing to answer your question about the dividend rate; we're not changing the dividend rate or any of the other substantive terms of the securities. All we have done in respect of the qualification of these securities as NVCC instruments is to, in the first part, undertake to OSFI to convert them, if as and when there is a finding of non-viability. Second, we've also undertaken through this <mark type="ph" /> D-Pol (30:17) mechanism to tell the holders of the securities that we will not covert the shares to common except in the circumstances where there's a finding of non-viability. So as a result, all we've done is narrow down the circumstances that can cause these preferred shares to be converted. That's the only changes we're making.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And &#x2013; okay. I'll ask more questions off line. Just a question for David Williamson; we've seen spreads narrow at a couple of your competitors domestically now. What is your outlook for spreads generally? Can spreads stay where they are even if there is no increase in Bank of Canada interest rates or is this just an anomaly this quarter and spreads aren't that bad? Could you give us an update on the outlook for spreads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll be happy to. Yeah, so when we look at what's happened quarter-over-quarter that's kind of jumping off point for us, so we're down 6 basis points in NIMs. A couple of factors there, one is mix of our businesses and partly that's driven by seasonality. And then the other factor is just the &#x2013; what I was speaking about before with commercial lending, and it was broader than just commercial lending; the competitive forces right now in lending broadly and in mortgages is fairly strong. So looking forward, our plan is for NIMs to stabilize and be relatively flat, but it's going to be somewhat dependent on the degree of the competitive pressure in the marketplace. And then the other thing you touched on, John, it's just also the impact of declining interest rates, what that has on our deposit balances, that's another factor, which again no crystal ball on that as where that will guide us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the forecast of flat spreads remains, but it is more sensitive to competitive issues that have emerged over the last three months than you would have said three months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly right &#x2013; yeah, that's exactly right. The other thing I'd touch on is something that Kevin put in his remarks, just our funding costs, we did some advanced funding and there are some extra costs associated with that to the extent that, that has a impact on NIMs. That's something that would drift away as we don't pre-fund. That was one impact that Kevin referred to. But I think big picture, you've got absolutely right. The pressures in the market over the last few months have just caused us to tweak that expectation of flat NIMs a bit to say let's see how competitive the market remains over next little while.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You're generating a lot of capital and your capital ratios are increasing, but your earnings are still too low to increase the dividend. So I've got two related questions; first, remind us your pay-out objective and where earnings would have to get to before the dividend would likely increase? And second, what are you going to do with &#x2013; otherwise with the capital that you're generating? And then I've got a couple of other questions, if I can, after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, Michael, it's Gerry. Our payout range is targeting to have a dividend between 40% to 50% of our earnings, and if you look at it now we're at the upper end of that range. Last quarter we were within the range. And so, the first thing I would say is if one looks at it literally, as we work our way into the range, in theory we're eligible for a dividend increase. However, I would say that the idea of hovering around 50% is not what our practice has been in the past. Generally, what we've tried to do is take dividend action as we work our way down the range and the reason for that is because we're at a certain point in the recovery cycle today where we would target to move to the lower end of the range so that you're given more room when you get back into a slower environment or recessionary environment. So 40% to 50%, we are at the top end of the range and historically we've &#x2013; and I don't see at this time yet a reason to vary from how we operated in the past. Generally we would try to work our way down the range a bit here in order to hit our target of high, high confidence around sustainability, that's part one.</p>
          <p>The second part was I think, given the capital buildup, which is going quite well, your question is about what we intent to do with the capital. We do intent to take my first set of statements here and the &#x2013; continuously examining that dividend in light of do we &#x2013; are we in an environment where we have a lot more capital building up than we did in the past, which would be one reason to vary somewhat from our practice of working our way well down into the range of 40% to 50%. So, it's possible that we could move a little earlier than we have in the past because of the excess capital. We haven't operationalized that yet because there is too many things changing and that continue to change in terms of the requirements for Basel III. And I would emphasize again that while much of the frameworks of Basel III are on the table, our view is that there's still sufficient question marks out there. And I've said before, this whole concept of strategically important financial institutions and &#x2013; globally strategically important financial institution does leave the possibility that there will be globally further overlays coming in terms of capital requirement. Our intention to be at the forefront of compliance so that you will be able to continuously question us about an excess is where we're at today. We want to make that we have in excess and that we have in excess when the rules or if the rules become more strict.</p>
          <p>So that is the main part of my dividend answer and my capital answer. The only thing on the capital side is &#x2013; I would emphasize is we have a tremendous amount of latitude and intention, subject to what I said earlier on about changing conditions and all that to deal with our non-common Tier 1 equity that we have today, under Basel II we have an excess, under Basel III these things don't count. And so, they do have a phase-out that operates all the way through the 2019. We really would like to, as I say, basically eliminate the overhang of that capital as rapidly as possible because that fits every scenario that has been presented so far as a way to improve earnings and yet to continue to advance as being the strongest bank from a capital viewpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow-up on one thing? When you talk about possible moving sooner than you would perhaps more normally do, could we consider possibilities such as buyback or special dividend as potential options?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x2013; on buyback I would say at this time, that is the &#x2013; least likely because of everything I said about the changing rules and the evolving rules around Basel III. We really wouldn't want to get into buying back until there is absolute clarity there and we really knew that we had an excess that we are buying back with because again one of our key objectives here is that when you're looking at CIBC and you're saying, here is all this stuff that's going to happen between now and 2019 and we can &#x2013; you can look at us and say, well, wait a minute, they're compliant across the board, therefore everything that comes in is available for this discussion.</p>
          <p>We're just not sure that if we're buying back capital today, it actually was capital that was available for buyback. It might be available now, but if you've got to use it in 2014 or &#x2013; excuse me, come up with it in 2014, our view is that we would very much want to clear the visibility for you on we're compliant, what comes in of earnings, pays the dividend and the rest of it is available for the business and does not have to be sidelined in order to comply with these new standards. So that's our primary objective, the visibility around that. And we are there now. We do comply. We're being cautious because we think it's possible there are other restrictions coming in Basel III. We don't know that for a fact, but there are enough discussions going on globally that the possibility is fairly strong.</p>
          <p>On the special dividend, that would have &#x2013; and I mean &#x2013; now I'm working through the logic of this, it has much less of an impact in terms of the whole reason why I said buybacks are at the bottom of the list for the moment. I have in the past mused that there are interesting characteristics to special dividend that fits scenarios where you have a transparent determined excess of capital, but you might not be where you want to be in a payout ratio. And I would say that those remarks, I still think from a technical viewpoint, are quite accurate and do fit the scenario that we have today. However, all the things I said earlier on about Basel III, changing regulation, creating visibility would say that it is unlikely that we would act in that fashion at the moment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's one other thing that we are still looking at. As you know, we now have an international segment, so what we would potentially look at is putting it together with our other international operations. And a lot of that is Retail, so we haven't decided yet whether or not it stays in Retail. Another potential option I guess would be to put in corporate and other. It's not big enough to stand on its own. So we wouldn't &#x2013; we surely wouldn't show it as a separate segment. So it's more a case of where we decide to include it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I'm wondering if we could just go back to the discussion on pre-funding, and I'm just looking for a little bit more color on what exactly it was that you did, how much did it hurt the quarter in terms of impact on net interest income and more importantly perhaps, how much will it help your margin on a go-forward basis? Any color on that would be helpful I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's Kevin Glass, I'll take that. I think as far as accelerated term funding is concerned, these higher external funding costs are primarily allocated to Retail. And so the &#x2013; the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:00) impact for the current quarter was we estimated approximately $10 million. To the extent we slow our funding plans forward or have different opportunity, that will obviously &#x2013; opportunities rather, that will obviously impact what the future looks like. And our capital group and businesses are still taking a looking at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, this is top of the house $10 million or just $10 million to Retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's $10 million to retail and that's on an after-tax basis; 90% of that &#x2013; or that represents 90% of the top of the house number because that gets allocated out of treasury, 90% of which goes to Retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and how does it help your margin in future periods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to the extent we can deploy those in high yielding assets, obviously that would help margins. We pre-fund it, so we got at very good rates, but to the extent we don't have to replace with higher, more expensive debt in the future, that's going to help us in the longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And maybe just a couple of numbers questions as well. When I look at your supplemental, the &#x2013; couple of things really stick out, one is card fees really came into at a brand new low and securitization &#x2013; income from securitized assets was up quite big. I wonder if you can just touch on those, if you could?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I know the two &#x2013; they're directly related. So at the end of last quarter, we did a significant cost securitization, if you remember it was about $1.7 billion that was for internal capital management. And as a result of that, our &#x2013; it had no economic impact to the bottom line but our securitization income is up and card fees would be down. So it's between those two lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Brad Smith from Stonecap Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks very much. My question relates also to the capital. I'm not sure who I should direct it to, Gerry, perhaps you. The discussion that just preceded here talking about excess capital and how you might deal with that, I found intriguing. And I appreciate that your Tier 1 ratio is quite high on both the current and the proposed Basel. My question really relates to the leverage of this bank. The assets to common equity ratio increased to just under 29 times in the latest quarter and that was up from just under 28 in the previous quarter. The Basel III proposals, as I understand them, are going to include a companion leverage calculation, which does not incorporate the consideration of risk weighted asset assessment. I was just wondering how that &#x2013; how the bank is viewing that companion leverage calculation and how that might impact the bank. The &#x2013; if I look at the risk-weighted assets assessment, it's come down about 11% since mid-2009 and at the same time the actual asset on the balance sheet has gone up by an equivalent quantum. So that mathematically explains the change quite clearly in the risk and the risk ratio, but it still leaves the bank with a very high &#x2013; I would say, on a global basis probably one of the higher leverage ratios. Can you just offer some insights into that and how that might affect your willingness to buyback stock or otherwise distribute capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's two &#x2013; and I'm going to add &#x2013; for more numbers I'm going to turn it over to Andrew Kriegler in a second, but I do want to say, I would take two approaches to that. Number one is, as Andrew is going to lay out for you, we're actually quite comfortable with our leverage position and there are elements of why it is up now that we've selected to do for at the moment. As these new rules come in, we have high control over dialing that down and it has to do with some of the things that have been discussed here today about funding levels and the inventory of pre-funded term debt that we have today and how we run that off. So number one we feel fine about our leverage ratio today and in the future because the nature of that build-up you're talking about is highly controllable and there is a lot of it that is this pre-funded term that ends up being placed overnight and there is a lot of mechanics to it. Andrew will fill you in a little more on that.</p>
          <p>However, part two on this is, on a planning basis strategically, we feel that we're in a very good shape in terms of the various elements of balance sheet, as I've laid out. We are looking at a lot of our activities through the Basel III lens at this time and the Basel II lens. And that's why in my remarks I talked about some discontinued businesses and the fact that we're vigorously pursuing eliminating positions in those because we're finding very often that you might have a P&amp;L that's negative on it, but a pretty big positive capital impact under the new world. And now that liquidity is in there in the market, and I'm not talking about the structured credit side, we're able to free up a lot of capital as we roll through eliminating those securities and we're probably &#x2013; I just want to say we're becoming a little more aggressive in that department as the liquidity is there and there is willingness to take paper losses &#x2013; not paper losses, actually to realize a loss on these securities when it's highly accretive from a capital viewpoint. As we eliminate those securities, it also brings down the leverage ratio and you're not seeing it in there because of the funding, but there is a steady quarter-after-quarter decline in the usage of our leverage and capital as a result of the elimination of positions in our legacy book structure credit. That's important because it's also releasing term funding. Right now you're seeing that contributing to the backup in term funding and &#x2013; because we don't necessarily have securities that are maturing right away or places to put the money. But as you utilize over time the resources that are freed as a result of these activities, you find you're your leverage ratio moderates because there is a redundancy right now that's taking place as a result of pre-funding term debt and the releasing term funding when you eliminate positions that were term funded.</p>
          <p>So the reason why I'm giving you this second part of the equation is we get an advantage that is higher than it was in the past under the new regime by aggressively eliminating our structured credit book and it is a path that we are on and we have been on it all the time. But the conditions liquidity-wise are much better and the conditions in terms of how capital is affected are much better in terms of eliminating these positions. Therefore, we are far more inclined to take an accounting P&amp;L loss in order to generate the freeing up of balance sheet from a viewpoint of leverage but also from a viewpoint of capital. So as to our current picture and why the leverage ratio is highly controllable, I'll turn it over to Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Just before you do that, I was just &#x2013; I mean can you understand how it's a bit confusing for someone like myself to hear you securitizing credit card balances at the end of the prior quarter for capital management purposes, being willing to take a realized loss on a book that will eventually I think in your expectations run off without a loss in order to improve your capital position and at the same we're talking about how you're going to deal with an apparent excess capital position. I just &#x2013; I'm not sure how you can square those two sort of understandings and discussions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that was a lot in one shot. Kevin was making vigorous notes. He writes faster than I, so I'll give him first crack at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of the securitization, from a capital point of view it was the effective way for us to do an internal transaction to move funding which &#x2013; so it wasn't a capital leverage issue, it was just internal transaction to manage funding. And Andrew can cover that in a bit more detail in his comments. I just wanted to stress that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Andrew will go through nooks and crannies of this a little more, but there is &#x2013; a very consistent thread here is that we are engaged in activities that are in businesses where we have capital tied up. We want to liquidate in order to get at the capital. If there's funding &#x2013; term funding tied up there, we want to liquidate in order to get at that. We want to deploy that into businesses where we can use it to generate profitable returns and service our clients. And right now we're finding that we're able to generate capital both from those activities and earnings much faster than we're able to use it, and we think that is actually a good thing for the moment, given the changing standards. Andrew will give you a little bit more of the math on some of these things. Andrew?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Gerry. So just to pick up the point that Kevin made a moment ago in respect of the securitization that was done at the end of the last quarter, that was done to be clear for internal capital management purposes, that is to say the relative legal entity capital of the various subsidiaries that we have, it didn't affect the consolidated numbers. Second, in respect of Basel III leverage &#x2013; well, actually let me backup for a second. As you can see from our disclosure, we're well within the asset to capital multiple limits that exist today under the Basel II regime. Basel III leverage, which is a 3% leverage ratio rather than an assets to capital multiple, doesn't come in for a number of years to come. Having said that, we do monitor where we believe we will be should that regime come into place today, and we feel comfortable that we will be not constrained by that leverage ratio over the coming years.</p>
          <p>In terms of the detail about this quarter's movements, there is a couple of things I can point you to, and I'd emphasize that there is some short-term variability in the size of the balance sheet movements related to a couple of things that have already been highlighted on the call. One of those is the degree of prefunding that we did and another is the degree to which short-term balances come on to the balance sheet can be deposited, for example, in securities positions or in deposits with central banks that cause the size of balance sheet and therefore the leverage ratio to move up and down over short periods of time. That is not indicative of sort of a systematic increase in the bank's leverage over the long period. As I say, we feel fairly comfortable that we will not be constrained by either Basel II leverage or Basel III leverage over the long-term.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's sort of difficult to understand how CIBC's margins or NIM in the various segments move around and even from a total bank basis because disclosure isn't quite the same as we get from some of the other bank. So perhaps Kevin or maybe even &#x2013; or perhaps someone else, if you could talk about what happened to the retail NIM this quarter. And maybe on a total bank basis, we all have our own ways of looking at total bank margin, it seems to have come in a lot and it make sense given the increase in liquidities in the quarter. Could you talk about what happened to the all-bank margin, perhaps excluding trading, and what happened in Retail? I'm trying to understand where the pressure really was this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mario, it's Kevin. I'll hand over to David at this end of this for Retail, but as we said, that's market-driven as well as some seasonal mix issues driven by seasonally low credit card balances and that was about 6 basis points. But if we look at overall margins bank-wide, there were a number of issues that didn't really impact the economics of the bank but they did have a negative impact on NIMs. So, one of the things that Andrew alluded to and we'd spoken about is funding opportunities. So as a result of pre-funding, this significantly increased our liquid asset balance &#x2013; balances and you'll see it on the balance sheet when you take a look at it, and that had an about 8 basis points, I would say, impact on bank-wide NIMs.</p>
          <p>The other thing to take into account is, if you look at the previous quarter we actually had some interest income on tax reassessments. So it wasn't massive but all of these things add up and that also had a couple of basis points impact on bank-wide NIMs. The securitization that we spoke about earlier, the cost securitization that was about $1.7 billion. Again, it didn't impact the bottom line of the bank. There was a swing between NII and securitization income. So what that does is it makes it looks like our bank-wide NIMs are compressed and that had about a 4-basis point impact. So if you add all of those up, that's what really had taken our &#x2013; if you look at bank-wide the NIM down from we say around 2.8 &#x2013; 2.08 down to about 1.94, 1.95.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the math you're coming up with then is about 14 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Around that, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is very similar to the 14 basis points I'm calculating as well, although I probably have &#x2013; I'm doing it a slightly different way but it's essentially the same delta. You're suggesting then that delta is accounted for by the pre-funding and it certainly makes sense because the pre-funding was 8 on its own, the securitization four &#x2013; there's 12 there plus a little bit &#x2013; plus a few other things. So that's essentially what causes that 14 basis points delta. The question then is, how soon would you expect to regain that 14 basis points or is that not really the way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can certainly talk about it, right. So some of it, you're not going to regain because the delta, for example, on the interest, some of the smaller issues like the interest income on tax reassessments, I mean that's come and gone and we'll bank the money but that NIM isn't coming back. If you look at the securitization, that's here to stay for a while. So, we're not going to see that coming back, but again that doesn't have an economic impact. So, that's not an issue for us. Retail NIMs, I'll let David chat to &#x2013; talk to that for a little bit. And then the funding, over time we do expect to pick that up. It's just a question of time, how we're going to deploy that and how we're going to actually use that &#x2013; the funds that were raised.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Kevin, are you saying that's as much as $15 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are actually two things that happened. Andrew alluded to some short-term borrowing opportunities. There were some extremely low rates that we took advantage of and that we could place with central banks and other spots. That wasn't particularly profitable, but it did give us a bit of pickup on the bottom line. But again, that significantly increased the balance sheet. So that had a negative impact on NIMs. The other element of it is actual pre-funding, as part of our funding plan. So if you look at from the beginning of the year, this quarter was about $15 billion, beginning at the year it's about $25 billion. It's about a 50-50 split between the two of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, David, perhaps on the Retail side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So a bit of a simpler story there, it's two dynamics. So, one is quarter-over-quarter mix. So mix is, I'm going to refer to the seasonality of things, cards outstandings were down about 1.5% from last quarter and obviously cards are a higher NIM product. So that's one of the mix factors that are causing NIMs to be off. Now there's two things that that could be, one for sure is seasonality. First quarter has the holiday season in it and now our customers are paying off their balances and that's going to be the &#x2013; I would think the bulk of it. Potentially some of that could be just consumers moderating and delevering, but further evidence that it's seasonal is that the April outstandings were up above the January and February outstandings, so that would indicate that's there is that seasonal element to it which would imply that part should come back. And the other bit is just what we spoke of before, which is the marketplace right now on lending and mortgages is competitive and that part &#x2013; we'll see just how plays out over the next while. In the fullness of time one would expect the NIMs will flatten out. Just we'll have to see what the competitive marketplace is. So those are the things.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I understand those changes, those are the ones you've talked about before. What I was trying to get at here was the delta, how much margins actually came in, in the quarter in Retail?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. I'll try and keep it brief this one is probably for Tom Woods. Tom in your newly acquired MasterCard portfolio, if I look at the results of the securitization conduit for that book, is that a reasonable comparison for what is happening on balance sheet for CIBC? Let me start with that one first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No the &#x2013; it's a bit technical but just as a refresher for some others, we took this book on in August of last year and there were no delinquent accounts. So there is no delinquent accounts in the securitization, no delinquent accounts on our book. So those are the same. Delinquencies then started, as you'd expect, and in February that was the 180-day mark when they rolled through to write-off. So we had &#x2013; and you're seeing this month-by-month in the securitization releases. Zero in September building up to I think a little over 9% in March. So that would, for the most part, be similar to what's on our books. And this is where it gets technical. Because the cards are still on the Citicorp system until probably August, September, the accounting is somewhat different. So we're front-ending probably 3%, 3.5% in that 9%, okay, and you're seeing that on our books as well, but we've had questions about is it apples-to-apples with your core and that really isn't. It's about 3 points different and that will come back over time.</p>
          <p>The other thing to keep in mind is this portfolio is very similar to our class &#x2013; CIBC Classic portfolio as opposed to be Aerogold Premium. So whereas our core portfolio has a mix of Classic and Aerogold and hence a lower rate, and this quarter it was about like 4.8% consolidated, when you see a 9% number and you ask why is it 9%, I think you have to think about it being about 6% and then recognize that it's entirely Classic. So bottom line is it's a bit apples and oranges, but it's performing in line with our expectations. You could see over April, May a slight further pick-up and we'd expect that to come back as higher recoveries occur because of the front-ended nature of this accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just the bottom line, and from my perspective, if I go back to your Investor Day in the fall, I think the commentary around that book was you'd expect the loss rate on the portfolio you'd picked up to be not more than, say, 100 to 200 basis points higher than the legacy CIBC book. Is still &#x2013; is that still the appropriate level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah when you adjust for the accounting and when you adjust for the fact that the mix is different, okay, I'd probably say 150 basis points to 200 basis points. I mean, if you look at our combined 4.8% and you accept my analysis of the 9% being kind of like 6%, you're about 100 basis points now and that'll little probably tick up another 50 basis points or so over the next two months, maybe 100 basis points.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Andr&#xE9; Hardy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And just to clarify on your last answer, Tom; the 9% is more like a 6% but are you going to have recoveries once the cards are now on your systems? And then related to the systems conversion, how much do you expect in annual savings from moving from the Citi system to the CIBC system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take it into two parts. Part one, and this is where it gets technical, Andr&#xE9;, and I can take you through this off-line. There is three main accounting differences which mean the delinquents &#x2013; the reported delinquencies are higher, but because of that accounting difference the expected recoveries or account that ultimately will payoff as opposed to will default, will be higher as well. So that will tick back over time. And in fact we're already seeing in the month of March and we &#x2013; the preliminary April numbers show the delinquency numbers are coming back. So the short answer is yes, that will come back in the form of higher accounting recoveries.</p>
          <p>I don't know, is there anyone that can comment on that cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the cost savings will be, not necessarily a massive number, it's part of the $3 billion plan that we would have outlined before. We're on track to do the conversion, as Tom said, August, September time line. We'll get into our &#x2013; on to our platform and things are tracking actually on the transaction itself, whether it's balances, revenue or <mark type="ph" /> NIAD (01:08:03) the Citi acquisition's performing better than the Board-approved plan. So we're happy with it, and the conversion itself is tracking to plan as well.</p>
