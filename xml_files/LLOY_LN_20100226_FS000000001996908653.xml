      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Win Bischoff. I'm pleased to be with you today at this, my first annual results presentation as Chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. I'd like to make some brief remarks before handing over to Eric Daniels, our Chief Executive, and Tim Tookey, our Finance Director. And my comments will cover our business, some thoughts about the banking industry, and finally, remuneration.</p>
          <p>First of all on our business, it's been a year of challenge but also one of achievement for our company. Under the strong leadership of Eric Daniels, the business has positioned itself to benefit over the next few years from a strong earnings momentum. The constantly changing economic climate, both in the U.K. and overseas over the past 12 months, has obviously presented the banking industry with some difficult challenges.</p>
          <p>However, as we move into 2010, we believe that we are well placed to benefit from the encouraging signs of economic recovery, albeit we believe the U.K. economy will grow at below trend levels over the next few years. Eric and Tim will take you through the main elements of last year's performance and share with you our strategy and guidance for the year ahead. I would like to pause briefly, however, at this point and touch on a number of issues relevant to our company and the rest of the banking sector.</p>
          <p>Last year was a particularly difficult year for the U.K. economy. GDP fell by 4.8%. As a retail and commercial bank with over 30 million customers across the U.K., we are all too well aware of the financial stresses that many households and companies are experiencing as a consequence of the economic downturn. It is, of course, a privilege to have the opportunity to serve our customers. Given our scale, with that privilege come obligations. That is why we are playing a very active part in the U.K. economy's recovery.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to note that we extended &#xA3;70 billion of new lending last year, helping many households and businesses in the process. As the country's largest private sector savings institution, we also played a commensurate part in encouraging people to rediscover the savings habit, an essential component of any economic recovery.</p>
          <p>More broadly, we were and continue to be involved in all the government schemes to encourage lending and to assist people or businesses in financial difficulties. We participate in all six of the household-related schemes as well as of the government programs helping small businesses.</p>
          <p>To the extent that banking institutions, including Lloyds, meet their obligations of service and intermediation and are responsible and proactive conduits of channeling savings into productive enterprises and households, to that extent can we hope the trust in our institutions may be reestablished. It will not happen overnight, but happen it must and it is up to us to ensure by our actions that it does. It follows that it is right and that there is thoughtful and considerate debate on the shape and structure of our industry and not simply knee-jerk reaction by the industry.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, I believe that the combined efforts of a small number of the most prominent global institutions, perhaps with two or three of the respected industry bodies, should proactively help develop proposals which are acceptable too and can be supported by regulatory authorities and governments. Such proposals could pave the way for an internationally agreed way forward removing the uncertainty and skepticism hanging over the industry, both of which act as a break on progress to the detriment of the broader economies.</p>
          <p>Let me finally say something about remuneration. We are conscious, who could not be, of the current public debate about remuneration in the banking sector. We understand that this is a sensitive issue for many people at a time when their personal finances are challenged and in the light of the significant support given by tax payers to our industry. We have thought carefully and responsibly about the design of our remuneration schemes.</p>
          <p>We are committed to maintaining the right balance between reward, risk management and performance. Specifically, we are active participants in the debate about the appropriate remuneration structures for the banking sector. We believe deferral and clawback are the way forward. These are already features of remuneration designed in the banking sector now and will be refined further, both here and abroad.</p>
          <p>More importantly and as already announced this past Monday, Eric Daniels decided to waive the bonus which the Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, had awarded him in the conviction he fully merited it. Eric took this decision since he felt the public debate about bonuses in the banking industry was in danger of obscuring the very real advances which have been achieved by our Group in terms of capital creation, quality of revenues, earnings prospects and write-offs, and integration benefits.</p>
          <p>If I can make a personal observation at this point, we must find a way whereby remuneration models and performance criteria agreed and voted upon by shareholders will be allowed to be honored without the recipient being put in a position for the sake of the company for which he has, in fact, delivered the results, to feel he should waive the award arising from them.</p>
          <p>We are, as you know, primarily a retail and commercial bank. This means that the total payout and our discretionary annual bonus schemes for 2009 will be but a very small percentage of overall revenues. All our rewards additionally are subject, where appropriate, to deferral and clawback in line with the G20 principles and as agreed with UKFI and FSA.</p>
          <p>I'd like to conclude by thanking all of our investors for their support and the faith that they have placed in our management team, which I believe is being superbly led by Eric Daniels. I want with gratitude to highlight the role government played in supporting Lloyds Banking Group and the banking sector in general during 2009, and Lloyds Banking Group more particularly during our fund raising at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>With our strength and capital foundations, we're in a much improved position to develop our business and deliver significant financial performance and value for our shareholders, not least to the tax payer, whose support is greatly appreciated. Let me now hand over to Eric Daniels.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Win. Good morning and thank you all for coming. I'll start this morning by briefly reviewing our performance for 2009 and take you through how we're positioning the Group to grow and outperform over the next several years. Tim will then provide the texture and detail behind our near term outlook and longer term goals. We'll then move to our usual question and answer session.</p>
          <p>In my presentation this morning, I'd like to focus on three key messages. First, 2009 was a year of considerable achievement, in which we shaped the Group to enable us to deliver the growth potential of the enlarged franchise. Second, the core business will deliver a strong financial performance, given the trends that we've already established on margins, costs and impairments and in a stabilizing economy.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have substantial additional growth opportunities from continuing to develop our business model and applying it across the broader franchise. As we realize the potential, it will enable us to further improve the growth trajectory in the coming years. As a Group, we're just over a year old, but we've made great progress in addressing the immediate challenges. We have good momentum in all the core businesses and we believe the Group is now well positioned to deliver strong growth, both in the near and long term.</p>
          <p>We've achieved excellent traction in integrating the two banks. We're now well ahead of our initial forecasts and we've now increased our run rate synergy target to 2 billion by the end of 2011. We've embedded the Lloyds risk disciplines across the Group. The results are already coming through and we've seen a significant reduction in the level of impairments in the second half.</p>
          <p>During the year, we improved our funding and liquidity by reshaping the balance sheet and extending our maturity profile. We ended the year with a very substantial liquidity buffer of &#xA3;88 billion. We undertook a major capital raising program at the end of last year that gives us the platform to continue to grow and supports our objective of returning to full private ownership. Overall, we made great progress last year, and laid foundations for future growth.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly review the Group's results. On a management basis, we produced a loss of 6.3 billion for the year. Income was up 12% on prior year, helped by lower write-downs on Treasury assets and the profits from debt swaps. These gains more than offset the year-on-year decline in margins, which suffered from increased funding costs and the impact of very low base rates. Costs were down 5% as we continue to manage expenses and began to do deliver major integration benefits.</p>
          <p>Higher income and lower costs draw a substantial 35% uplift in the trading surplus. We made excellent progress in improving our cost:income ratio. This fell by almost 900 basis points in 2009, although that contains a number of one-offs. Impairments are the most significant number on the slide. At 24 billion, they are up 61% on 2008 and were the primary driver behind the pre-tax management loss. But as expected, they fell back in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Looking behind the numbers, the business is performing very well. The development of our customer franchises has continued despite the weak economy. This slide highlights some of the key members across the divisions. I won't go through them all, but I particularly wanted to touch on the support for house buyers and businesses.</p>
          <p>In Retail Banking, we maintained our strong levels of mortgage lending with 35 billion of gross new lending. This has helped thousands of our customers buy homes. In the Wholesale bank, we committed some 10 billion of lending to SMEs and another 25 billion to Corporate customers. We're acutely aware of the importance of supporting households and businesses as we exit the recession and we will remain just as focused on this in 2010 as we were in 2009.</p>
          <p>We provided an increased level of guidance at our interim results in August and I'm pleased to report that thus far, we're trending in line or better on all those measures. We set the target of delivering high single-digit revenue growth in our continuing businesses within the next couple of years. We've guided that our margins would fall in the second half of 2009, but would recover in 2010. We're actually seeing good progress on margins and we actually saw margins increase in the back half of the year.</p>
          <p>We're performing well on costs. We've achieved over half our initial three-year target in the first year of the program. Impairments are trending in line with our guidance and we expect a substantial further reduction in 2010 and beyond. Our balance sheet reduction program is making excellent progress. We've already achieved a 60 billion reduction in non-relationship assets and we completed the sale of five non-core businesses.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we expected to deliver substantially improved financial performance in 2010 and in subsequent years. We'll benefit from the improved margins as we price for risk and as based rates gradually rise. We'll continue to drive our costs effectively and we have the additional benefit of the synergy programs. We see reduced levels of impairments given the specific programs that we have already put in place. With margins, costs, and impairments all trending in the right direction, we expect to deliver strong growth for the next several years.</p>
          <p>Let me expand on that outlook, starting with the economy. The economic performance last year was worse than most expected. Looking forward, we remain cautious, but realistic. Our view is that the risk of a further severe downturn in 2010 is lower than a few months ago and we're holding to our August forecast of 1.8% growth in GDP in 2010 and a similar trend in 2011.</p>
          <p>Against that backdrop, we expect property prices will be broadly flat in 2010 which is below consensus. We anticipate that company failures will peak this year, but we do not expect them to reach the heights seen during the last recession. We also think that unemployment will peak in 2010, but again, at a lower level than the last recession.</p>
          <p>Our financial outlook and guidance are based on a range of economic scenarios. Having stressed our portfolios, we're confident of our capital position and our expectation of improving financial performance, albeit that the growth would be slower in coming through if there were a weaker recovery.</p>
          <p>As we guided, our asset margin has improved as we are pricing our assets to better reflect risk and funding costs. The key drivers of our margin in 2010 will be asset pricing, a possible increase in the base rate and the cost of wholesale funding. We expect to be able to achieve a 2% margin this year and to be on an upward trajectory after that. We see the largest positive influence as being the appropriate pricing of the book. An upward move in the base rate would also be positive and we expect one increase later this year.</p>
          <p>Beyond 2010, we envisage minimal impact from the cost of wholesale funding as we run down our non-core assets and this will be more than offset by the moves to price new and existing business. We've made great strides in delivering the integration, which is one of the largest financial services mergers undertaken.</p>
          <p>We exited the year with a run rate of some &#xA3;766 million, a very strong start. Given that we've now achieved half our run rate target, I'm pleased to report that we're raising our guidance to 2 billion by the end of 2011. The rate of cost reduction, however, is not linear, given the build-up to the major IT integration in 2011, but we're confident we will deliver, as we are on track against all of our major milestones.</p>
          <p>In August, we said that the total Group impairments would peak in the first half and the full numbers confirm that. The major driver of the improvement was in wholesale, where commercial property charges were reduced substantially. Retail impairments fell in the second half, driven by the large reduction in the secured book. This reflects the improvement in the house price index and better than expected arrears trends.</p>
          <p>Impairments in the unsecured book rose in the second half, as you would expect in the current part of the cycle. The Lloyds conservative approach to risk management is making a difference. All new lending is within the Group's risk appetite and the existing portfolios are being managed to Group standards. Our business support units have been expanded and extended Group wide.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we expect to see a similar pace of half-yearly improvement through 2010 and a further substantial reduction in 2011. We expect to see reductions in all three divisions, although we remain cautious on the Irish portfolios.</p>
          <p>As I've just outlined, we expect improving margins, reducing costs and falling impairment charges. Based on these trajectories, we will deliver a strong improvement in our performance over the next several years. However, we believe there are also significant opportunities for additional growth.</p>
          <p>Over the last five years, Lloyds TSB has delivered accelerating profit growth by focusing on acquiring, deepening and broadening customer relationships. We can see significant opportunity from sustaining this trend in the legacy Lloyds franchise and extending the model across the Group. Over the next few minutes, I'd like to share some of the work we have underway and how we view the potential. These are clearly not forecasts, but rather examples that illustrate some of the opportunities.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you of the results we are achieving in the Lloyds TSB retail franchise and how that compares with the legacy HBOS. The left hand chart shows that when attracting a new customer, the absolute level of cross sales is higher in Lloyds than in HBOS and that then the Lloyds sales trend up nicely over time. The right hand chart illustrates how Lloyds deepens relationships with customers over time, taking a customer cohort opened in 2007 and tracking it over the past two years.</p>
          <p>HBOS has also grown relationship depth, but at a slower rate. Clearly, there is a big opportunity to further improve the old Lloyds performance and the results in HBOS. We're addressing the HBOS opportunity by raising the sales effectiveness to Lloyds levels.</p>
          <p>As we told you before, Lloyds is very good at using lead management systems to generate customer leads and convert them into sales. Finalta benchmarked Lloyds as being one of the most efficient sales networks in Europe. As you can see from the chart, compared to HBOS, Lloyds is more successful at both lead generation and subsequently converting the leads into sales.</p>
          <p>Based on the current Lloyds TSB results, our estimates suggest an income opportunity of some &#xA3;500 million from both new and existing customers if we were able to successfully implement these practices into the HBOS network. We also feel there is a great deal of potential still to come from the Lloyds network. As the chart shows, the proportion of the Lloyds customer base holding more than one product is rising over time.</p>
          <p>I've shown you in previous presentations that multiple product holders are much more profitable. If we continue to deepen relationships and we're able to achieve a 55% penetration of customers with multiple product holdings, it would give us an additional 250 million in annual income.</p>
          <p>Here's an example from the Corporate Bank. As I told you at the half year, we're segmenting our customer base to identify those accounts where we have the strongest and deepest relationships and which deliver a significantly more income. We classify these customers as trusted adviser and trusted specialist relationships. We've been working this model for a year and have been very successful in the trial segments. Analysis based on their work shows that we have the potential to treble the number of these more valuable relationships. We've estimated that if we were to realize the full potential, we would generate a 600 million income uplift per year.</p>
          <p>Whilst I've been through the first three examples on this slide, we clearly have a range of other opportunities across the franchise. In Commercial, Lloyds TSB is a market leader in business startups based on our success in opening SME accounts for our personal customers. If we could replicate that performance in the HBOS franchise, we could generate an additional 50 million of income each year. By building deeper relationships across the entire SME customer base, we can see an additional 200 of revenue opportunity.</p>
          <p>We've seen strong growth in the number of customers within the private bank in recent years and established the Wealth division to build on that success. Across the Group, we've identified some 300,000 clients who are suitable for wealth services. Were we able to gain all this business, we believe we could generate an additional quarter billion of income per annum. Again, this is not an exhaustive list, but just a few examples to illustrate the additional growth opportunity that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>In finishing, I'd like to leave you with my three key messages. First, 2009 was a year of substantial achievement in which we shaped the Group to enable us to deliver the growth potential of the enlarged franchise. We've made great progress with integration and we've greatly strengthened our balance sheet. We've achieved all this while maintaining good momentum in the core business. The Group is now in a strong position.</p>
          <p>Second, the trends in margins, costs and impairments are all positive. The management actions we've already taken and combined with the underlying business momentum, points towards strong financial performance in the coming year as the economy stabilizes.</p>
          <p>Finally, we believe that we have substantial additional growth opportunities from developing and extending our business model across the new Group. As we realize this potential, we will add to our growth trajectory.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Tim to take you through the results in more detail. Thank you. Tim?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Eric, and good morning, everyone. In the following slides, I would like to take you through some of the key elements of Eric's presentation in some more detail, further reinforce our confidence in the strength of our business and our strategy and provide some insight into our expected performance over the next few years. I'll particularly focus on the improving earnings outlook, our progress on right-sizing the balance sheet, how we are improving our funding and liquidity position and maintaining a robust capital position.</p>
          <p>In 2009 the Group delivered a resilient trailing performance against the backdrop of a difficult economic environment and the continued challenges of financial markets. In addition, the integration of HBOS is progressing comfortably ahead of our initial expectations and as a result, as Eric, said we have increased the cost synergies target. All in all, we have demonstrated that our core business is in good shape.</p>
          <p>Over the last six months, our lending portfolios have performed pretty much in line with our expectations and we believe that the overall Group impairment charge peaked in the first half of the year, as we guided with our interim results. We're making good progress in right=sizing the balance sheet with a focus on the reduction of non-core assets. And our capital raising transactions have further strengthened our capital base and we've made significant improvements to our liquidity position.</p>
          <p>So looking now at our business performance in more detail, for 2009, as I've said, we can report a resilient revenue performance, where significant year-on-year margin pressures were more than offset by the reduced impact of 2008 market dislocation. At the same time, we have continued to maintain excellent cost control, with expenses down 5%, and I'll break out some of the component parts of our revenue and cost performance shortly.</p>
          <p>As we all know, we took very substantial impairment provisions on the higher-risk HBOS books in the first half, but in line with our previous guidance, we experienced a significant decrease in overall impairment levels in the second half of the year. With the positive effect of the fair value unwind, we've reported a loss before tax on a continuing businesses basis of &#xA3;6.3 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>On this occasion, however, I believe it's important to reflect for the moment on statutory profit. As you know, we paid less than half of book value when acquiring HBOS, given the problems in their asset books and the large credit from negative goodwill means that we have delivered a statutory profit in the year and statutory profit of course is also important from a capital perspective, as it flows almost fully into regulatory capital. Our statutory result in 2009 was a profit of just over &#xA3;1 billion, reflecting the impact of the credit to the income statement from the negative goodwill arising on the HBOS acquisition. And this goodwill credit more than offset two other large one-off items, integration costs and the &#xA3;2.5 billion GAPS fee.</p>
          <p>Looking briefly now at our divisional performance, and unlike previous presentations, I'd like here to focus on half-on-half trends, because during the second half of the year, we saw some stabilization in the economy which enabled many of our businesses to demonstrate improved business and earnings momentum in the second half. Retail delivered a good underlying performance against the backdrop of slowing economic activity and significant margin pressure from lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Margins in retail decreased year-on-year, but improved in the second half, particularly from increased product pricing in both secured and unsecured portfolios. This, combined with lower impairment provisions, led to a significant profit uplift in the second half. Wholesale's loss for the year was due to the high levels of impairment and this was partly offset by the lower impact of market dislocation and continued strength in sales and trading activity. And the second half result for wholesale clearly shows the benefit from the significant reduction in impairments.</p>
          <p>In Wealth and International, a solid underlying performance for the year was offset by increased impairment losses driven by the Irish turn-down. As we cautioned at the interim stage, the difficult economic situation in Ireland led to much higher provisions in the international business in the second half and particularly in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our insurance business performed well in a difficult market, but saw reduction in income and profit as sales fell. Now this is partly mitigated, however, by a very strong cost performance and then improvements in the U.K. new business margins to 2.7% in the second half. Overall, the combination of improving margins, cost synergies and lower impairments have led to a better performance in the second half and these trends all bode well for the future performance of the Group.</p>
          <p>Looking now at revenue trends, as I mentioned, 2009 revenue was supported by the absence of 2008 market dislocation and we've also executed a number of liability management transactions which generated strong gains over and above the fair value unwind that crystallizes as a result of these transactions. Overall, we're pleased with the resilience of our revenues against the impact of lower deposit margins and last year, this margin pressure reduced income by some &#xA3;1.2 billion. In addition, the impact of moving to a monthly premium PPI product in January '09, as you know, reduces the upfront income on these products.</p>
          <p>Turning now to margins, the net interest margin from our banking businesses for the full year reduced by 24 basis points to 177 basis points. However, again I want to focus here on the half-on-half trends, which are quite different, as we have delivered an improvement in margin in the second half. In the first half, the impact of falling base rates and the lengthening of our wholesale funding profile was significant.</p>
          <p>During the second half, however, the impact of asset pricing and stabilizing wholesale funding costs more than offset the impact of lower base rates. Notwithstanding the further maturity extensions that we achieved in the second half, the overall cost and mix of wholesale funding improved the Group margin by four basis points.</p>
          <p>All new lending and all renewals are done at prices that reflect the appropriate cost of funds, and of course, proper pricing for risk. Within existing lending, the other major dynamic has been in our mortgage portfolios, as customers continued to migrate to standard variable rate offers as their existing fixed and tracker products mature. We expect this trend to continue and we may see the proportion of our mortgage book on SVR increase to around 50% of the overall book by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Looking now at our expectations for margins going forward, now many of you will recognize this type of slide, which sets out our directional guidance in the key areas driving our margin and I've updated this to reflect the changing trends that we have seen in the last few months. The improved margin will in the second half, we believe, further improve over the next few years and we expect it to increase in 2010 to around 2%, with further improvements thereafter.</p>
          <p>One area that I just want to touch on briefly is the potential impact on our margin of the refinancing of government and Central Bank liquidity schemes over the next few years. The Group's balance sheet reduction plans will avoid the need for a proportion of this funding to be refinanced at all. And the residual refinancing, which we expect to come from increases in customer deposit and a wide variety of secured and unsecured wholesale markets, is not expected to cost significantly more than the existing schemes.</p>
          <p>The current cost of the Group of participating in these schemes is around 50 basis points over LIBOR for the SLS and around 130 basis points over LIBOR for the CGS. Overall, and based on expected spreads and balance sheet mix, the increased cost of wholesale funding over the next few years is expected to impact the Group's net interest margin by no more than ten basis points. And this increased cost is expected to be more than offset by the impact of improved product pricing.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the cost trends. The Group has continued its excellent track record in managing its cost base. During '09, expenses decreased by 5% as integration-related savings have started to be captured and this includes the impact of staff numbers coming down by over 11,500. Adjusting for the lower operating lease depreciation, you can see that business as usual costs rose by some 3%, reflecting continued investments in growing our core business as well as increased pension costs and inflation.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we anticipate further cost savings from the integration over the next two years, more in just a second, and as a result of this, we expect to exceed our continuing businesses cost:income ratio improvement target. After a couple of years of integration delivery, we will still be targeting further efficiency and productivity improvements, as we seek to optimize our cost:income ratio in the medium term.</p>
          <p>Now let me expand on our recent progress on integration. We've already made significant progress in capturing savings from areas such as rationalization on procurement and over &#xA3;500 million of savings have already been realized and these represent annual run rate savings of over &#xA3;750 million. Clearly we are delighted with this progress and as a result, we've increased our commitment to deliver a run rate of cost synergies and other operating efficiencies of &#xA3;2 billion per annum by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's move on now to impairment. The significant rise in impairment levels largely represented falls in the value of commercial real estate and the impact of the general economic deterioration during the year. This included, of course, the effects of rising unemployment and reduced corporate cash flows, although we saw the effects of some of these issues start to reduce in the second half with the impairment charge down 21% compared to the first half.</p>
          <p>In retail, the increase in impairment losses year-on-year particularly reflected increases in unemployment on the unsecured impairment charge. In the second half, however, this was partly offset by a lower mortgage impairment charge, as house prices started to increase and the trend in mortgage arrears started to improve.</p>
          <p>The wholesale charge for impairment losses increased significantly, in particular due to the real estate exposures in the legacy HBOS portfolios, which were much more sensitive to the downturn in the economy. And as we predicted, we saw a significant reduction in the second half charge as we began to see some stabilization in these real estate markets.</p>
          <p>In our Wealth and International business, the impairment charge rose quite substantially, particularly reflecting provisions against our Irish commercial real estate portfolio, which we have been cautioned about in our recent guidance.</p>
          <p>Looking now at our previous impairment guidance and outlook. As Eric said, it is important to us when we provide market guidance on any part of our business that we subsequently deliver on that guidance. And I'm pleased therefore that there were no negative surprises in our second half performance. We believe, given our current economic outlook, that the impairment charge in 2010 will be significantly lower than the 2009 charge. And our second half charge, as you know, was 21% lower than in the first half. And given our current economic outlook, we expect to see a similar pace of half-yearly improvements throughout 2010, with further substantial reductions in 2011 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Looking at the divisions, compared to '09 we expect to see reduction in the retail impairment charge this year with further improvement charge thereafter as the U.K. economy improves. In wholesale, further significant reductions are expected in 2010 and beyond, based on our current economic expectations. In Wealth and International, while we continue to have ongoing concerns with regard to the outlook for the Irish economy, although we expect and believe that 2009 has been the peak for the international impairment charge.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our secured mortgage portfolio. And this is, again, the format of a slide that I hope you would all recognize and I've put it up again to demonstrate the improvements in our mortgage portfolio in the second half of the year. The values of our book that are both more than 100% loan-to-value and more than three months in arrears are very modest indeed. In fact, they total around 0.9% of the total mortgage portfolio only, down about a quarter from the end of June.</p>
          <p>These slides, lots of information, these slides are in your pack. But whichever way you look at it, whether it's arrears, customers new to arrears or repossessions data, all key trends in our mortgage portfolio are moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to talk about capital and liquidity, I just want to update you on our current expectations for the unwind of our acquisition-related fair value adjustments. As a result of some accelerated fair value unwind in the second half of '09, which of course related to our capital exchanges, the Group now expects some &#xA3;2.5 billion net to unwind favorably in 2010 and then during the next three years, we expect smaller impacts as you can see. And I will, of course, keep providing an update on the timing of these unwind adjustments in future presentations.</p>
          <p>So just recapping for a moment on our earnings outlook, if I may. The outlook for margins has improved. We have a significant cost opportunity ahead of us and our impairments are expected to reduce substantially over the next few years. All in all, this means that we expect our financial performance to improve significantly in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>But now I want to focus for a few minutes, if I may, on our balance sheet. In the Group's interim results announcements in August, we set out our strategy to reduce non-core assets, including business which is outside our current risk appetite by about &#xA3;300 billion, of which some 200 billion was expected to be achieved by the end of 2014.</p>
          <p>It's always been our intention to manage these assets for value and given the current economic climate, our primary focus continues to be on running these assets down over time and I'm pleased that &#xA3;60 billion of the 200 billion ran off last year. Although I must confess, and you can see it from the chart, the path of this runoff reflected impairment write-offs. Otherwise we've made good progress in reducing our Treasury assets and non-core customer assets.</p>
          <p>Over the next few years, we expect a further 140 billion to run off from this portfolio. And the overall balance sheet reduction over time will provide the Group with increased optionality and flexibility from the resultant releases in both capital and funding. These benefits will be incorporated into the Group's overall business plans, which include actions to increase retail and corporate deposits over time.</p>
          <p>Together, these actions will reduce the proportion of the government's funding that is derived from wholesale markets and eliminate our use of government and Central Bank-sponsored funding facilities, whilst providing capacity for core business growth. And I would remind you that the impact of running down these portfolios is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's financial performance.</p>
          <p>Recapping briefly, we've made good progress in reducing our balance sheet assets and creating greater flexibility for the business. But now, let's look at how we've used this asset reduction to improve our funding position. If we strip out the insurance and derivatives items from the Group's balance sheet, total banking assets were about &#xA3;800 billion and this is largely funded by customer deposits and wholesale funding, with the remainder coming, of course, from repos and capital. And the balance sheet reduction we've achieved has enabled us to reduce our repo balances and we've also reduced wholesale funding by some &#xA3;17 billion.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've been able to avoid rolling over more expensive hot money-type deposits, which we estimate to be some &#xA3;20 billion, whilst growing our core deposit balances. And as you know, a significant proportion of the Group's overall funding support from government and Central Bank sources will mature over the next couple of years. However, the Group's balance sheet reduction plans will avoid the necessity to refinance a large proportion of this.</p>
          <p>Turning now to funding sources and how we've lengthened our wholesale funding maturity profile, throughout the turbulence in global wholesale funding markets, the Group continued to benefit from a diverse range of funding sources, which have recently been further enhanced by senior funding issuance in a number of new product areas, such as our first issuance in the U.S. medium-term note market.</p>
          <p>The Group's wholesale funding basis proved to be very resilient, supporting the Group's balance sheet and with an increased level of longer-term funding. And as we've said previously, over time and as we see improvements in the capacity in these markets, we expect to maintain the average maturity of the Group's wholesale borrowings with a maturity date of more than one year to be in excess of 40%, which we consider to be an appropriate and sustainable long-term proportion.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this, the Group has continued to extend the maturity profile of wholesale funding, such that at the end of the year, 50% of our wholesale funding has a maturity date greater than one year, up from 44% a year ago. And the maturity extension achieved has continued to de-risk our already prudent funding profile. Within this extension activity, you will see the amount of more than one-year funding has actually risen by 13 billion and the amount of less than one year maturity funding has reduced by 30 billion, a very good illustration of our improved funding position.</p>
          <p>Relative to the size of our balance sheet, we don't have excessive senior term funding requirements. Over the next three years, we expect our public capital and senior funding issuance to be in the range of 20 to &#xA3;25 billion per annum and approximately 7 billion of term funding for 2010 had already been completed by the end of January.</p>
          <p>Turning now briefly to our liquid asset buffer, the Group's liquid asset portfolio has increased from 105 billion to over &#xA3;150 billion and represents a liquidity buffer now 19% of total banking assets. And as Eric said, of this &#xA3;88 billion represents primary FSA eligible liquidity, which is a multiple of current liquidity requirements. So we have made significant progress in improving our funding and capital &#x2013; I'm sorry, our funding and liquidity position, which just leaves me time to talk about capital.</p>
          <p>During the year, our risk-weighted assets have reduced by &#xA3;5 billion, as result of a 40 billion reduction from asset reductions being largely offset by the effects of procyclicality. Within this, retail RWAs have increased as the deteriorating economic conditions led to an increase in average risk weightings. Wholesale risk-weighted assets have decreased, as a result of the reduction in assets and some currency movement being offset by procyclical impact of weaker economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Over the next few years, we expect to see continued reductions in risk-weighted assets as a result of balance sheet asset reductions and a positive procyclical impact as the economy continues to improve.</p>
          <p>At the end of December, the Group's capital ratios were very robust and were further enhanced by the issuance earlier this month of &#xA3;1.5 billion of equity, which concluded the December capital raising and which further increases the core Tier 1 ratio by 30 basis points to 8.4%. And this, of course, excludes the potential benefit of the ECNs issued late last year. As a result, the Group is now in a solid position to deal with what are constantly changing regulatory capital requirements.</p>
          <p>And let me now briefly comment on the current &#x2013; too many Cs in this speech. Let me now briefly comment on the current consultations on capital requirements. Now this gets more interesting now, I promise. But seriously for a moment, we are clearly mindful of the discussions taking place among the policy makers across Europe and globally, relating to the appropriate levels of capital, funding and leverage for the system and, of course, for individual banks. The most notable of these comes from the Basel Committee. And of course, we are fully engaged in the consultation processes which will take place through this year and quite possibly beyond. And this is critical if the right balance is to be struck, so that all potential impact, including on economies, can be considered and calibrated.</p>
          <p>Whilst it is too early at this stage to draw conclusions, I want to take this opportunity to share with you some of our current thinking around certain aspects of the current proposals. Under the banner of raising the quality of capital, the Basel Committee is proposing a number of potential changes to the definition of core Tier 1. If these were enacted, the Group would clearly be affected by the proposal to deduct 100% of insurance businesses from core Tier 1 and so we are looking at options for optimizing our use of capital should this change be implemented. I would add here, of course, that we already have 50% of this potential deduction built into our medium-term capital plans. So I color this amber overall.</p>
          <p>The potential restriction of deferred tax assets has received some comment. But I've coded this amber green, because whilst we currently carry the deferred tax asset, we expect it to reduce a lot before the implementation of any rule changes. The other changes proposed to core Tier 1, such as the treatment of AFS reserves and pensions, if implemented as proposed, are not expected to affect our capital base significantly. And the definition of future Tier 1 capital securities may well be tightened, but we expect all of our existing securities to be grandfathered.</p>
          <p>The proposals around increased risk weighted assets are mainly concentrated in investment banking activities rather than retail and commercial banking activities and therefore, the impact from this aspect is not expected to be significant at all. We note the proposed definition of a new leverage ratio, but we'll only able to properly understand its potential impact after calibration. In short, there is still a great deal of water to flow under the bridge with regard to the future regulatory capital requirements and we are actively engaged in the consultation processes.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have strengthened our robust capital position. And so in concluding, we can look back at a very challenging year, but one of significant achievements. At the start of the year and at the half-year, we provided extensive guidance and we believe that we have delivered against every aspect of it. Our core business is in good shape with resilient revenues against an extremely challenging operating background.</p>
          <p>We have an improved outlook for margins going forward. We're targeting substantial cost synergies and we expect impairments to reduce significantly. We are very happy with the progress made in the run down of non-core balance sheet assets and we expect the Group's performance to improve significantly in 2010. We're now very well placed to deliver significant growth from our relationship model across the enlarged franchise.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will hand you back to Eric.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. John-Paul Crutchley, J.P., from UBS. You've given us some very comprehensive guidance on what you expect for the year ahead in terms of the shape of the P&amp;L and what you're doing on the balance sheet. What you've not, and I know Lloyds don't give profit forecast, but you've not said whether you expect to be in the black in 2010.</p>
          <p>But can I just maybe just walk through what I think you said and just correct me if there are any issues I think I may have missed? In terms of where you guiding to on the margin, it looks like locally the interest income will be up and it looks like it broadly offset the sort of numbers you're talking about in terms of impairments. And in terms of non-interest income, at the moment, broadly equate to the cost base and the cost base obviously falling. And you've talked about the release of the fair value unwind, too. So when you put all of that together, it looks like the Group has the potential to be in the black for 2010. I'm just wondering if you can just comment on long term on those numbers or whether there is anything else we should be factoring in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if I understood &#x2013; the sound is not terrific, that you're basically saying that we're trending the right way on margins, impairments and costs and so will that lead to a rosy 2010? Is that the thrust of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess I was saying, if you add up essentially what you're saying, you reach the conclusion that you should be a profitable bank in 2010, and I'm just wondering if you can comment whether there is anything else we should be factoring in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I understand the thrust of the question and I understand perfectly why you're asking it. I think we have given very detailed guidance, J.P., and I think we can't extend ourselves too much further than we already have. But I think that it is safe to say that we have a strong belief in the trends within the business. They're all moving in the right directions. We've had a very strong year in 2009. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, thanks for the question, J.P. We're acutely aware that there is a range of different views in the room and half of you have us in your spreadsheets for a profit next year and the other half of you have us in for a loss. What we wanted to do here was give as comprehensive guidance as we can to share with you the positive trajectory we see in the fundamentals in the business and to enable you to all update your spreadsheets. What I can't do is complete them all for you and as Eric said, we can't add anything specifically from the platform that isn't in the announcement this morning, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have a question over on the right, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob Law of Nomura. If you can't fill in the whole spreadsheet for us, perhaps I could ask you to help us on one or two cells. And I was particularly more seriously thinking about the net interest income line. You've kindly given us guidance on the margin and if I look at the sequential margin improvement in the second half of the year and roll that forward, that would be kind of consistent with the margin guidance you've given.</p>
          <p>My question relates to actually the movement in net interest income, because although you've seen an improvement in the margin, the net interest income has actually gone down in the second half of the year compared to the first. And I was wondering if you could give us some kind of rationale for that and give us some guidance as to whether you actually think the net interest income for 2010 will be up on '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, the income was down &#x2013; I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I'll start with the first one. I think you're there looking at the trend over time of what's going on in the net interest income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean there are a number of dynamics that are at play in that, not least of course what's going on, on the balance sheet and the asset rundown. What we're looking to achieve going forward is to achieve the asset rundown with minimal impact in the overall financial performance of the Group and clearly, there's a large proportion of the assets that are in there that are not generating enough of a return. And running those down over time will give us quite a lot of flexibility to manage our funding costs and that will help us deliver the margin guidance going forward.</p>
          <p>There's nothing particular in the trends in the second half that you're referring to. The one or two lumps in there around some of the treatments of the income that comes from operating leases, which is one of the reasons I pulled that separately out from costs, because, of course, the two broadly offset between income and costs. So I hope that answers your question. As I said, the sound isn't brilliant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would you expect net interest income to be up in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think we've, I'm not sure I can add to the guidance that we've given, Robert. I'm afraid that's probably one of the cells that I can't fill in in your sheet for you. I mean, the fundamentals in the business are good. We're repricing a lot of business as it comes up. And of course, we are growing the business and that's one of the benefits of having the flexibility coming into the business, to grow our core franchise business with customers from running off the non-relationship assets that we have in the business that really aren't performing for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Robert. Ian, you had a question over on the left here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ian Smillie from RBS. Two questions, please. The first one is on the mainstream mortgage book in the U.K., it looks like it declined at an accelerating rate through the second half of last year. So I was just wondering if you could give us some color as to what was happening there, what sort of margins that business is rolling off, was on the book at, and how we should think about progress in the stock of the mainstream mortgage book through 2010, please? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is bigger picture, but could you, where possible, walk us through the moving parts on the Group balance sheet, if the U.K. sovereign was to be single or multi-notch downgraded, just so we could have an idea of what you think would happen to the business? I noticed in the liquidity section there is a line saying if that was to happen, that you may or may not be able to meet your funding requirements, so more color on that area would be very useful, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks for the questions, Ian. I'll give a basic response and then ask Helen whether she'd like to comment on the mortgage market. Basically what we've seen is that the mortgage market did, in fact, the house prices did, in fact, perform better than I think anyone would have expected and we have seen some limited activity in new home buyers. But by and large, the purchase of new mortgages has been very restrained.</p>
          <p>What we have done is focused our efforts really on first-time buyers and on movers and that's what we believe is important in our relationship building. What we have not done is necessarily chased the non-customers through the IFA channel. So that sort of shapes how we are looking at the mortgage business going forward. Helen, if you can comment, please, there's a microphone coming here, and then over to you, Tim, for the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think the other thing that's affected the mortgage market in the second half is we've been very focused on our relationship strategy through mortgages through the branches. So actually, the reduction you see in mainstream mortgages is primarily coming through the IFAs and that was business that's coming up for renewal. A lot of it was put on in 2007, the back end of 2006, 2007. It's relatively low margin and in some cases, slightly negative margin business.</p>
          <p>So actually, that rolling off our books has actually helped us, so that's been a core part of our strategy, refocusing on our core relationship business through the branches and to a certain extent, allowing some of that less profitable business to roll off and refinance elsewhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Helen. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ian, with respect to the last point of your question, I have a lot of respect and affection for our risk colleagues and they do insist that we write balance segments in the various bits and pieces that would encourage some people to jump off high buildings.</p>
          <p>I think what I'd tell you there is that what we set out here is the various ingredients that make up our funding plan at the highest level for the next few years and it should give you a high degree of confidence that the actions that we're taking in pricing the business, that we do appropriately both for the cost of funds as well as for risks and running of the non-relationship businesses but doing it in a way that manages them for value rather than says, I must have the liquidity at any cost, gives you a high degree of insight into the confidence that we have that we can run the business successfully from a liquidity perspective over the next few years. So we don't regard that situation as likely at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Peter, you had a question right here in front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Toeman from HSBC. I was sort of encouraged to see that your margin forecast for the second half of '09 proved to be about as inaccurate as my own forecast would have been. But I think you're telling us that one the reasons that inaccuracy might be more mortgages moving on to SVR basis and I wonder as interest rates rise, then some of that sort of surplus mortgage return might be eroded by rates going up. So I wondered if that was sort of a factor that could blow your sort of positive expectations for 2010 off course?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Peter, I'll ask Tim to comment as well. We were pleasantly wrong. In fact, margins since turned around instead of in 2010, a full half earlier and we're quite pleased. Tim took you through some of the drivers behind that, but basically, if you're asking about our rate sensitivity, were there to be a base rate increase, what we believe is that, in fact, it will be helpful.</p>
          <p>As you know we have an enormous branch network and our savings and current accounts are worth a good deal less in a low interest rate environment. So, yes, the asset pricing, if there is a lag, will hurt margin somewhat but that's more than compensated for by seeing the liabilities go up. So on balance, we think we feel pretty confident if the economy indeed conforms to our forecast, that we will see margins go up during 2010 and beyond. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and thanks for the question, Peter. When we were out talking about our capital raise in the autumn, we at that stage were talking about the stabilized margins and the trend we saw in the mortgage book. And the proportions that were moving on to SVR, a pattern which we do think will continue and that's going to be part of the benefit in overall margins.</p>
          <p>I'd also just point out of course that the funding markets were quite different in the second half of the year compared to the first. And indeed, notwithstanding the fact that we continue to push out our wholesale funding and de-risk our overall wholesale funding position further in the first half, we actually had a small margin benefit from wholesale funding in the second half compared to a cost in the first half. So, mortgages is part of it but I think I'll continue to talk about the different drivers of margin going forward because there are so many component parts to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes, we have a question over on the far left, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. It's Tom Rayner from Barclays Capital here. If I can, can I have three questions, please? I don't know if you want them all in one go or one at a time, but the first is just on the margin again. Just so I understand the trends in the second half of the year, because I think at the interim management statement, you said that Q3 saw stable margins on the first half, so it looks as if Q4 margin has jumped to about 194 basis points.</p>
          <p>So, just trying to understand that move and the guidance for 2010 would suggest a fairly flat profile on Q4 and I wonder what it would look like if we don't see any base rate increases coming through? I've got another question on wholesale funding and one on sort of just revenue and cost drawers, but maybe I will leave at that one first, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much, Tom. When we were out in Q3 you're absolutely right, we talked about stabilized margins. To me, stabilized can be plus or minus a few bips from a particular number and we didn't go out with our Q3 statement with a full income statement, so we weren't quoting specific numbers.</p>
          <p>So, if you &#x2013; mathematically, I am sure what you're doing is correct, but you are probably slightly overstating what was in Q4. We do believe from what we see going forwards and reflecting current spread and the mix that I foresee coming through to fund the business over 2010, that we will bring the margin in at around 2% this year. You asked about the impact of a base rate change, relatively modest this year, because I think it will come towards the back end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. On the wholesale funding, I'd just like to push you a little bit more on your comment that you expect a minimal medium-term impact from the cost of wholesale funding. Just sort of looking at the first slide on Page 14 of the presentation, the focus clearly is on 50% of your wholesale funding being greater than the year. But you could look at it, that 65%, as a residual maturity of less than two years.</p>
          <p>And that's quite a big number, 211 billion, and we know quite a big chunk has a government sort of guarantee and you pointed out the cost of some of that, like the SLS, is fairly attractively priced funding. So I'd just like to understand the dynamics a little bit more that as you go through the next couple of years, why there is not a bigger impact on your revenue expectations coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, certainly, thank you, Eric. Yeah, Tom, there is a number of factors in play here. Firstly remember that there are a lot of relatively underperforming assets on the balance sheet consuming expensive liquidity. We will be reducing those assets over time and therefore, a certain proportion of it will not need to be re-financed at all. On top of that, as we've said, so our post reflect it also didn't work.</p>
          <p>What we're also doing, is we said we want to build our core customer deposit base and that's both on the retail side as well as in the wholesale space. So there is clear a mix effect in here. What I wanted to do in giving the guidance here was give you insight into the different levers that we're pulling to manage the business going forward and de-risk it. And there is a lot of mythology around proportions of wholesale funding and maturities and there are different definitions out there. If I chose to use a definition used by another U.K. reporter, I could have told you that our wholesale funding today was 60% funded more than one year and you've said, oh, gosh, isn't that wonderful. So just be careful when you're looking at definitions and comparing one institution with another.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can, just one final one, just on the old favorite, sort of revenue cost draws. I think taking out structure to the market dislocation effects and liability management gains, it looks like underlying revenue was down 9% on the year, costs actually down 1%, again, on an underlying basis and that's despite synergies coming through a bit more quickly. So I just wondered if you could talk, I mean, it's not quite the aggressive cost management we're used to hearing from you guys, I wonder if you could comment on that?</p>

          <p>Tim, do you want to take this? I'll head it up.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, very clearly, we signaled, again, looking at the income statement, that we were benefited from the debt exchanges as well as the lack of Treasury write-downs. And they are fairly big numbers, but I would also tell you that our income statement has forever extraordinary items. So you have to, I think, take some kind of reasoned view about what is the real level.</p>
          <p>As Tim told you on our expenses, what we have actually done is continue to invest in the business. I would give you some examples. We have started programs for training all of our people, I think it's terribly important to build a common culture and so we won't skimp on that. We've also been investing in new systems, as you would expect, and beyond the integration investments, we're getting better information systems, better lead management systems and so on. So all in, our true rate of cost increase was somewhere around 3% including inflation and so we think that, that's a very reasonable way to manage the business. I don't really have much more to add. Tim?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. May we have a question here right in front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Mike Trippitt at Oriel Securities. I have a question on liquidity. If you could maybe help with what you think the impact of increasing liquidity has been on the margin or what the drag on the margin is in 2010? And secondly, longer term, do you envisage running with that same level of liquidity on a smaller balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mike, thanks for the question. I think that what we have done is in taking over HBOS, we've stretched out the maturities. HBOS very clearly, especially in the few months before we actually struck the deal, was pretty much taking liquidity at any cost and any duration, so it was a liquidity issue.</p>
          <p>When we took over, what we did is we took the entire balance sheet and basically developed a liquidity plan that would put us on the side of the angels and that cost us a great deal during 2009. It was costly to stretch out the maturities.</p>
          <p>I think that what we're signaling and if you go back to Tim's chart about those influences that will drive margin going forward, we feel pretty comfortable that we've gotten ourselves to a pretty good place. We'll continue to fine tune, we'll continue to change the liquidity profile, but we don't think it's going to have nearly the impact that we have had during 2009 when we were changing the entire balance sheet. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Eric. I think there's just one other point there that you raised, Mike, which is what level do we think would be appropriate with a smaller balance sheet. I think what the industry is slowly beginning to understand and the way regulators are proposing to take liquidity requirement is that it's going to be a feature or a factor rather relative to short-term wholesale funding. And so, the shorter you fund wholesale, the more liquid assets you will need to have. And you could get to the ridiculous extreme of having no short-term funding, say, in a three-month window, you'd need no liquid assets and the regulators will be happy.</p>
          <p>So I think going forward, there will be an increasing understanding amongst banks in the community around the relativity of the proportion of liquid assets that you have to have and your short-term funding. I think at the moment, whilst these new requirements are still some way offsettling down and potentially some considerable way offsettling down, we will maintain a level that we think is appropriate to continue to hold a very prudent funding position in our balance sheet and even just looking at 2009, we saw very different markets in the first half to those that we saw in the second half. And during that time, we've positively turned out wholesale funding and we've maintained that high level of liquid assets. So, yes, it could change over time, but I think we'll want to hold something that we would consider to be more than adequate until there is a lot more clarity from the regulators.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, just pressing on liquid assets that I was getting at, and I just really wanted to understand, you've had a 50% increase in the liquid asset pool, what impact you think that's had on the 2010 guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly, carrying that kind of a liquid asset pile has an impact on your margins because we built most of it up in the period between March and September and we showed that trajectory in the information that we gave at the time of the rights issue, the impact is built into the 1.2 billion margin drag that we've quoted for the full year here. I wouldn't expect a big extra impact on that going forward because of where markets are at the movement relative to where they have been during 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Arturo de Frias from Evolution. Three quick questions as well, please, one by one. First of all, on insurance, you mentioned the full allocation of capital to insurance within core Tier 1. Your current supervisory deductions are in the region of 11 or 11.5 billion and I tend to use that number as a proxy for the capital that you will have to allocate.</p>
          <p>If I do that and compare with the earnings from insurance, insurance could be generating an ROE of around 3% with full allocation of equity, which obviously is less than ideal. You mentioned that you were thinking, or you were considering options if this regulatory change takes place. So I would be very interested in hearing which option would you be considering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me just give you a couple of comments and then ask Tim to comment as well and then Archie, if we can peel him off the ceiling, might want to comment as well. Basically, if you recall back to the days when we were looking at Scottish Widows and some of the same kinds of capital discussions were in the forefront, what we did is looked to manage the Widows in a substantially more capital efficient manner and in fact, over the three, four years we pulled about 4.5 billion of capital out of the company.</p>
          <p>If we look forward, we have the very desirable position of having the largest insurance company in the U.K., it is really a very desirable asset, we're getting very good synergies out of it. And we see some of those same kind of opportunities to, in fact, dividend capital back-up and to therefore reduce the drag that you're talking about.</p>
          <p>So I think that overall, we've guided about as much as we can but we're fully aware of what the proposed changes are. We think, as Tim, I think, said, we have a lot of water to go under that bridge before we finally determine what the capital will be. But in the meantime, we think that there is opportunity, in fact, and we've demonstrated with Widows that we can, in fact, run the insurance businesses in a much more capital efficient fashion. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric. Before handing over to Archie, the 11 billion you're quoting includes some other bits and pieces. If you look on Page 129 of the news release, you'll find the insurance reduction quoted at about 10 billion. So I'd add that. I think also, let's remember there's a very strong dividend flow that comes out of the insurance division every year. We took in, in terms of dividends, about 500 million out during 2009. That number's buried somewhere in the news release, if you can find it. So I'd add that before Archie comes on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have a program looking at the opportunities to improve the capital position within the life companies. Now if I take you back to the early days of Widows, one of the things that we did around about 2003, 2004, was to look at the capital we were consuming in the business, i.e. in the products, and reengineer those products so that we were consuming less capital. That's one of the things that allowed us to upstream more capital.</p>
          <p>We also then restructured the businesses. As Eric said, we paid back in excess of 4 billion over a period of three or four years. Now, one of the things that we've done in 2009 is compare and contrast the product set that each boss compared to the product set that Scottish Widows side. And when we've applied the internal rate of return discipline that we used in Widows, which HBOS was not really using, we have found quite the marked difference in the profitability of the products.</p>
          <p>So for example, we've withdrawn the Clerical Medical pension products and replaced it with a Scottish Widows product. Now to give you an idea of the impact of that, that has virtually doubled the IRR of that product, because it's a completely different product. The  Clerical Medical product was a high commission-led product, i.e. capital consumptive, whereas the Scottish Widows product that we now are rolling out more and more, is a factory gate priced product which is not so capital consumptive.</p>
          <p>Now, the important thing to realize is what we are going to do with the insurance businesses is a well-beaten path. It's exactly what we did from '03 through to '08 in Widows. So this is not something new. We're not going to try and reinvent the world. We are going to do exactly the same things through allocations of costs, product and channel profitability, application of IRR disciplines and we see some great opportunities to improve the overall capital profile.</p>
          <p>The last thing I would say is, we've also got a program going looking at the overall structure of all of the businesses that we have and looking to see where we can improve and release capital from the various businesses that we have within the insurance division and we have a list of opportunities whereby we'll be able to do that. So, you're absolutely right, it is a real issue, but we're really focused on that and in 2010, we'll be doing some hard work on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I &#x2013; Arturo, Arturo, I might just add something on that. I'm sort of &#x2013; sparing Archie's blushes, the performance in there of what Widows is doing in this year, you'll find some interesting stuff buried in the news release. But there really has been a very strong &#x2013; some strong examples this year of exactly what Archie is talking about here.</p>
          <p>If I just look at the EEV margins, for example, I gave you a statistic from the podium on the U.K. life business where &#x2013; about how the second half margin improved. But within that, the performances of the two businesses are really quite different indeed. And if you just looked at how the Scottish Widows product set has performed, then the EEV margin there is actually up to 3.5% last year. So there really is some absolutely stellar work going on, and some great opportunity for improving efficiency in the newly acquired life businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. The second question was on the procyclicality, I think you mentioned that you expect the procyclicality to become a positive impact on RWAs rather than a negative, which I found very encouraging. Do you have an idea of when can that start to be seen in the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing that we've guided on specifically, so all I could really say is, look, this will come as the economy improves and as we see improvements on the underlying drivers that affect risk weighting. So clearly, we'll need to see improvement in things like unemployment and things like that and the retail sector and improved confidence and strength of cash flows in the corporate sector, for example. So the kind of things which actually we would intrinsically think would increase the likelihood of an event happening ,as those mitigate away, so the risk weightings will come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And the final one, loan-to-deposits in retail, just today, one of your competitors was talking about 100% loan-to-deposit in retail as a target. Do you still have 165? I find it extremely remarkable that two banks operating in the same market have so different views in terms of what is a correct loan-to-deposit ratio in the retail. So can I have, can I have your comments on that? What is the ideal, what is kind of aspiration for loan-to-deposit for Lloyds? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that we use a series of very clumsy ratios to try and describe and compare institutions and I don't think that they are necessarily terribly worthwhile. I think you have to look at a series of ratios and you have to look at the issue in aggregate. We, for example, just did a rather significant RMBS. It was the first one that was done in some time and that substantially &#x2013; that was a substantial sort of check in terms of our funding and liquidity plan, yet, it doesn't impact the loan-to-deposit ratio at all.</p>
          <p>So I think a much better way to look at it is through a series of measures. We've given you some of them, whether they are liquidity buffers, whether they are loan-to-deposit ratios, whether they are maturities schedules, and we will continue to give you more and more to try and help describe how we deal with the liquidity question. But I think the loan-to-deposit ratio in and of itself is a worthwhile reference point, but certainly not the end all and be all. It doesn't really describe how the business is run. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I totally agree. It is an interesting and relevant reference point and our retail ratio, as you say, is higher than I would like it to be. But one thing we're not prepared to do is to buy our way down to a lower ratio. You'll recall from the podium, I mentioned the fact that we've been successful in avoiding having to repurchase, if you like, hot money deposits by maintaining unprofitable, unsustainable rates. And obviously not all of that was from the retail side, but some of it was.</p>
          <p>If I'd chosen to continue to pay for those deposits, we could have improved the ratio and you wouldn't have thanked me on the margin side of it. I actually would rather de-risk the overall funding as we're doing. So loans-deposit ratios are relevant, but I don't think a regulator would actually think it a terribly good idea to fund 100% of a retail bank from customer deposits. Because what you're really saying there is that you want 100% of your mortgage book funded by customer deposits that are basically withdrawal on demand. Is that really a sensible funding profile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would only add to that, that one of the things that we have to remember is that while there clearly were some issues and liquidity was very much the watchword during the past year, that one of the reasons why, in fact, we have seen more people in more homes, one of the reasons why we've been able to have business expansion is, in fact, because we have very efficient financial markets that allow some additional leverage over and above the very traditional, basically nineteenth century banking, if you will.</p>
          <p>So, I think that we have to be very careful about the excesses. We have to be very careful about staying on the side of prudence. But to suggest that we basically have one-for-one funding, I'm not sure, in fact, that, that would serve the economy terribly well or society terribly well.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Can we have the next question please? Right behind.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Joe Dickerson from Execution. If I look on your balance sheet, you've got about 26 billion of loan loss reserves in addition to the fair value adjustment on the HBOS portfolio. And I am wondering if as the loss environment improves, it's roughly 3.5% of loans. So as the loss environment improves, say, going out to the end of 2011, what is your flexibility to release these reserves and what would the timing be and then also, what would be the priority for the uses of this release? And I ask in the context of the government stake holding, because if you could release, say, half of those reserves, you could pay off the government stake holding. And then following on that, what is the plan to get HMT off the shareholder register? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a number written on the back of my jacket. In fact, I really correct on your numbers are just around the table. So you're correctly extracting. I think, I would encourage you not to go away sadly, thinking that we have sandbagged the provisions and we're just waiting to be able to release them. The provisions that we've set up as part of the Lloyds approach to risk management and impairment assessment are to look at the cash flows that we expect to get from an asset that has come under stress and to look at those cash flows on a discounted basis, and to provide accordingly.</p>
          <p>Now we would love to see some releases from those provisions. That will come if our assessment of the cash flows that will come from an impaired asset actually improves in the future. And that could be because somebody who is in arrears gets back into job and stops being in arrears. It could be because a building that's one short of a full set of tenants gets a full set of tenants and suddenly the whole exposure of us changes. So there will be all sorts of reasons why we might have releases, but I wouldn't encourage you to go away thinking that we could simply take half of it back  to P&amp;L.</p>

          <p>Well, I think that there has been a fair amount of speculation about the government stake, which currently stands at 41%. I think we've been very, very clear that our ambition and our goal is to return to being a wholly privately owned company, one that pays dividends and behaves as a normal bank.</p>
          <p>We have made no statements in terms of when we expect that to happen. I think that we would really be better served speaking or you might be better served speaking to the UKFI about that. We think that the best way to, in fact, achieve those kinds of &#x2013; the goals of returning to full private ownership is to, in fact, outperform, get the stock price up. That makes the sale of the government stake very, very easy indeed. What we have told you today is that we've used the year well to build a solid platform for growth, that all of the trends, the key drivers, are moving in the right direction and that we expect a strong trajectory of financial performance going forward. So we think that that is our best route to achieving that goal that I've talked about.</p>

Just on margins, sorry to recover old ground, but I'm almost mildly incredulous at the suggestion that rising base rates for Lloyds could be a net negative for margins. That's certainly not what it says in your arrow chart.</p>
          <p>So can I just ask a question around a slightly more negative scenario than your base case is, i.e. GDP growth less than 1.8%, slightly falling house prices, certainly no interest rate rise this year, maybe not next year. I think your arrow chart is still guiding us to a net interest margin of 2% plus in 2010 and 2011 under that scenario. Haven't you been low-balling us on the cost synergies for 18 months, so are you keeping a bit in reserve on margin too?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on costs, it's only a small point. Deferred bonuses, clearly a smaller issue for you than your U.K. peers. Are you pushing any of the cost into future years like some of your peers are, or are you fully creating the deferred compensation costs in your 2009 expense numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, why don't I sort of give a heading answer and then turn it over to Timothy. I think the thrust of your question is, are we in fact low balling and should you then mark your spreadsheets to the upside? I think that what I would repeat is that, when we give guidance and we have given greatly enhanced guidance over the past couple of times we've been on this platform, we take it very seriously indeed. And our clear policy and objective is to meet or exceed that guidance. I think if you looked at one of my charts and then at one of Tim's, we can tick a lot of those boxes, in fact, all of the boxes on the guidance that we've given.</p>
          <p>That said, what we don't believe is that creating a false impression, i.e. that creating low barriers that we can jump over easily is necessarily terribly good guidance. When we give it, we think it's reasonably meaningful. Now clearly, if we have a different economic scenario, we will have a different outcome and we have warned you both in Tim's speech as well as mine that we have a defined economic scenario and we are forecasting our performance based on that economic scenario. If we were to see a substantially worse environment, slower growth and worse house prices and so on, we undoubtedly would have an impact.</p>
          <p>What we have told you, though, is that within our stressed scenarios, we're pretty comfortable with our capital position and we're pretty comfortable that we will, in fact, continue to achieve growth, albeit it will be slower in coming through if we were in fact to have a weaker recovery. Tim?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree with all of that and the answer to the last part of your question is, yes. We do expense in full.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Right across the hall, please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's Andy Wilson from Goldman Sachs. I've got two questions, if I may. The first one is if I understand your guidance correctly, you've said that you expect revenue, high single-digit revenue growth in your core operations. So, I was just wanting to know what you view as your revenue contribution from non-core in 2009? Second question is related to cost income. Earlier, you've said that you expect an improvement of 2% per year, more in the earlier years and I wanted to know on a headline basis if this is true for 2010 as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the second question and then turn it over to Tim for the first. In terms of our cost:income ratio, what we had said is that as we have the synergies coming through in the earlier years, that, in fact, we will do better than 200 basis points of improvement in the cost:income ratio and that will certainly apply for 2010 and 2011. So, I think that if you looked at the cost:income ratio improvement this year, admittedly with one timers as Tom has pointed out, that we improved by 900 basis points during the year. I'm not by any means guiding to a similar number for 2010, but we will have better than the 200 basis points of improvement. Tim, did you want to talk about revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the revenue guidance is around continuing businesses so that's using a similar type of definition that we use when we're presenting results in the numbers that you see up here. So that's where, for example, you adjust it out of comparatives sales of businesses. So these examples, for example, the numbers this year take out of the comparatives the impact of the sale of HBOS's Australian business. So it's not about adjusting so much for sort of non-core sort of asset run down. This is adjusting for continuing businesses using the type of definition you would find in the front of the news release.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. But just to clarify, Eric, then, you're talking about a headline basis including your sort of 1.5 billion debt management income that you had in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, the 1.5 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point here is, your start point, you should take the '09 numbers and then adjust out the one-time on income to give you the start point, if you're trying to predict a cost:income ratio going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you. May we have a question upfront here, please, the lady?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="inaudible" /> from RBS. Before we get carried away talking about releasing credit reserves, can we just ask about the coverage ratio and where you think that's going in the new world, because that 44% still looks relatively low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I didn't get that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the coverage ratio. It's interesting, <mark type="inaudible" />, I totally understand the question. We tend very much to look at the coverage ratio as the answer rather than something we are targeting. And it is very, very dependent upon the mix. And if you've got the right approach to assessing your impairments going in, then you will come out with an appropriate coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>And I understand it's very, very difficult to compare different institutions, but obviously, for a business like ourselves, where half of the balance sheet is actually in mortgages, you could have an impaired asset, one that meets the definition of impaired asset, where the asset is &#x2013; it can be relatively large compared to the impairment provision, that you would need to be effectively taking 100% of your potential exposure. So it's very difficult and I do feel for you all in trying to compare different businesses on coverage ratios. But we are very comfortable with the coverage ratios that we have, that we think are appropriate and match our prudent approach to assessing impairment levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thanks a lot, I've got two quick questions, the first one is coming back to net interest income, I'm afraid. And excepting that the banking margin went up in the second half, that obviously only captures, albeit a majority, but it only captures some of the total net interest income. And I think the net interest income actually fell because the trading and Treasury contribution fell from 800 million in the first half to nothing in the second half of the year, and I know that can move around a little bit, but I just want confirmation there is no movement of certain types of funding costs out of what we may deem to be proper core banking businesses? And if you can give us some idea as to where that trading and Treasury net interest income goes next year, sorry, this year, that would help?</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, I can put your mind at rest, there is no jiggery-pokery between halves on moving funding costs. You know me better than that in terms of getting to the right answer. So, and in terms of that line going forward, I'm afraid we can't give guidance on any particular area or line of business performance in the future. That's something I can't give you, so I haven't put it in the news release.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you help explain why it dropped so much then, because there was a 800 million delta on it first half of the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is anything particularly in there. I mean, there were different levels of performance from the different lines that are in there. But I am not aware of anything sinister or something I feel we should flag to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question is on the SLS. I was surprised to read this morning that the cost was LIBOR plus 50, because effectively, we were led to believe that it was fat LIBOR for all banks participating. Has there been some premium that you've had to pay simply because of the size of the SLS utilization in HBOS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've never commented before on the costing of it. So, I am not sure where you say we've been led to believe. Certainly, if you look at the SLS documentation, there is scope in there for the bank to charge a higher premium where they deem that the take is more than they had expected. And that's what happened on the HBOS bit and that's why we've quoted that 50 basis points over today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what &#x2013; just to add on to what Tim said and I completely agree with his answer, what happened was that there were varying rates depending on the institution and depending on the usage. And so, what Tim has given you is a blended cost for the two institutions and they are very different historically. So what you're seeing is the overall blended cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and final sub-question, I promise. On the SLS effect on the balance sheet, whereabouts, if anywhere, can we see the SLS monies that you've drawn within your funding breakdown or it is completely off balance sheet? Is it in repos, is it in the wholesale lending breakdown that you provided?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That bit of it that has been repoed is in the repos bit, that is my columns on there and obviously some of it is still held in Treasury bills that hasn't been repoed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. May we have a question here, right there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andrew Lim from Matrix. I've got a question on your balance sheet. Yes, you're running off non-core assets and indeed, if you see half on half, your assets are falling nicely, down 3% but your risk-weighted assets, actually increased 2% half on half, which I think quite surprising, because isn't the case that the non-core assets that you're running off is higher risk than the book of business that you are retaining? And could you explain what's going on there and the future trends for risk-weighted assets going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. We certainly expect to see future reductions in the risk-rated assets from the asset run downs we get as well as the effects of positive procyclicality. Certainly in the second half, we did see some negative impacts of procyclicality. So just despite what you sometimes see in the headlines, you need to understand the individual profiles of the different books.</p>
          <p>And clearly, we work very closely with our colleagues in risk and all of the modeling teams as we seek to predict what the appropriate risk weighting should be and the various factors that go into that. I think what you've got there is, you can see the impact of some of that work coming through in the second half. But that should turn around as we see the economy improve, when we would expect both aspects, so asset reduction as well as procyclical effects, to have a positive impact going forward, i.e. positive lower, I mean lower RWAs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately, we're running down in time. So can I suggest that we do the following. We have Mike and Tim, who will be available if there are any specific detailed questions regarding how we account for things or how to interpret the presentations. We certainly will be happy to stay and answer those in one-to-ones. But are there any more generalized questions that we could answer before we wrap this? Yes, down, down here please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Steve Hayne from Morgan Stanley. I had two questions, but I'll cut it to one, given time. You kindly gave us a slide showing the impact on running down or right sizing the balance sheet, and you have an indication of the 240 going down. And on the slide, it draws a straight line with an arrow. And I think it's absolutely critical to the investment case for your stock about what happens to net interest income, that's clearly volume times margin.</p>
          <p>So I would really appreciate it if you could give us a bit more of a view. I know you don't like to expand your guidance, but I think it is absolutely critical what sort of run-down schedule we should predict on that non-core, given one of your competitors only yesterday gave us an explicit year-by-year number that we, as analysts, can track. And for you, I'm wondering, do I just effectively straight-line it as you've indicated on the slide? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the right way to think about it and as you suggest, we can't give you any more guidance, that we have said that we have 200 billion that we will run off by the end of 2014. We have taken 60 billion off in the first year. So that's about as much guidance as we can give you. We also said there is an additional 100 billion that we will take off after 2014. So again, I think we've been pretty explicit. You'll have to, I think, make up your own mind about the trajectory. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, frankly, I'd love to give you more information. But what I'd probably best is to remind you of some of the things we said in the summer. We actually said in the summer that we thought there would be quite a slow start to the run-off, reflecting the economic conditions and that we would run the portfolio for value, which we felt would be running it down over time.</p>
          <p>What we saw were opportunities to actually accelerate some of the run down and do it in a way that had no impact on the income statement. So all we got was the positive impact from reducing our wholesale funding needs and the flexibility that gave us in funding and you saw the benefit of that coming through in the margin impact in the second half. So going forwards, I know you want to do volume times margin play to derive the income statement in your models. But we will run the portfolio down over time, but for value, and have minimal impact on the P&amp;L. That's our focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Do we have, yes, right there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, it's Michael Helsby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just two quick questions, firstly, I know you mentioned Ireland. Clearly, we all know Ireland is going through a difficult spot, but I think most people would have been surprised by the extent the bad debt jumped in the fourth quarter. So I was just wondering if you could give us some more color. Clearly you've given us a broader bad debt guidance for the Group, but just what exactly you're thinking about in terms of Ireland?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, Royal Bank yesterday gave us a stable funding ratio. I was wondering if you'd be able to give us your stable funding ratio for the end of '09 and if the assets run off as you think, what you might be able to get to by the time both comes through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good to see you, Michael, and thanks for the questions. In terms of Ireland, yeah, very clearly, we gave you in August a cautionary note in terms of our guidance. We were concerned about the Irish portfolios, we remain concerned about them. Basically they're very, very heavily concentrated in real estate, both commercial and residential. And that basically, they are therefore going to be a very high beta portfolio.</p>
          <p>The economy in Ireland clearly is not out of the woods yet. We have a rather bearish view of where the Irish economy is going, around 2% drop in GDP and in our guidance, we have said that we expect that in fact, our impairments take that into effect. So we expect that we will have peaked on the Irish impairments. But we are very cautious about them. There is less of a sense of confidence, I think, than we have in our other portfolios. Very fortunately, they make up a pretty small part of our balance sheet. So I think that we feel very confident to the overall guidance that we have given. Tim, did you want to take the second?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the second point, Michael, no, we haven't quite &#x2013; but I did see what Royal Bank did &#x2013; said yesterday and we had a quick look at this last night. We came out with a very similar number to roll back, but pick me up afterwards and I'll take you through it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good, last question over on the left, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, it's Simon Samuels from Barclays Capital. Two questions and they are both kind of follow-on from previous ones. The first is, just on the balance sheet shrinkage, the 200 billion, in the summer, Tim, you put up a slide with a kind of a fan effect saying that it's 200 billion down, that you're going to grow by 100 billion and so the net reduction was 100 billion. Is that still the case or are you now shrinking faster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, absolutely, what we said in the summer was we wanted to create optionality and flexibility for us to reinvest in our core business and that is still the case today. In fact, when you get a chance to read the CFO review in the news release, you'll find us talking about building that flexibility into our business plan so that we absolutely have capacity to grow our core businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you still planning to reinvest half of the shrinkage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we said in the summer was reinvest up to half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is no change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And the second question, picking up Eric's last comment, I am on Page 89 of the news release, you're obviously mega-bearish on Ireland and really picking up the earlier comment about coverage ratios, given that you've got 30 billion of advances in Ireland, 10 billion approximately in non-performing, but your coverage ratio is only 37% against those NPLs in Ireland, which just feels, given &#x2013; well, anyway, the best of times. But given all those comments about the uncertainly of the outlook, just still is a very, very light number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, remember also, you've got the fair value impairment provisions there, which also on Page 89 are a further &#xA3;5 billion, which would increase the impairment provisions by more than 50%. So you're approaching 60% coverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much for coming, one and all. And we'll look forward to seeing you as we present the interims, if not before. Thanks again.</p>
