          <p>Good morning. We are going to begin the Presentation of Results for the First Quarter of 2011. The procedure will be as usual, questions from the floor, questions over the phone and finally over the internet. And our aim is to finish no later than 11:00. So, the Chairman, Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n has the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Good morning. Thank you all very much for attending, those in the room physically and those connected by phone or through the website. We will follow the usual structure for the presentation. First I'll discuss the keys for this first quarter, then the CFO will give more details on the results for the entire Group. And I will end with some brief conclusions, and we will move on to the questions. And between Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro, [indiscernible] and I will try to answer all your questions.</p>
          <p>Firstly between January and March 2011 the net profits of Iberdrola grew 10.1% and this is really important. For the first time we have gone over the magic figure of &#x20AC;1 billion in just one quarter, the highest figure we've ever had in the history of the company in a single quarter, over &#x20AC;1 billion. This has been possible in spite of a complicated environment, but thanks to a business portfolio that is diversified, that has enabled us to grow in gross margin in spite of the lower production compared to a record quarter last year. I think that as one of the keys, we have made a tremendous effort to contain costs and as a result of that we have improved efficiency by 13%.</p>
          <p>EBITDA grew 4.4% to &#x20AC;2.273 billion. Again the gross margin grew about 1%, expenses went down 13%, EBITDA grew 4.4%. And through the quarter we have also continued to improve our financial position as we can see in the positive performance of our ratios, that driving a cash generation of 11% in this quarter amounting to a figure close to &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>These results are not results obtained by chance but are the result of a business model that has guided Iberdrola throughout the last decade and which is fully consistent with the 100 year history of this Group. It's a model which by focusing on the basic business, the production and supply of electricity, has helped us to multiply by three both our installed capacity and our number of customers.</p>
          <p>The main motor behind this growth has been a greater internationalization effort so that the traditional business in Spain which represented 99% of the operating results a decade ago now only represents 40% of total EBITDA. Iberdrola is a group today that is present in 40 countries and is highly concentrated in the Atlantic area and is a significant operator in Spain, U.K., United States, Mexico and Brazil and also has growing presence in other countries in Continental Europe.</p>
          <p>A decisive contribution has been made by our increased capacity to generate clean energy, where Iberdrola has been a pioneer. And remember, few years ago, one of our colleagues said that the wind never blew when you needed it, so it wasn't worthwhile investing in this sector. But we have carried out first of all hydroelectric developments and then wind power, a technology where we are world leaders.</p>
          <p>Another outstanding sign of Iberdrola is our approach on operating efficiency. And this has enabled us not only to expand this philosophy, but also to attain scale economies that wouldn't have been attained and synergies which have made it possible to continue to exchange best practices between the different businesses in the Group.</p>
          <p>And finally the prudence that has always guided our decisions in the area of financing has enabled us to maintain a solid position over these years, in spite of market turbulences.</p>
          <p>The application of this business model has made Iberdrola a great Group, whose value is much greater than the sum of its parts. It's a global Group, with sufficient critical mass to undertake new projects for profitable growth, such as the recent acquisition of Elektro in Brazil or the development of ocean wind energy that we are starting in the U.K., access to favorable conditions in our acquisitions from suppliers, the diversification of operating and regulatory risks, the possibility of maximizing efficiency and exchanging best practices, which is reflected in the operating expenses of the Group, as we saw earlier.</p>
          <p>And finally, this international presence of Iberdrola enables us to obtain financing in very competitive terms. And if we were only a Spanish company, the costs would probably be infinitely higher or difficult to obtain. The best demonstration of the success of our model is the creation of value obtained by our shareholders during this period. The growth for Group activities from the year 2000 has been accompanied by a major increase in results, an 8% average annual growth in income per share, and also in paid-out dividends that have grown more than 10% per year and aggregately represent over &#x20AC;10 billion paid out during the period. And this will be &#x20AC;11 billion, if the shareholders approve the motion to be presented at our shareholders meeting.</p>
          <p>As a result of this our shareholders have obtained a total return 100 points higher than the average of European utilities, and of course much more than in other activity sectors in Spain and abroad. Looking to the future we are convinced that the Iberdrola that we have created during recent years will continue to maintain a high growth for potential in the future. And in order to maximize this potential we recently modified our organization model stressing even further the achievement of synergies, efficiencies and exchange of best practices.</p>
          <p>We will therefore continue on a path that started with the first integration of areas such as treasury, purchasing, communication, and systems, and which enabled us to obtain initial savings of close to &#x20AC;200 million with the British and American integration. And the Group then immediately adopted a management model by countries promoting the exchange of best practices and the savings obtained in this sector through this process already represent &#x20AC;380 million a year. Last year we decided to move forward even more by integrating corporate areas by creating a single corporation, which is already reporting profits of &#x20AC;120 million per year through the optimization of corporate processes in areas such as human resources, corporate resources, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Well, this step that we took last year now means that we manage the Group by global businesses. And as we explained on Investors Day in February, we are starting to carry out the necessary tasks to pick up of the maximum possible savings through a greater homogenization of aspects such as the business processes or equipment design. And we are convinced that this will enable us in the future to obtain new efficiencies both in operating expenses and investments.</p>
          <p>Together with the significant transformation during the first quarter of 2011 we have carried out three operations that we are convinced will enable us to continue with the Group optimization process. First of all, we have come to an agreement with Qatar Holding because this company has become a strategic partner of Iberdrola.</p>
          <p>The agreement includes, apart from an investor with a vocation of being stable and permanent, it represents a new step in the Iberdrola internationalization process, since it includes the possibility of jointly undertaking projects in areas such as Latin America, Middle-East and Asia.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we've recently closed the acquisition of the distribution company, Elektro in Brazil that has more than 2 million points of supply in the states of S&#xE3;o Paulo and Mato Grosso and which presents some wonderful prospects, and perhaps later on you can talk about this because you've been there. But at this point in time we are now initiating the integration of the company and I have to say that the process is going wonderfully well. And in this regard, I would like to underscore the high management standards that we are finding in the company and this is a magnificent operation at all levels.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, and as you all know, in March we submitted a proposal for a merger with Iberdrola Renovables, which we hope will be carried out in the next few months.</p>
          <p>These three operations are fully coherent with the Group's business model, because they are based on three of the main factors, that it is improving the business portfolio, internationalization and efforts to maintain our financial stability.</p>
          <p>As regards this final point, the operations are going to good in grid without compromising our balance structure. So, therefore the funds that will arise from the extension of capital that has been carried out to allow the access of Qatar Holding are going to be used for the acquisition of Elektro Brazil, whose results will be consolidated as from the month of May, as well as for the merger with Iberdrola Renovables.</p>
          <p>But not only that, that is the balance sheet management actions carried out in the quarter have allowed us to improve the debt profile and the Group's financial ratios.</p>
          <p>We have made bond issues for a total of &#x20AC;1.5 billion in the quarter, and liquidity right now stands at &#x20AC;10.7 billion, now that the funds corresponding to the take of Elektro have been paid out. So, that means that the Group has met its funding requirements for the next 18 months.</p>
          <p>Likewise, I would also like to underscore how the collection process is going as regards the tariff insufficiency in Spain, which have represented an income of &#x20AC;1.8 billion for Iberdrola, and which all hope will continue in the month of May. And there might be another issue very soon along the lines of the statements made by the Ministry of Industry. And this has allowed the rating agencies to recently reaffirm our credit rating.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to talk about the main aspects that have to do with the results of this period and later on, the CFO will be talking about this in much greater depth. I would like to repeat that the Group has behaved very well in a complex quarter, from an operational perspective. There has been a drop in production and distributed power and we've increased the gross margin by 1% and we now stand at &#x20AC;3.256 billion.</p>
          <p>And the positive trends in the Grid business that shows the better &#x2013; the improvements that have been achieved &#x2013; that were achieved last year. We've been working with all the regulators. And we have now managed to carry out adaptations and improvements that we can see in our operating results.</p>
          <p>So, this growth, together with the growth of Renovables, whose gross margin has grown 5%, because there's been 11% growth in wind power, that has been partially counteracted by the contribution made by the Gas business in the United States, have made it possible to compensate the slump in the Liberalized business. And this has also managed to cover the reduction of margins in the U.K. And last year, in Spain, we had a record year, in terms of wind power and electricity.</p>
          <p>And as regards costs, the Group has reacted to the operational environment of the quarter and has boosted gains in efficiency. This parameter has increased by 13% and has improved 20% since the integration with our colleagues in the United States was carried out in full. And in this regard, the net operating expenses have dropped by more than 12% in the quarter, which means that this is a reduction of &#x20AC;108 million in absolute terms.</p>
          <p>The savings, we also have savings in staff. We have had a 5% improvement as well as in the external services that have dropped by more than 18% and we now have a single corporation and we have an organization that is based on credible business areas. The Grid business has also benefited from the efficiency improvements obtained in the United States where operating expenses have dropped another 40% and there has been also a cost reduction in Spain.</p>
          <p>We have to recall that the results of the first quarter of 2010 still included the costs corresponding to the Connecticut gas companies. As regards the Liberalized business, the net operating expenses are, have reduced 2% thanks to the reductions obtained in the U.K. and Mexico and thanks to the flat behavior of Spain.</p>
          <p>And finally, Iberdrola Renovables has improved its operating cost ratio per installed megawatt for another quarter. The improvement of the gross margin together with costs savings have made it possible to achieve a 4.4% increase in EBITDA that now stands at &#x20AC;2.273 billion. And the grid activity is working very well thanks to improvements in the gross margins and thanks to improvements in efficiencies.</p>
          <p>There has also been an increase in taxation and these taxes have been multiplied by two in Spain and we have nowadays what are called nuclear taxes and local taxes and regional taxes. And we've had a positive impact in the different actions implemented in order to optimize the structure of our liabilities. For instance, the increase in operating cash flow together with the control of investments and the collection of debts because of the tariff insufficiency in Spain, have made it possible to reduce the debt by &#x20AC;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, equity has increased by more than &#x20AC;4 billion, thanks to the capital extension and thanks to the profits retained. And we now have exceeded a figure of &#x20AC;34.4 billion. So, that means that leverage stands at 40%, which represents an improvement of nearly six points in relation to the figure reported 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>And the main financial ratios have also undergone a significant improvement, which we hope will maintain us at the levels of the A rating even after the operations in which Elektro Brazil and Renovables have been taken over.</p>
          <p>And finally, the solid operating evolution and better financial position of the company have produced an increase in excess of 10% in net profits, that is more than &#x20AC;1 billion. And there has also been an increase in the cash flow which has gone up 10.6% and now stands very close to &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to give the floor to the CFO, Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, who is going to be explaining this in greater detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Thank you, Chairman I will now review the most important aspects in the account and the business evolution and will end up with an analysis of the financial situation of the Group. As the Chairman said, the company obtained a growth of more than 10% both in operating cash flow and in reported net profits and recurring net profits.</p>
          <p>The income figures have also been accompanied by an improvement in operating costs and financial costs and this makes it possible to present excellent results this quarter. The sales figure grew 10.4% to &#x20AC;8.483 billion, especially in the Liberalized business because of the increase in prices and also the exchange rate which has had a positive effect.</p>
          <p>Regarding procurements for the group, they grew 18% to &#x20AC;5.149 billion basically because of the same reasons. The gross margin increased by 1% to &#x20AC;3.255 billion, since the good performance as mentioned by the Chairman in the Regulated business, Brazil and renewable, and the positive effect of the exchange rate offset the drop in the gross margin for the Liberalized business. And it's also had a negative effect on the selling of businesses in Connecticut and Guatemala. The basic margin went up 0.9% very much in line with the gross margin.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses showed an improvement of 12.1%, in spite of having increases, in this case, of about &#x20AC;40 million because of the exchange rate, offset through the selling of the businesses in Guatemala and Connecticut. In this positive performance we have the personnel expense control and efficiencies applied to the Group, which have had an effect on net external services and net personnel expenses, and as I said, the net personnel expenses dropped 5.1% to &#x20AC;407 million.</p>
          <p>The net external services were reduced by 18.7% to &#x20AC;376 million. However, there is a difference in accounting criteria, regarding 2010, regarding the inclusion as other income of facilities according to IFRIC 18, and the attendance premium for the shareholders meeting, which in 2010 was held in March and which in 2011 will be held in May. Excluding non-recurring profits, there is an improvement of 7%. And this good performance has been partly reduced by the increase in levies to be paid by the Group, which increased by 18.9% to &#x20AC;263 million, mainly because of the Liberalized business levies in Spain, which grew by almost 46%, as the Chairman said.</p>
          <p>The consolidated EBITDA for the Group reached &#x20AC;2.273 billion, an increase of 4.4% in homogenous terms, in other words, excluding the exchange rate effect and the change in the consolidation parameter after the selling of the Connecticut and Guatemala businesses, growth would have been almost 5%.</p>
          <p>This growth of 4.4% obtained in the consolidated EBITDA for the Group is based on our diversified business model, which has been reinforced by the growth in the most stable businesses with the lowest risk, such as the Regulated business of Brazil and Renewables, which have offset the greater volatility in the Liberalized business.</p>
          <p>If we analyze the operating profit by businesses according to the new structure for the Group and starting with the Regulated business, EBITDA, which includes the results for Spain Regulated, U.K. Regulated and United States, grew by 23.8% to &#x20AC;843 million. This high growth substantially improves the results obtained in gross margin 5.9%, thanks to a 30% improvement in the net operating expenses. The Spanish Regulated business makes the biggest contribution, 47% of the total. United States and U.K. carry a similar weight of around 27% each. Regarding growth of the U.K. Regulated, business grew 18.9% and the Regulated business in the U.S. grew by 11.1%.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the Regulated business in Spain grew by 35.4% to almost &#x20AC;400 million, thanks to the increase in the gross margin of 15.8%, and the major improvement in net operating expenses. The growth in gross margin is a result of the recognized income for the Regulated business. And we have to remember that during the first month of 2010 a provisional remuneration was included in the books which was lower than was finally approved in the electricity access tariffs based on the reference grid model.</p>
          <p>So, the development income is not comparable, and that's why in this first quarter we have very high figures that will be homogenized during the fourth quarter. The increase of 35% in EBITDA more than doubles the gross margin results, thanks to the significant improvement, as I said, in operating expenses which dropped by 28.6% due to efficiency improvements and the accounting reclassification that I already mentioned related to IFRIC 18, which has an impact of &#x20AC;19 million in Spain. If we deduct this effect the improvement in gross operating profits in Spain would have continued to be 14%.</p>
          <p>The Regulated business in the U.K reached an EBITDA of &#x20AC;219 million with an increase of 18.9%, through an increase of 22.2% in gross margin as a result of the great investments made and scheduled through the new remuneration for the business DBCR5, applied since April 1st, 2010, and because of the average 4% appreciation of the pound during this period.</p>
          <p>This good performance in EBITDA has been achieved in spite of a 38.9% isolated increase in net operating expenses, which is due to the activation of certain investment project costs which will unwind during the year. And I would just like to say that in the U.K., a large part of the operating expenses are capitalized more than in Spain and the United States.</p>
          <p>The U.S. Regulated business provides an EBITDA of &#x20AC;225 million under the IFRS regulations, which represents an increase of 11.1%. This positive performance has been achieved in spite of the sale of the Connecticut business, which represented &#x20AC;43 million less in EBITDA. The improvement in business operations, especially in relation to costs, the increase in tariffs because of the new rate case and the new main line, have offset this effect during this quarter, as well as the exclusion of the operating expenses from the gas companies that were sold.</p>
          <p>Iberdrola USA has had major efficiency improvements, which has made it possible to improve operating expenses by 41%. There is also an effective exchange rate situation because of the appreciation of the dollar with &#x20AC;6 million more in EBITDA and also the U.S. GAAP effects which contribute &#x20AC;20 million more to the EBITDA.</p>
          <p>And now I'll move on to the case of Spain, U.K. and Mexico. EBITDA in the Liberalized business fell by 14.1% to &#x20AC;779 million. The better performance of the business in Spain whose EBITDA grew 10% and represents close to 70% of the total in spite of the major increase in the levies paid, has not offset the worse situation in the UK.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA, which dropped 54% because of lower margins and sales in spite of the fact that the area improved expenses by 2.3%. Starting with the Liberalized business in Spain there was a reduction in the ordinary regime production basically because of a drop of &#x2013; the reduction in hydraulic production. However, 82% of the Group reduction in Spain, or the ordinary regime in Spain continues to be emission free.</p>
          <p>An average sales price of &#x20AC;60 per MWh has been achieved and this has provided a greater margin in spite of growing supply costs. EBITDA grew 10% to &#x20AC;541 million because of the improvement in the basic margin, 12.4% to &#x20AC;860 million. Additionally there is a non-recurring positive effect of &#x20AC;50 million associated to a provision in 2009.</p>
          <p>The net operating expenses only grew 1.6%, much lower than the growth in the basic margin. An increase in expenses linked to higher activities is offset by the efficiency measures. The 64 TWh production estimated for 2011 have been sold at a price of more than &#x20AC;56 per MWh. And 26 TWh have already been sold for 2012 over &#x20AC;60 per MWh.</p>
          <p>And the Spanish forward is still 9% lower than the European average, in line with recent years. And the hydraulic reserves continue at maximum points close to 80%, 8,700 GWh.</p>
          <p>The growth in the Spanish Liberalized EBITDA has increased, as the Chairman said, in spite of an increase of 46% in levies, amounting to &#x20AC;135 million and this represents 25% of this EBITDA.</p>
          <p>And in fact in the last two years the levies in this business have practically doubled from &#x20AC;77 million to &#x20AC;135 million. And as the Chairman said, this is due to several factors, the nuclear levy which has had a major increase, the new levies related to the financing for energy saving and efficiency plans, and the new generator levy, the social bonus and the eco-tax in <mark type="indiscernible" />, which we have appealed again.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA in the Liberalized business in the U.K. dropped by 54.2% to &#x20AC;148 million. This negative performance is basically due to a reduction of 39% in basic margin in an environment of less production, an 11% drop globally, 4% in electricity and 12% in gas and higher procurement costs that have not been offset by an equivalent increase in the electricity sales price.</p>
          <p>The net operating expenses improved by 6.8%, thanks to the reduction in external services and maintenance costs. We estimate that during 2011 there will be a progressive recovery in the margins, both for electricity and gas. We also have to highlight that the forward curves are pointing to possible tariff increases during 2011 to compensate the increase in the price of fuel.</p>
          <p>We must also say that this is an especially unfavorable quarter from the comparative point of view since the first quarter of 2010 showed especially positive results in the area of retail gas because of the cold temperature recording during that winter.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA for the Liberalized business in Mexico fell 1.4% to &#x20AC;89.7 million. The exchange rate effect is positive after a 2.8% revaluation in the average inter-annual exchange rate for the dollar, while there is a negative impact from the consolidation parameter after the selling of the business in Guatemala.</p>
          <p>Excluding both effects the underlying operations for the business improved by 9%, thanks to the improvement in the heat rate margin and power station availability. The drop of 1.4% in EBITDA improved the gross margin from minus 2.2%, thanks to a 5.7% reduction in net operating expenses because of greater efficiencies in the selling of Guatemala.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The EBITDA of the pure renewable business grew 9.3% and now stands at &#x20AC;428.3 million. Installed capacity grew 13.6% and operating capacity 6.6% and now stands at 12,584 megawatts and production 12.1%.</p>
          <p>The load factor dropped from 29.4% to 28.3%, fundamentally because of Spain because the first quarter of 2010 was exceptional in the United States; it went up 27% to 31% and in the U.K, 21% to 23%. And wind power in this country is still abnormally low for the second year running. And the prices have reached &#x20AC;71.6 per MWh, which is slightly below those of the same period of 2010.</p>
          <p>In addition, control efforts have been carried out for costs and OpEx per operating megawatt have improved by 1.5%. And this good evolution of the Renewables business compares with the weak contribution of the Gas business with only &#x20AC;24 billion. It has been affected by the weakness of gas prices in the United States, which have placed the total EBITDA of the company at &#x20AC;453 billion with a growth of 2.6%.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of Brazil has grown 4% and now stands at &#x20AC;140 million, and the quarter has been very unfavorable because of resettlements totaling &#x20AC;21 million that had been included in the first quarter of 2010. And this compensates the positive impact arising from the appreciation of the real by 10.2%, which represents another &#x20AC;14 billion in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>But the gross margin of the business has increased 8.7%, because there has been a 7.5% increase in demand and also because there has been an improvement in the unit margins after the tariff revision of April in 2010, and also thanks to the new hydraulic capacity in operations. The GON has increased 24.8%, and half of this increase has to do with the effect caused by the rate of exchange and the rest has to do with inflation increases and because there has been more activity.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of other businesses from engineering and non-energy businesses have grown 38.6% and now stand at &#x20AC;55.6 million. The improvement in engineering margins in this quarter covers the weakness of the rest of the businesses that encompass real estate and other industrial shares, and also because there has been a big cost contention effort.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the Group went up 4.4% and now stands at &#x20AC;760 [sic] &#x20AC;670 million in line with the growth reported in terms of EBITDA. And we've also had more procurement. Amortizations now stand at &#x20AC;335 million, which is 5.2% more because of the greater installed power and Renewables, and also because Scottish Power Networks has made a large investment, and also because of the impact of IFRIC 18 on the Distribution business. And the forecasts have dropped 7.7%; it now stands at &#x20AC;34.7 million.</p>
          <p>The first quarter non-recurrent provisions were provided, which have increased the comparison base. The financial results have improved 24%, thanks to the impact that has been produced by the exchange rate hedgings for the results of the branches. And the currency market has been completely different compared to the first quarter of 2010 and has been very favorable for the financial results.</p>
          <p>Iberdrola is still maintaining its policy aimed at reducing volatility in the net results and has therefore provided more coverage. And the financial expense related to debt has improved very slightly in relation to 2010 after reducing the average balance of the debt, which contracts the slight increase of the average costs, which stands at 4.3%.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the higher rate of deficit remuneration has a positive impact of nearly &#x20AC;8 million and is a remuneration system that is linked to the Euribor of the previous year and in 2010 it was 0.7% and in 2011 it's been 1%.</p>
          <p>The recurrent net profits show a 10% increase and now stand at &#x20AC;932 million. The lower contribution of non-recurrents can be compensated with the lower tax rate that has, includes the effect produced by the tax reduction of 1% in the U.K. and this has a very significant influence on deferred taxes. So, that means that the reported net profits now have gone up to &#x20AC;1 billion, which is really in line with our recurrent growth.</p>
          <p>As regards funding, as the President pointed out, after the securitizations and after the usual settlements there has been a substantial reduction in the tariff deficit that is still to be collected. Of the &#x20AC;5.2 billion we had at the end of 2010, there are only &#x20AC;3.628 billion and that is 31% less.</p>
          <p>And as you can see here and the base on the closing of 2010, in Q1, a new deficit was generated totaling &#x20AC;245 million. And &#x20AC;1.8 billion have been collected and we have to add another &#x20AC;62 million that were collected in the usual settlements. And we hope that securitizations will be reinitiated very soon with a new securitization every five or six weeks. And it has to be pointed out that deficit generated by the system in the first quarter is in line with the government's expectations as regards finishing the year with about &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>And the company has continued with its balance sheet strengthening policy in the first quarter with, significant progress has been made in terms of securitization and we've applied our cautious financing policy in the acquisition of new businesses like Elektro and Renovables.</p>
          <p>And equity account for &#x20AC;34.389 billion, which is more than last year. And the net debt, without considering the tariff deficit, currently stands at &#x20AC;23.278 billion. So, after this strengthening of the balance sheet, both in terms of debt and equity, leverage has also improved and now stands at 40.4%, which is 580 basis points lower than what we had last year, although the acquisitions of Elektro and stock portfolio will increase the level of leverage during the year.</p>
          <p>And if we include the tariff deficit, debt now stands at &#x20AC;29.906 billion and because of this leverage we've also had a significant improvement, which now stand at 43.9%. And the strengthening policy for the balance sheet that has been achieved in terms of operating cash flow allowed the company to increase its financial ratios vis-&#xE0;-vis those of the same period of the previous fiscal year, both including and excluding the tariff deficit.</p>
          <p>The FFO, net debt ratio has improved 24.9%. The retained cash flow relative to net debt has nearly improved by 8 points or 56% and now stands at nearly 22%. And if we include the outstanding tariff deficit, the ratio goes up to 90%. And it has to be pointed out, as the President pointed out, that today we have an excellent liquidity position with &#x20AC;10.737 billion in liquidity and credit lines, including the &#x20AC;750 million from the issue from the beginning of April and the &#x20AC;1,066 million that had been paid for the acquisition of Elektro.</p>
          <p>It's a very comfortable situation that has just to cover 18 months of financial requirements including the repurchase of the stock portfolio that has been announced for the merger process with Iberdrola Renovables, of which nearly 1.70% has been carried out, or nearly 40% of the total.</p>
          <p>The average life of debt is 6.1% and in the first quarter Iberdrola has been successful in two bond issues totaling &#x20AC;1.5 billion. And we've also obtained another &#x20AC;1.8 billion through three deficit securitizations. And you can see the maturities on the slide for the loans which is very comfortable and is pretty stable for 2011, most of the maturity dates will be focused on the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And the President will close this presentation results. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Thank you, Pepe. To conclude, I would like to highlight that these results for the first quarter are again further evidence of the Iberdrola business model, focused on long-term value generation and this model gives the Group flexibility to obtain positive results in any scenario.</p>
          <p>In a period characterized by a complex operating situation, especially compared to the first quarter of last year, where the Group has been capable of obtaining positive performance in all its results, it has been possible, thanks to that diversified business portfolio. The investments made in recent years in Renewables and Networks have compensated for the evolution of the Liberalized business, although the excellent results obtained last year have not been achieved, as a result of the situation of in the British market.</p>
          <p>And the first quarter of 2011 also shows the benefits of internationalization, since the good performance of the businesses of the group in Spain, U.S. and Latin America have made it possible to maintain a positive evolution taking over from the U.K., which in previous quarters was the driver for growth.</p>
          <p>International diversification has also been a key factor in efficiency gains obtained in this quarter. And if we analyze the results for the last two years, the synergies and extending the best practices at Iberdrola to new businesses have helped us to increase efficiency by close to 20%.</p>
          <p>In the last three months, the magnificent performance of Iberdrola USA and the reduction of corporate expenses has made it possible to reduce net operating expenses by more than &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>The third key element in this quarter is financial expense reduction, as the CFO said, as a result of the strengthening of the Group's balance sheet. And thanks to the increase in equity and debt reduction, leverage has dropped to only 40%, which is the lowest we've had in the last 10 years.</p>
          <p>All this has boosted the results for the Group, which grew by more than 10% both regarding operating cash flow and net profits, which for the first time has exceeded &#x20AC;1 billion in just one quarter.</p>
          <p>The performance obtained in the first three months of the year also means that we can reaffirm the growth prospects for 2011. We expect that during the next quarter, the improvement in the operating situation together with the contribution from Elektro Brazil will enable us to maintain in the forecast we announced during the recent Investor's Day, as long as there is a reasonable scenario considering exchange rates and things are in a little bit of turmoil as you can see. As I was saying the results that we're presenting also prove that this business model is capable of generating value both in the short and the long-term.</p>
          <p>Iberdrola is a company over 100 years old that has been transformed very significantly in the last 10 years while respecting is origins. And today it's a great group focused on the basic business, a world leader in the clean energy and concentrated on operating and financial efficiency. A company that creates values for its shareholders; they have benefited from a total return of 158% in the last 10 years, and also for all those stakeholders with which we interact.</p>
          <p>Firstly, for all our employees last year we had over 1 million hours of training through initiatives in which 95% of the staff have participated, with the ultimate objective of attaining professional excellence at the company. Our 30 million customers in Europe and America have also benefited from the growth of the Group through the increase in efficiency and exchange of best practices, which have resulted in improvements in service quality, a parameter which in Spain has improved by 45% in recent years.</p>
          <p>Also our suppliers, thousands of companies that employ hundreds of thousands of workers all over the world, they also benefit from this growth at Iberdrola through the procurements that we make, which in 2010 amounted to close to &#x20AC;14 billion.</p>
          <p>And finally society in general, the Iberdrola business generates a major tax income in the 40 countries where we are present. In 2010 alone the tax contribution from the Group amounted to &#x20AC;3.5 billion. You can be sure once again that all the women and men that work for this company will continue to do our utmost so that this global growth business with low risk will continue to maximize results on the long-term for all of you.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and now we will move onto the questions.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] Any questions from the floor, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I am Alejandro Vigil. I have a couple of questions. The first question is related to the Qatar Holding, the new shareholder, and I would like to know what kind of role that company is going to play. And in the context that you pointed out as regards takeovers in Latin America or expansion in Latin America in the Middle East and Asia, could you please say a little bit more about that?</p>
          <p>And then the second question has to do with the nuclear issue, which is obviously a very significant subject because of what's happened in Japan. I'd like to know what plans you have in the U.K., where you had very advanced plans, but could you please say something about gas, nuclear power and renewables in the future, please? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, perhaps I can start off with the second point. Yesterday we had the opportunity, it was the 25th Anniversary of the foundation of the Pr&#xED;ncipe de Asturias and we were honored by the presence of Prince of Asturias and [Angel Moria] gave a presentation and is the director of the organization and he said a lot about the energy sector.</p>
          <p>And I think that in the nuclear issue he was very clear from the point of view of the fact that the nuclear technology is essential, that the world still needs nuclear power and that any decisions that are taken have to be taken very cautiously. We have to learn and we have to apply the things that you've learned, but what you shouldn't do is forget. You have to give support and you have to, well you always have to support learning processes is what, which is what this sector does.</p>
          <p>Because firstly, in the case of Japan the problems did not have to do with a nuclear problem, but it was an earthquake followed by another 60 aftershocks totaling a level of 6.5 or 7, a tsunami with waves measuring 15 meters in height. And all of that had been contemplated by the design, but they'd not expected such a high level earthquake. They &#x2013; the power station's designed for a maximum wave height of 10 meters, not 15 meters.</p>
          <p>So, it's been an exogenous element. But in any case, I think that they have everything under control. But as far as we are concerned, well, firstly, the Spanish nuclear power stations are designed to resist earthquakes and these nuclear power stations, when I worked as an engineer, I also designed the racks for the continuity systems, so the batteries that have been installed at the Almaraz nuclear power stations and I can give you the parameters. It is double the maximum level that &#x2013; of an earthquake in Spain. But in the trials, this fulfilled the design criteria perfectly well and in Spain it's going to be very difficult for us to have these sea quakes, because most of the nuclear power stations are inside of the country and those are located at a sufficiently high altitude.</p>
          <p>So, in the worst cases, no water will ever be able to reach them. But we will learn from all of this and there will be meetings. We also have the Chairperson of the National Council of Nuclear Power and a representative from the OECD and we also are going to be holding meetings with the United Nations. So, this is something that would eventually draw conclusions as to the improvements that can be made. But these systems did work and I wanted to make this very clear.</p>
          <p>So, the British plan, we are working on this and in no case would this decision be taken before 2015. This was already planned, so therefore, we are in a very pre, pre, pre, pre-stage. And there is an office with our partners in London, and where there are several dozens of engineers working. But the decision of carrying on will not be taken before 2015. So, we will have to wait.</p>
          <p>Qatar Holding, well, I think that we've already said this before, it is a financial investor, long-term and stable and they have said that, too. And we are going to do things together with them. There are countries where they have very good connection and proximity and these countries are going to allow us to make investments together with them. And we are the technologists in terms of energy issues and they are going to provide whatever resources are necessary to supplement our efforts.</p>
          <p>In other areas like Latin America or even in Europe, well the situation is perhaps the opposite, because they will be able to become involved in some of our businesses in these countries as minority investors to support our efforts.</p>
          <p>So, it's a very global agreement at a general level to have them as a capitalist partner in those investments that are attractive in different markets, by using our skills and our know-how in terms of energy and electricity and also using their abundant economic and financial resources.</p>
          <p>Next question at the back of the room, please, Raimundo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I am a bit late. I am not sure whether you've already addressed this during the presentation. And if you have, I would like to apologize.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I would like to ask you about developments in the U.K. where there has been a significant slump in the operating profits, in terms of trading and commercialization. I'd like to know what's going to happen in the rest of the year or have we reached the lowest valley? So, once the fuel contracts are improved, would this mean that the business will improve too?</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with demand in Spain and prices. We have seen that demand has slowed down recently. And I wanted to know what you think about future trends for the rest of the year, is this a surprise or what do you think is happening?</p>
          <p>And finally, could you say something about the tariff deficit and its progression for 2011? We've seen that there has been a very strong increase in the access tariff in the second quarter, but I think that the Ministry thinks &#x2013; do you think that this is sufficient to cover the target set for the deficit in 2011? Or perhaps the demand in Spain and tariff deficit, you can answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As regards the U.K., you said it perfectly clear. In the U.K we are affected by several things. Firstly, there is a somewhat lower demand, but in any case, everybody is affected in the same manner. And in our case, we are also affected by the purchases of raw materials that we made in the past at high prices. And it's going to take us few more months to digest these purchases.</p>
          <p>And I think that, <mark type="indiscernible" /> if I am mistaken, I think by the last quarter, it will be fully covered. So, it's a very specific issue that we'll have to be putting up with for the next two quarters.</p>
          <p>But I have to make an announcement, as the CFO said, that this situation that is pretty usual for the rest of the stakeholders and considering how forward prices are evolving, it's highly probable that over the next few weeks or next few months, there will be a substantial increase in tariffs in the U.K. in terms of gas and electricity. At least that's what I've read in the U.K. press.</p>
          <p>These are the rumors and it's logical too, because if the prices of raw materials and if the prices of the energy forwards are going up, well we'll just have to do something about this in the retail prices and I am sure that this will help.</p>
          <p>So, expectations are that on the one hand, the internal problem we have on our decisions taken at the past in terms of procurement of certain kinds of raw materials have &#x2013; this has all been caused by these high prices. And as regards the prices themselves, it's an issue that we'll probably have to increase or the market will possibly have to absorb the cost increases that are nowadays being seen in the case of the energy prices in the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about demand in Spain and the tariff deficit, perhaps you could answer this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as the demand in three months is concerned, there has been a slump of 1.6% in Spain roughly, and fundamentally the slump has been stronger in the service sector and in the domestic sector, and less important in the industrial sector. And in the industrial sector it has been less than 1%, whereas in the service and domestic sectors it's been in excess of 2%.</p>
          <p>So, making a forecast at the beginning of the year is very difficult. We have &#x2013; considering a global increase in terms of demand of something between 1% and 2% for the year. But possibly, we'll have to see how things evolve and see how each of the market segments operates to possibly adjust these figures in the upcoming revision.</p>
          <p>And as far as the tariff deficit is concerned, well, this is something that's already been mentioned by the CFO. I think that there have been three issues of two billion each. I think that the next issue will be prepared and it will be done in May. And the rate that has been set by the government will be issues every five weeks approximately.</p>
          <p>So, &#x2013; what they are doing is managing each issue separately, so that they can be adjusted to the amortization plans that were set some time ago. So, they were going to consider a 10-year schedule, but I think that's going to be very difficult and possibly they will have to resort to shorter maturity dates. But in any case, I think that the efforts that are being made by the government to fulfill its commitment in terms of the tariff deficit, I think that all these moves are positive and I hope that the deficit, the outstanding deficit that we funded will be fully covered and that will put an end to that issue. Next question, please?</p>
          <p>Well, if there are no more questions in the room, let's move on to the questions on the telephone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Good morning. The first question will be asked by Mr. Pablo Cuadrado from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Go ahead with your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good morning, everyone. I had three questions, two on the domestic business and one on Brazil. The first regarding the Liberalized business in Spain, we have seen some good results in the first quarter. And I was surprised by the average sales price close to &#x20AC;60 per megawatt, because the comments we had last year regarding the forwards, well, I think that we expected reference levels around &#x20AC;55. But looking at the hydraulic level, the reserves, the question would be, do you feel that with the information you have now, it will be possible to reach the same EBITDA levels in 2011 that were raised in 2010?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to distribution. We've also seen a very significant performance in the first quarter and the impact on the accounts and the new regulations have been explained. And I would like to know if you could tell us something about 2011 overall. And wherein by the last quarter, we would be able to see the comparison, and what EBITDA level would you feel comfortable with regarding annual growth?</p>
          <p>And finally regarding Brazil, the acquisition of Elektro has been completed. The Chairman commented on the positive forecast for the integration and it's been in the press recently that you are still working with your partners at Neoenergia to see how the Elektro integration can be carried out. So, could you give us some update regarding the proposal published in the press that said that Elektro would go into CPFL and you would take a stake in Neoenergia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will answer the question. What I have to say is that we are currently holding discussions. We have several scenarios on the table. I have to say that we've been with our partners and they understand that we have to have a majority control position in our Brazilian business because of the limitations that there are going to be in the future regarding consolidations. So, we need to have this majority stake and we are looking in the way of obtaining this majority stake whether it's through mergers, by bringing things together, adding things together or sharing things together. We have all this scenarios on the table and we are holding discussions practically every week.</p>
          <p>The Development Director, Pedro Azagra, I think is having a next, a meeting next week. He was there last week. So, the scenarios are currently all open. All I can say is that there is &#x2013; everybody is absolutely willing to come to a friendly agreement where the various partners from the various companies can come to an agreement and, in order to arrive at a situation that will enable us to consolidate our participation in these businesses. So, the relationship is absolutely open, cordial and we are looking at it. But we have to look at many scenarios from the economic point of view, from the tax point of view, from the labor point of view, and that's what we are doing.</p>
          <p>Regarding the other two questions, well, trying to look at what the various items are going to be is difficult. The general results for the company and the Group from the operating point of view, at this point and with the currency, if, because we can't manage that side, but regarding what we can manage, we expect that our growth during the year will be in line with the figures we gave during Investors Day. If the interest rates change substantially we'll have to see what happens, but this is what we are working with and there areas, as the CFO said, that will buffer this growth because there were a number of significant inputs at the end of the year that we didn't have at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>And as I said regarding the British Generation side there are inputs we are going to have, that we didn't have price increases and inputs that will disappear, which is the purchasing of coal at high prices. Once the stocks are run out we won't have that same situation but I think that in general this will be scenario. I don't know whether you would like to add something.</p>
          <p>Next question please? I think it's Javier Ruiz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the next question is from Javier Ruiz from BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I would like to ask three questions, two on Spain and one on the U.K. The first, in Spain could you give us your assessment of the tariff deficit in February, the &#x20AC;550 million and do you think that we can reach &#x20AC;3 billion without making any further changes in the access tariff?</p>
          <p>Secondly, it can be said in a simplified way that in the first quarter you offset lower volumes in Generation in Spain through higher prices. But my question would be how have you been able to obtain higher prices when you have a closed price position? And the final question regarding the United Kingdom; if you say that you still have large coal stocks in the U.K. why is it that coal production has dropped by 12% in the first quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Will you answer the first question, Jose?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the deficit assessment, all I can say is that our latest budget update last month, our forecast for the tariff deficit for 2011, which practically coincides with the &#x20AC;3 billion budgeted by the government. But if the demand instead of going up by 1% or 2%, if it drops by 3% there will be a gap there, there will be a tariff deficit. But under normal circumstances and as we see the year we believe that the government is going to comply with the tariff deficit. As long as the increases in energy prices which are planned are turned in to tariff increases obviously. Because if they are not then the tolls would have to drop, and I don't think that would be rational.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to answer the other two questions, Paco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will start with the U.K. The reason why there has been a drop in production is because less competitive fuel is available, partly, and also partly because there's been a drop in demand, a 3.4% drop in demand. Therefore there is less production in general. Little by little Renewables are also coming in and therefore there's less production and this is a well-known effect in Spain, as well as the loss in competitiveness as a result of those expensive fuels that we will digest during the year.</p>
          <p>In Spain the price situation was produced because we anticipated it. We do very close weekly follow-up of the market and the price or market signals anticipate these prices. And that anticipated information we give on how much we've sold is already reflecting those higher prices that the wholesale markets subsequently corroborate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question I think is Alberto Gandolfi from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we move on to Alberto Gandolfi. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have three questions, please. The first on financial expenses, there is a fairly strong increase in income and I don't exactly understand what is recurrent and what isn't. Can you give us an annualized figure for financial expenses for the year excluding non-recurrent expenses? And coming back to what Pablo said, I am not sure I understood the answer regarding the Spanish distribution. And looking at the new regulatory framework could we talk about an increase this year compared to 2010 of 6%, 7% or do you think that's too much? In other words the Spanish business could be 50% Generation or 50% Distribution in EBITDA terms in 2011.</p>
          <p>And finally a more strategic question. Looking at your business model, there is a very integrated model, especially in Spain and the U.K. in Generation, Grids, Renewables where there seems to be no integration is in the U.S. with really depressed margins. Do you see opportunities in the U.S. to buy generation, because there is a wave of mergers and acquisitions that are very significant there on a domestic level, so do you see opportunities there? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, the third question, I'm going to answer it very quickly. Our plan right now is not to buy any further companies. We are in a process of consolidating what we have this year. We bought Elektro Brazil for reasons I've already mentioned, and we'll continue with that and we'll do whatever is necessary to integrate it in the group. And I think we fulfilled our plans regarding this exercise. There may be opportunities in the future, but right now we are not looking for opportunities. If an opportunity is put on the table, we'll look at it but we're not looking for it.</p>
          <p>Regarding financial expenses, Pepe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well yes, the increase in income basically comes, as I said, through the improvement because of the positive impact of the financial derivatives, basically. Last year they were negative because, as we do every year, we tend to partially hedge the account. And last year the currency evolution was the opposite, it generated more EBITDA at the top and negative impact in financial income because of our lower derivatives. And this year is the opposite and that's why there's this increase.</p>
          <p>The financial expenses, we've said that is going to be around 4.5%. Regarding the average debt, which is the expense that we plan for, and this will increase slightly because by including Elektro it will increase slightly. But basically, the planned financial expenses are 4.5%. If the exchange rates, as the Chairman said, continue at this level, we will have a smaller growth at the top that will be partially be offset by these financial incomes and therefore financial spending will be less than we budgeted. Will you answer the question on grids?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that the question was the relationship between EBITDA and the Spanish Liberalized business and grids, that it's more or less 50-50. Well, our forecast runs along those lines. Perhaps, the Grid EBITDA will be slightly higher than the Liberalized business in Spain, but it will be around 50% each. And then the increase in the Grid EBITDA during the year, considering the homogenization of remunerations in 2010 and 2011, well, I think that it will be around, yes approximately 6%, 7%, &#x20AC;200 million out of &#x20AC;1.5 billion, &#x20AC;1.6 billion.</p>

          <p>Now we have questions from Bruno Silva.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Thank you very much. Good morning and many thanks for the opportunity. The first question is could you please say a little bit more about Liberalized generation in Spain. I think that you've spoken about a change in provisions of &#x20AC;50 million as regards the reported EBITDA. And this would explain part of the growth.</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you please say a little bit more about what is happening with the prices now that you have a 90% hedging? You've had a price of &#x20AC;60 per megawatt and it was nearly &#x20AC;56 last year? So, how can you manage to do this with these hedging levels? And does this mean that we can use this figure for the rest of the year? In terms of production I think that it's less favorable, so that's why there's been an increase in EBITDA, which is one of the outstanding factors that based on the OpEx issues that are also very strong.</p>
          <p>And the second question has to do with Elektro. I'd like to know what kind of scenarios could be contemplated after the statements made by the Bank of Brazil as regards achieving control of Neoenergia? Perhaps their production could be changed. And do you think that Neoenergia could be broken up to control the rest of the assets? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that I already said this before, we are delighted with Elektro. Jose San Pedro was there last week together with <mark type="indiscernible" /> and together with other colleagues. And all the feedback we have is much better than the expectations we had initially. And it's a company that is wonderfully managed with beautiful assets with a very powerful team of managers, and with production means that are very modern. And in many cases, we are going to be able to learn many things. And I am saying this because it feels that when we go to places we only teach, but no, we also learn. And it seems that there are a lot of fields in which we can draw some, many positive conclusions.</p>
          <p>As regards of the rest of the issues mentioned, we are currently contemplating all the elements. And the only thing that is crystal clear is that firstly, reaching an understanding &#x2013; or we have a complete understanding with our partners to design a solution that will allow us to achieve our joint goals. In the case of Iberdrola as well as other partners that we have in other companies, that is that we need to establish a position that would allow us to consolidate our participation in view of the accounting changes that are going to take place, and that's it.</p>
          <p>And anything else, with due respect, is just a passive requirement. So, we have a number of objectives and the main objective is to reach an agreement in order to achieve what it is we're heading for, and our partners agree and they are going to help us.</p>
          <p>As regard Elektro, Elektro, I am going to say this again, we like this company more and more. The more we know them, the better we like them. And as regards the other two questions, prices and hedging, I didn't really understand you very well. Paco, would you like to say something about what this gentlemen was asking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, starting off with the forecast, this is just a technical issue that has to do with the price differential regarding the commercial lines, and after publishing the regulations with the special regime. And if I'm not mistaken, I think that was implemented in March or in April. And technically speaking, the possibility of us requiring that to change this &#x2013; or to do something about the price difference has dropped 50%. And technically speaking, according to the auditor, we've applied some measures but they're just technical actions that are not very important.</p>
          <p>And the price issue is pretty important. I think that it would be better for us to look into this bilaterally. But in global terms, what has to be said is that in the same manner that we have 24-TWh sold at an average price, we have practically closed the fiscal year which is above 80-TWh total. But we still have another eight that are open and for which we expect to obtain a price in excess of the &#x20AC;50-something that we've already closed for the other 80. And this is what gives us the upside.</p>
          <p>And then there is something else which has to do with the rainfalls over the last quarter of the year or next year. This is also another upside &#x2013; an important upside. And in the worst of cases, we'll just stick to the forecast and if there are significant rainfalls we'll be producing at a lower variable cost, lower than what we have already agreed to. And many times &#x2013; well, there are many, many markets, it's like airplanes, that each ticket has a different price and it's very difficult to do something globally or to explain the complexity of the procurement and sales system of a company that is managing 90-terawatt per hour. And my apologies for us not to be able to give you more information that will allow me to explain each and every detail concerning prices.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] And the last question from the telephone comes from Javier Suarez. Go ahead, Javier, with your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good morning, everybody, and many thanks for accepting my question. I have two or three questions to put to you. The first question has to do with the &#x2013; what it is you think about the regulatory development for the development of Renewables in the United States, could you give us an update? It seems that in the United States the shale gas had had difficulty, that it's producing lots of difficulties. But in any case, I'd like to know what you think about these trends or what's going to happen in the future?</p>
          <p>And the second issue connected to Renewables in the U.K., I would like to ask you if the current high inflation environment in the U.K., could it endanger your expansion plans for Renewables in the U.K.? And talking to the regulator and talking to the government, what sort of intentions do you have as regards developing your Renewables capability in the U.K? And the third question that has to deal with Elektro. Could you give us an update, please, on the regulatory revision that has to be carried out there? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as regards our regulatory developments in the United States, I think that we didn't mention this. But in the first place, the United States is made up of many states and this is &#x2013; the obvious, of course, that it's not the same thing when you're dealing with the Midwest or with the West or the South or Southeast or whatever.</p>
          <p>But the American regulation, at a Federal level, has not only been improved, but has changed, but it's also been improved. There were grants and the condition was that to collect them, they're going to be in effect until 2012, but to collect them, work had to be started in 2010. And they made this a little bit more flexible. And the deadline is that the whole thing finishes in 2012 regardless of when you start. So, this helps a bit, or helps a lot, rather.</p>
          <p>So, from the regulatory perspective, the issue is as it was before and now we have to see what's going to happen as from '12 &#x2013; 2013. And as I said on Investor's Day, we don't really know and we'll see if the grants program is extended or if a new one is drawn up. We don't really know. So, this is one of the elements that has to be considered. But if, from the point of view of the States, I have to say that California a few days ago approved the Renewable portfolio standards up to 33% for 2020, and this without a doubt is going to make it &#x2013; it's going to produce greater desire because of purchasing power of this client.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, energy prices in the United States are very low and this is applying lots of constraints as regards the construction of wind farms. So, those of us that are still lucky enough to have 23 states where we can choose are going for those states where that, the pricing levels are more suitable but we've reduced it substantially. But last year, we built a 1,000, 1,100 megawatts and this year it's going to be 600 megawatts and next year, it's going to be 300 megawatts.</p>
          <p>So, we are adapting ourselves to these circumstances. But we can carry on because we are operating in States where we can obtain reasonable prices because that shale gas is not yet reaching them or because the energy prices are not being affected by that issue or because it's that the obligations have not yet been fulfilled. So, therefore, there is still the need to purchase renewables.</p>
          <p>In the U.K. what I have heard other people say, what everybody is saying, and even the politicians are mentioning this, and today it's election day in Scotland and Wales, that all the campaigns of the political parties are based on who is going to offer more renewables in their shopping basket. So, some political parties say 100% by the year 2020, or 100% by 2025. Others talk about 90% by 2020 and this is what the debates are all about.</p>
          <p>And I've read in the newspaper and I'm involved in that, because I said that's its feasible to reach those figures by some of those deadlines. But in any case the U.K. has, very clear in its mind and it's called Renewables and nuclear power, these are the two main vectors for the generation of electricity over the next few years. And all the debates that are taking place on the white paper but has to be submitted to Parliament, are running along those lines.</p>
          <p>And all those plans that we have in terms of Grids, and as you know, we are significant transporters in the U.K., are designed so that you can evacuate this energy to be produced in the future. So, I don't really think that there are any changes in what has been happening until this point in time. I think that that was the final question, and something about the regulatory situation. Well, you can talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as you know, the Brazilian regulator, ANEEL, has proposed a new change in the remuneration system, or what they call Part B, which is the added value of distribution. They submitted a proposal that has been opposed by practically all the distribution companies and there has been an exchange of views and what ANEEL has said is that they are going to present a new proposal and they postponed the tariff revisions.</p>
          <p>And in the case of Elektro for this summer and that's been postponed until the month of November, bearing in mind that during that period ANEEL is going to submit a new proposal. It's going to send to the distributors. It's going to make known a change in the remuneration system. But in particular in the acquisition of Elektro, as we didn't know about that, it was done by applying the first proposal for the change in remuneration that had been made by ANEEL in relation to the figures used for Elektro. So, let's say that the, if the proposal improves the worth of Elektro is also going to increase significantly.</p>

          <p>Okay, we have come to the end of the questions from the telephone and from the web. All of them have been answered except for one of them comes from the Miguel Davila from <mark type="indiscernible" /> Capital, who is asking about the impact of the wind power tax in Castilla-La Mancha and do other regions have that in mind.</p>
          <p>Well I think that it's something like &#x20AC;6 million in Castilla-La Mancha, isn't it, if I am not wrong. But what &#x2013; and this year it's going to be &#x20AC;6 million.</p>
          <p>Any more questions? No, we have no more questions.</p>
