          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to E.ON conference call. As a reminder, all participants will be in a listen-only mode and we will conduct a Q&amp;A session after the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And now I hand over to Kiran Bhojani, please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Anna. Good afternoon, [Foreign Language] Thank you for joining our conference call of our nine months results and since I'm aware that you're all waiting for Wulf Bernotat and for Marcus Schenck to talk about strategy and nine months results I'm straightly hand over to Wulf. Wulf?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kiran and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on this conference call on our first nine months 2008 results. Since the last time I spoke to you at the presentation of our first half results the financial crisis has massively accelerated and is moving into a general economic slowdown.</p>
          <p>We need to take stock of the new scenario that has been developing over the last two months, a very different one to what was expected only a few months ago. Compared to other industries E.ON's business should remain relatively shielded from the economic slowdown. Electricity and gas demand are not very sensitive to economic cycles. In addition the longer term fundamentals of the sector continue to look strong.</p>
          <p>In most of our markets the need for investment in new power generation capacity is driven by the need to replace aging capacity more than by consumption growth. Climate change concerns and tight primary energy supply will continue to support the strong expansion of renewables. And in the gas business, the decline of domestic gas production in the EU underpins investments in new gas import and gas storage infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless E.ON will not remain completely immune to the economic downturn. Electricity and gas prices tend to move with overall energy prices and especially oil prices. Oil prices reached extreme highs in July but have now fallen back to much lower levels. Over time energy prices obviously have a material effect on our earnings. In our power generation business we sell forward our output for several years. As a result, the short term volatility of energy prices is smoothed out in our earnings. I'd like to highlight in the respect that we accelerated hedging in particular our central European output in May this year and especially during the third quarter at a time of rather attractive prices. By now we have sold more than 60% of our output in Central Europe for 2010. In the gas business however and especially in upstream we have a more immediate correlation between earnings and oil and gas prices.</p>
          <p>A second aspect that needs to be considered is the impact of the financial crisis on our financing. E.ON continues to enjoy a good access to debt markets. Nevertheless, credit spreads have increased substantially over the last few weeks and liquidity being provided by the public debt market is at very low levels.</p>
          <p>Where does that lead us to? We are entering the period of the year where we review our budgets and investment trends for the next years. These uncertain times, the Board of Management prefers to err on the side of caution. Despite the tougher credit markets, we remain comfortable with the capital structure that we outlined in May 31 of 2007. We are fully committed to a single A flat rating which translates into a target for economic net debt of three times adjusted EBITDA. Following the acquisition of Viesgo and selected Endesa assets, we will come out slightly above that level this year. We will bring economic debt back to target over the next two years.</p>
          <p>In this context, we will continue to apply a particularly stringent discipline to review of our investments. Most of the projects included in the &#x20AC;50 billion investment plan for 2008 to 2010 have already been carried out or are already at a very advanced stage. However, there are a number of conventional power plant projects, for example, for which we have made no firm commitments at this stage. Furthermore, our impression is that component prices have just passed a peak and that they may come down in the wake of lower steel and other commodity prices, thus keeping such projects on hold looks the right thing to do for the time being both from a macro and from a microeconomic perspective.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have decided to delay the completion of our share buyback program. We have already purchased 6.5 of the &#x20AC;7 billion that we had promised to buy back. We consider it prudent to wait for the credit markets to settle before buying the remaining &#x20AC;500 million of our own shares.</p>
          <p>With regard to performance, we remain fully committed to delivering an adjusted EBIT of &#x20AC;12.4 billion in 2010. As our first nine months results demonstrate, we are well on track. And Marcus Schenck will detail all this in a moment.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we are not standing still. Over the last few weeks, we took several further steps to execute our strategy. First, we concluded an agreement with Gazprom with regard to Yuzhno Russkoye. Second, Abu Dhabi's Masdar and Eon joined forces to partner in the London Array offshore wind farm project. Third, we are progressing with a disposal of 4.8 gigawatts of generation capacity in Germany. Fourth, we have decided to explore the possibility of a disposal of Th&#xFC;ga. And finally, I will comment on an initiative to improve operational performance across the group that caused some press speculation last week.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the agreement regarding Yuzhno Russkoye. In early October we agreed with Gazprom to swap the 2.9% stake in Gazprom held via ZAO Gerosgaz for 25% minus one share in the giant Yuzhno Russkoye gas field. This gas field has reserves of over 600 billion cubic meters making it one of the largest gas fields in the world.</p>
          <p>First gas flowed last year, and next year already the field will reach plateau production at around 25 billion cubic meters annually. The share of around 6 billion cubic meters, E.ON's participation in the production of Yuzhno Russkoye represents a huge step toward our objective of producing 10 billion cubic meters of equity gas.</p>
          <p>Due to the technical complexity of unwinding ZAO Gerosgaz, the joint venture through which we hold a 2.9% stake in Gazprom, we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2009. However, we have agreed that the operation should be accounted for retroactively as of January 1 of next year.</p>
          <p>Let me now continue with our partnership with Masdar under the agreement Masdar has entered the London Array wind offshore project in the UK. Masdar has acquired 40% of Eon's 50% of the London Array scheme, giving it a 20% stake in the project overall. However, the agreement regarding the London Array is meant to be a pioneering project within the global renewable energy partnership that we want to develop. We have secured in Masdar a strong partner to work with us on London Array and on future renewable energy projects which would help us to push the industry from boutique to industrial scale.</p>
          <p>We hope to announce a series of exciting joint projects over the coming months. We are generally interested to access renewable energy projects in emerging markets and more specifically in the Middle East and in North Africa.</p>
          <p>Let me now briefly update you on the stand of our settlement with the EU Commission. The market test was completed successfully during the summer. We are now waiting for the final confirmation from the EU Commission. In the meantime we have initiated discussions with several parties regarding the 4.8 gigawatts of generation capacity on offer.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to discuss now the decision to explore a potential disposal of Th&#xFC;ga. Th&#xFC;ga is a holding company which actively manages a substantial portfolio of minority stakes of municipal utilities in Germany. As a consequence of the intensifying competition and regulation in the German market, many opportunities are opening up to Th&#xFC;ga to participate in the consolidation of the municipal utilities landscape. However the anti-trust limits set by the Federal Cartel Office for the E.ON Group prevent Th&#xFC;ga from fully leveraging its development potential in its area of expertise. We have therefore decided to explore the possibility of a disposal.</p>
          <p>I would like to underline that we have not taken a firm decision in this respect. We also look at other options. Also we have not defined how we might best structure such an operation; a full review of Th&#xFC;ga will require several months.</p>
          <p>Let me now tell you a bit more about the performance improvement program which came up in the German press last week. We had already initiated this program several months ago, well before the worsening of the financial crisis. After a strong phase of expansion and acquisitions we felt it necessary to revisit once again how we can best run our organization and processes. The objective is to further improve our operation performance with a special focus on reducing administrative costs and on simplifying reporting and decision processes. The program mentioned in the press is one of many projects and initiatives which will help us to deliver on our &#x20AC;12.4 billion target for 2010 adjusted EBIT.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me now conclude my presentation. Marcus will walk you through the detailed figures for the first months of 2008. As you will see, the Q3 results are solid and proof that we are well on track to deliver on our 2008 promises. Looking ahead we continue to feel comfortable with the strategy and the targets that we outlined on May 31, 2007. Our growth-oriented strategy rests on solid long-term fundamentals for the sector. However, given the uncertain state of the economy we want to be slightly more conservative than before with respect to our capital structure and with respect to our investment program. Nevertheless, our business is marked by long cycles and long investment horizons. The immediate challenge for us is to find the right balance between complacency on the one hand and overreaction on the other hand.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes my remarks. Thank you for your attention and I will remain on the call to answer your questions later on. And with this, Marcus, over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wulf. Good afternoon respectively for some of you good morning. Before I comment our results I would like to also talk a bit about a subject that Wulf has already touched upon. The global financial crisis has clearly changed the world around us at least for the time being. I would like to highlight that E.ON is flexible enough to adapt to this more challenging environment.</p>
          <p>Since the peak of the financial crisis and the aftermath of September 15 we like many others are noticing an increased concern from our analysts and investors on the refinancing and funding situation at E.ON. Hence I want to be very clear in this topic now. We're very confident that we will meet our funding and refinancing requirements. An example for E.ON's financial stability is the extension of the so-called Tranche A of our syndicated revolving credit facility. As you maybe aware we're currently in the process of renewing this. We've asked our banks for their commitments for another period of 364 days. The process is still ongoing so we cannot make a final statement yet. However, the &#x20AC;9 billion commitments we have received from our banks exceeds the total volume of &#x20AC;7.5 billion that we set as a target. Taking into account the difficult situation in the financial markets and with banks in particular, this is a great success underpinning the trust of the financial community in E.ON. I would like to use the opportunity to thank our banking partners for their continuing support, which is highly appreciated in this difficult period for the financial sector.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we have been very active on the bond market in the past 15 months, issuing a total volume of &#x20AC;17 billion. Despite the already tougher environment, we've been able to do this at adequate price levels. Regarding further details on our funding program you may consult the backup of this presentation.</p>
          <p>We are aware that the pricing situation has changed during the course of September. Recent larger bonds placements indicate this. We all observe that spreads over government bonds have widened. At the same time, however, government bond yields have been coming down and may continue to come down. We firmly believe that there will be windows of opportunities for us to further access the bond markets. In doing so, we will stick to our policy to strive for adequate pricing, and we will continue to diversify our funding sources as far as possible. Furthermore, we will constantly seek for attractive funding alternatives. One prominent example here is a loan that we are currently negotiating with the European Investment Bank, the EIB, that has a volume of &#x20AC;500 million we are expecting to receive by the end of 2008. We have furthermore executed a smaller private placement last week. In a nutshell, the markets remain open for E.ON.</p>
          <p>This is also evidenced by our activities in the commercial paper markets. Even during most difficult market circumstances, we got good demand for our CP, even with larger pennants at quite attractive rates. Out of the total outstanding amount of &#x20AC;7 billion, more than 4 billion has a maturity that is beyond the year-end 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me also highlight the sound liquidity position of E.ON. On September 30 of this year, we record &#x20AC;10.1 billion of liquid funds in non-current securities of which only &#x20AC;2.3 billion is on balance sheet funding of pension obligations. At the moment, we have even higher liquid funds due to the increase of commercial paper compared to the end of September.</p>
          <p>I hope I have sufficiently addressed your concerns regarding E.ON's financing situation. Now I will, as usual, run you through the nine month results in detail.</p>
          <p>Group sales increased by 22% to &#x20AC;60.5 billion. Group adjusted EBIT rose by 8% to &#x20AC;7.7 billion. Group adjusted net income improved by 6% to &#x20AC;4.5 billion, and group cash provided by operating activity decreased by 13% to &#x20AC;6.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The 8% increase of group adjusted EBIT to &#x20AC;7.7 billion breaks down into the following main developments by market unit. Central Europe's adjusted EBIT increased by 5%, to &#x20AC;3.7 billion. Central Europe West non-regulated was the major contributor with an improvement of 9% to &#x20AC;2.8 billion. Important positive items were the following: positive power transfer price effects of &#x20AC;977 million, higher power sales margin in Germany up &#x20AC;84 million. These positive effects were partially offset by higher CO2, fuel and power procurement costs of &#x20AC;453 million, the burden from lower generation volumes, mainly the ongoing outages of the jointly owned nuclear power plants, Kr&#xFC;mmel and Brunsb&#xFC;ttel, totaling &#x20AC;289 million and the transfer of activity to other market units of &#x20AC;103 million.</p>
          <p>Central Europe West Regulated declined by 20% to &#x20AC;546 million. This was induced by regulatory burdens in the network business of &#x20AC;150 million. The decline has accelerated compared to the half year stage due to the fact that the pricing decisions by the regulator were only effective from the second quarter onwards.</p>
          <p>At Pan-European Gas, adjusted EBIT increased slightly to around &#x20AC;2 billion. The trend visible already at the half year results was a growing EBIT at up and midstream and a decreasing EBIT at our downstream participations has been manifested. In the third quarter it was even more pronounced. Here are the main drivers. Firstly in the upstream business we made an adjusted EBIT of &#x20AC;270 million on the back of production volumes being up by 70% in terms of oil output and 83% in terms of gas production. The main driver behind this was the Njord gas field. The combined effect of higher volumes and prices delivered a positive adjusted EBIT contribution compared to last year of plus &#x20AC;221 million. This was partially offset by higher OpEx and deprecation of &#x20AC;62 million.</p>
          <p>Secondly our midstream business adjusted EBIT is slightly up by &#x20AC;31 million, which is an improvement on the half year reporting. There is a bit of a push and pull in this business, between positive and negative factors. On the one hand as per end of September, sales volumes were up due to colder weather and storage valuation yielded favorable results. On the other hand the time lag between rising purchasing costs and the pass through to sales prices has a temporary negative effect. Additionally the pressure on sales prices increased due to tightening competition. Unlike last year we could not benefit from significant differences in the development of wholesale prices between the U.K. and Continental Europe.</p>
          <p>Finally in our downstream activities, the adjusted EBIT was down by &#x20AC;117 million. The most important factor for this was the Th&#xFC;ga business, here the absence of book gains led to a reduction of EBIT of &#x20AC;86 million. The adjusted EBIT of the market unit U.K. declined by 25% to &#x20AC;745 million. Similar to the situation when we reported first half results, the adjusted EBIT in the regulated business was stable in local currency. On a euro basis it lost &#x20AC;47 million. In the non-regulated business the strong EBIT decline continued in Q3. In addition to negative currency translation effects of &#x20AC;70 million there were also the following other effects with a significant impact.</p>
          <p>Lower retail power and gas margins impacted the adjusted EBIT negatively with &#x20AC;221 million. The announced price increases in February and August could not offset the higher procurement costs. This was in part compensated by an improved performance in generation arising mainly from increased specs. This positively contributed &#x20AC;84 million to the adjusted EBIT.</p>
          <p>Nordic's adjusted EBIT reported an increase of 10% to &#x20AC;654 million. The main factor behind this increase was the increased market-backed transfer prices for power generation in the non-regulated business which accounted for a positive contribution of &#x20AC;172 million. This was partially mitigated by lower available generation volumes and a higher taxation on nuclear, respectively hydro generation.</p>
          <p>The adjusted EBIT of U.S. Midwest decreased by 7% to &#x20AC;273 million. The decline is entirely attributable to the currency translation effects. In local currency terms, the adjusted EBIT was even up from last year's level thanks to an increase of margins in the retail business.</p>
          <p>The new market unit Energy Trading achieved an adjusted EBIT of &#x20AC;407 million. Of this impressive figure, &#x20AC;309 million were contributed by asset optimization exceeding our expectations. &#x20AC;98 million were contributed by the proprietary trading business.  The strong performance of the unit in the summer months is in line with the expected seasonal earnings development. We have highlighted the seasonality of the business to you in the past two results presentations. And you may refer of the chart on this pattern in the backup of our presentation.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, I would like to draw your attention to our new market units Climate &amp; Renewals Italy, Russia and Spain. We're showing you this chart because it highlights the big differences between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. This is important as a large part of this delta is attributable to the purchase price allocation. A second effect depresses the adjusted EBIT of Spain and Italy by in total &#x20AC;126 million in the third quarter alone, and lets it look lower than it is fundamentally. The reason is an accounting method used for acquired and freely-allocated CO2 certificates on the balance sheet of these businesses. This is a non-cash effect which is burdening our results in these businesses only in Q3 of this year and Q4 of this year. This effect will not reoccur in the fiscal year 2009. Adjusted net income grew by 6% to &#x20AC;4.5 billion. The growth of group-adjusted EBIT and lower taxes have offset the higher net interest costs.</p>
          <p>Now I will comment on the net income attributable to shareholders of E.ON AG which decreased by 42% to almost &#x20AC;3.1 billion. The main effects here were the following: adjusted net interest income declined from minus &#x20AC;694 million to minus &#x20AC;1.4 billion, the consequence of the planned increased in the group's financial indebtedness due to our investment program. Net book gains were significantly reduced by &#x20AC;756 million to &#x20AC;234 million, the main reason were reduced results from divestment of securities at Central Europe compared to the first nine months of 2007. The other non-operating income &#x2013; in the other non-operating income, the higher negative contribution of almost &#x20AC;2 billion was mainly attributable to the lower result of the mark-to-market valuation of derivatives. Coming from a positive effect of &#x20AC;433 million in the previous year's first nine months, this accounted now for a loss of approximately &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to the group cash flow. The cash flow provided by operating activities declined &#x20AC;973 million to &#x20AC;6.3 billion. The movements within each market unit are partially impacted by the inter-company effects, in particular, in relation to E.ON Energy Trading. One important factor responsible for the decline in operating cash flow is the utilization of our storage facilities within Pan-European Gas. We have seen a huge year-on-year swing leading to a significant working capital increase. Last year we used much more gas from the storage which was filled up in 2006 at significantly lower prices. In the first nine months of 2008, the change of the gas value in our storage facilities increased by approximately &#x20AC;700 million compared to the same period last year. So, in essence, volumes in the storage are up and prices are up.</p>
          <p>Let me also point out the details related to the reported operating cash flow of the market unit U.K. Here we have reclassified cash flow during Q1 and Q2 of 2008 from operating cash flow into financing cash flow. This was necessary to properly reflect the carving out of the trading and renewables activities from market unit U.K. but it is not reflected, it was not needed in the Q3 numbers.</p>
          <p>Our economic investments totaled &#x20AC;18.8 billion until end of September 2008 coming from &#x20AC;5 billion in the first nine months of 2007. This is mainly related to the acquisition of Viesgo and the Endesa assets as well as investments in our new market units.</p>
          <p>Our economic net debt increased in the course of the first nine months of 2008 by &#x20AC;17.8 billion from 24 to about &#x20AC;42 billion. The main factors were economic value of investments of &#x20AC;18.8 billion, dividend payments of &#x20AC;2.9 billion and the share buy-backs amounting to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. These factors were partially offset by cash provided from operating activities of &#x20AC;6.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me now discuss the outlook for the full year 2008. Our outlook for both group adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income for this year remains unchanged. We continue to expect both metrics to be 5 to 10% higher than in 2007. I would like to emphasize here that we stick to our guidance although a few negative factors have appeared unexpectedly in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The two nuclear power stations, Kr&#xFC;mmel and Brunsb&#xFC;ttel are staying offline for longer than previously expected. On top of that, we had an unplanned short-term outage of the Unterweser power plant which is now again up and running. In Sweden, the unplanned outages of Oskarsham and Forsmark are probably going to cost us several million euros in the fourth quarter. Also, certain currency movements in particular in Eastern Europe where the financial crisis has led to a decline of some of the local currencies will cost us money.</p>
          <p>Finally, as Wulf mentioned before, I would like to reiterate our commitment to our 2010 adjusted EBIT target of &#x20AC;12.4 billion based on our current portfolio. We will give the market a detailed update on the 10 of March.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks, and Wulf, Kiran and myself are now more than happy to answer all your questions.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now starting the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question comes from Chris Rogers. You can speak now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, with regards to your new market unit, the EBITDA line obviously gets rid of any accounting issues and so on. I'm very disappointed by, as I'm sure you are, the outcome of your Spanish business. Can you just let us know a little bit about what you plan to do about that? Obviously it's quite a high profile acquisition for you and it'd be a shame to see it going that same way as Powergen. So can you tell us what you're doing to sort that out? Additionally in relation to those new business units, can you give us some guidance as to what the PPA depreciation is going to be? I understand it's not in this quarter's figures, but as a ballpark, it would be quite useful to know what your thoughts are there. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one point I would like highlight, Chris, when you look at EBITDA the effect that I mentioned in relation to CO2, that is not corrected, it's not a depreciation there. You should be aware of that. So there is in Spain for this one quarter alone, there is a negative charge of &#x20AC;35 million and the amount for Italy in that period is &#x20AC;91 million. It is really important to highlight. So EBITDA is also negatively impacted by those CO2 costs which, as I mentioned, we will see once again in Q4, but this effect will not reoccur then in 2008. The overall &#x2013; sorry, 2009. The overall effect from purchase allocation in terms of higher depreciation, we are still working through. We don't have a specific number there but I would expect that for the overall transaction to be at around 100 million, plus minus.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But could I just follow up on Spain? Even if we make that adjustment of the 35 million, you get to an adjusted EBIT before PPA depreciation of maybe 6 million in a quarter which, looking at the Spanish utilities, wasn't a bad quarter. That would still suggest to me that you're going to quite under-perform your kind of 10% return, or any kind of return, on invested capital target. So, I mean, are you happy with how Spain is going? I just wonder if going into your purchasing season whether there's any issues to address there.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, this is the first quarter of our ownership of this asset. We are still integrating so there's also some integration costs included in that number. I think it is also important to highlight that, as we told the market when we announced the acquisition, the claw back is hurting this business in this quarter. And as far as Spain is concerned we recognize that earnings need to come up there. We are comfortable that we can achieve that next year. And I would say just looking at three months is simply too short sighted here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon. I have two questions; on Brunsb&#xFC;ttel and Kr&#xFC;mmel when do you expect the power plants to start production again? And the other one is on the EU regarding your asset swap plans for the network and the production efforts. When do you expect the EU will come up with a decision on that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll go with the first one. Kr&#xFC;mmel, I think Tanya, as you know we're not the operator of these plants, but the information we have is that Kr&#xFC;mmel is expected to come back with the beginning of the second quarter of 2009, whilst Brunsb&#xFC;ttel is likely going to be delayed into the second half of 2009.</p>

          <p>Second question as far as the EU asset swap is concerned, we are finalizing our agreement with the commission. We expect to have that in place by mid December, and that will allow us to start our disposal process. And to remind you, we've got two years for the transportation grid, and six months plus potentially another six months for the generation capacity and that will start, and that's from December onwards.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, two questions please. First one is very simply on your 2008 guidance. You used to say that's you would be rather at the high-end than the low end at the adjusted EBIT level, can you reconfirm this? And the second point is on the, I would say that the tax rate in Q3 it was a very low tax rate. Will you have a view, would you speak to your 22% tax rate guidance for the full year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second one is easy. We expect the overall tax rate for the year to be at the level that we see in Q3. On your first question, let me first make a correction. To the best of my knowledge, and I even looked at the information, at the transcript. I actually never said we will be at the high end of that range. The only thing I said was that we do not, and I said that in the conference call, to the second quarter, I do not expect us to be at the bottom end of that range. We stick to our 5 to 10% guidance. I think I highlighted some of the effects that we are seeing in the fourth quarter in terms of unexpected nuclear outages as well as a situation that has basically arisen from the financial crisis in terms of certain Eastern European currencies devaluating, which will have a negative impact on us. We nonetheless stick to our 5 to 10% increase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi to all. Good afternoon. Just the two questions. The first, could we just have a bit more color on the exact mechanics of what you're having to do with the CO2 both in Spain and in Italy? And then the second question relates to your investment plans. You've obviously highlighted that certain investments in power stations could be put back. Could you just elaborate on which power stations you're actually talking about there, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll go with the first question. The mechanics, simply speaking, are as follows. We basically acquired a business that has freely allocated CO2 certificates. And from an accounting point of view, we are essentially forced to build provisions reflecting the market value for those CO2 certificates. And for those CO2 certificates that we use in each quarter of 2008 in Q3 and Q4, we basically will have to charge that provision to EBIT. So that's the effect, and that's why given it's a provision effect, that's why it's not in a way being added back when we move from EBIT to EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So why does it just impact 2008 and not 2009 through to 2012 given that obviously these CO2 certificates have been allocated for phase two of the ETS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to pretend that I'm an accounting expert, but this the outcome of the analysis we've conducted together with our accountants. And this is how we, from an accounting point of view, have to treat it. For the experts on the phone, this is essentially IFRS-3 that is forcing us to treat it like that in our accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to come back to your second question. If I got it right, and the line is very bad we have with you, unfortunately, but I understood that you were asking whether we are reviewing our investment plan or pushing back some of the projects or even rescheduling them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Basically, which ones</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I said is what we are planning to do is that, of course, we will review and scrutinize all our investment projects individually when they come up for final decisions, and we have to make sure that they continue to meet our financial criteria, and that might lead to some rescheduling in our investment program, but we are not, at this stage, planning to cut our investment program. It is more that we will have to review it under the different market conditions which we have seen in the last few months popping up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just to add, obviously projects that we have started where we are in the process of building are not impacted. But as we have always said, there are certain power plants where we either do not yet have permissions to build, or we have not yet secured equipment. And in light of what we've said, also financially we think it may make more sense to wait with one or the other investment decision to potentially benefit in case equipment costs come down. And then essentially what you have to do is go through the lists, for example, of power plants, and you can see which ones are under constructions and which ones aren't. And those that aren't may get postponed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just two questions. One is on Th&#xFC;ga, you did say that you're looking into potential disposal of the asset. Is it just a question of getting the right price, or are there any other conditions you're looking for? And the second question is to comment in the beginning, i.e. that we are going to see a certain form of demand destruction. But do you really expect there to be a significant impact from lower demand for power, bearing in mind that there was &#x2013; quite, but the correlation in the past has not been very good. And if so, do you expect it to be enough to bridge the capacity gap we're seeing not only in Germany, but in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that we have actually said that we see a significant reduction in power demand. We said that we are, rather, a less affected industry, less volatile, compared to others, and therefore even in an economic downturn will not have a significant impact on the demand side. So I don't think that it is a major issue, therefore we don't need to talk about, let's say, the gap between we might be seeing come up in our market, the generation capacity gap, which was mentioned in the DNR study some time ago.</p>
          <p>As far as Th&#xFC;ga is concerned, that was your first question. We said, and I would like to repeat that, that we are evaluating all options now. And one of the options indeed is a disposal, but this has nothing to do at this stage with price expectations or market conditions as such. We have to find out what are the best options for Th&#xFC;ga given the situation that it is hard for us to grow the Th&#xFC;ga portfolio under our ownership and that might be a different situation if Th&#xFC;ga had a different owner, because then all the Cartel law restrictions would not be applicable. And I think that are the major consideration in this respect. Not so much a specific price target, which we might have in mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the decision to say that you're looking at all options on Th&#xFC;ga is really related to the court case, which closed yesterday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, the short answer is no. It's really not the &#x2013; we started this process some time ago and not just yesterday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a few questions. The first one...</p>

          <p>Two questions, Jackie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...two questions. The first is what is the volume of your funding requirement? What volume of that relates to investments that you haven't yet decided to start? And then the second is to do with Th&#xFC;ga. And I suppose sort of, would you prefer to do an asset swap or outright sale and is the Th&#xFC;ga sale assumed in that funding requirement of 30 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me, we can say again on the Th&#xFC;ga side. We have not taken a decision. So what form it might take, we have to decide it much later when we have finalized our process on analyzing our options. Therefore, it is far too early to be in a position to answer your question whether it's an asset swap or a straight sale. We have not even decided whether we want to dispose of our Th&#xFC;ga assets. So you have to bear with us for some time before we can give more clarity on this issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as our funding program is concerned, let me just again, let me just spell out the key metrics here. When we started our program together with our investment plan in August last year, we said that including any refinancing until the end of 2010 we have a total refinancing volume of around &#x20AC;30 billion. Since August last year until now we have issued bonds for in total &#x20AC;17 billion. In addition, we right now have commercial paper outstanding of &#x20AC;7 billion. So you can see what right now the delta until 2010 is. The sort of another &#x2013; we have one big refinancing coming down the pipe in May of next year which is a &#x20AC;4.25 billion bonds. I think with those parameters I think you can roughly estimate what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is that 7 billion included in -the 7 billion CP included in the 17 billion that you've already done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. It is on top. It is 17 in bonds.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Plus 7 in CP.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not taken a decision in terms of how much will &#x2013; may get delayed in terms of our investment program. We are right now in the middle of our planning session. An update will be given with our full year results in March. So I don't have that number for you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes. It is Catarina Saponar here from Nomura. I would like to &#x2013; can we possibly revisit the question of guidance here, longer term. On the near-term guidance, can you just confirm versus the H1 stage, you sound more pessimistic now because you had obviously revised up. Are you, by implication, revising your guidance back down to being towards the bottom end of the 5 to 10% range? And also on the longer term guidance, when you're saying or talking about the project delays, to what degree will you actually be making up in your longer-term growth guidance, given that those are not necessarily signed-off projects anyway. But there must be something else that would be filling in. And the second question is on your capital structure and share buyback. You said that you are delaying your share buyback. The recent increased costs of your refunding, are you revising your capital structure target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fine. I think these are all fair questions. On 2008, we said with our half-year results 5 to 10% and we said we will not be at the bottom. Today we're saying we will be at 5 to 10%. That's the message that we have. We will also not be at 5 point nil, that much I dare to say. But I think it is important that people understand that we do have, in particular, with the outages of the nuclear plants, some items that are temporarily burdening the performance in the fourth quarter. We are not at all post pessimistic, and in particular with regard to 2010 we can more than, we can at least confirm the guidance that we put out. Any projects delays on the investment side will not at all impact the earnings guidance we put forward for 2010. That is clearly not the case.</p>
          <p>On the second question as it relates to capital structure and share buy-back, no, we are not changing our target for the capital structure. We will stick to a single A flat. We will stick to a three times leverage factor. I think it is in market circumstances that we are facing right now, where you could argue that maybe the last 5 to 10 days we have seen one or the other issuance in the debt markets, but quite frankly I think there is still not yet sufficient evidence of the government support packages really having impacted the banking sector to give it a more stable situation. And that is the reason why right now we think it is much more prudent to postpone the completion of our share buy-back program and just to highlight, we are talking a number that is &#x20AC;500 million out of 7 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to make one additional comment on the potential postponement or rescheduling of investment programs. If we were to do that, it would only have an impact of the outer years beyond the current mid-term plan. So, no impact on 2010 outlook, clearly not.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions. The first one is on your dividend. You haven't reconfirmed your previous guidance of 10 to 20% average annual growth over 2007, 2010. Is that still something you're committed to? And is the dividend included in the 30 billion funding requirement you've mentioned earlier? And my second question was just again on the issue of potential capital delays. Are we talking about projects or numbers which were included in the original CapEx plan of 63 billion for 2007, 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the dividends, we stick to our dividend policy, 50 to 60% payout ratio, and we stick to our target of an average 10 to 20% increase of that dividend until end of 2010. And yes, the refinancing, or the financing of dividends is included in our sort of financing activity, the numbers that I communicated earlier.</p>
          <p>And the CapEx of potential delays, yes, they are included in our investment plan. People should be aware of the fact that there can obviously also be a power plant that was planned to &#x2013; where we planned to start building say second half of 2009. So only a certain portion will then go out of the amount until 2010, because a power plant typically doesn't get finished in 1.5 years. So the answer is yes, we are referring to projects that are included in the CapEx plan.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Yes, two things. Firstly could you just give an indication, the 100 million purchase price allocation for Southern Europe, you talked about to what timeframe that refers to? And secondly, you had recently a ruling from the Cartel office on gas prices and bonus payments, paybacks to customers in Germany. Could you give some indication on the burden you expect from that in the fourth quarter? Thank you.</p>

That is obviously an annualized figure. So that's full year impact. As far as the, what was the question there? Whether we...</p>

          <p>Hello.  I'm still trying to &#x2013; I would like to make sure that we understand the underlying figure in &#x2013; of your new markets EBIT of $58 million.  You said, I think, 90 million something was Italy, the CO2 issue, then 34 in Spain, and you will have a PPA allocation next year of 100 million for the year, which makes something like 75 for three quarters.  Is it fair to say if you add up all these numbers that the underlying figure for the nine months was something like just above 100?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Ingo.  The 91 for Italy and the 35 for Spain was Q3 only, i.e. for three months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And you would need to compare that if the 100 million is correct, with the 25 million charge.  Yes?  Is that clear enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And another question on trading.  Apparently you're coming from 99 million in the first half to, now, 407.  Can you &#x2013; I mean RWE has specified an underlying figure for their trading operation, which I know is structured differently, of something like 300 million.  Can you give us likewise a figure that we could calculate, given that this business is notoriously unpredictable from the outside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've, in a way I think, highlighted the key problem with that.  Let me just make sure that the mechanics are understood.  In a way every year the baseline for this business gets reset.  So you can't sort of take the 400 or whatever that the full year result is going to be and then sort of perpetuate that, because for next year the transfer pricing mechanism, which has been described in our various documents, kicks in which means that any uplift in the overall power prices is initially recognized within our traditional market units.  It's phased with the Genco businesses.  And then only the optimization around those transfer prices which are market based is going to show up as a result inside E.ON Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>So, this is the mechanics, unfortunately, it is in a way a business that's not really predictable in a sense that at the beginning of the year we essentially transfer at, roughly speaking, the forward prices that we see.  And it is then the task of E.ON Energy Trading to optimize against that.  That's the logic.  So please do not take the result this year and then say okay, they can grow this by x percent.  That's absolutely the wrong way of doing it.  But, obviously, you would understand that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  First question is pretty much in the direction of Ingo's question just to make sure that I got it right. If I understand your picture that you have provided on the single quarter results of asset optimization, I understood that the single quarters should balance out at the end of the year.  And given the very strong performance in asset optimization after nine months, is that still a realistic assumption?  Secondly, regarding the cumulated comprehensive income, I'm comparing your...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Comprehensive income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Comparing your figure here after six months and after nine months, this leads me to a difference of roughly &#x20AC;3.5 billion euros. Perhaps you can &#x2013; sorry? Perhaps you can give me details on that. I understand that a good portion of this comes from the valuation of Gazprom, where we see quite a huge difference, but if I calculate the debt right, it leads me to a difference of more than &#x20AC;5 billion.  So perhaps you can provide some details here on these differences?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question on E.ON Energy Trading.  If I understood it correctly, your question was, we've always said that the first quarter of the year and the fourth quarter of the year will be not as good as the quarters two and three of the year, okay?  That we can reconfirm.  Now I'm not so sure I really understood whether that is answering your question or whether there was more to your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really.  You said that this impact or that the similar results should balance out in the course of the year.  I understood that this would lead to neutral result at the end of each year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  That is not going to be the case.  We obviously, you never know what the final weeks of the year will bring, but we clearly do not expect the results from E.ON Energy Trading to drop compared to the three months results, if that sort of gives an indication of where we see it.</p>
          <p>Now as far as the OCI is concerned, one point you should bear in mind when you look at Gazprom, the way it flows through OCI is on an after-tax basis.  There is a tax associated with the position that we hold through our Gerosgaz joint venture.  And that I think you need to deduct from the math and that is a charge which is, I don't have the precise number,I believe it's around &#x20AC;1.3 billion or so.  So bear that in mind when you do the reconciliation.  I think that almost explains the difference.  The other items that are flowing through OCI are fair value changes on our asset management side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I'd combine the two words, "2010" and "at least".  But let me just ask two questions.  One on the share buyback, you're obviously suspending it now.  What are the conditions that you're looking for to resume buying back shares, or are you thinking about at some stage issuing it as a special dividend?  Is that linked to your financing costs?  If you can give us some indication there, that would be great.  The second question is back to the Gazprom deal on Yuzhno Russkoye.  Obviously that's quite a tricky task, because on the one hand the value of Gazprom shares is quite volatile, and on the other hand I imagine the value of the Yuzhno Russkoye field, as well given the volatility in oil prices.  How confident are you that you're not going to have to revise this agreement that you've struck over the course of the next 15 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe I can start with the second one on the Gazprom deal.  Indeed you're right in saying that we now have two assets which we will swap that are both moving up and down with market developments.  And that is a difference from what we discussed up until that time when we had done some assets on off on our side and participation in the gas fields on the Gazprom side.  And the gas prices moving up and therefore the value of that position was moving up simultaneously.  Now we have two assets that breathe with market developments, and it makes it easier to finalize our deal.</p>
          <p>When you talk about confidence, I mean we've got all the assurances that you need for such a deal.  It was signed in the presence of the Russian President and the German Chancellor and was recently confirmed by CEO Alexei Miller in a conference in Munich, that he is very glad and happy that we have reached a deal and can cement our excellent corporation with Gazprom.  I think these are assurances enough that give us confidence that we will have a deal in the end.  But we'll still need to negotiate some of the detailed contracts to execute the deal, and that will take us into the next year.  And the closure is foreseen for probably the third or fourth quarter of next year due to the complexity of the deal, concerning Gerosgaz and to make it fungible.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question there's no intention to do a special dividend as a substitute for the completion of the share buyback program.  I think I would also like to highlight that what Wulf has said was that we have put it on hold; unlike others we haven't canceled it.</p>
          <p>Now what exactly are better market conditions in the debt markets?  Quite frankly, that is tough to precisely define.  Certainly, what we would like to see is inter-bank lending to be a little bit more healthy than it probably is at this stage and with that also see some more liquidity in the bond markets.  Now I can't give you a metric for that but we are really looking for improved conditions there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone. I have two questions.  The first one again on the investment plan.  So if I make a rough calculation of 50 billion investment plan, 35 billion are already more or less started; so do we talk about a 5, 10 or 15 billion which could be put on hold if you could give us some guidance on this.  And the second question would be again on Th&#xFC;ga.  When you look at Th&#xFC;ga do you only look at the German business from Th&#xFC;ga and if we look in your balance sheet do we see the fair value, the market value of Th&#xFC;ga or more or less a book value?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  We are only looking at the German business because the Italian part of Th&#xFC;ga has been moved into our market unit Italy.  So it's included there.</p>
          <p>As far as the investment plan is concerned, I mean I would like to reiterate what I said earlier; we are right now in the planning process.  I'm not going to give you a this is x-point-y billion euros that may be taken out.  We will revisit this.  Clearly, I think, one item I'd like to highlight is that obviously a certain portion of the 63 billion is non-cash, and obviously we look at this in a slightly different way.  That's Yuzhno Russkoye and that is the Elk transaction.  And as far as Th&#xFC;ga concerned, it is recorded at book values in our accounts.</p>

          <p>Hi.  I just have two debt questions.  One was just on your extension of the Tranche A, presumably the  central extension will be at slightly higher costly rate, is it something like a hundred perhaps &#x2013; sort of negotiating perhaps a hundred basis points more at rates. And the second question is just generally in terms of looking at the bond markets at the moment.  Several of the companies or several utilities have accessed the bond market in the last few weeks, and perhaps speaking some of those saying in terms of prudence in accessing the cash now, given your comments on conservative views on your balance sheet.  Is that the reason why you haven't donned that status, is it because of your strong liquidity, or is it a certain view on the bond markets?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  As far as the credit facility is concerned we are far away from an increase by a hundred basis points.  And when I say far, I really mean far, far away from that.  I think we have secured here much more attractive terms that reflect the good relationship that we have with our banks.</p>
          <p>As far as bond issuance is concerned, I think people should recognize is that the situation obviously deteriorated on September 15, and we had, in August, raised &#x20AC;2 billion with the euro bonds.  So I would say in a way we have done something already.  And when you now refer to others that have tapped the market in the last few days/ weeks, yes, that is correct.  We had simply done it a little bit earlier, i.e, before September 15.  Having said that, we are clearly continuing to monitor the situation and if the market conditions present themselves in a reasonably solid way &#x2013; I'm going to avoid the word attractive because I don't think I will really see attractive conditions in the next few months, but I also believe we have not yet seen the support, the governmental support packages fully impact the financial sector.  So we are confident that there will be reasonable windows for issuance in the bond market.  And then we will use those windows.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi.  Just one follow-up with respect the guidance you gave on the trading business basically saying that it's difficult to see what is really the underlying number there given the roughly 400 million this year.  If I recall it correctly, you said that you look for an improvement in results of roughly 1 billion mid-last year and that 600 million out of that should come from the asset optimization being achieved through the trading business.  Is that still correct in terms of thinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is not, because I think maybe you got the numbers in the reverse sense.  One billion is correct, 400 and 600 are also correct, but it was 400, which we expect from trading optimization until 2010.  This year it very much looks like we have actually achieved already quite a bit more than &#x2013; earlier than we had originally anticipated.</p>

          <p>Hi, Chris.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  So, yes.  Just a couple of follow-ups from me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of follow-ups, huh?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're swapping a Gazprom stake that gives you very little in terms of dividends for the stake in the gas sales which are, I guess, would give you some quite nice operating income.  Are you able to quantify what the earnings uplift may be for you as a result of that transaction, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not put forward a number.  It is obviously a high multiple of the, what is it &#x2013; 45 million dividend we received this year on the 2.9% position in Gazprom that we hold through the Gerosgaz joint venture.  Chris, the way I &#x2013; I can't give you X hundred million number, because that number actually is also changing with where the oil or respectively gas price is.  But it is, even at today's prices it is a very significant multiple of this dividend.  We're more than happy to walk people through the mechanics of how this business functions to give you some guidance on where the financial implication can be.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  But we're talking the hundreds of millions territory, effectively?</p>
