          <p>Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Volkswagen Conference Call for the First Three Months of 2008.  I am joined today by Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG responsible for Finance and Controlling; and by Detlef Wittig, Executive Vice President, Volkswagen AG responsible for Group Sales and Marketing.</p>
          <p>As usual, you can also follow the webcast and download the chart from our website volkswagenag.com/IR-webcasting.  Questions can be sent by email or called in.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to mention that after the speech of Mr. P&#xF6;tsch and Mr. Wittig, we will first respond to the questions of analysts and later answer those of journalists.</p>
          <p>I would now like to ask Mr. P&#xF6;tsch to give a few comments on the highlight of the first quarter of 2008 before Mr. Wittig goes into detail of the deliveries to customer.  Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Ladies and gentlemen, also a warm welcome from my side to this conference call.  I am very pleased to be here today to discuss our good performance against a backdrop of falling growth in the developed economies and an almost daily barrage of newspaper headlines.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to say that our strategy in the emerging markets of China and Brazil and our early entry to Eastern Europe via &#x160;koda have provided us a useful counterbalance to this declining growth.  Consequently, I am pleased to report that despite the impacts of Easter falling in the first quarter we were able to grow deliveries to customers by 7% representing a growth rate of four times the global market.  And we will of course not stop here.  Already this year we have presented the Passat CC and the stunning Scirocco, the return of a classic.</p>
          <p>The all new Audi Q5 with the unique sleek silhouette was shown in Beijing, which followed shortly on from the A3 Cabriolet and the A4 Avant.  &#x160;koda has launched a new Superb, and Seat is a few weeks away from the start of production of the sporty all new Ibiza to name just a few highlights.  Our brands design language is becoming clearer, our portfolio of cars more complete and customers are buying our vehicles as never before.</p>
          <p>When we turn to the operating profit performance, all brands as well as financial services, were able to improve their earnings thanks to our continuous focus on strong cost control and capital discipline, which is reflected in this performance.  Our operating profits increased significantly by 20.9% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion.  Consolidated pre-tax profit also increased strongly by 27.8%, to &#x20AC;1.4 billion, 0.3 billion above the comparable 2007 figure.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we announced in March the agreement to increase our stake in Scania and I'm pleased to confirm that the transaction is proceeding according to plan with an expected completion in summer 2008.  We will fully consolidate Scania within our financial reporting from this point.</p>
          <p>The cash outflow for the share purchase will also occur at this time.  I'll give you a few more details on our financial performance later.  Let me now hand over to Mr. Wittig who will give you an overview of our positive sales development.  Mr. Wittig, your turn please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Welcome also from my side ladies and gentlemen.  As a very first and general remark, I think I can probably say we had a good start, a good sales start into this new year 2008 and as you can see on the chart, the first column on the chart, on the left side shows our total Volkswagen Group sales performance for the first three months.  We were able to increase our sales as mentioned already by Mr. P&#xF6;tsch by 7% up to 1,572,000 cars and we can say this is a new sales record for the Group.  At the same time and during the same period of the first three months, the total car market, world car market increased only by 2% so this means that we were gaining market share.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the individual brands of the Group from left to right, to the right from Volkswagen Passenger Cars down to Commercial Vehicles, first of all, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars increased sales to customers by an overall of 8.3% up to 920,000 units and that also was a sales record for the brand Volkswagen and that sales record was made &#x2013; was driven by some countries in Europe but especially by our emerging markets.  In Europe, we were able to increase our sales in Germany by 8.6%, yes, we take into consideration that there was a lower base in the first quarter of last year but also at the same time we were able to increase our sales in Poland by 44% and now the new emerging markets for us Russia plus 48% and in Brazil plus 22% and of course in China again a plus of 25%.  So those countries were driving the Volkswagen Passenger Cars sales.</p>
          <p>Turning to Audi, Audi sales were up by 1.3% that refers to a total volume of 250,000 cars.  It is also the best first quarter in Audi's history and it was mainly driven by the Audi A3 and the new A5 Coup&#xE9; and the Coup&#xE9; very successful for a Coup&#xE9; version with over 13,000 deliveries in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Going to &#x160;koda, &#x160;koda continued its very positive trend with a further strong plus of 15.7% up to 173,000 units and that includes for the first time a measurable number of 16,000 Octavias built and sold in China; also a sales record as mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Turning to Seat, Seat however we suffered a decline of minus 7.5% but with the strong base in the Spanish market and the Spanish market showing a weak performance in total, the Spanish market is down by 15% in the first quarter of this year. And still the new Ibiza just being around the corner we think it was still a good performance and we have no concern, we're not worried about the first quarter results of Seat.</p>
          <p>Bentley also was down by 17.8% and that again refers to the first quarter of last year, where we saw the high demand last year of the launch of the Bentley GTC version.  We expect a more balanced demand in 2008 with a full year target on the same level as in 2007.</p>
          <p>Last but not least our Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, they had an excellent quarter with deliveries to customers increasing by plus 12% up to 123,000 units.  All model lines contributed to this success and our commercial vehicles were mainly concentrating and successful in the Western European market say in France, Britain, and Italy.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our sales by market areas and this chart, we will go through it in detail but I would like to focus the first remark on the two columns to your right, which shows our performance in South America with a plus of 11% and in Asia-Pacific with a plus of 28%.  So those areas were very positive in driving our sales.</p>
          <p>Now again starting from left to right, Europe.  Europe, a mixed performance because we will have to look into Western Europe on one hand and then into Central and Eastern Europe on the other hand.  In Western Europe, our sales declined slightly by 0.7% year-on-year and that was mainly due to the weak markets in Italy and Spain, which combined, showed a fall of 14,000 units.</p>
          <p>Balancing this, that was our delivery performance in Germany, France, and the U.K. where we were up by almost 12,000 units.  On the other hand, in a rather stable German market and slightly recovering as compared with the first quarter of last year, we were able to reach a record market share of 32%.</p>
          <p>As far as Central and Eastern Europe is concerned, we saw a very successful start in the year with an increase of our sales by 18%. And that was significantly supported by our sales in Russia.  Sales went up by plus 57% and also a recovery in Poland and the Polish market at the same time with a plus of 16%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to North America, North America delivery shows, they show here a decrease of minus 5.7% but we will have to sort of differentiate between the U.S. and Mexico.  In the U.S., I think we were quite successful at turning around the Volkswagen brand sales.  The Volkswagen brand showed an increase of nearly 13% and we are quite confident that we have reached a turnaround situation for Volkswagen in the United States.</p>
          <p>Mexico, however, and that is part of the North American sales volume here, Mexico saw a decline of 15% and that has contributed to a decline of the total market, and at the same time a weaker performance of the SEAT brand in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Next column shows South America and South Africa, as mentioned before, a very positive trend. But to point, at South America only excluding south of Africa, we had a plus of 18% driven by Brazil with a plus of 23%. So we are doing quite well in South America.  However, on the other side, in South Africa we saw a decline of 30% and that is mainly due to a very weak total market, the market went down there by minus 20%.</p>
          <p>The last column shows Asia Pacific, in total a plus of 28%, but that was mainly driven by our performance in China.  Our sales there grew by plus 32% and this is the continuation of the positive trend of last year and even an acceleration, because last year we had a growth rate of 28% and now 32%.  Also included in the Asia Pacific sales volume is India, where we saw a growth of 46% mainly due to the &#x160;koda sales in India.</p>
          <p>Turning to the individual brands, if you highlight on some of the models of the Volkswagen brand, the Passat CC and the Scirocco shown here on the picture had an excellent reaction from journalists and dealers since their first showing.  The Passat CC in Detroit and at the Geneva Motor Show and the Scirocco over the world premier at the Geneva Motor Show.</p>
          <p>However, when we look at those models driving the sales success in the first three months, we saw a very positive effect resulting from a success of our Golf sales in South America with an increase rate of 20% there. And the newly introduced Chinese models, Sagitar and Magotan, very successful in the Chinese market.</p>
          <p>In Europe, however we saw a very successful new Golf Variant with some 26,000 deliveries, a positive performance in the first quarter.  And certainly &#x2013; and I would still like to mention this, the success of our Tiguan with actually over 100,000 orders taken to-date. And we are working hard on cutting down the waiting list by extra shifts that we have put in place in order to satisfy our customers' demand as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Audi; with 251,000 cars delivered in the first quarter, Audi reported the best first quarter in its history.  This success is the result of the enlargement certainly of the modern range of the model offer. And certainly with the new Audi A4 Sedan, that we introduced end of last year, we saw a very strong performance, a plus of 16%. And the Audi A4 Avant, which is shown here on the picture, we have just launched this car a week ago and we can probably say that we have been able to take 36,000 orders already for this new car.  And driven also &#x2013; this Audi success was also driven as I mentioned before by A5 coup&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>Turning to &#x160;koda; &#x160;koda continued their success during January to March this year and also had a new sales record with 173,000 cars sold, increase rate of 15.7%, the highest increase rate of our group brands. And as I mentioned it earlier, in China we started this year the production of the Octavia and this will certainly give us an additional push in the second half of 2000 &#x2013; well in the second half of this year because we will then introduce also in October this year the Fabia in the Chinese market.</p>
          <p>The basis for the worldwide success is the Octavia line with the Octavia Sedan and Combi version. And as shown for the first time last year, the Roomster is also well accepted by our customers and now the new Fabia Hatchback contributed also some 9,000 cars to the total gain of 23,000 cars this year.</p>
          <p>The new Superb that is shown here in this chart will be introduced on the markets in June 2008, saw the world premier at the Geneva Motor Show, and will certainly contribute to the ongoing success of &#x160;koda.</p>
          <p>And finally a word on SEAT; SEAT delivered in the first three months 101,000 cars to customers although that means a minus of 7.5% worldwide.  This is due to, first of all, two markets, home markets for SEAT in Europe, the home market Spain, and the very strong market of Italy for SEAT. But both markets were rather weak, a minus of 15% and 8% respectively.</p>
          <p>And also SEAT is now in the situation of running out the current model Ibiza, which simply says that &#x2013; on this chart you can see the new Ibiza. That will certainly fit very well to the brand's auto emission theme and we expect the Ibiza to become the icon of the SEAT range, and to start a new chapter in design and quality and volume for the SEAT brand.</p>
          <p>So, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me take you through the financials now and let's start with the sales revenue which, as you know, excludes our joint venture activities in China which we report in summary within the equity results in the financial results.</p>
          <p>The first three months of 2008, our sales excluding China increased by 2.2%.  Sales revenue rose 1.4%, or 0.4 billion, compared to the first three months of 2007.  Volume growth contributed 0.7 billion which was almost entirely offset by adverse currency effects, with regard principally to the U.S. dollar and British pound, not forgetting that our extensive hedging activities impact only at the operating results level rather than here at revenue.</p>
          <p>Price was up a positive point 2 billion, also mix was a negative point 1 billion. Financial Services made an important point &#x20AC;2 billion additional contribution.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to operating profit. Price, mix and volume contributed a positive &#x20AC;0.3 billion. We had an impact of hedging of 0.2 billion from currencies. Despite the head wins of further increases in commodity prices, our continued efforts to improve the cost of our vehicles resulted in the saving of 0.2 billion in product costs. The &#x20AC;0.1 billion fixed costs/depreciation relates in part to an increase in start up costs for new products. Financial Services weathered the storm into financial markets and despite higher funding costs slightly improved last year's first quarter earnings.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to cash flow. In the Automotive Division cash flow operating activities was &#x20AC;2.2 billion. Cash flow from investing activities fell 300 million to &#x20AC;1.3 billion. However, please remember that in the first quarter last year we increased our investment in MIM. Excluding this impact as you can see in the footnote to the chart, investments rose by 356 million as we invested in products and on our new production facilities.</p>
          <p>The operating cash flow reduced year-on-year. This is mainly due to a lower improvement in working capital when compared to the first quarter 2007. Here one must recall that in former years considerable efforts were made to achieve a sustainable improvement in working capital. Such an improvement cannot be repeated each year. Furthermore, higher volumes typically lead to higher inventories as we ensure the dealer network has sufficient supply.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx ratio in the first quarter of 2008 was 3.9%, up from 3.2% for the comparable period 2007, reflecting our investments in new models. We expect to see CapEx pick up as the year progresses. The cash flow from operating activities coupled with our investment discipline contributed to a further improvement in net liquidity. At &#x20AC;14.2 billion Automotive net liquidity is 0.7 billion above our year-end 2007 cash position of 13.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look now at the financial performance of the different brands starting with the Volkswagen Passenger Car brand. Positive sales development together with further improvement in our cost efficiency combined to improve the operating results of the first quarter 2007 to a rounded &#x20AC;0.5 billion. Our wide geographic base from a core in Western Europe, encompassing Eastern Europe, China and Brazil allow the brand to weather the market uncertainty and provide a sure base for further growth in new emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Audi's revenue declined slightly due to exchange range impacts. However, Audi's focus on cost discipline and the development of a broad product portfolio allowed Audi to yet again increase earnings into first quarter. &#x160;koda's excellent volume performance translated into an improvement in operating result to 182 million. I have no doubt that the new Superb will provide a further boost going forward.</p>
          <p>SEAT reported an operating profit of &#x20AC;12 million reflecting the tremendous work undertaken to improve the core business. The new Ibiza launching in the second quarter will be a very important milestone in securing the brand on a sustainable earnings base. Bentley reported stable earnings and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles improved its earnings more than 50% reflecting the improved volume already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Despite difficult financial market our Financial Services business managed an improvement in earnings.  At this point I would like to mention the excellent progress in our Chinese business, which we have reported in the footnote as it is included using the equity method within the financial result.  The recorded a proportional operating profit of 73 million euros more than double the performance in the first quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the regional development, you can see a slightly mixed picture; vehicle sales in Europe and the remaining markets shows a mild decline which contrast to the slight increase in deliveries to customers Mr. Wittig described earlier.  This is a seasonality issue, which will adjust itself in the second quarter and relate to the fall of Easter in late of the first quarter.  All other regions recorded sales improvements.  The sales revenue trends broadly mirror our vehicle sales.</p>
          <p>The worsening picture on North America highlights again the challenge of exporting from Europe to the U.S. and as you already know I hope to be able to report more on how we will face this challenge in the next few months, once some key strategic decisions have been taken.</p>
          <p>To sum up, first quarter 2008 was a positive quarter for the Volkswagen Group. Operating profit increased substantially by over 20% as did profit before tax and after-tax.  Automotive liquidity is up and in these difficult times for finance, we grew our Financial Services earnings.</p>
          <p>We've launched new and exciting products to maintain our momentum and are continuing to build the foundations for future growth in both our core markets and the emerging world markets.</p>
          <p>And finally ladies and gentlemen let me turn to our 2008 outlook statement which you can read in full in the Interim Report.  We expect demand for our Group vehicles to increase substantially especially in the Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe and South America regions.  We continued to improve our processes and are systematically pursuing our disciplined approach to cost management.  Together with the higher sales revenue resulting from the expected increase in unit sales this will help lift our operating profit for 2008 above the previous year's figure.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to expect a positive net cash flow and a further improvement in the Automotive Division's liquidity position.  Let me assure you our confidence in achieving these targets remains high.  As my last comment for now please note that these forecasts do not take into account the effects of the acquisition of further shares of Scania on volume, earnings and financing data.  We expect the transaction when it closes as we hope in mid-2008 to be accretive to both deliveries and earnings.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have our first question from Jochen Gehrke with Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  I have two questions if I may.  First of all with regards to your cash flow you are still quite sizably below your medium-term target of 6% CapEx to sales.  I wonder Mr. P&#xF6;tsch whether you could state whether we will reach or see this number within the year 2008 or whether we will still be noticeably below that?  And secondly with regards to your segmental reporting, once again we've seen a segment report where your intracompany eliminations have set a very level with &#x20AC;276 million.  I wonder whether you could make clear when finally this number is going to come down, I mean in my spreadsheet at least this is now a triple-digit number for quite some quarters.  Is it actually, it's almost 20% of Group EBIT now.  How should we see the performance of each and every individual brand?  Where should we allocate those?  Do you really think you're giving us a clear picture here on divisional performance with such a high number?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.  Jochen has two questions, the first question refers to our CapEx ratio and if we can give an outlook for 2008 and the second question is referring to our segment reporting and if we can give some more information about the line other.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all with regards to the CapEx development we've seen an increase in the first quarter against the first quarter 2007 and following the usual seasonality pattern we can expect that we will see that this number going up further.  As we already said we stick to limiting the framework for CapEx development at around 6% and I think from today's point of view there is a high likelihood that we will remain in this framework.</p>
          <p>The second question is a question on the segment reporting on other items is to be answered like the following first of all clearly we want to show the performance of the single brands and as I was explaining in the earlier conference calls there is business going forward between the brands on the one hand and of course we have also to reflect intracompany profits by building up stock or moving down the stocks.  So this figure is going to fluctuate going forward.  It's very difficult to predict whether the figure will go up or down but it has nothing to do with in any extent situating any fog around the real performance figures of the single brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, may I just follow-up on that? On the segment reporting is it 276 million for quarter is this an indication to cash flow, is this also a cash near intracompany elimination because otherwise your brand cash performance is not nearly as high as your group-cash performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No you can allocate the 276 in a sense and clearly there is also a cash element included in that, but this doesn't change to any extent the key performance indicators of the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We now move to Christian Breitsprecher with Sal. Oppenheimer please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon.  Maybe firstly following up on the CapEx question, you said that CapEx would remain in the framework of 6%, we have been follower in the first quarter, so what is the CapEx ratio that we should expect for the full year, is it 5%, is it 5.5 or 6, maybe you can clarify that a little bit, and then secondly on Financial Services, could you tell us whether you're also using industrial net cash that you have at the moment to refinance Financial Services business and could you tell us to which extent you're doing that and where we could find these numbers in your interim report.  And secondly on Financial Services, we had one of your competitors at BMW a big impact from the write-down of residual values.  Can you elaborate a little bit on which risks you're facing in terms of residual value and your exposure to the U.S. market in that respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Christian.  So, we have three questions.  The first question is about the CapEx again so if we can give CapEx ratio for this year, what we expect?  The second question refers to the financial business financial services if we are using industrial cash to finance the financial services business and the last question is if we can give some information about the development of the residual values especially in the U.S? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Though, first of all the question again related to CapEx development &#x2013; clearly as I've stated we are looking at a situation where we believe will stay below 6%.  It's very difficult to talk about any digit behind the comma and at this point I would like to remind you that of course ratio always depends on two sectors if the other sector is sales revenue and I think It should be very clear that also this number is not so easy to predict because it's heavily affected by exchange-rate effect as we saw already in the first quarter.  But the best guess at this point in time is between 5 and 6 and I think fundamentally of a higher importance is that we are continuing our high discipline with regards to investment spent.</p>
          <p>Turnaround to your questions regarding financial services, firstly you were asking on whether we use industrial-net cash to refinance the financial-service business.  Principally speaking, we look at the situation of our two business units in a way that we see it has two separate financial schemes which are to be financed within themselves which doesn't say that we are not making an exception here or there.  So for example when for example last year, during the summer period, we saw incredibly high spreads coming up it was very senseful to support financial service with industrial cash debt, that was brought back then in the month until yearend.  The amount is always a very low single-digit number.  So essentially it can be said we are dealing with two separate financing streams.</p>
          <p>As far as the residual values are concerned, it's clear that the situation in general terms reflects the market situation and in so far it's first of all not surprising that the situation is somewhat more difficult in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world, fortunately we can say that probably related to the fact that we are more a niche player than any volume player, first of all, secondly, as you are well aware, we've always kept incentive spent levels to a level much lower than the average in the market.  And thirdly, we have triggered a program already at the end of 2006 to stabilize residuals and we do see that these measures, which were partially precautionary measures are paying back now.  So, this means, we proportionally can say that we are reasonably protected by our provisions in terms of residual values in America and we are significantly on the safe side if we look at the world picture.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Good afternoon.  You sounded quite pleased I think Mr. P&#xF6;tsch on the Chinese joint ventures developments with quite a big increase in sales.  I wonder whether you are really quite as satisfied with the profit performance, it just occurs to me that 73 million in that first quarter.  Although, it was a lot higher than you achieved a year ago, after some pretty strong rises during 2007,  is still &#x2013; implicitly is still a pretty low margin perhaps only 2 to 3%.  I just wondered what your thoughts were on that, whether there was a long way to go still on China, whether there was a really big seasonality in the quarter or what other explanation there might be?  And then second question.  I guess that we all have an appetite for bit more data on Financial Services at this time.  I wonder whether you would be prepared to share with us one item that you dropped simply the penetration rate in the first quarter and whether you might say what the global cost of risk for the Financial Services was in that quarter.  And may I just follow up on Christian's point about financing.  I mean, it seems to me that the spreads you are looking at today are way higher, aren't they, than you were looking at even in August of last year?  So, doesn't that actually make sense to put some of your industrial net cash into your Financial Services financing at this point?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, John.  So, we have three questions.  The first question is about our Chinese joint ventures.  If you are satisfied with the profitability and what do we expect in the near future?  The second question is about Financial Services.  If you can give some further details about the penetration rate especially in the first quarter and the third question is about our high amount of liquidity if we should support the FS?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me get started with the comment on our Chinese joint ventures and there I really got to remind you two situation, we had been in two or three years ago, where we really had to take a few decisions on a very massive restructuring program.  And at that time, we launched this Olympic program, which in the meantime I think has reached a wide acceptance for the reason that it really delivered the results that we are expecting.</p>
          <p>Now, there's one point besides to comment I would generally make here, if we look at just the three month performance which we is seasonality but what we should not forget is that we're able to turn around the situation in China in a very dramatic way without a few very key products being available and that's something which is about to change somewhere around the middle of this year and this is to say it and we were able to show the cars already at last motor show in China.  It's going to be two cars will hit the real volume markets.</p>
          <p>In China, we will officially present the cars to the wider public then at the occasion of the Olympic Games in China and shortly after we'll be able to deliver and that will be a step change in our Olympic program because at that time, then we will be in addition to the measures we have taken so far which was heavily concentrating on cost-cutting, performance improvements and the like quality improvement, we will from now on will be in a position to also to drive the further improvement process by introducing new cars into the market.  This is going to change the situation very much to the more positive.</p>
          <p>So to sum up shortly, we are not surprised but we view the situation clearly on the positive what we've reached so far and we're looking forward to a situation where we can play the game much more actively by introducing new cars to market.</p>
          <p>As far as Financial Services are concerned, I unfortunately cannot talk about anything extraordinary in terms of the penetration rate specifically as far as the first quarter is concerned. I think we're continuing on the reasonably high level, we reached in several markets, there is nothing, which did significantly change in this first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No change in cost of risks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, the cost of risk are to be seen but in saying this, I got to say here that if we look for example at delinquency rate then we see a development which is only different in the third or fourth digits.  So it's not even clear whether this is characterizing a trend or whether it's not basically an unchanged situation.  There is another area where it's a bit more significant, that's the wholesale situation, that's where dealer financing is concerned, there we saw a slight upturn in delinquency rates.  We are fine on the leasing side.  So over and above, we still have quite a playing ground between the risks, which really materialize and ones that we keep in our books to be prepared for a different situation.  Very clearly, the spreads went up quite significantly and even if they turned little bit back in the meantime, it's absolutely clear that this is fundamental for the business.</p>
          <p>Now having said this, I got to say that we very successfully were able to realize a few issues in billion dimension type for spreads which were benchmarked in the market. And so far, I think looking a little further down the road, yes we are still in a situation where spreads are higher than the longer-term average but part of what we currently see is also the way back to normalize the situation where, as hopefully we all know, a situation where we've seen the spreads, which were really negligible and not really reflecting the cost of finance.  So in that sense, I think we will continue our very conservative policy in terms of financial services and what's currently taking place in a few markets.  It's just a confirmation of the policy we've applied in earlier years, yes.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  Can we have the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, our next question will come form Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.  Good evening, every one.  I just have three questions, and a follow up on John Lawson's question, just to be really very clear, are you telling us that you have not increased your provisioning for residual value risk which I presume you review probably constantly but at least on a quarterly basis, you have not raised the provision at all from the recent trend, is my first question.  Because it would kind of be shocking if that were the case given just the reality of what's gong on in the market with your competitors.</p>
          <p>The second question, regarding the intracompany loan, just specifically what is the amount of the loan as it stands right now?  We know you do it, everyone does it, it's part of the business.  Can you just quantify in at least rounded to the nearest billion, if you will, how much cash has been lent, how much of the industrial net cash has been lent to the financial sub, please.</p>
          <p>And then finally last question, just on depreciation, I noticed that it declined in absolute terms pretty materially year-on-year in the first quarter.  It seems to be at a level that was equal to when &#x2013; a magnitude at least to when you reported your Q1 2003, yet the company is about 25 or 30% larger right now in revenue terms.  So, why was the depreciation down so much when you are growing?  Is this just a freaky thing for the quarter that we shouldn't pay attention to or, is this, there is some other explanation because it can affect your earnings quality too?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Adam.  So we have three questions.  The first question is again about the residual values and new question is do we have increased our provisions for our residual value risk this year.  The second question is, you would like to have some further details about the amount of intracompany loans and the last question is about our depreciation, why did it decline in the first quarter and in comparison to the last year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to the first question, it requires clear answer I believe.  I did not at all say we didn't raise the provisions.  I was saying that the provisions clearly cover any risk, which we can view right at this moment.  Secondly on the intercompany loan I just can repeat what I already said it's a low single digit number.  It doesn't make sense to make mention a number because it's fluctuating from month-to-month.  It might be two; it might be three or four. It's a low single digit number.  As far as depreciation is concerned first of all, I mean if you look back into earlier years we have realized CapEx to sales ratios the last few years of below 5% and this clearly leads to a lower basis for applying depreciation.  And so far, it's completely normal development which we only will see going upwards again when we start investing more than in past years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so just a follow-up on that last point.  It's just a normal case of years of more efficient and lower investment, it's just we're now seeing that time lag where the depreciation is reflecting with the lag of the downward slope for your CapEx over the last three or four, five years, is that I think that's how you are explaining it.  And if that's correct and we should continue to have D&amp;A kind of lagging or bottoming out perhaps before rising again in coming periods, is that, that's fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's fair</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we won't, so then we'll keep assuming that D&amp;A possibly can continue to have more quarters of year-on-year reduction, which we won't want to extrapolate too much but this could continue at least for the next some quarters, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or we won't?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are leave &#x2013; about to leave a period where we were clearly depreciating more than we spent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And now, we are about to change that and I think it's necessary to change it because clearly we cannot continue growing the company and still just spend 3% of sales revenue.  That's not possible.  And that's why I really say we will see an upturn in CapEx this year, which we consequently lead to higher depreciation rates.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hello, first I want to congratulate on and finally arrived depreciation improvement.  However related to this I have two questions; first is then why was actually the operating cash flow in industrial business before the net working capital side down 10%, why didn't this figure improve maybe not in line with the EBIT improvement but well didn't that improve at all?  And second in the waterfall chart for the EBIT, you show a combined negative impact from fixed costs and depreciation of 0.1 billion, what is the implied negative 0.4 billion effect in the fixed cost side you suffered in the first quarter?  And thirdly, lastly on financial results, if one backs out the equity results from lease plan, obviously one would come to a negative result due to the other financial result what happens here and why is apparently the lease plan result more resilient in this environment than the Volkswagen Financial Services business model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Albrecht.  So we have three questions again.  The first question relates to operating cash flow and our working capital if you can give some further details here, the second question is about the decline in fixed costs and the last question is about that equity result of lease plan if you can give some further information here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all on the cash flow situation that if I can touch on a few items to make the interpretation a little bit easier.  First of all, if you look at the gross cash flow situation, you might recognize that we are falling short with the number of the first quarter 2008, of the first quarter 2007 by roughly 200 million.  Now, there is first of all an additional amount of taxes included which relates to the higher profit level we've achieved in the meantime.  So, I think that's not necessarily negative.  Secondly, you might recall one of the conference calls last year, where I was talking about one-off items specifically related to first quarter, where we were closing the one and the other fund where we were allocating few of our assets, which we did in a profitable manner.  So if that's eliminated, it would improve the situation by around 500 million, which means it would then show a two digit improvement on the gross cash flow level.  And that in spite of the Easter holidays just let me give this remark also.  And this is also to say that we are in our view absolutely on track with gross cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the working capital.  Now clearly, if you look a little bit deeper then it's</p>
          <p>visible that inventory came up and we also had to account for a significantly reduced amount of liabilities.  Now this then contributed to a lower improvement in working capital.  Now at this point, let me say very clearly and this is also a remark I was making before I think.  I think, we have to keep in mind what we did in past years, which is though it depends on the time period, you want to address but if you take a timeframe starting 2004 to 2007 then in that period we brought the volume up by more than 20, I think it's 22%.  In the same time period, we improved working capital by 7 billion.  Honestly speaking, it comes a bit of surprise that we are able to improve again by 200 million in the first quarter because we really have to view this situation as such that looking at the growth momentum of the company, which is still in place and hopefully will remain in place, we need to build specifically at the end of the first quarter inventory to be able to feed the dealers to ensure sufficient supply of our cars and it's something you can clearly identify looking at the numbers. To cut a long story short, we believe we are absolutely on track and the reduction of cash flows at the first look should not come as disappointment.</p>
          <p>As far as the financial result is concerned, just &#x2013; and in order not to talk too long on that, but it clearly is a figure, which is not so easy to predict because it consists of very much different components.  On the one hand, we have something which is reasonably calculable; that's the net equity &#x2013; companies, there we have a plan which can be valued and taken into account.  Clearly, in a similar way, we have a clear view on what we can produce with our net liquidity.  It's much more difficult to consider the fair valuation of derivatives and that's mainly our commodity futures and things like currency swaps and interest rate swaps.  So therefore, also as far as the financial result is concerned, it's not completely leading to the right judgment if one only looks at the financial results; you've got to look a few lines deeper and there you can see that we were doing reasonably fine with our net equity companies and as you were asking for lease plan, lease plan produced a slight improvement over the first quarter of 2007, which I think is also respective &#x2013; a result which can be respected.  We're also doing fine with the other equity companies.</p>
          <p>And then to your other question on the fixed costs, we really have the situation that on the marketing and sales costs, as far as the fixed part is concerned, we have to take into consideration that we grew volume in a significant way, and I was explaining a couple of times that while we are talking about fixed costs, part of the fixed costs vary with the volume.  We also have higher development costs.  This is necessary to feed our product pipeline and in that sense, we saw a slight increase of our fixed cost position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's now take a email question coming from Sabina Blumer, Creative Global Investments.  So I guess there are left two questions.  The first question is if you can give some flavor how profitable is the Volkswagen Group's business in Russia?  And the second question is, could we comment on Audi's profitability, which improved year-on-year but was down from the previous three quarters?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question as far as the profitability of our business in Russia is concerned, we have to distinguish between cars being imported, fully built up here in our European plants and then exported to Russia or imported into Russia with a burden of a 25% import tax or duty. And the cars that we are now putting into our assembly line in Russia in Kaluga.  Certainly, the profitability of the FBU imported cars is lower as compared with the European average because of that duty burden. But now with the start of the assembly of the &#x160;koda Octavia and the Volkswagen Passat in Kaluga, that situation is changing because you can expect that we will take advantage of 25% not being burdened minus the extra assembly cost, so that gives us a major relief, so that our profit per car &#x2013; or our profit contribution per car is improving very much so above the European average. So from that point of view, the business in Russia and the business trends in Russia are very positive for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A quick comment on Audi profitability. Just in order to make sure that we have a common view on the real situation, it's been a record first quarter for Audi, which is to say, we always will see a certain seasonality in the way how profits are recorded and that's certainly also coming through in the year 2008.  I don't believe it's making too much sense to compare it with completely different quarters.  Audi completely sticks to the outlook, which is that it's going to be another record year in a series of record years for Audi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks very much.  Going back to this CapEx and the potential rise, and given the fact that you've got a lot of new models already sort of being shown and assuming the assembly &#x2013; the expenditure on assembly has already been made and you've said you were much better at managing your CapEx, I just wonder what it is that you're going to be spending high CapEx on. I mean are you going to be committing moneys to potentially the new plants that may happen in the U.S. this year? I mean is it going to come back that quickly?  And perhaps you could also talk about the U.S. decisions and how that's &#x2013; what's still to be decided. Whether you will be announcing some cooperation with other German exporters to the U.S. to try and have together improve your natural hedging there?  And that's my first couple of questions anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you, John.  Again a question about CapEx. If we can give some further details about our plans for this year and where we intend to spend some money, in which areas. And then your question was about the U.S. and if we can &#x2013; when we can expect a decision there and if we intend to cooperate with other German OEMs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, on the CapEx situation again, I understood the question as a question on whether &#x2013; to explain a little bit on why we could support significant &#x2013; a lot of hard work in the past few years and why the hell now CapEx is coming up.  Now, I think it is important to look at the various fundamental reasons on why we need to spend money for capital expenditures. And while products is an important issue, capacity is another important point and I think I was explaining this in the various conference calls a couple of times for too long a period of course. Volkswagen was not able to enjoy a sufficient capacity utilization rate.  Now, in the meantime, by growing by growing the whole group most of our brands in a very substantial way, we are able to talk about capacity utilization rates which are significantly higher than 90%, which means while for quite a few years we were able to organize a significant growth without capacity related investments.  This time is now at least to a certain extent over.</p>
          <p>And then the other issue is when we say capacity we also have to keep in mind that and this is exactly the motivation of Volkswagen to build currently plants in India and in Russia.  We can only explore markets and take advantage of the specific developments in certain markets if we are able to build cost there, it's by the various trade barriers and couple of other things not always possible just to go for exports.  But that's another important item which is fueling CapEx spent.</p>
          <p>And then just a little comment again on the product side, while we in a very intelligent manner in the meantime are able to use tool kits to build cars with reasonably acceptable amounts of investment it's also to say that we still can save significant amounts of money if we enlarge the utilization of tool kits into one and the other way and that's one of the very key reasons why we are about to see a higher level of investment also flowing into the platforms of our products.  So hopefully this explains a little bit on where we are heading.</p>
          <p>Onto &#x2013; and on the U.S. side to your last question, this is to say that we are pretty much on track in analyzing the overall situation, I think the package of the respective cars which we intend to launch in the market in the meantime clear.  We have excellent feedback from the market in terms of local sourcing and we do expect the final decision on the U.S. somewhere later in the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone.  I have three question if I may. Firstly on the FX, I think on the chart or table, page 11 you showed the FX net negative impact of 0.2 billion year-on-year on the group EBIT. I presume you're nearly fully hedged this year on the FX side, so I don't know if you would give us some indication of what you expect the year-on-year headwind to be so we can sort of gauge a little bit what you are thinking in terms of your guidance for 2008. And also just some indication of the split really between the hedging levels, sorry the hedging level of cover between '08 and '09?  And then, secondly, your capitalization of R&amp;D rose to about 33.8% in Q1, I don't know if you could give us some indication of the full year rate and maybe some sort of medium term, what's a sort of normal level in 2009 and beyond?  And finally I think you made a comment a few days ago on deliveries for the group.  In April, I think you commented something like 7% up on year-over-year or so, I don't know if you can you give us a further update on how that's looking and maybe within that particularly Audi?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Adam.  Three questions again.   For the first question refers to the impact of currencies, if we can give some further details about our hedging rates for 2008 and 2009 and the second question is about the capitalization rate, if we can give an outlook for '08 and '09 too?  And the last question, our deliveries went up by 7% in the first quarter so what do we expect for the full year.  I guess this is a question for Mr. Wittig maybe Mr. Wittig would like to start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as you rightly mentioned, we are up at a rate of 7% for the first three months and the indication of our April sales is that we will keep that pace at 7 maybe 8%.  So we are quite confident that we will able to keep that pace for the rest of the year and that will then mark a new record for the group in total, the group sales deliveries to customers in total.  As far as the brands are concerned in your specific question, as far as Audi is concerned, Audi is continuing the positive trend as shown in one of my charts and we expect Audi to exceed for the first time also the one million threshold this year.  So it will be another record sales here for Audi as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the currency side, first of all the currency headwind shown in the first quarter could be typical for we have to expect for the remainder of the year.  Do we have a different situation with regards to hedging 2008, 2009?  No, as I already said for the next two years we are covered by more than two-thirds for the most important currencies.  The R&amp;D capitalization rate, which was slightly below 30% last year, is expected to be in the framework of 30 to 40% this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry if I could just follow up maybe on the FX?  Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I just follow-up on capitalization rate. Just broadly in the medium term, would that be similar, sort of, of the order of something like 35% is that &#x2013; do you anticipate that as being a normalized level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The normalized level is below 40%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And so you're saying that really this year you are still on the hedging side, you are still to some degree exposed and therefore movements in the currency in the short-term do still matter in terms of 2008 numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fully taken into consideration with our outlook statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then I guess we have time for two questions from analysts, so first, let's take the next question</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question will come from Lothar Lubinetzki with MainFirst.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Hans P&#xF6;tsch.  Two things; one, when I look at the first quarter results for Volkswagen, it looks to me like the numbers in general are fine but if I look at the EBITDA margin of the industrial business, the margin has come down slightly.  So I am wondering whether this is just a trend because the growth in the first quarter was coming from emerging markets primarily China and with the lower model launches your are planning for the rest of the year, whether you will be able to come at least back to the margin we have seen in 2007. And related to this with regard to Adam Jonas' question, if I understood you right, you were telling us that basically, finally, Volkswagen is running out of opportunities for impairments, I think in the last two years, you had 1.1 and one more than 1.2 billion respectively, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Lotha, we didn't hear the last question?  Can you repeat the last question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Earlier on in the conference call, we had discussions about depreciation coming down and I think in the last two years Volkswagen had very high impairments, more than 1 or roughly 1.1 billion last year and more than 1.2 billion in the year before and I was wondering all the time when this will more or less stop.  So it looks like 2008 will be the year when impairments finally will come down is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe I'll go immediately ahead with answering the questions.  First of all the question on the Volkswagen results, you were asking on the EBITDA margin and there only can say again the first three months of the year are not characterized as the full year.  I think, there's all the reason to stay optimistic also on the EBITDA margin.  Secondly, the impairment, it is always let's say related to a certain situation, and so far I think it's difficult to say from today's point of view on whether there will be any basis for impairment or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Now let's take the last question from an analyst.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question will come from Frank Biller with LBBW.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good afternoon.  Just a small question on new products in the U.S.  I heard about the Tiguan, which is selling pretty well in Europe, that there is a delay in the U.S., it's not in spring but in autumn you are going to introduce this car. Maybe you can give us some glance on new products coming to the U.S.?  And one more question of the breakeven U.S., did I get you right?  You already got the breakeven in Q1 and are expecting a breakeven for the whole fiscal year, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you Frank.  So two questions, one is, which new models are planned for North America and the second question is, did we achieve a breakeven in the first quarter of &#x2013; do we expect that for the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to answer the first question, the first part of the question as far as new product is concerned, I think we started early this year at the Detroit Motor Show showing the Passat CC and at the same time also the Jetta Sports Wagon and both were well received. And I think especially with the Passat CC we will be able in the second half of the year to again improve our sales.  And later on, in February this year, we presented at the Chicago Auto Show, the Volkswagen Routan, the minivan &#x2013; the North American built and North American destination, Routan. And again we got a very positive reaction at Chicago Auto Show at the same time also we were presenting the car to our dealers and they were quite happy with it. And we will continue this year with the introduction of on the Audi side with the new Audi A4 and the A5.  And returning once more again to the Volkswagen side, we put a major weight on introducing the TDI, the clean diesel version that we presented also in a Jetta version in Detroit already.</p>
          <p>So that is what we are going to do still during this year, and I would like to point out again that after three months, we are on the Volkswagen side ahead of last year sales without any new product and without increasing our sales incentives.  On the contrary, we are cutting down the sales incentives, so obviously the value of the brand is coming back again, and so we will expect an even better second half of the year with the new product coming in and then the medium term that's all about 2008.  And the medium term as we have mentioned before, we are going to build two new cars especially designed for the North American market, a new compact sedan version and a new mid-size sedan version and this will then give full support to a further step in the turnaround of our North American business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In full accordance with Mr. Wittig, first of all, I can say that we continue to improve in the North America region. Still at the current level of exchange rates it is extremely difficult to break even.  For North America, if we look at the situation from a group's perspective, clearly as far as the local organization is concerned, we will see the breakeven in that organization much more earlier than on the group level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now let's hear what the journalists would like to know, I know we have some questions.  So, please one question only because we are running out of time. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Chad Thomas with Bloomberg News in Berlin.  I am just wondering Mr. P&#xF6;tsch if you can speak a little more about the dollar and what your expectation are for the dollar.  In your internal planning, do you expect the dollar to increase in value at all in the coming months or you are planning it to stay at the level we currently see that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Chad, again a question about currencies, U.S. dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I probably &#x2013; if I knew, I probably would not be sitting here.  I think a twofold answer, first of all, I think looking at the global framework and without passing through all the single elements there, I think there are lot of reasons that we well see the dollar continuing its weak phase. And so far, I think, it's very hard to predict on whether and if ever when we might see a turning of the dollar, which means strengthening up of the dollar.</p>
          <p>At least that's the position we prepare for as a company and on that basis clearly short-term &#x2013; short-term means for the next number of years, we have embarked on reasonably high rates of financial hedging.  The other consequence is that in order to, on the basis of a long-term strategy, deal with which is still the biggest market in world the USA, we need to localize in a very substantial way and we need to offer products, which are clearly made for the American customers.  That's to cut a long story short the answer which we intend to give as a company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon everyone.  Could you give us an indication of what the future of the Fox model looks like in the light of the current currency situation?  Is Volkswagen earning any money with the Fox under these circumstance and if not, are you considering to shift production to other plants to lower the forex exposure, or is even ceasing the production of this model an option at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all the Fox model is very successful in the Brazilian market and it's not only successful as far as sales volume or sales to customer is concerned but also as far as the profit contribution is concerned.  Your question certainly is focusing on the European market and yes, there is as we all know a problem with the currency, with the Brazilian currency.  From that point of view, we have sort of reduced the sales volume and the export volume to Europe but the Fox is still doing quite well in the European market, so it's essential for us to continue selling it here and at least we are balancing prices and volume and demand so that we are breaking even here in the European business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Now, we have the last question and we have to close the call, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our last question will come from Jan Schwartz with Reuters.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi there, good afternoon.  I would like to get one point a little bit clearer, because at the beginning of the call we got the information that you were confident to have reached a turnaround in the U.S. and then later on, there was the information that it is very difficult to turn, to get a turnaround on the Group level.  Could you elaborate a little bit more on this, and so we could get clearer, when do you expect the turnaround in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you.  I guess there is misunderstanding about the performance about the risk earnings in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think basically there might be a misunderstanding, as the market-oriented people might also use or prefer to use the term turnaround in terms of turning around the decline in sales volume.  So if we talk about this, then we can be optimistic to see this turnaround this year, on the basis of the introduction of several new models which we think we've got a good chance to see the sales volume increasing against last year.</p>
          <p>The other question is: when will we see the turnaround on the financial side?  Now, as we demonstrated last year and the year before also we are continuously improving the situation in the North American region, but clearly at the given framework in terms of exchange rates it's difficult to achieve a breakeven situation financially on a Group level.  And hopefully I am not confusing you at this point, but we of course have a situation with regards to the local organization in North America and that's why I said a few minutes ago we can be optimistic after executing a restructuring program, which is already in the execution phase; that we will see the that breakeven in this local organization earlier, significantly earlier than on the Group level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you, this was the last question.  So I would like to come to an end.  I would also thank you very much for taking part in our conference call.  Enjoy the rest of the day and goodbye from here in Wolfsburg.</p>
