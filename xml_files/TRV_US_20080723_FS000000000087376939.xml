          <p>Thank you.  Good morning and welcome to The Travelers discussion of the second quarter 2008 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and we cast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.  With me today is Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO, Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer, Brian MacLean, President, Operating Officer, Joe Lacher, Head of our Personal and Select businesses, as well as other members of senior management.  They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.  They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through their prepared remarks and then we will open it up for questions.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the following on page one of your webcast.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Gabby and welcome to the team. It's good to have you here. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  We're very pleased with solid results this quarter, with operating earnings of $918 million or $1.50 per diluted share, operating return on equity of 14.3%, and a combined ratio of 89.3%.</p>
          <p>But rather than focusing on the specific results we posted this quarter which Jay, Brian and Joe will review with you in detail; this morning, I'm going to take a few minutes to share our perspective on the current operating environment.  Reviewing our first six months, the underlying business has shaped up about as we had expected.  Our revenue strategies are paying off in each of our segments and we see that in our retention rates which remain very high.</p>
          <p>As we outlined at Investor Day, our agents and brokers are embracing our products and that is reflected in the significant increase in deal flow to us in Business Insurance, primarily from TravelersExpress, our new small Commercial platform and IndustryEdge, our new middle market products.  In personal insurance as well, our progress is evidenced by the success of Quantum Auto and Quantum Home.  Nevertheless, our close rates are actually down as we have responded with discipline to the more competitive new business environment.  We have tremendous tenure among our underwriters and we're pleased they have applied their knowledge, learned during previous cycles by exercising such discipline in this marketplace.  So far this year, rate and underlying loss trends are generally developing as we had expected they would with some variances about which Brian will speak later.  Net investment income is down as short rates declined much more than we had originally anticipated they would, and returns on non-fixed income investments, while positive, remain significantly lower than last year.</p>
          <p>We continue to be extremely pleased with our asset portfolio.  We're gratified that Moody's upgraded our debt and insurance financial strength ratings during the second quarter.  While so many other companies are being pressured to raise capital, Travelers remains very strong with a superior balance sheet and significant liquidity.  When we look out to the rest of the year, we're aware of the current economic environment and the potential for an interesting combination of continued low interest rates, a lower growth economy, but higher inflation.  We're looking at a macroeconomic environment which has changed significantly over the last six months and we're certainly taking that environment into account in terms of how we go to market. But let me be clear, we have not yet seen evidence of any real spike in inflation in our loss trend data.</p>
          <p>Finally, we've been as disciplined with regard to the left side of our balance sheet as we have to the right side.  Bill Heyman and his folks have done a terrific job in thinking about risk and in making sure that our risk and return equation is disciplined and thoughtful.  As a result, so far we've been able to avoid all of the missteps that have plagued so many other financial service companies.  We manage our business with long term returns and profitability in mind, and this philosophy has served us particularly well.</p>
          <p>So tying it all together, we remain committed to our long term financial objectives, and I believe the franchise is well positioned to achieve them.  History would suggest that our confidence is well placed.  Since January of 2005, we've achieved an average return on equity of 15.3% after $1.9 billion in after-tax catastrophe losses, including the largest U.S. catastrophe on record, as well as an increasingly competitive and pricing environment in much of our business dating back to 2005.  Our underwriting results over time are a real indication of our underwriting experience, skill and discipline.  So when we look forward to our goal with a mid-teens ROE over time, it's based on what the businesses have achieved, how we underwrite and how we manage our capital.  With that, let me turn it over to Jay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay.  Let me begin by going through some of the highlights for the quarter as shown on page three of the webcast.  As Jay mentioned, second quarter 2008 operating income was $918 million or $1.50 per diluted share, producing an operating return on equity of 14.3%.  Our weighted average diluted share count declined to 611 million shares as we continued to generate capital in excess of our growth needs and used $750 million of that excess capital to repurchase 15.3 million of our common shares in the current quarter.</p>
          <p>And despite dividends and share repurchases of $4.1 billion in the last 12 months, adjusted book value grew, adjusted book value per share grew by 12% in the past year, and 3% in the current quarter.  Later, Brian and Joe will discuss the drivers behind the slight decrease in net written premiums, so let me end my comments on this page by noting how pleased we are to have received a ratings upgrade from Moody's this quarter.</p>
          <p>Page four of the webcast shows the components of operating return on equity as we first displayed them at our May 2008 Investor Day Conference.  Fixed income net investment income less interest expense remained the major driver of year-to-date operating ROE.  This passage of time component produced an 8.8% return in the current period, down slightly from the prior two years due to lower short term interest rates. A much smaller contributor to operating ROE, both historically and year-to-date, is non-fixed income investment income, which produced a positive return of 0.3%, down as expected due to current market conditions.</p>
          <p>Underwriting income continued to provide a very strong return of 5.8% year-to-date driven by healthy underlying underwriting margins along with net favorable prior year development and despite the very high weather related losses.</p>
          <p>As the data on page five indicates, both cats and net favorable prior year reserve development played a meaningful role in our results.  Cat losses, which were concentrated in the business and personal insurance segments, resulted from the unusually large number of severe weather events that occurred during the quarter, include tornados, hail storms, and floods in various regions of the United States. Cat losses, net of reinsurance, added 6.6 points to our GAAP combined ratio this quarter.</p>
          <p>Net favorable prior year reserve development, resulting from better than expected loss experience in each of our business segments, reduced our second quarter GAAP combined ratio by 9.8 points.  As this slide indicates, our GAAP combined ratio when adjusted for cats, net favorable prior year reserve development and last year's timing impact of the change to the fixed value based agent compensation program, increased by 2 points.  This increase, which was less than the 2.4 point increase in this year's first quarter, was generally consistent with our underlying expectations for pricing and loss cost trends and also included the impact of the small increase in the number of large property losses that Brian will discuss later.</p>
          <p>Page six provides further information about our net favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter.  Development was concentrated in our Commercial businesses for accident years 2004 through 2007.  It primarily related to liability lines and was net of an $85 million increase in environmental reserves.  There are many factors that have contributed to our favorable reserve development in recent quarters.  Some we can control and others we cannot.</p>
          <p>Within our control are processes that help to detect unfavorable trends that could lead to unfavorable development, such as having the analytical tools, management information and culture to maintain strict underwriting discipline at all times while maintaining thoughtful and responsible reserving methodologies that constantly loop back to current underwriting and claims experience.</p>
          <p>Also within our control are initiatives that can actually give rise to favorable reserve development, such as the claims initiatives we introduced in recent years that reduced actual claim costs from claim costs assumed in reserving that had been based upon historical settlement values.  These claim initiatives have included faster settlement of auto claims and the use of managed care techniques for workers' comp claims among others.</p>
          <p>Factors that are not within our control include improvements in the legal and judicial environment including tort reform.  All of these factors have continued to play a role in the favorable development of our prior year reserves and in many cases, have translated into improved estimates of profitability for current year business.</p>
          <p>Before turning the microphone over to Brian, I did want to provide an update to certain information we last provided to you over a year ago at our May 2007 Investor Day Conference.  Since that time, we have been actively managing our cat risk by reducing hurricane exposure in coastal areas in the southeast and changing our reinsurance coverage to reduce tail risk and related capital charges, particularly as they relate to northeast winds.  Our focus has been on reducing exposure to highly severe, extremely low frequency events.</p>
          <p>As can be seen on page seven, our estimated probable maximum loss for a single hurricane at the 1-in-100 level, net of reinsurance and after-tax, has been reduced to $1.4 billion or 5% of common equity.  And a single hurricane at the 1-in-250 level also net of reinsurance and after-tax has been reduced to 2.2 billion or 9% of common equity.  I should point out that these estimates would correlate to extremely large industry events, much larger than say a Katrina.</p>
          <p>Our P&amp;L estimates are based upon the assumptions outlined on page two in the a\appendix to this webcast presentation and factor in the July 1, 2008 cat reinsurance renewals that are incorporated into the chart provided on pages 20 and 21 in the Appendix.  The only significant change to our cat reinsurance program in this year's July 1 renewal was the addition of another $250 million of Northeast Only coverage which brought our Northeast Cat Treaty up to 500 million and when combined with our $500 million Cat Bond, brought our total Northeast coverage up to $1 billion, all excess of 2.25 billion.  The cost of our National Cat Treaty was $77 million for the coverage period July 1, 2008 through July 30, 2009 down from $100 million for the prior period.</p>
          <p>I should also point out that this information regarding PMLs [probable maximum losses] is based upon output from analytical modeling related to probability and potential losses which are inherently unpredictable and that actual cat losses could be materially greater than indicated.  I urge you to read page 23 of the Appendix to this webcast and with that let me turn things over to Brian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jay.  I'll begin by going over the production statistics for our Commercial businesses and as you can see, the results continue to be strong.  Current market dynamics are obviously impacting our results but as our numbers indicate in the aggregate, we're managing these market dynamics quite well.  Looking at the details on slide eight, you can see that retentions remain at high levels across all the domestic U.S. Commercial businesses.  These overall high retention levels reflect our ability to withstand marketplace pressures and execute on our strategy to keep profitable business and not sacrifice underwriting results.</p>
          <p>In the International operations, retention was down due to the intentional non-renewal of certain property business in Canada and auto business in Ireland and competitive market conditions impacting our Lloyd's business.  Our business in the UK continued to have strong retention numbers.</p>
          <p>The renewal price changes which reflects both rate and exposure changes, remains generally consistent with recent quarters.  RPC in the Select business which represents about a quarter of the Business Insurance segment was still positive and consistent with the last two quarters.</p>
          <p>In the remaining domestic businesses, the change in RPC was down modestly due to primarily to declining exposures which reflect the broader economic environment.  Underlying rate changes were consistent with last quarter.</p>
          <p>The improvement in the International renewal price change was due to increased exposures primarily in Lloyd's.  Again, our organization has done a great job on preserving our renewal book at appropriate price levels.</p>
          <p>The new business dollars are shown on slide nine.  In the aggregate, they are essentially flat with second quarter last year and last quarter.  In the domestic businesses, they were down slightly and in the International operations new business was up primarily due to Lloyd's.  But to get the real story, you have to get beneath the written dollars and look at deal flow, quote ratios and hit ratios.</p>
          <p>Overall, the flow of new businesses submissions was up in most all our businesses and in some businesses, they were up dramatically.  For example, in Commercial Accounts, our core middle market franchise and Construction, which combined comprised about 25% of the premium in the segment, quotes year-to-date were up about 20% from 2007 and 50% from 2006.</p>
          <p>Our new product offerings, platform enhancements and strong positioning with agents and customers have continued to drive this heavy flow of opportunities and we continue to feel good about the quality of opportunities we're seeing.  Accordingly we're quoting on much of this business and our quote ratio remains fairly consistent with historical trends.  Unfortunately the pricing on new business continues to deteriorate and since we are being just as selective as we've always been, our hit ratio, or the percentage of our quotes where we are winning has been declining through 2007 and the first half of 2008 and we believe that's evidence of our underwriting discipline.</p>
          <p>So we think the real story here is that we've built a franchise which is driving significantly more opportunities our way.  In this more challenging pricing environment, that's enabled us to maintain share where we seek to do so but more importantly, it leaves us extremely well positioned for when the market conditions improve.</p>
          <p>With respect to International, the increase in new business over the prior year quarter is driven by Lloyd's.  As part of our strategy, we have hired two underwriting teams, Power &amp; Utilities and Yachts that have generated over 50 million in new business in the quarter.  These are experienced teams that understand their market.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Business Insurance segment financial results on slide 10, you can see that net written premiums declined 4% quarter-over-quarter.  The decline is due to the market pricing dynamics I just discussed and in these market conditions this feels like the right answer, especially with retention levels remaining very strong.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, Business Insurance operating income was down 18% from the same quarter last year.  The adjusted combined ratio on the page was 93.3 for the quarter, a 2 point deterioration from the second quarter last year.  This decline reflects some compression of our core margin which is essentially in line with our expectations of benign loss trends and moderate price declines, as well as a modest increase in the number of large property losses, which I will discuss in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Our expense ratio after considering the timing impact of the agent compensation program is up about nine-tenths of a point.  Six-tenths of this is the result of a reduction in national account fee income and the remainder is primarily from the decline in earned premium.  So for the domestic U.S. business, we feel great about how we are executing in some difficult market conditions.  Business volumes and margins are down but modestly; and given the marketplace we believe that's a very good result.</p>
          <p>Turning to Financial, Professional and International Insurance [FP&amp;II] on slide 12, the segment continued to produce positive results with operating income up 34% from the same quarter last year, driven by the favorable prior year development.  The adjusted combined ratio of 95.3 was also up 2 points in this segment from the second quarter of '07, reflecting the same market conditions I just described in Business Insurance as well as the increase in large property losses.</p>
          <p>It's probably worth noting right here that the increase in our loss and LAE [loss adjustment expense] ratio in this segment is not the result of increased losses in our management liability business, which includes our D&amp;O [Directors &amp; Officers] portfolio or our surety business which includes or exposure to contractors in general and the Central Artery project in Boston, in particular.</p>
          <p>Financial, Professional and International net written premiums of 985 million in the quarter were flat with the prior year.  Bond and Financial Products premium quarter-over-quarter declined but was more than offset by net written premium growth in our International operations.  Our International operations which benefited from the new business growth in the two new units at Lloyd's also reflected the favorable impact of exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Now I want to take a minute to talk about the property large loss dynamic that I mentioned is running through both Commercial segments.  This increase in loss activity being driven primarily by a modest increase in the number of large property losses in excess of 5 million, net of reinsurance.  We obviously anticipate some losses of this size, but in the first half of 2008, the actual number of losses was above our normal expectations.  So to really quantify this for you, we're talking about seven losses in Business Insurance and five in Financial, Professional, and International.</p>
          <p>More importantly, we manage our limits tightly with a maximum net retention of 15 million in Business Insurance and the UK and five million in our Canadian and Lloyd's operations.  So in the aggregate, it's not a large financial exposure, but it is impacting our combined ratio comparisons in 2008.</p>
          <p>The bigger issue is do we see this as a trend, and if so is it from our underwriting? Well I can tell you for all large losses we scrutinize them very closely. We've examined all our large property losses, we've challenged ourselves and looked at all the data. The events run the gamut from the fire at Universal Studios, to a large sugar plant explosion, to a fire at a hotel under construction in Boston. So we have not seen anything we could yet call a trend other than the obvious, that many Commercial losses are fire related.  So our assessment is that this is not a result of our underwriting or pricing decisions but is an aberration.</p>
          <p>We are aware that industry-wide losses are also up, and so we know that the issue is not unique to our results. But in summary, although it's certainly worth noting for the quarter and year-to-date results, we don't see this as a trend but we are watching it very closely.</p>
          <p>Stepping back to the larger picture, overall our results in this quarter, considering the softer insurance marketplace and the general economic conditions, were very solid. We experienced strong levels of retention, modest price declines on our retained book, a significant flow of new submissions and our core margins are performing as expected. With that let me turn it over to Joe Lacher for the Personal Insurance results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Brian. Personal Insurance results start on page 13. Not surprisingly, weather is a significant part of the segment's results for the quarter. Even against that backdrop, Personal Insurance produced strong results with a combined ratio of 97.3% and $122 million in operating earnings. We had strong production results with increased new business and retention renewal pricing in year-over-year policy in force growth consistent with recent quarters. When comparing the quarter's profitability to the second quarter 2007, earnings were down primarily driven by significant adverse cat and non-cat weather related losses, somewhat less favorable prior year reserve development, and lower net investment income. Excluding these items and the impact of the timing of the 2007 agent compensation program change, the underlying combined ratio was in line with the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking specifically at our property results on page 14 and in the Statistical Supplement, we can see the impact of adverse weather on the quarter. It's not news to any of you that the industry experience for the second quarter is projected to be one of the worst second quarters in a long time. While our property results were impacted by nearly 19 points for catastrophes, we still recorded an underwriting profit with a 96.5% combined ratio.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we continued to grow our business. Policies in force [PIF] increased 3%, retention remained stable at 86%, with a renewal price change of plus 6%.  We remain pleased with the continuing growth of the Quantum Home product and its ability to increase new business volumes despite competitive market conditions. Quantum Home policies now represent a little over 10% of our policies in force.</p>
          <p>Shifting to auto, our combined ratio for the quarter was 97.9%. Catastrophes negatively impacted that combined by 1.5 points in the quarter. We're pleased with our production results in the current market conditions. New business volume was up over 12% versus the prior year quarter and is at the highest levels we've experienced since the first half of 2006 and the rollout of Quantum Auto. Policies in force grew 3% over the prior year quarter and at the same time our renewal price change was plus 2% with retentions consistent with prior quarters.</p>
          <p>We continue to make investments in our business, infrastructure and distribution capabilities to fuel our long term profitable growth. These investments continue to impact our results. Our ongoing agency appointment strategy is one example. As an anecdotal illustration, one of our regions reported in their last internal operating review that over 20% of their new business volume this year came from agents appointed within the last 18 months. They continue to deploy a systematic, segmented distribution expansion and management process that's yielding growth opportunities without the need to be imprudently competitive on pricing.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 15, I'd like to touch on loss inflation in the auto line. Excluding the anticipated impacts from the broader risk profile of Quantum, we saw loss inflation in the quarter to be essentially flat. Frequency trends were down just slightly. We experienced total severity trends up just slightly. Similar to recent quarters, we saw physical damage related severity increasing in the low single digits and bodily injury severity slightly decreasing. We believe this is a big deal. These numbers are not loose impressions; rather they're based on our actual experience. As we've previously discussed, our bodily injury results appear out of pattern and better than what a number of our competitors have reported. We believe this is a direct result of our claim initiatives, which leverage the strength and breadth of our multiline claim organization. This continues to be a leveragable competitive advantage for us.</p>
          <p>While the marketplace remains competitive, we are still seeing increasing signs of firming, particularly in the auto line. We're continuing to monitor these, to monitor loss trends, profitability, and marketplace conditions as well as the changing economic climate as we adjust our tactics going forward. We remain pleased with the businesses' underlying performance and we look forward to building on that success.  With that I'll turn it back over to Jay.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Joe. Net investment income for the quarter is shown on page 16 with $624 million after-tax or $134 million lower than the prior year quarter. Fixed income related NII [net investment income] which was down only $7 million from the prior year quarter was impacted by the lower short term interest rates. The major variance between the two periods occurred due to non-fixed income returns which remained positive but well below the prior year period level as we had expected.</p>
          <p>This low level of non-fixed income related NII resulted from lower real estate and private equity partnership gains due to low transaction volume given current market conditions. Overall our after-tax yield was 3.4% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 17, our investment portfolio and our balance sheet continue to be in terrific shape as we continue to avoid the issues that others have had to deal with. We ended the quarter with almost $26 billion of common equity ex-FAS 115 and book value per share ex-FAS 115 of $43.45, up 3% in the current quarter and up 12% since a year ago. All this after $3.4 billion of share repurchases and $730 million of common stock dividends during the past 12 months. Our capital remains at or above all of our target levels and we continue to generate significant amounts of excess capital and liquidity. Our debt to total cap [capital] ratio was 19.7% at the end of the quarter compared to our 20% target and holding company liquidity was 2.2 billion or twice our target of one year's worth of interest and dividends.</p>
          <p>Page 18 provides updated information concerning our guidance for full year 2008. We continue to expect fully diluted operating income per share of $5.55 to $5.85 which translates into an operating return on equity of approximately 13 to 14%. Our guidance incorporates our results for the first half of the year and assumes the continuation of lower short term interest rates and the more challenging environment we experienced in the first half for non-fixed income investment returns.</p>
          <p>Our guidance now assumes full year cat losses of $785 million pre-tax or $510 million after-tax or $0.84 per share after-tax, which has been adjusted for actual cat losses in the first half of the year. No further prior year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable, no significant change in average invested assets ex-FAS 115, and after approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases for the full year. And a revised weighted average diluted share count of approximately 610 million shares after share repurchases and employee equity awards.</p>
          <p>Before we take questions, I'd like to turn it back to Brian who has a clarification.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes one quick correction. When I was talking about the Business Insurance business flow, what I should have said was that submissions from agents of deals was up 20% from '07 of 50% from '06 in our middle market and construction businesses. And I think I incorrectly used the word quotes there. So, our quote activity is obviously up but not that dramatically. So with that...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning. I was hoping you could touch on a couple of points. First, on the auto frequency trend, can you outline to what extent you think that it's driven by higher gas prices and consumers driving less and the sustainability there. And also with the combined ratio in auto in the high 90s do you feel you need to be taking more rate?</p>
          <p>The second issue I wanted to touch on is, I don't know if you can quantify the full impact of the non-cat weather and the large property losses in the quarter. And finally, Jay if you could touch on your appetite for M&amp;A at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's getting in five for the price of one, Jay. Well done. Joe, do you want to start with auto frequency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the auto frequency piece, Jay, we've seen all of the reports on fewer miles drive per vehicle and lots of speculation on gas prices. We're going to; my answer's going to be equal speculation.  At this point it's unencumbered by facts. It looks like it to us. There's no real way to tell. That seems to be the most logical conclusion. We're not, not making the assumption that it's sustainable and will continue to drop over the long term. Given where we are right now that's not the basic assumption we're looking at going forward. We're obviously constantly watching it and we'll see what happens. But we're not assuming a sustainability as we think about how we're going to navigate the business.</p>
          <p>Relative to the pricing dynamic, we shoot for a mid-teens ROE. I'm not going to comment on specific pricing strategies of how we're going to work through it. We're obviously in the upper end of a tolerable combined ratio and we're obviously seeing the marketplace conditions that we talked about and we'll factor all of that into our pricing thought process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one observation I'd make Jay, is if we were updating the grid that we shared with you previously at Investor Day for targeted product returns, the combined ratio in auto that we generated in the quarter and I think for the six months, let's check that, but I believe that's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The returns that we had in ex for the auto business it would still be in that box that meets our targeted threshold returns. So, at these levels, even given this interest rate environment because we are factoring that into our analysis, there's, the auto business continues to produce our targeted return in that 13 to 18% range that we've disclosed previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At a 97.9 and I pointed it out we've got a 1.5 point impact on catastrophes running through that number. You don't typically see that running through auto numbers and you can track our cats on auto back for a while. So that's somewhat atypical, so we're okay with where it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the response to the merger and acquisition question is the same as it would have been if we were asking three months ago. There's nothing that's particularly changed. We think we have the tools and the requisite skills to grow our business organically and that's clearly our focus. Any transaction that we would even consider we would do so only in the mindset that it would, that we would be convinced conclusively that it would add to shareholder value.</p>
          <p>And that kind of analysis would always incorporate the risk associated with any transaction. And I've articulated them before; balance sheet risk and capital risk and people risk and systems risk and it's high. And we've done enough of them to know how high those risks are. So the answer with respect to the M&amp;A environment is no different than it would have been in the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the property large loss thing, Jay, we're not disclosing the discrete number. I mean, you can &#x2013; but I gave you a lot of information there. So if you want to do the arithmetic for the first six months and say, well if it's about a dozen losses and I gave you the limits. And they weren't all limit losses but you can come up with a number. I think the conclusion there is it's causing a little blip in the first two quarters. The bigger issue as I mentioned in my comments is what does it mean for going forward? And I think we're looking at that just like everybody else in the industry. But...</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks. The two, well one, but first a general question.  Jay I heard your remarks at the outset on inflation. I think the recap was that it's on the radar screen but not yet showing up in the loss cost trends that you're analyzing. At least not in an outsized way. I guess one confirming that that's the right characterization. And two, what types of inflation are highest on your radar screen? That's question one, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Will, your characterization was actually right on. It's, I think all of us are aware of the inflation risk, predominantly from what we've been reading in the financial press, watching oil, now albeit at $126 a barrel down from 140 and the attention that's been paid to it. What I think that people would anecdotally think is that perhaps we've seen it in construction materials already. We've certainly read about increases in prices of cement and increase in prices of building materials generally. Interestingly enough, it hasn't yet evidenced itself in any substantive serious way in our loss trend data, notwithstanding the anecdotal observations.</p>
          <p>But given the fact that we incorporate an estimate of inflation as we price our product and reserve our product, it would be foolish of us not to have it higher on the radar screen than perhaps it might have been six months ago. We have, the industry has benefited from a longstanding period of benign inflation and I think that that has to some extent offset some of the pricing pressure that's been around for a couple years. If in fact that changes, if the inflation dynamic changes, it's obviously something that we need to begin to think about in the context of our pricing strategies. And so that's I think why we've identified it as an item of concern and it belongs on the radar screen for any responsible management team.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Bill (sic) [Will], this is Brian. When you look at the hierarchy of concern, the other one that would be high on the list is medical inflation, which would run through obviously our workers' comp and many of our liability claims. So we watch medical inflation very closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that. And the same characterization holds true there, it's on the radar screen but no apparent change from the recent past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Correct. Certainly we're always seeing minor ups and downs and moves but nothing that's systemic that we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to comment though, because it is obviously information that's available on the workers' compensation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. For example, comp [workers' comp] was a line where we actually net had a little bit of unfavorable development in the quarter. That was due to seeing both pharmaceutical costs and long term care costs inflate higher than what we thought. It actually, if you break the comp disclosure down by year, which I don't think we do publicly, the more recent accidents years, I think it's '05, '06, '07 were still developing favorably and it was the '04 and priors that were net negative. But that was an example of seeing some, I'd say relatively minor, but worth noting inflation trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jay spoke about it earlier but what you're hearing on this call is actually an example of the feedback loop that exists between claim department, loss analysis right back into underwriting.  It's incorporating what we are seeing on the front line on the claims side back into our underwriting analysis that you hope keeps us a step ahead of the game.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that discussion. I'll squeeze in another quick one if I may. Jay you've talked quite a bit before about the evolution of the pricing cycle and suggested that folks who keep a close eye on retention ratios and the new business penalty.  I guess looking for an update to that discussion, retention ratios hanging in there. Has the new business penalty shrunk? Is that part of the reason perhaps that retention ratios are remaining stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so is the short answer. First I would characterize the retention ratios as, actually I wouldn't use the words hanging in there, I think actually they've almost in a sense they are different. This is a different cycle than anything certainly that I think anybody sitting around this table has ever experienced before this long into a pricing deterioration, albeit a modest one where retentions have stayed at the levels that they are and they continue to look just very, very solid.</p>
          <p>If anything in the second quarter, and this is more anecdotal rather than it is factual, because it is hard to track it quite that currently. Our sense was that the market for new business actually became somewhat more heated and the little bit of data that I can offer that's &#x2013; that is interesting; Brian, ran through the point so quickly that I think it gets lost. The number of, the actual deal close submission that we're seeing, is up in many of our businesses and they are up dramatically. And you want talk about competitive advantages, you can't &#x2013; if you never get a deal in the house, you can never bid on it. And so, Brian talked about a 50% increase in deal close submission, in the sum of middle market and construction over the last, was it three years, two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's really quite amazing. The quote ratio, the number of times that we quote, has largely stayed flat, kind of <mark type="inaudible" /> on that. But the hit ratio is actually down. The number of times that we're succeeding, is actually down, and you would take that, and we take that as kind of a leading indicator, on the nature of the competitive market for new business.</p>
          <p>So based upon that data, we would conclude that the second quarter was somewhat more heated for new business, not less. I do understand that you'll then say, well how do you figure that retentions are staying as high as they are? That's the same question that's sort of been out there for a while. This is an interesting market, there's a new business market that has a certain aggressiveness to it and a retention market that has a surprising amount of stability to it. And beyond that I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other point I'd make, maybe in a little bit of giving us some credit here, I don't think there are a lot of competitors that talk about deal flow numbers, so it's not something you can see easily. But given, I doubt that many of them would be talking about a lot more deal flow right now. And so I think part of this honestly does speak to our position in the marketplace, and both our ability to retain our accounts and our ability to attract significantly more deal flow in an economic environment where I don't think there's a lot more deal flow out there in the aggregate. It speaks somewhat to our franchise and what we've been doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jay Benet. There's not a lot going on. What we saw in the data that we had is that as it relates to pending policyholders. So it's not driven by new stuff coming in. But we did see some upward development in defense costs in some of the settlement values. So we just reflected that in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to refresh us, how is that? Has there been any trend there or is this a one-off in terms of where we've seen the previous quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say there's been any trends. I mean, each year, each quarter we go through and evaluate what's taking place. Sometimes it takes a little longer for information to develop for us to act on it. We do, as you said, recognize a fairly modest increase to the reserves. And it's indicative of us always staying on top of what's taking place in our reserves and making sure that our balance sheet is as current as can be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second, you mentioned that 2004 to 2007 accident years, particularly in liability, have been showing some favorable development. Particularly that 2007 year what kind of data are you getting? Is that certainly the minority of the impact or are you seeing that 2007 is really turning into a year that think you might see some profits turning out over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question and when we talk about where the reserve development is taking place, obviously it gets highlighted in particular years, but it also goes back to something that is inherent in the reserving process. That being that when you start analyzing '04, '04 provides you information as to, not just '04, but the starting point then for '05, '06, and '07. So each one of the analyses kind of rolls into the next. So when we talk about adjusting '07, it's not an adjustment based on gee, the current long-tail information is coming in at a rate that's lower than we expected. That's not the primary driver. The more current of the years is driven more by the rollover effect of what's taking place from the prior years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and finally, and I'm being as non-specific as possible and really intend to be. But in the events that you were to make an acquisition, what sort of financial metrics in terms of pay back or in terms of understanding what it has to be in terms of being accretive to Travelers. What do you have to see early on and what do you have to see in over 3 to 5 year periods to justify it in your minds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I really, Josh, know how to answer that question other than to say, which is the same thing that I've been saying, we would have to be convinced that a transaction would add to shareholder value. And I think the way you analyze that is based upon the specific circumstances at the time. Every transaction that I've ever been involved in has always stood on its own analytically. Every one added something different from another so the way in which you approach thinking about what it did for your franchise, there's the transaction that simply adds volume that you bring in geographically, you kind of analyze one way. A transaction that helps you get through a strategic initiative that might be important, you might have a longer view of. So I don't know really how to answer it other than to say that anything that we ever looked at would have to pass a high threshold test of creating shareholder value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my question is just the economy and its potential impact on exposure. Some of the brokers have opined that, particularly at the smaller end of the market that's becoming an issue in their eyes, and it doesn't look based on the premium trends that that necessarily is indicative of what might be happening broadly speaking. So I was just wondering if you'd just give some insights there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, let's make sure we're talking about the same thing. When we talk about exposure, we think about it as units of insurance. So if you're writing an account and they've got one truck, and they are growing their business, and they add a second truck, and they need more insurance, that to us is a change in exposure. So if that's the concept...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jay, I guess it would be more broadly than that. I guess it would be since exposure could be for work comp, could be payrolls, could be autos to your example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be that. Plus just maybe discretionary decisions about how much coverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a lot of our products are rated on receipts, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're an industry that likes economic growth. The more economic growth there is, the more stuff there is to insure. So we're all for building new plants and hiring more people and adding to payrolls. And when payrolls shrink and plants get closed and shuttered, our economic engine turns the other way.</p>
          <p>So in its simplest form, if we're &#x2013; and I can tell you that what we've seen so far, is that exposure, while positive I think in the quarter, was nonetheless lower than what it has been. If that's an early indicator of some slowdown, then that's what it is. I don't know for sure. It's just too early to tell. But &#x2013; so I would say again that exposure in the aggregate was positive in the quarter, it didn't shrink. But it's down from where it was, and we're going to watch that very carefully. And again, I'm not sure that we can do much about it. We'll write more workers' comp business when payrolls go up. To your point, we'll write more property insurance. As companies expand, we do better, as companies contract, we do a little worse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. The other question I had was just, there's been a lot of M&amp;A and this isn't your appetite, but there's been a lot of M&amp;A that's happened particularly smaller, regional companies and does that help or hurt your strategy? I guess what I'm really going at is I would view one of your advantages of being &#x2013; your pockets and your resources and your technology, which creates an advantage.</p>
          <p>As some of these companies perhaps become part of bigger organizations, do you worry about that eroding or given that some of these businesses are net new, they still don't have the economies of scale you have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'd say first that given the stability of this organization, given its feel for stability, that we hope we're beneficiaries any time there's any dislocation in the marketplace. And any time there's a transaction where one company is combining with another, in the agent's office, there's always dislocation, always. And I think given our stability and the clarity of our underwriting profile, that in the near term we end up as the beneficiary of those things. That's more an aspirational statement but a belief more than I can show you analytically and prove to you.</p>
          <p>In the long term there isn't anything that's happened in the last year or two years that caused us to feel at any competitive disadvantage or that the advantages of the company have in any way been compromised or marginalized. I just don't believe that. The transactions have been largely related to relatively small companies with either relatively small geographic footprints or fairly narrow underwriting profiles. I just don't think it makes much of a difference.</p>
          <p>I said before, I didn't think that the two Liberty Mutual transactions would particularly change the competitive marketplace much at all and I still believe that. I still think we're just very well positioned in a competitive arena. We're unusual in that we are a very big company but with a focus on small and middle market commercial business. Most &#x2013; and it's really a function of the history of the organization, how it came together. It's come together with a bunch of individual companies that all had that end of the market to focus and we love it.</p>
          <p>I think we have &#x2013; one of the real advantages is the ability to bring expertise platforms. The TravelersExpress has been nothing short of a home run. It really has been remarkable and it takes real assets to be able to do it, it takes real wherewithal. If you're a little company with a little footprint, you haven't got much of that wherewithal to create a TravelersExpress. So the real scale opportunities that come to us, I think are because we are as big and solid as we are, and yet we market to an end of the market that most competitors don't have that scale to. So it's just an interesting place to be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you guys for keeping the balance sheet conservative. I have a couple of questions, Jay. If I look at the current accident year combined ratio of around 92.5 and add 2.5 points of normalized catastrophes, you'd be around the 95 give or take a few which would suggest a return on equity based on your slide 4 of around 12%. Is it time to focus &#x2013; when would it be time to focus more intently on the expense ratio given that the pricing environment is continuing to be challenging, the opportunities, you're doing the best to get new business, but top line isn't likely to grow significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, Alain, that we focus on expenses all the time. It's always time to focus on expenses. It's never a time not to. But we don't focus candidly on the expense ratio as many analysts tend to look at. And the reason is, is that when you look at the success of this organization, much of it has happened because of investments which drove an increase in the expense ratio and ultimately provided more than offsetting benefit, significantly more than offsetting benefit at the loss ratio.</p>
          <p>I would use all of claim work that Joe has talked about so effectively over the last couple of years. That takes real people and real systems and real spending to have happen. So I would tell you that what we do every day is we think about the long term returns that are available to us in the business and we make the investments that we're going to make that we're convinced will add to that value equation and allow us to continue to hit the mid-teens ROE over time. That's the way that we think about the business.</p>
          <p>If an investment won't help us meet that goal, we're not going to make it regardless of the environment we're in. And if it does make it, we're going to try like heck to make that investment, regardless of the environment. There are going to be times where we are not yet there. I think that's an important point. We're not yet at the point where it would be appropriate to start chipping away at the investment strategy of the organization. It's been very successful, it's a got great governance and diligence process around it and we're going to continue it. If in fact the market continues to deteriorate and two years from now we're having this conversation, I think the bar gets raised and we look at it differently.</p>
          <p>It's not &#x2013; I would tell you when you look at Travelers, it's not at all like the old days in a sense. It's not about cell phones anymore, it's not about plants in the office. We are an unbelievably expense conscious, expense focused organization. And by that I mean, no one wastes any money here. No one wastes any money. And ultimately what you're really talking about is the level of investment that we make to build our business for the future and that gets rigorous analysis all the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a follow up to that. On the Personal auto business, maybe for Joe, the combined ratio was 98.6 and 97.9 if you take away the cats, were reserve releases too quite similar to what you've had in the personal lines? Because that would suggest a combined ratio closer to 98.5. Any way to quantify what's the investment you're making? Why are you still comfortable that you're okay and we shouldn't worry more about it going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the reserve releases and we don't disclose those by line were generally consistent but lower in the quarter than they had been for auto. But they've also been somewhat consistently running for some period of time inside of that line. When we look at the combined ratios and we look at mid-teens ROE and the range we've put on them before, we see the line running inside of that range, admittedly at the less profitable end of that range, but inside of the range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not hard, Alain, in our business when you have the analytics to sit down and know exactly what combined ratio will translate to what return. It's not anecdotal. Joe has a chart and the chart that he has shows here's the combined ratio, here's the achievable return in that product. So we know it and we're watching it very, very carefully and there will come a time when you turn around and you go, if we run the business for the long term and we're going to make those hurdles then something has to change and we'll take that into account as we think about our own pricing strategy. I think Joe said it right. I don't know that we're at the low end of the range of acceptable margin, acceptable return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're certainly at the lower end of it, but still well within that range that lets us meet those thresholds. If that changes, we will change our pricing strategy. We'll rethink it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I promise that's the last question. Jay, in terms of the question in M&amp;A transaction, you mentioned that you'll judge them all in terms of creating shareholder value. I assume that relates to your mid-teens return on equity on average over time that any transaction, you would like it to achieve this, that's how you would measure creating shareholder value from a financial point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's right, Alain. I think that you've got it exactly right. If ultimately we can achieve mid-teens and we end up taking on a transaction and we end up going down to single digits, we haven't achieved much, have we? And I do think you have to look at these things in the long term and that gets again to what are the capital demands of whatever you buy. It's a complex issue but I think you've expressed it exactly right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. The workers' compensation business we saw some small adverse development in the '04 and prior years. Does that change your mind about your decision to increase your workers' compensation business in small accounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. And you know, we've talked about this a little bit in the past, but we are a company that from a guaranteed cost perspective is relatively underweighted in workers' comp, but from an overall corporate expertise and capabilities, and I'm speaking to our larger account comp servicing carrier capabilities, we are a very experienced and knowledgeable comp company with &#x2013; we're pretty confident if not the best, one of the absolute best claim engines in controlling comp losses. So we think we know the line very well.</p>
          <p>We have historically had a very cautious; some might stay overly cautious view of guaranteed cost comp. We have been over the last couple of years very selectively moving forward and trying to look at areas, both by account size and so we've done more in the small account area than not, and also by geography. So this isn't anything close to a one size fits all. But one where we're taking a very selective look at comp, and we continue to think there's opportunities. We went through a bunch of this at Investor Day; we talked about some of our claim capabilities there, so I think that's worth referring back to. We still feel good about the line and the '04 and prior stuff hasn't really changed our view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And the second question is on Personal auto. Joe mentioned that your BI [bodily injury] premiums are increasing less or maybe they are decreasing versus the prior years. Could you help us understand what specifically you were doing versus the other personal auto insurers that keeps your BI claims lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And this is Joe. I did say that our BI severity was decreasing, not increasing, which at least, when we've heard other folks talking about it last couple of quarters, has been inconsistent with what other companies are seeing. I'll point you back a little bit to what we did in our recent Investor Day presentation, because you can get a fair amount of slides and description longer than I can give you at the tail end of this call on those.</p>
          <p>But we're taking advantage of the full breadth of our claims capabilities, some of the managed care as an example, the managed care capabilities that we'd have in our workers' comp claim department to use nurses to triage medical claims from a BI perspective. We're using our medical bill repricing capabilities from workers' comp and the breadth of our networks to run medical bills through from an auto perspective. Those are capabilities that other players wouldn't have without the volume of medical losses that we have running through the entire organization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things that's no secret, but it's not necessarily visible from our financials. We are a very, very large and very successful fee-for-service workers' compensation claim handler for large national accounts. We don't write the guaranteed cost, the first dollar insurance that you'd typically think of, but we handle substantial amounts of claims for large companies being paid a fee for managing those claims on their behalf.</p>
          <p>And there is a significant, developed over literally decades, workers' comp claim handling engine that exists in this organization with real first-rate medical claim expertise, handling medical losses that occur on the job site. That expertise is stretchable. It can be stretched from that workers' comp platform over into the auto bodily injury work. And if you don't have that workers' comp engine behind you, you don't have the ability to do that. And that's a perfect example of where the size of the organization benefits really at the point of claim, that there's a real difference, a competitive difference.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; Vinay Misquith That's great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jay. I wanted to go back to the M&amp;A topic and rather than dance around it, I thought I would ask it a little more directly, knowing your ability to comment may be limited. But obviously there's been a lot of very public media reports about RBS and who's interested in that property. And I guess what's surprising to me, and the part that I hoped you could talk about, is I can understand why you would want to take a look at any big property on the market. But when we see all these media reports that everyone else is dropping out and you're one of the final three left, it implies that you're relatively serious about it.</p>
          <p>I guess what's confusing, and what I hoped you can address, is from your past comments about M&amp;A you've said that international is not a priority, and I can't recall any time in the past you talking about being interested in getting into direct distribution. So it just seems that, I'm not a &#x2013; I can understand you wanting to look at deals that fit strategically, I guess I don't understand why more international and direct distribution whether it be RBS or some other company fit strategically with Travelers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, it's a very, I think, thoughtful question. Let me go back I think it was to 2005 when it was reported on Page A1 of The Wall Street Journal that we were in deep talks with Zurich Financial Services and sources close to the talks were reporting that a transaction was imminent. The only thing I can comment is we're not responsible for media reports.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're responsible for what we say. And ultimately the reason that we came out with our commentary in the Zurich transaction, was that it was being viewed by everyone as though we had said something. And it was being viewed as fact. And in fact, it was proving to be not in the interest of our shareholders not to say something. And I felt responsible to do so.</p>
          <p>I don't feel that sense of responsibility now. I think it's very counter-productive to building shareholder value to comment every time someone suggests that we're looking at something. We're going to look at some things; we're not going to look at others. As I have said before, I think thoughtful managements always stay attuned to what's happening in the marketplace and try and stay knowledgeable about things.</p>
          <p>But I think you have to rest back on my early comment, which is we, notwithstanding the history of the company, and the fact that it was built by acquisition, we're in a very different place now, we're in a very, very different strategic and competitive place. And the only time that we would ever look at something seriously would be if we were absolutely convinced that it would add to shareholder value. So if you're questioning that something wouldn't create shareholder value, I think you can make the assumption that we at least ask ourselves the same question. And I'd like to just leave it at that. I don't think I have anything more to say about any specific company or any rumor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's fair. And to be honest, I don't want you to have to refute everyone out there either. That's a very good answer, and I guess I think you guys are doing a great job executing the strategy you're on, so I'd hate to see you change to do something dramatically different. So it's sounds like we're on the same page. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Jay, your stock has been hovering around or even slightly below your book value per share, and I guess theoretically, I guess what the market is saying is either one, they don't believe your book value per share, which frankly given the reserves that you've seen and given the cleanliness of your asset portfolio doesn't seem to be a big concern, or the second issue is your ROE is relatively quickly going down to your cost of equity capital, I don't know, 9, 10%. I guess I wanted to focus on that. What kind of environment would you have to see for your ROEs to go from where they are now down to that level? And what do you think the chance is of that sort of environment emerging in the next two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jay, there's actually a slide in Jay Benet's presentation that actually answers the question. If you take a look on page four, so far for this year, we've earned a 9.1% return on equity from our investment portfolio in an environment of short rates. We circled the short rates on that back slide because they're actually half of what they were a year ago, 1.7 short rates versus I think 3.8, yes, versus 3.8 a year ago.</p>
          <p>So that's talking about a 200 basis point drop in short rates in that period of time. So we had a 9.1% return on equity just from the investment portfolio, which means that if you wanted, the answer to the question is 100% combined ratio would have produced a 9.1% return on equity in this quarter. And you see the numbers. How far are we away from 100% combined ratio? If rates continue to go down 3, 4, 5%, we will eventually get there. But we're a long way from 100 now.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Jay and Brian you commented that pricing continues to be pretty competitive here. One I was hoping you could get a little more granular and say what lines of business right now are you worried about or actively pulling away from versus what lines of business you think are attractive? And then can you make some comments on what's happening with terms and conditions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think let me take a quick shot, Brian. This is Brian. Consistent with what we've said in the past and I think what a lot of other folks say from account size perspective maybe most importantly, the larger the account the more pressure. Not to say that there isn't pricing pressure anywhere, but clearly smaller accounts a lot less than larger accounts. You can see that a little bit with the fact that in small commercial we're still seeing a total price change a little positive and underneath that, total rate change would be slightly negative but very consistent.</p>
          <p>From a line of business perspective I would say large property stuff is under pressure and something that we're looking at although the large loss dynamic that I talked about especially being industry-wide is beginning to have a lot of folks rethink that. So that might be one that we see some signs of actually the softening mitigating a little bit. Nothing dramatic other than that within the lines. It's much more of an account size.</p>

          <p>It really comes back if you look at the retention rates. We're not in effect pulling back from anything in our business. It would show up in the retentions if we were in any serious way and I think the relevant question is in the new business environment, what's going on, and you can look at the new business numbers and sort of get a pretty good feel for it, I think, of what it is and how we're reacting to it.</p>

          <p>Not dramatically. I mean there is always some movement as markets move, but on our book I would say not dramatically, and I'd probably put the same comment in. The bigger the account the much more pressure there's going to be on that.</p>

You really wouldn't talk about as the question is being asked, you would think about changes in terms and conditions. You would think of that in national property, you would think of it in some of those lines.

          <p>Great. And then one last question, maybe for Joe, on the PD severity that you said was up modestly. What would you attribute that to, and would you expect that the impact of the raw materials prices kind of rising here may continue to put some pressure on that severity here going forward?</p>

          <p>I think it's just generally what's in there already. It's the normal inflation in costs, whether it's parts or labor rates or the like, that's our sense of it. You get some level of model symbol drip that's running through the physical damage severity, just because the newer cars tend to have a higher value and there's a little different repair cost there. So it's that, and we would expect that trend would generally continue.</p>

          <p>Look at the macroeconomic level there hasn't been any meaningful wage push inflation yet. It doesn't mean that there won't be, but you can actually look at Bureau of Labor Statistics data and you'll see that there really is no significant wage push, and one of the things that we'll keep watching as a leading indicator.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the question. It's on the investment portfolio. No one would argue that you don't have one of the cleanest ones out there. I'm just curious how you feel about the turmoil that's surrounding the GSEs and how that may impact your securities? I believe you're at the more senior levels.</p>
          <p>And secondarily with the two monolines being put on watch for downgrade by Moody's, I noticed that your AAAs dropped significantly sequentially in the quarter. I imagine that was because of downgrades of the monolines on your muni book. So if you could talk about how <mark type="inaudible" /> went to AA how would that impact your credit quality.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now first <mark type="inaudible" /> we gave an analysis last quarter where we took the entire municipal bond portfolio and, it's on the web, you can see it, where we actually gave the ratings underlying the securities ex the RAP [risk adjusted performance].</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is an analysis there. And that hasn't changed in any significant way. The portfolio would change from a rating perspective modestly, modestly if....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just noticed that your 10% AAA went from AAA to AA? I thought that it might have been due to monolines losing their ratings.</p>

          <p>Can I address it, Jay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please Bill. I am sorry, we're just getting the page. Go ahead.</p>

          <p>Let me take your. Let's go back and take the questions in order, if we could. In a way we look at the GSE's not unlike municipals. The mortgage backed securities can be viewed as mortgage backeds which are insured, in other words the residual is insured by the GSE.</p>
          <p>In terms of straight obligations of the GSE's, our total for both is a mere 19 million which can be characterized as nothing more than a placeholder. We look at them as financial institutions which have always been much more leveraged than the big money center banks and have treated them accordingly.</p>
          <p>With respect to our mortgage backeds, we look at them on the strength of the underlying mortgages and try not to attribute too much value to the implicit guarantee of the U.S. Government, if there is one, or the guarantee by the GSE of the pools. And the underlying mortgages underlying our mortgage backeds, are in terms of age and seasoning, we think pretty secure. So we feel pretty good about them.</p>
          <p>Skipping to the municipals, I think one has to remember that the principal concern with the monolines is less with their insuring municipal bonds which have very low default rates to begin with, than with their insuring of structured products and with respect to those products, when the insurance falls away there is much greater concern.</p>
          <p>With respect to municipal bonds, I think again one has to remember that the rating scales are very different. A AA may in fact even less than a AA municipal, defaults with the same frequency as a AAA corporate. And you've probably read in the newspaper, of Congressional testimony by municipal treasurers asking or demanding that the rating scales be adjusted. So we have always felt very secure about the credit of the municipal portfolio even in the absence of insurance. And we have never owned a security where we felt we the needed insurance. Our view has been that the insurance is very valuable if a county treasurer absconds with some money, but in a period of financial stress the insurers are likely to have as much stress as the insureds and that what we're seeing. So I hope that's responsive.</p>
