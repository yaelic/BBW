          <p>Welcome and thank you for calling into our fourth quarter conference call. Here with me are Federico Casillas and Mariana Rodriguez. Let me first remind you that we have been &#x2013; we will be hosting our fourth annual analyst meeting next Tuesday, February the 12th here in Mexico City. During the meeting, we will be providing comments not only on the 2007 results, but also on what we are doing to continue creating value for all our shareholders. And I would like you to know that there will be a webcast of the different presentations that you can access through our webpage of Wal-Mart M&#xE9;xico.</p>
          <p>Now let's go into some of the highlights for the results for the year 2007.</p>
          <p>Sales, general expenses as a percentage of total revenues, operating income, EBITDA and net income were the best ever for the company. Return on equity for the year was 25.7%. This is 50 basis points higher than the 25.2% achieved last year, while return on capital employed decreased 70 basis points from 29.8% to 29.1%. Total sales for the year were up 13.3% and 9% in real terms. We opened 136 units from our different business formats, increasing our store capacity by 13%. Our comp stores sales grew 5.8% and 1.8% in real terms.</p>
          <p>As you know, during the year, we faced a slowdown in consumption in Mexico, and at the same time, we had a very difficult comparison versus the previous year. In our case, the driver of sales growth was customer traffic, our stores, clubs and restaurants with a 12.5% total increase during the year. We served 957 million customers during the year. Nevertheless, this pressurized consumption was reflected on a 3.4% increase on the average ticket in real terms versus the previous year.</p>
          <p>We also saw an effect on the mix of sales, being Superama the best-performing format while Suburbia and VIPS the most affected. On our self-service format, we had a good performance in food, while clothing and general merchandise, particularly <mark type="inaudible" /> were the most affected. It is important to mention that general merchandise and clothing represent 51% of our sales.</p>
          <p>In terms of comp stores, the format that had the greatest increase in number of customers were Bodega Aurrera and Wal-Mart Supercenter, and regarding average ticket, the only format that had a positive growth was Sam's Club. As of December, the number of customers increased 12.3% and the average ticket decreased 5.6%. In terms of comp stores, customer count increased 4.4% and average ticket declined 4.1%. Regarding the different regions, the best-performing during the year was the south of the country and the weakest was Mexico City.</p>
          <p>Gross margin for the year was 21.7%, 10 basis points higher than last year, despite the change in sales contributions from the different format as well as the lower participation of Suburbia and VIPS that have a larger gross margin in self-service format. All self-service formats improved their gross margin.</p>
          <p>General expenses increased 7.9% during the year, and recorded the lowest level ever as a percentage of revenue, this is 13.4%. The growth in expenses favorably compares with 9% growth in sales and was achieved despite additional expenses related to the operation of Banco Wal-Mart. Financial income increased 6.8%. This was basically as a result of lower level of cash in 2007 and 2006. Net income increased 10.5% throughout the year while net earnings grew 11.7%. This differentiation is proof of the benefit that our ongoing repurchase program has for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Regarding our balance sheet, as of the end of the year 2007, our cash position amounted to 8,984 million pesos. This is equivalent to 824 million. This year represents 6,564 million pesos less than the previous year mainly due to the investment of 11,262 million pesos equivalent to almost $1 billion in fixed assets. The repurchase of 144 million shares and a dividend payment in cash of $211 million. Additionally, we had a decrease in accounts payable to suppliers because of a calendar effect. That is, one more payment day than last year.  The amount of the payment on December 31st was 3,448 million pesos.</p>
          <p>Before I finish this conference, I would like you to inform that during today's Board meeting, it was decided to call for our Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on March the 12th of this year. During the meeting, a proposal will be presented to pay a dividend of 0.59 pesos per share. This is equivalent to 35% of the 2007 net earnings. This is $0.08 more than last year, as in the case for previous years, dividend will be payable in cash or stock. With this, I'm ending now our conference call for the fourth quarter results, and I thank you again. We will be here, Frederico, Mariana and myself to receive any questions that you may have. Thank you.</p>
