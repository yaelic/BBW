          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enbridge Inc. 2008 Year-End Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Vern Yu. You may proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Enbridge Inc.'s 2008 year-end earnings call. With me this morning are Pat Daniel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Bird, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Development; and Colin Gruending, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I should advise you that during this conference call we may refer to certain information that constitutes forward-looking information. Please take note of the legally required forward-looking information disclaimer in our slides, which generally states that you should not place undue reliance on the statements about the future, since we necessarily apply certain assumptions to reach these conclusions about future outcomes, and future outcomes are always subject to risks and uncertainties affecting our business, including regulatory parameters, weather, economic conditions, exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. A more fulsome discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our securities disclosure filings, which are publicly available both on the SEDAR and EDGAR systems.</p>
          <p>The call is a webcast, and I encourage those people listening by phone to view the supporting slides, which are available on our website at www.enbridge.com/investor. A replay of the call will be available later today, and a transcript will be posted to our website shortly thereafter.</p>
          <p>The Q&amp;A format in this call will be the same as we've been using lately. The initial Q&amp;A will be restricted to the analyst community. And once that's completed, we invite questions from the media. And I'd like to remind you that both Pat Murray and I will be available after this call for any detailed follow-up questions you may have.</p>
          <p>So at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Pat Daniel.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, you're back on the line. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We were interrupted there, so I think I'll start &#x2013; I'm not sure whether everyone on the other end got this. But again, good morning, thanks for joining us. This is the review of our fourth quarter and our year-end results.</p>
          <p>And as I was saying, we're in the very fortunate position at Enbridge of announcing robust earnings for 2008 and for the fourth quarter of 2008. As detailed in our news release this morning, we recorded year-to-date adjusted earnings of $677 million, and that's an increase of 6% over last year. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 203 million, which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>I think most notably, we have achieved these results at a time when both financial and commodity markets were in free fall. The challenges faced by the global economy are absolutely unprecedented, and while we at Enbridge are proud of our results and our continuing ability to deliver value to our shareholders, we are mindful and respectful of the impact of current economic conditions on our customers, our business partners and the communities in which we do business. Richard is going to give you a more detailed look in a moment at the financial results.</p>
          <p>The increase in earnings for 2008 is primarily due to the continuing progress that we've made on our slate of commercially secured liquids pipeline projects. In 2008, we completed the Waupisoo Pipeline ahead of schedule and on budget. We continued construction of Southern Access and began construction in Canada on Alberta Clipper and Southern Lights projects. We also had a successful first year of incentive regulation at Enbridge Gas Distribution.</p>
          <p>So we ended the year at $1.88 per share adjusted, which was close to the mid-point of upwardly revised 2008 guidance. On the strength of these earnings, and our future outlook, we were able in December of 2008 to announce a 12% increase in our dividends. And we do remain very well positioned to deliver the 20% increase in earnings in 2009 that we discussed on our recent guidance call.</p>
          <p>Even with the turmoil in the markets, we're still confident that Enbridge is on track for 10 plus percent five-year EPS growth, as we continue to bring our liquids pipeline growth projects into service. And of course with 2008 behind us, we're now into the steeper part of that growth curve over the remaining four years through 2012. And as I've said before, we really now are moving into the sweet spot for our investors.</p>
          <p>Beyond 2012, it's now clear that the slowdown in upstream oil sands development activity will delay a portion of our longer-term liquids pipeline growth projects. However, shippers are continuing to express interest in a number of projects required by 2012 and 2013 to support selected oil sands projects, which are still on track.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, we expect that crude oil prices and oil sands cost will re-establish an equilibrium, which will support steady and sustained growth well beyond 2012, though at a more modest pace than what we've seen in the past.</p>
          <p>Strong customer relations have always been a priority for Enbridge and the key ingredient in the long-term success of the company. So to sustain these relationships we will need to be responsive to the impact of the current environment and anticipated supply, demand and pricing dynamics. With our regional, existing regional and mainline infrastructure, we have the ability to offer shippers a range of creative and flexible options to meet their transportation needs. In fact, it's really in this environment where being the low-cost crude oil transporter and one of the lowest-cost gas distribution companies in North America that Enbridge really shines.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to spend a minute on the topic of productivity improvement. Realignment of the oil and gas industry cost structure is a critical requirement in the current commodity price environment, and we are part of the cost structure for our customers. We're embarking on a major initiative to reduce the cost of our services to our customers across all aspects of our energy delivery business. We have a long track record of successfully managing our costs, improving our productivity and sharing the savings with our customers. And this has become an even more important success factor for Enbridge right now.</p>
          <p>Turning back to our growth prospects, we see the pendulum of opportunities swinging back towards natural gas. And this will play a role in offsetting the anticipated slowdown in liquids pipelining growth projects post-2012. The strategic location of our existing assets in Texas, our interest in the Alliance Pipeline really helped position Enbridge to capture a number of organic growth opportunities driven by shale gas development onshore and by continuing development of the U.S. Rockies gas. We're very encouraged by the strong progress being made on the Rockies Alliance Pipeline. And we have the financial strength to be a valued partner in many of these developments.</p>
          <p>At the same time our ownership interest in the number of offshore pipeline systems placed us well to benefit from new production in the deepwater offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. These new projects would be more in line with Enbridge investment pieces than prior Gulf investments have been. They'll be structured in a way that will include a minimum return, guaranteed to take-or-pay type arrangements with the normal life of basin agreements being attached to them thereafter. And this would help to better align the offshore assets with the overall Enbridge investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>So to conclude before I turn it over to Richard, while the composition of our post-2012 growth is shifting in response to the business environment, we still expect to achieve solid long-term growth rates while preserving the safety and income components of this tried and true investment value proposition.</p>
          <p>So with that, now I'll ask Richard to review the financial details to 2008 and also update our financing plans and earnings growth going forward. Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Pat. Good morning, everybody. So, I'll start off with the 2008 results, and as announced this morning, our reported net income for the fourth quarter was $263 million, compared with 249 million in 2007. Adjusting for non-operating items, fourth quarter earnings were 203 million or $0.55 per share, which are comparable to the prior year.</p>
          <p>Full-year adjusted earnings increased from 637 million in 2007 to 677 million in 2008, which represents an increase of approximately 6%. As Pat stated, 2008 is really the calm before the storm when it comes to EPS growth as we expect to deliver about a 20% growth rate for 2009.</p>
          <p>As we expected, the damage on our systems and upstream platforms from the Hurricanes Ike and Gustav had a drag on Q4 results. I should also note that the unprecedented fall in commodity prices during the quarter was a real life stress test of our earnings at risk metric. Our strict measurement and management of market price risk ensured that our Q4 earnings were not impacted overly by this commodity price volatility.</p>
          <p>I'll now take you through a quick summary of each operating segment, highlighting the major factors. Liquids Pipelines continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter. As has been the story all year, increased earnings were a result of AEDC being accrued for Southern Lights and within the Enbridge system, the Alberta Clipper and Southern Access Expansions.</p>
          <p>The Enbridge System also performed better on the annual metrics &#x2013; performance metrics under the IGS earning approximately 15 million in 2008 versus 11 million in 2007 as the bonuses under those metrics. Lastly, of note is a stronger performance from the Athabasca System, which includes the Waupisoo Pipeline, which as Pat mentioned, was placed into service in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>As I noted earlier, the Gas Pipelines segment was negatively impacted by the effects of the hurricanes, offshore results were reduced by seven million in the fourth quarter, which brought us to 11 million for the full year as a result of repair costs and lost revenue from those hurricanes. Insurance proceeds are currently being sought and are not reflected in those numbers. They will probably not materialize until the second or third quarter of this year, 2009.</p>
          <p>Within the Sponsored Investments, Enbridge Energy Partners continued its strong performance, with an increase in adjusted earnings of over 35% in the fourth quarter, and over 25% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year increases were a result of increased performance within the Liquids Pipelines segment of EEP, and higher GP incentive earnings as a result of the distribution increase announced earlier in 2008.</p>
          <p>Enbridge also benefited from our increased ownership percentage. As you'll recall, on December 4, Enbridge injected US$500 million into EEP, increasing our stake to 27%. Of course, that effect will kick in more significantly as we move into 2009.</p>
          <p>Earnings within Enbridge Income Fund were comparable in the quarter, and increased year-over-year due to increased preferred distributions and incentive income as a result of the 2008 distribution increases made by the Fund. Earnings were further enhanced by the improved performance from the Saskatchewan System as a result of the expansion placed into service in the second quarter of 2008. The Fund's contribution should continue to increase as a result of the 12% increase in the monthly distribution rate announced for 2009.</p>
          <p>Gas Distribution &amp; Services earnings also improved in 2008. EGD's results reflect early success during the first year of incentive regulation, although the quarter was down from the prior year due to EGD accruing or sharing with the rate payers as provided for in the incentive regulation agreement. Within this first year, EGD was able to achieve about 50 basis points of improvement in return on equity relative to the regulated rate. That's about halfway to our target of 100 to 150 basis points, which we expect to reach, at least the lower end of, this year, in 2009.</p>
          <p>Gas Distribution &amp; Services earnings were also improved as a result of higher earnings from Aux Sable, which we had locked in through our risk management process. So even during months of lower fractionation spreads, we were able to capitalize on positive hedging results. And as we mentioned on the 2009 guidance call, we have already locked in the 2008 level for 2009 on Aux Sable, with the potential for further upside if frac spreads rebound to some degree.</p>
          <p>Energy Services reversed its performance from the third quarter and had a strong end to the year as a result of increased volumes and margins on storage and transportation contracts. International results, of course, continue to reflect the sale of CLH in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>And lastly, corporate costs were comparable on a year-over-year basis, but higher in the fourth quarter; that was due to a variety of smaller items, including increased interest expense and higher staff cost. In the full year, that was offset by decreased interest expenses as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of CLH.</p>
          <p>I'll now move on to provide an update of our financing outlook. Our spending in 2008 came in as expected, and our 2009 capital expenditure program remains unchanged from the update that we had provided during the earnings guidance call back in December. The balance of the five-year capital expenditure forecast also remains <mark type="audio gap" />. This leaves the funding waterfall in the same position with about 600 million of additional equity required to fund our commercially secured capital investment opportunities over the next five years, of which above 200 million falls into this year.</p>
          <p>Something that has changed a bit is our liquidity position. Until recently we had been carrying total bank credit facilities of 6.2 billion with a little under three billion unutilized and available to bridge our capital expenditure program through to attractive capital market issuance opportunities. That amount of liquidity is adequate to accommodate our commercially secured capital program. However, to provide increased flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities, we recently bolstered our committed facilities with an additional 475 million, 364-day extendable facility with a one-year term-out.</p>
          <p>Our total bank facilities now stand at 6.7 billion and we have 3.3 billion of available liquidity on these lines. Our total funding requirement for 2009, or at least for the balance of the year, is only $2.7 billion, and this takes into consideration the remaining 2009 capital expenditures plus debt maturities, net against our funds from operation.</p>
          <p>So we continue to have more than we need in terms of liquidity, but in this environment too much is significantly better than not enough and does leave us with a flexibility to pursue additional opportunities over and above those that we have commercially secured.</p>
          <p>We will however, remain on the lookout for additional favorable equity capital sources, and I do emphasize favorable, as there is no immediate need to do anything. This will ensure that we have even further additional capacity and flexibility to take advantage of potential investment opportunities that Pat discussed earlier.</p>
          <p>We will still consider any of the three alternatives of asset sales, asset monetizations and/or an equity issuance if a favorable funding opportunity emerges on any of these fronts to secure a little further equity capitalization.</p>
          <p>Back to you, Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thanks, Richard. And let me maybe just very quickly wrap up some of the key takeaways from this call. First of all, 2008 was another good year for Enbridge, not only from the perspective of our financial results, but also from a project management and execution point of view.</p>
          <p>The recent market fluctuations have also proven out the safety attribute of our investment pieces and adds comfort to the 12% dividend increase that we announced back in December. Our 10 plus percent earnings per share average annual growth rate through 2012 is still looking very good, and we see good potential to maintain our growth thereafter, albeit with some shift in the composition of that growth, possibly.</p>
          <p>We remain very focused on working closely with our shippers and ensuring that we're responsive to their needs and flexible and creative in the solutions that we come up with. In tandem, we're moving into a period of even greater focus on productivity management to ensure we maintain those win-win relationships that we've always been known for with our customer base.</p>
          <p>And finally, all in all, Enbridge offers an investment proposition, which combines safety, income and unparallel growth even in extremely difficult financial and business markets.</p>
          <p>So that concludes our updates today, and I think we can now move on to the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Robert Kwan with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. You spent, Pat, a lot of time talking about your customer relationships. I was wondering if you could touch on a couple of things related to that. One being, have there been any approaches from CAPP or just general shippers about slowing down construction on something like Alberta Clipper? And then secondly, have there been &#x2013; have you made any progress with respect to the upcoming expiry on &#x2013; of the ITS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Robert, and the answer to both of those questions is yes. We have talked about potentially slowing down Alberta Clipper, but for some very good reasons, I'm going to give in a moment, we don't intend to do that. The reason for this approach is of course is because of the slowdown upstream and producers not wanting to be overpiped out of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.</p>
          <p>However, we have &#x2013; we're well along in Alberta Clipper, and it would be a mistake to stop construction at this point, recognizing that Alberta Clipper will be used when it's put in place because of the very strong power efficiencies associated with the new pipeline. So getting it in place and reducing power cost is important to our customers. So we and they have agreed that the pipeline will continue on schedule.</p>
          <p>With regard to ITS, we are just in the early stages of starting to discuss the renewal of the incentive tolling agreement, and I'm sure, as you can appreciate, with everything that's been going on in the industry right now, it's hard for the upstream, in particular, to find the time to get started on that initiative. But we've had some initial discussions on it, and the objective being, and as a matter of fact, I discussed this directly with CAPP last week, the objective being the same that it has been in the past. We don't want to be in hearing rooms on a regular basis. We want to work constructively to make sure both sides benefit from the new ITS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Is there any early indication on ITS? I know previously there was the thought that there was going to be some downward pressure with the current environment. Do you think that might be the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say that, Robert. I think that we've got such a good strong track record of deals that provide win-win, that that is more likely the theme going forward than any downward pressure theme. As long as we can continue to produce as much benefit for our customers in terms of cost savings and improved quality metrics, which I think may actually be even more important to them going forward, that that will be more likely the controlling factor in ITS renegotiation.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst with BMO Capital. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Pat, clearly there is a need for another pipeline out of the Rocky Mountains, and Rockies Alliance could very well fit that bill. It looks like near-term, however, that open season has sort of been kind of delayed until market conditions will allow to go forward. Until such time as we rebalance the U.S. gas market, are you seeing other opportunities to participate in large diameter pipes, whether it's Ruby, whether it's something in the mid-continent? And as you shift your sights longer-term to U.S. gas, maybe away from the oil sands, should we would be thinking in context of in ENB or in EEP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Multiple questions there, Carl, and if I didn't get every part of it, make sure you -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; to it at the end. But first of all, yeah, we are seeing strong interest in Rockies Alliance, but you're absolutely right, in today's low price scenario for natural gas, it's a challenging time for gas producers to make long-term commitments, particularly with the net-backs the way they are in the Rockies, although it's one of those, do you drain the swamp or let the alligators keep biting away? We do need to get additional pipe capacity out of the Rockies to be able to improve that basis differential. But due to the environment that we're in, it's a little difficult to get people to participate. We continue to work, we think that the right place to get to is Chicago, and feel we've got a very attractive proposal there.</p>
          <p>Second part of your question, generally speaking, Enbridge is considered as a very favorable partner right now because of the strength of our balance sheet and the relatively strong position that we're in compared to our peer group. So we think we're going to have an opportunity to participate in projects that we wouldn't otherwise have where it might be us or the competition. We think there may be some opportunities for us to work with the competition because of the strength of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And I guess the third part of the question, if I got all three parts correctly, the &#x2013; I think it &#x2013; we'll have to assess project by project whether it would be at the corporate Enbridge level or whether it would be at the MLP level. If it's a gas gathering and processing development in association with the shale play, it would tend to be in the partnership. If it's major interstate transportation, it would be more likely to be at the Enbridge level.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kuske with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. With the moderation in oil sands growth post-2012 and your statements to that effect in the press release, do you see this as a potential on the natural gas side to be involved in a bigger, broader, restructuring of EEP, just given were their pipes are predominantly located? They're very well exposed to a couple of the emerging shale plays. But does that motivate you do something bigger, broader and bolder with EEP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, it could and &#x2013; but I think it's fair to say at this point, our main objective is to evaluate the fundamentals in some detail around the gas business and the shale plays and what that will lead to in light of what has become another gas bubble in terms of North American supply. And how that will play out, where the demand for that is going to be, and most likely in gas-fired power generation, and how we then provide the infrastructure for it. So we're working very hard at that fundamental level right now, rather than kind of at a restructuring level for EEP. As you know we've looked at a number of different alternatives. I think they we're pretty well educated on that subject and will come up with the right structure to meet their future needs.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in the context of just your views on the gas markets. How do you see the offshore pipelines fitting into that? Those assets, since you bought them, they haven't delivered really all that great financial results for you. And yes, you've been troubled with a couple of hurricanes that have rolled through and some severe hurricanes, and that has pushed out activity. And I just &#x2013; what's your view on how the offshore pipelines fit into the Enbridge family?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, in some ways, the financial model around the offshore pipelines probably falls a little on the outer edge of the Enbridge investment proposition, because we carry a little more risk than we normally would, primarily reserves dedication risk rather than throughput commitment risk.</p>
          <p>And as we expand and grow in the Gulf, and as you know we're the best positioned of all companies to do that because of our infrastructure, we'll try to move more towards take-or-pay commitments that bring a kind of a base level of return that we're happy with and then some upside if we see better volumes. So we're going to try to kind of tighten the model up a little bit, and at the same time work very closely with the customers that have got some pretty exciting developments underway there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Just a question on your Wave 2 projects. If in the best case we would have seen those projects at the sort of 17 billion magnitude completed over a five-year period. What would you say is the proper time period post-2012 to be looking at now? And also what is the magnitude, and how does that magnitude change now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's going to be &#x2013; it's probably a little early for us to quantify that for you, Petro. We, of course, are listening and working very intently with our upstream customers, many of whom have talked about as much as a year to year and a half to two-year delay in their projects.</p>
          <p>However, we expect some projects will continue to go and might actually even accelerate a little bit. So we may find that in that Wave 2, some of the early on projects continue on, and then those that were a little bit later out get pushed back a year or two. But I think we're going to need a little longer time to assess that as we determine just kind of where commodity prices are going and how quickly the cost structure is reacting here in Western Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up. You've indicated more opportunities on the gas side post-2012. And &#x2013; I mean, do you see yourself introducing at some point some kind of number in a revised Wave 2 project outlook that includes some relatively larger magnitude in gas projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I think it's fair to say that we will see some delay and push out beyond that, what then would be the 10 years of our long-range plan on some of the oil projects and some gas projects to fill it in. So yeah &#x2013; the answer to your question will be yes, we would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; but no care to quantify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little early to do that at this point, but we have mentioned two or three of the very exciting gas opportunities that already have emerged, the Rockies Alliance Project, the potential to tie in some of the new deepwater Gulf and then some of the activities around the shale plays. So we're very active already on the gas side in developing alternate opportunities.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Pat, TransCanada seems adamant about building Keystone to the Gulf Coast. I'd like your most recent thoughts on whether if that makes sense, and if it does go ahead on this timeframe, and what you're saying is that Alberta Clipper also goes full stream ahead, what are the potential impacts on Enbridge, or how do you see that affecting your business if it comes to pass?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all I can go by is what I read with regard to Keystone, and the indications are that that project is going to get built and come on stream, Matthew. So we've of course looked at it to determine what the impact will be, and to tell you the truth, bottom line financially, there's no impact on Enbridge at all as a result of the nature of the agreements that we've got in place. And I think it will be up to the industry to determine just how much capacity they want and where they go in terms of growth going forward beyond that.</p>
          <p>We are in the process right now of re-forecasting, as you know, right about this time of the year, we come out with a forecast for produceability out of Western Canada. CAPP did do a reforecast in December, but I think even now its members are feeling that that forecast may have been a little bit aggressive. So we'll get a better feel for what the total ex-Alberta capacity is going to be over the next month or so. But in terms of bottom-line impact on Enbridge, Keystone doesn't have any impact on us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that answer. And when you talk about acquisitions, do you think about Canada at all, any more? There's obviously a fair bit of disarray in the income fund area given the taxation of 2011 and a lot of the income funds' valuations have come off a lot, both in midstream and pipeline. Is that scenario that would at all attract interest? I mean valuation aside, just from a business strategy perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're always reluctant to talk about anything very specific on the acquisition front, Matthew, for reasons that you know well. I will say that we are very, very well positioned, relatively speaking, with the value of our currency with the balance sheet and the strategic positioning that we've got, with the liquidity that Richard mentioned to be very selective in what we do and to ensure that anything we do is accretive to shareholders and beneficial strategically. So that's really about all I can say at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, can I sneak in one little detail question for Richard, which is on slide 10, on your CapEx forecast. Why is the CapEx projection for 2011 come up so much relative to prior? What is the specific project, Richard, that's boosted the 2011 CapEx forecast?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Linda, it's &#x2013; I think the total, as you know, is disclosed there, I think, 7.6 for the quarter, 7.6 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that's 7.6 for both?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for total system, it's 7.6 million, the quarter. And to decompose that into buckets, Clipper, 4.9; Southern Access, none, because it's in service earlier in the year &#x2013; at least for the quarter, obviously, and then Line 4 roughly two million, and then some other minor, less than a million on NRAs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just as a comment. Your System earnings are about a third of your earnings for the quarter, but it's about one line out of 20. So it would be appreciated in future, maybe if there would be an opportunity to increase the granularity on that, that would be helpful from a modeling perspective.</p>
          <p>And I guess just another detailed follow-up question on the System. Of the $15 million ITS bonus in the quarter, would it be possible perhaps to break that down between the different components of your performance, under the different metrics?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just a follow-up on the bonus question. I think that 15 is almost all exclusively quality bonus. That doesn't include costs because it's measured separately, and throughput levels haven't been high enough, I don't think, to generate any of the capacity bonuses. So if it's different from that, we'll get back to you, Linda, but I think it's almost all quality.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Respecting you have a great deal still to do by 2012 and then perhaps risk of drop-off at that point, I'm just curious, Pat, if anything's come up on your plate longer-term with respect to transmission interests, smart grid, gas distribution merging with power distribution, that kind of angle, or is it just simply not on your radar screen yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really nothing substantial in those areas, Sam. We do have some work that we're doing through the distribution utility on electric metering, but nothing substantial in terms of growth potential there. And by the way, you speak to the risk of drop off. Don't forget that if you take a look at where Enbridge is as we move out towards this 2011 and '12 timeframe, we're sitting in a very strong position with over $1 billion a year of free cash flow as a result of the projects that are coming on stream and an excellent positioning geographically to take advantage of all kinds of opportunities. So &#x2013; but nothing in particular in the areas that you're asking about now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You haven't mentioned frontier gas for a while, is there anything to mention with frontier gas at this stage? Mackenzie in Alaska of any consequence to Enbridge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. I think you would have to agree that the economics of those projects will be challenged as long as we've got a significant gas bubble in terms of oversupply and under demand in the Lower 48. And hence it will be hard to make the economics work. Also a fairly significant, what I would call worldwide LNG overhang, kind of sitting in behind it, there is likely more favorably priced gas. So it's hard to imagine that gas being economically viable in the near-term, Sam.</p>

          <p>The only other area that we're looking at in addition to those two, which have been very successful for us, is potentially solar. And there are a few opportunities that our Pathfinders Group has been looking at. That's the same group that got us into the fuel cell and wind business. And we think, there may be some opportunities to do economic solar projects, and we're in the process of evaluating that right now, too early to guesstimate the size or scope of it, though, Sam.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">

          <p>Yes, thank you. Good morning. I was just curious with your position in pipeline building, what the current trend is for costs, i.e., steels and labor, and what ultimate impact that might have on your CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Jim. Yeah, first of all, with regard to steel costs. Steel costs have come down pretty dramatically over the last six months, and I'm going to ballpark a couple of numbers for you because I don't have a recent update. But I think we were &#x2013; scrap steel was priced at around $850 a ton back six months ago and is more like 250 right now. So that's been a pretty dramatic reduction. And steel and pipe is about a third of the cost of building a pipeline, so we're looking really good on that front.</p>
          <p>Another third of the cost relates to basically the pipe laid crews and the contractors, and we're starting to see some pricing tension come into that market now, which we didn't have a year ago. We were not able to get any fixed-bid contracts a year ago. Now we're starting to be able to do that. And it hasn't been so much as &#x2013; and we're seeing some improvement in the overall costing, not so much due to labor rates coming down, but due to improvements in productivity. And we've seen some significant progress in that direction. A little early to quantify that for you, but we had a fair bit of room to move in terms of improving productivity. So we're quite encouraged, but it's going to take a little while to fully work through.</p>

          <p>Pat, with the acquisition market looking like it might be coming back, and you're talking about the pendulum swinging back towards gas. A couple of things that you talked about several years ago, one being increasing international, and the second being the potential for a scale changing acquisition. Are those back on the radar screen from an acquisition front, or is there very much more focus on the gas business and how it would fit strategically into your existing assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think to answer your question quickly and then to come back and elaborate, we're not likely to enter into what I would refer to as a scale-changing deal at this point. Realize that we're, as I mentioned in my remarks, moving into the sweet spot in terms of providing return for our shareholders right now, and will be over the next four years as we continue this 10-plus percent growth, organic growth. And as I have said so often before, organic growth is relatively low-risk compared to major acquisition growth.</p>
          <p>And you're right, if I go back eight years-plus to when I came into this job, I was looking at doing some kind of a scale-changing acquisition in order to get the growth that we needed. But we've been able to do that through organic, and we've achieved the growth through a very low-risk investment proposition. So anything that we would do would probably tend to be on the smaller side, very opportunistic and grow out the map to take advantage of the strategic opportunities we have going forward.</p>
          <p>And we never really, as you know, kind of viewed international, so much as international, as simply a couple of very good investment opportunities, the ones that we had in Spain and Colombia. And we're not &#x2013; it's not that we've always been intent on building an international division. If we saw a really good investment opportunity, then we could do it. But it has to have the right numbers and the right risk profile around it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a quick question is, in North Dakota, we're hearing about some gas and oil shut-ins. How is this affecting Enbridge and Enbridge Energy Partners?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to be specific to the oil shut-in, Steven. We have got a major expansion underway of our North Dakota oil system right now to accommodate the increased production, and that expansion is being sized to carry all of the new production. I don't know whether &#x2013; I can't comment on any particular well or location that might be shut-in, but we certainly are going to have the capacity there to address everything in the Bakken in North Dakota.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are looking at providing gas infrastructure to take some of the associated gas out of that play. But, Richard, I don't know whether you've got anything more specific on the shut-in issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, I think Steven is probably right, just because the Bakken production has been ramping up so quickly. There is a lag in certain areas between how quickly infrastructure can be put in place to service that, and that really is what's driving both the expansion that we just completed and the expansion that Pat just referred to. So I think you're right, there is &#x2013; there are capacity shortfalls, and to some extent that will continue until the current expansion is completed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the current expansion should take in all the production that's available out there, on both the Saskatchewan and the North Dakota sides?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've actually got two expansions underway, one on our South Saskatchewan system and one in Dakota, but the answer is yes, it should.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course that's what we believed with the prior round of expansions on both those systems as well, so it's tended to be a moving target. But at the moment, the expansion on both the Saskatchewan system and the North Dakota system are both designed to accommodate the expected increase in production.</p>

          <p>Great, thank you very much. In the fourth quarter, you took a provision that EGD for some full-year incentive savings sharing. How much was this?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a provision, so to speak, it's an expense, and it was about four million. You might conceivably be mixing together two things. There was a small provision that was taken for further restructuring to achieve further savings on the incentive regulation. And in addition to that there was sharing recorded for the rate payers, and that latter number was in the vicinity of four million.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thank you. And in terms of the Energy Services, it performed very well for &#x2013; with increased margins and volumes. What's the likelihood of this continuing?</p>

          <p>I think it's very good in this present environment, Juan, excellent prospects there for that continuing. The sharp contango in the market makes that very attractive when you've got physical storage available to you.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. You mentioned solar power in one of the analyst questions. Can you explain a little bit more about what you're thinking in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, realize, Carrie, that it's very early on, and as I mentioned this is something that our Pathfinders Group has been looking at. We at Enbridge have had this group in operation for about a decade now, and they try to kind of stay out ahead of the curve in terms of new things that are coming along. And hence any investment that we might make would be very small in the early going until we get some level of expertise and comfort going forward.</p>
          <p>But we're looking at, to tell you the truth, primarily opportunities in Ontario right now where there are good incentives in the solar business and some existing projects and whether there is room for Enbridge to be an investor in those.</p>
