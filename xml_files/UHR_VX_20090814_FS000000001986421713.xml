          <p>Good afternoon. I am Moira, the conference call Operator for this conference. Welcome to the Swatch Group Half Year Results 2009 Conference Call. Please note that for the duration of the presentation, all participants will be in listen-only mode. And the conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayek Jr., CEO of the Swatch Group. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our telephone conference for the half-year results 2009. I have with me around the table Mrs. Arlette Emch, now responsible new for Swatch and all the other affairs that you know Japan, Dress Your Body, Calvin Klein, expect, she will hit me if I forget something.</p>
          <p>And we have Mr. Darwish with us of the Electronic sector responsible. Mr. Geiser, this time we have two Chief Financial Officers, Mr. Geiser on my left side and Mr. Kenel is here also on my right. So it's a tough time for me. You see I have &#x2013; they have put me two financial bosses near me.</p>
          <p>Marc Hayek, who usually is also in this meeting. He is running for the Blancpain Lamborghini Cup in Silverstone and after his third place last time, we hope that he is winning this time.</p>
          <p>Mr. D&#xFC;rr, he is with us via telephone line. He had the bad idea to take holidays during two weeks in Majorca, and he was surprised as all of you that we come out already with the numbers on Friday. He would have hoped we let him make his holiday until the end of the week.</p>
          <p>Okay, now like always let's come very quickly to your questions and answers or Mr. &#x2013; now I'm in a conflict, Mr. Geiser or Mr. Kenel you want to add something before that we start the question and answer session.</p>
          <p>No. They said they were waiting and listening to your comments. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>First question, Mr. Montagnani.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is from Mr. Mario Montagnani from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations on these very good set of figures for today. A couple of questions for you, the first one is on your comment today about a four to 5% growth in 2009, you will be happy obviously with this kind of number. And I was just wondering, where do you see the growth coming from in terms of brands, regions, and is that in effect of restocking or sell-out?</p>
          <p>The second question I have for you is, if you could comment on the trend, you mentioned something in your press release July/August, do you see pace of decline easing further for these couple of months and what is the outlook in terms of backlog for the very important Christmas season we have in front of us? And the very last question for you is on the margins development that we will have in the second half, I think you mentioned for production, we should replicate this kind of performance in the second half. Is there something to expect in terms of rebound? And definitely in the watch-end business &#x2013; division margins, how do these margins will trend in the second half? That will be very helpful for us. Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mr. Montagnani. First of all, I don't know where you have the number from the plus five to 6% in the second half. Let me explain. What we see certainly is that we still focus on is to close the year at nearby the 2008 result as possible.</p>
          <p>What I said in some interviews is that if we come in, in the region of five, six, 7% below 2008, then it's still a success, but we aim for more, especially since November, December of 2008 were not the strongest months.</p>
          <p>Of course, this means that the second half of the year, we will have and we will aim to have a growth depending on exchange rates, of course, we'll see what's happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now why do I think, or not only me, but the whole management and the board of directors that this will happen. If we look months-by-months after the January, February that was marked by panic, especially from chains and retailers, they didn't wanted to buy anymore. They were scared, either they had no money or they got no money or there were some financials guys that told them stop, you have enough stock, you don't buy anything. We saw really month-by-month, an improvement.</p>
          <p>Now in July, we have seen so far a very good month. Several of our brands have either better results than 2008 and some are very close to the 2008 results. And if you think that last year in 2008, July was a very strong month also with Olympic Games for Omega.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then you see how healthy it is. I give you a number for Omega. In July, we have 42 like-by-like stores for Omega. We have opened, of course, more stores, but I give you like-by-like, because it doesn't help you to give you sell-out numbers if it is not like-by-like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's comparable. The month of July, Omega did plus 22% in Swiss francs, sell-out, more than in 2008 in July. and the July 2008 was an Olympic year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think that's interesting. Then the Tourbillon stores, again a like-to-like comparison and in Tourbillon stores, we have about 16, 17 stores. We have Breguet, Blancpain, Glash&#xFC;tte, Jaquet Droz, L&#xE9;on Hatot and Omega and a bit of Swatch. We have seen in the month of July a result that was a result very close to the 2008 July number, and this means it's the high-end and it's again like-to-like.</p>
          <p>So this gives an indication. Then I add the sell-out numbers I have from Xin Yu, it's the Chinese retailer. The stock situation, I know the numbers not only from our brands, but from the third parties, since we are shareholders and in the Board of Directors, but I'm not allowed to tell you anything about that. And about the Middle East, Rivoli, where we are also shareholders and everything shows in the same direction. Stocks are going down, sell-out is up. And this lets us, of course, to a very clear forecast to say the second half of the year, there's no reason that we should see &#x2013; let's say again falling back into what happened in January, February. It will be an improvement in the second half of the year, and it will all depend on November, December. If what we think the performance can be strong then we will achieve our objective to be as close as possible to 2008 internal.</p>
          <p>So we have substantial facts and information from the markets to make us more than believe that this can happen. August is trending at the same level, the consumer is buying. Now when you talk about regions. The Unites States and Japan are certainly the most difficult ones, all together with Spain. However, we see also there an improvement of the situation. Especially, since we have opened some stores in the United States that give us a little bit more indication about the consumer behavior. And also here, we see that we should not be again on the levels of minus 50% that the Swiss watch industry was talking about for the United States, when we are talking of our brands. I cannot talk for other brands of other groups.</p>
          <p>Now also here we see an improvement, we see more confidence. However, we still have the situation that unfortunately many retail chains are so badly managed over there that they run out of cash in a very short period of time. They do Chapter 11. And you know, we have a very clear strict behavior in this company. We are not selling any products to somebody who could be in danger to go into Chapter 11. We are very strict. We do not deliver. Even if we say, okay, we made sales that way, but we have not extended payment terms, we have not given more sales reductions. That's everything clear in this company.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, there are some signs of improvements also in the United States, not dramatical, but improvements. And the rest of the world, as I said, except Japan and &#x2013; which also is performing better, and Spain, the rest of the world is fine. The Middle East is trending for the very high-end, a bit lower than the year before. Yes, Breguet, Blancpain and Glash&#xFC;tte are certainly suffering there a little bit more.</p>
          <p>Then you have Europe has a strong performance, all countries. Russia, very strong; Great Britain is very strong. Australia, the whole Asian part is performing. Korea, but later on, Arlette can say something about Korea and Japan. But we see that the world, the consumer is not behaving &#x2013; and this is a good thing like retailers. They continue to buy and they have the money. And the retailer always wants to say, he has no money, he doesn't want to buy. But also this has changed a little bit.</p>
          <p>So this is for the outlook. And remember, when we did this kind of discussion in January, February many of you were very skeptical, and said, they will go into one of the deepest recession for the watch industry. And now we see that, okay, there is a slowdown, 15% or roughly 15% less turnover is nothing that pleases us. We don't like it, but it's something that we can handle as you see we don't run into trouble on the profit level, little bit less profit but that's survivable more than survivable.</p>
          <p>And when you look at the margins, overall you have seen we have declared that more than once. We have not done on the personnel level. What we could have done, I mean, we could have sent hundreds of people away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To improve our bottom line, our operating and we said no, we don't do it because we believe that there will be a recovery soon. And these people will be motivated, will push and it will be good for our brands. Perhaps for the ones that are not Swiss, Swatch Group has been elected from the Swiss people as being the company with the biggest and best reputation in Switzerland, followed by Lindt &amp; Spr&#xFC;ngli, Mr. Tanner is also in the Board of Swatch Group.</p>
          <p>So we have taken a Swatch Group benefit probably. So this is certainly giving us a benefit also for the future and we will continue with this. However, we have acted very strongly on all the other costs in the company. But we have continued to invest heavily in marketing, in research and development and in store development. So the company continues in this strategy. We have just said we have a soft approach to our own people, to the personnel. We will not sacrifice then just for the pure sake of increasing the percentage of the operating income. And you see we are around 14, 15% for the first half, and in July operating went already towards 15, 16, 17.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see it's an improvement also without having done any measures and there's no stop in hiring personnel in Swatch Group. I still sign hiring, I have to sign it, it comes all to the CEO, wherever it happens in the world, in the branch, but I still have everyday the people that are hired either in production, hired in the brands and still we are capable in delivering these kinds of margins. Do you want to say something Mr. Geiser or Mr. Kenel, the margins on the production side?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe for the cost reduction, we didn't have any cost reduction in personnel, but we did have cost cuts in material, food purchase and sub-contracting, as well as traveling and others between 20 and 30%. So you see that we did a lot of efforts there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we say cost reduction in traveling, it's not that we let the people not travel, we have agreements with the airlines and we negotiated, of course, agreements to travel for less cost. So it's not that we have cut traveling, on the contrary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Jon Cox from Kepler Equities. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gents. I have a couple of questions for you. You're talking about how you would like your sales in H2 to potentially match the sales in H2 last year. I wonder if you could just be a bit more specific on the operating profit side.</p>
          <p>Am I right in thinking you are assuming that your operating profit in H2 will also match last year's H2? If that's the case, I guess you're assuming a pretty dramatic recovery in the Production division and the Electronics division or do you think an improved margin in the watches can offset ongoing weakness in the Production and Electronics? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is just on the cancellation fees you are charging maybe some of the other watchmakers or brands. I'm just wondering where you'd actually book those fees, are you taking from, maybe, some of the other luxury groups?</p>
          <p>Would that come in to your Production division itself or is it &#x2013; would it be booked somewhere else and I'm wondering could you give us an idea of how much that was in the first half of the year?</p>
          <p>And then just my last question is really on &#x2013; I wonder if you can just remind us so geographically your sales split for finished watches? I seem to remember that I think China, mainland China is your biggest market with about 10% of your finished watch sales, maybe followed by the U.S. I wonder if you can just run us through because I think one of the strategic advantages you guys have probably over some others due to your exposure to China and that region? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mr. Cox, of course the same level of profit &#x2013; operating profit in the second half of the year than last year, I don't think that we will be able to achieve it. What I said is, on the turnover basis I think we can come close on the watches side. On the Electronics side, it will be more difficult, but I will let Mr. Darwish say something about it. When I have finished this question, Mr. Darwish, you take over. What I say is just that, we are moving upwards 16, 17% and it might be that we go in this level, that we could maintain 16, 17 or 18%. It goes certainly upwards, this I'm sure. We will not see a less good profitability in the second half than in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>But if we achieve more than 2008, honestly I don't think so. But if we make it better than 2009 in percentage, I think we have already &#x2013; in the first half 2009, I think, we are &#x2013; we have the chances to do it. And we're confident. So July was usually not such a fantastic month. I told you our profitability hovered around between 16, 17%, already, with some brands of course not at the level of 2008. We have all hopes that this goes in this direction. Now for your cancellation fee, that's a tricky thing. You know that we are heavily forced, if you want so, by the Swiss Authorities, the Cartel Commission, et cetera, to practically accept everybody's orders.</p>
          <p>And if there are cancellations, unfortunately they are not coming to us and say now you can charge them whatever you want and all your investments. So the cancellation fee is a very small fee. And we are calculating this certainly on the amount of product, on the mix et cetera what's happening. Some of the third parties have also asked us to push it back, the deliveries, to 2010, 2011, 2012. So it's we don't have a formula for that. We have to see this a little bit more specific because the mix and the demands are different from company-to-company. So there's not much that we can book somewhere at the moment. So it's peanuts, if you want some. Mr. Darwish, perhaps you can elaborate before I cover the last part of the question on the Electronic Systems, where we'll be in terms of profitability and turnover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For the Electronic Systems, I definitely expect a clear improvement of the profitability globally and within the electronic system companies, the one making the components, will certainly show much better profitability, they are already showing this. The system companies have more difficulty but as the revenue of the components company is much larger, this is what will prevail. So I expect the profitability during the second half to come closer to last year results than to this first half-year results.</p>
          <p>Now this is, of course, the combination of things but we could have had even better results if we were not limited now in our possibility to deliver by the supply chain. As you know when the crisis started, several companies reduced heavily their work force and the possibilities in a dramatic way to try to adapt themselves in short-term to the situation.</p>
          <p>Now that the situation is improving and that the demand is back on the markets, those companies are not in the possibility of delivering. For example, Micro Crystal is still expecting ceramics to put its crystal in packages. EM Microelectronic has a very similar situation; to deliver to our customers we need some packages from the Far East and they don't have the material, which has to be produced by some of their own suppliers. So this is what presently is limiting the growth, which is already existing now compared to the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You remember perhaps in our meeting the ones that have been in Geneva, we explained that there has been a reaction that was too exaggerated throughout the supply chain for the Electronic system &#x2013; for many of the electronic system companies and that we foresee that this will be coming back again to let's say rather 10, 15, 20% less demand.</p>
          <p>And at the beginning of the year everybody panicked in this area and they cancelled orders for 80, 90%. And now we pay the price and I think many industries are paying it. They released the workforce. They have to rehire now at additional cost. They have to bring again know-how and everything is delayed, so our company Micro Crystal they could deliver much more. But they are waiting for components to deliver to the consumer, and this is to telecom industry mainly, and that's what we have forecasted. So you see, as Mr. Darwish says, we will see an improved situation, but it will not be back again to the fantastic times already in the second half of 2009, what we had in 2007 or beginning 2008.</p>
          <p>But also here encouraging signs. Then in the production, quickly, this I want to add. Of course, now in the second half I cannot say what the third parties are doing. I think they will also have an improved situation going into the second half, but some of them &#x2013; they have really cancelled a lot of products and we will see now what they do. So we'll see how this affects us in production, but will not change our approach. We'll continue to maintain our workforce and our know-how. So that's why we aim for a better margin and we will certainly have it. So let's see. We can perhaps expect a nice surprise at the end of the year like these half-year results.</p>
          <p>Now if we come to the region, it depends on the brands, you see, it's not the company itself. We have a lucky situation. We are present in all segments, that's a big advantage and it depends a bit of the brands. Some brands are stronger at the number one countries, China and Hong Kong, and other brands, the European countries are number one. And that's a good mix, because we don't want to be &#x2013; that we don't want to have one country that's number one for all brands. We prefer to have a diversity also, not just in segments but also in regions.</p>
          <p>Now if we take Swatch, for example, Arlette, you can say, what is the division more or less from Swatch between the countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Swatch is very strong in Europe. It's over 50% is present in Europe. And the second part, which is very important for Swatch is, of course, China. You know that next year we will have the Fair, the exhibition, the worldwide exhibition, Swatch will participate. We'll also open in China next year the Peace hotel, the Swatch Peace Hotel, which will be a very important PR instrument for Swatch. So we will develop and put in many efforts on China. This is a second very important part. And third, I will say it's Middle East and then is more the Anglo-Saxon countries.</p>
          <p>And for cK, perhaps, just it's practically the same. And which is also very interesting for cK that after 12 years, the Swiss-made in the fashion segment has been very important and so that we have been able to take over many market shares during that period for some brands. And we have done very good result being practically on the same level than last year. And also for cK is, Europe strong followed also exactly the same than Swatch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's still a potential for example in China.</p>

          <p>Now, if we take brands like Tissot. Tissot is very much European also with always a stronger success in China. And in the U.S, they have done a good job, but at the moment it's difficult. They are harmed by these Chapter 11 issues over there. Then you come to Longines. Longines is more Asian-oriented, very strong in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East, India. Omega is very strong in Europe. Omega has gained market share everywhere in the world.</p>
          <p>In China, they are strong. Olympic Games have done a hell of a good over there. And we are launching a new constellation on the 27th of August in China. That's apart by the way of the stocks that we kept during the first half of the year of Omega, because we didn't want it to launch in the first half, because of the situation we were waiting. And now the signals are very good, so we are launching and you will see a decrease in stock, a substantial decrease in stock in the second half of the year, not just for Omega only but for the others.</p>
          <p>Then you have the luxury brands, and here also it's a split picture. You have Breguet very strong in Eastern countries, in the Middle East, in Europe and Hong Kong, of course, and coming very strong in China, but not having been so strong in China as Blancpain, for example. Blancpain is very strong in China, as Eastern Europe, Middle East. And you see it's difficult &#x2013; the group cannot say we have only one strategy. It's a little bit split in between the brands and the markets and that's a very good situation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I wonder if I can just have one follow-up question, just to really come back to the profitability. I see consensus operating profit for this year is around CHF800 million. You've, obviously, beaten what people were thinking about H1, do you think you can beat this 800 million or would you rather &#x2013; the analysts maybe kept...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do everything &#x2013; we do everything. If we see now what is happening with our share. We do everything to convince you that you should only calculate with 600 million. And then we come up with 800.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, listen, you have seen the performance of the group now, it is depending &#x2013; the signals from the markets are good, but you know The Swatch Group. We will continue to invest. We will not make everything to achieve the 800. We'll do it if it is good long-term for the company, but if not we will not try to find ways artificially to do it. If the market is ready for it and I think it is, we will be certainly the first and the best to be able to achieve that and to bring the results. Okay. Next please.</p>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>The next question is from Erwan Rambourg from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Erwan Rambourg from HSBC in London. Three quick questions if I can. You indicate that you're expecting H2 to be flat to up, and I was just wondering what you thought about contributions from volume mix and price. I think historically the growth in the watches has been more mix and price driven, how do you see growth in the future from today onwards?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the components cancellation, because if you look at the production sales, it's perfectly flat for third parties and obviously you are gaining a lot of share from competitors. And so if you look at the F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration Horlog&#xE8;re figures at some stage the sales of components to third parties should come down theoretically, do you see this happening this year or is it more going to be postponed to next year?</p>
          <p>And then finally maybe if you can comment on your vision on the Tiffany venture, I think at the beginning you have mentioned a potential for 580 to CHF800 million in five to six years, what's your view now on Tiffany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's try to respond to all your questions. So first for the second half of the year. We will certainly aim for growth in the brands of the, I would say, the high end down to the last products, means from Swatch up to Omega. Now what's a very, very top prestige is concerned if we can achieve results close to 2008 in the second half, I think it will be good. So the growth is certainly coming if you compare to 2008 more from the rest of the segments then from the really, really, really very high-end prestige because their performance was very strong.</p>
          <p>But again, November, December is the big question mark because if there is a rush and people want to again to spend money like hell and if they look now at all the bonuses that you get in the banks again I'm sure that in November, December probably we will exceed the results by far with Breguet and Blancpain and Glash&#xFC;tte.</p>
          <p>But what we are seeing now is clear that from Omega downwards we will probably have a growth pattern more than in the very high end. But again the very high end is performing very well and will be very close, we are considering.</p>
          <p>Now F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration Horlog&#xE8;re, be careful export numbers will not &#x2013; you cannot equal export numbers with sales numbers because exportation of products into a country doesn't mean that they are sold yet. There might be stock somewhere in the country and this is sold but nothing is exported anymore but it's clear that some groups or somebody is suffering here. July has shown it to us because we had very good July and also good June and the F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration Horlog&#xE8;re were totally different numbers than what we have experienced. So there is somebody still suffering.</p>
          <p>What was your question on the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question on components was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Yes, we will already feel it in the second part, definitely. In the second part, we had at Universo, at Comadur, at all these companies that do over 50% business. There, we feel a problem and we have announced that we are forced now to do some short work &#x2013; not the whole work force for three companies, its Meco, Universo; Meco is doing crowns for over 50% third parties. Then there is Universo is doing hands, also over 50% to third parties. Then we have a little company, Mr. Geiser was just telling me this, Valdar is practically doing 90% for third parties. So they are hit, but that's a small company with about 20 people.</p>
          <p>So here we will have to introduce probably in September some short work. But we feel already some orders are coming back. Some people are giving signals that they would now suggest or think to place orders a little bit earlier again. But you will see an impact in the production in the second half, definitely. But I think we will need this kind of capacity for our brands because if we continue like this, and we'll continue to take market share despite the fact that we have to decrease the stocks that we still have in the company.</p>
          <p>And Tiffany, yes, we are launching now September/October/November/December will be the selling and I took Bvlgari and Caski a little bit as an example. I said if Bvlgari is capable of doing once around CHF300 million turnover with watches; then Tiffany was the name Tiffany with our help, then we should be capable of matching and exceeding these numbers. So something between 300, 400 and 600, 700 million is possible.</p>
          <p>However, this is also depending on the performance of a company that's based in New York and the name is Tiffany. And if you compared the dynamism of Swatch Group and the dynamism of Tiffany, I don't know if you feel the same speed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. I understood. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we would be happy if they could be inspired to be a little bit more aggressive because if look at the regions apart from the U.S., where Tiffany is, I am not talking Tiffany Watches, I am talking about Tiffany, it would be, of course, extremely helpful for us if its management would feel that the world could be changed in attacking the markets a little bit more aggressive. Let me say it politely. And we do everything from our side on the watches. Third-party distribution will be fine and good. But Tiffany and the Tiffany Stores, you know if you have a history of 100 years it's sometimes &#x2013; you have to do the same things that you have done 100 years and that's sometimes not so helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a quick follow-up, you mentioned in the release, retailer de-stocking is about to slow down. When you say about to slow down, is it a question of &#x2013; are you seeing it now or is it a question of weeks or is it before the holiday season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's on course. We see many countries, where the retailer is now ordering because it's not only de-stocking, he sees he gains confidence, he sees the results and he has to make business, he has to eat. So for some retailers, I'd say take the U.S. away and Japan, but the rest of the world, the people are buying. I mean they feel what brands are investing money. They feel who is doing investment in advertising, who is placing new stores around. So this is something we see week-by-week. It's a fact. The orders from third-parties, from retailers &#x2013; we say third-parties to them. The retailers or the agents in the countries they have improved and they improve month-by-month.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I never expect or hope that this happens. I hope that there are some entrepreneurs taking some retailers in the United States in hand and make them do a long-term strategy and not just selling watches as a commodity and doing it in an opportunistic short-term way. We need &#x2013; in this big country there needs to be something happening in distribution. And there might be a big opportunity now.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Yes, we can hear you. We hear you loud and clear.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Okay. First question on cost, sorry to ask you again but if you could just be a little bit more specific. I understand quite well where you've been in the first half. I'm just wondering, what the plans are for the second half and then I don't know if it's too soon to talk about 2010 but these numbers that you're talking about the 20 to 30% reduction in subcontract &#x2013; subcontracting travel, material purchases and then the move to short work on the three businesses in production division. Could you elaborate on whether there are any further big efforts that you're making and how the 20 to 30% reduction in subcontracting, travel material purchases compares to second half?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is could you discuss sell-through trends in China, mainland versus Hong Kong by key brand?</p>
          <p>And then finally in production, I'm just wondering if you could talk about when &#x2013; what your outlook is for the third-party demand and whether or not you see need for further cuts to your production rates today? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's try to address these issues. First China and Hong Kong. Okay. In Hong Kong, the situation is a bit different than in China. Hong Kong has picked up by the way. Lately again, July and August shows good numbers and here the retailers were suffering because they had too much stock from many brands. And I must really say not from us because we didn't make any sell-in, we didn't made any push. So now it starts again to be in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Then there was also an impact on this swine flu that the Chinese were traveling less to Hong Kong and this has disappeared. So they have also seen that the swine flu is not really a big issue. And the travels are there, so Hong Kong is performing in July and August much better than before.</p>
          <p>Now in China, the sell-out numbers for the most important brands from us are up in the</p>
          <p>single digit, high single digit to high &#x2013; to double digit. I will not say more but certainly from the information I have from the biggest retailer we're certainly by far the best. So it's a positive sell-out you have in this country.</p>
          <p>But it's not the only one. Well, of course it is sell-out in Switzerland, in Germany, in Russia, in United Kingdom, even over 30% plus in the United Kingdom. So you have many areas in the world where the sell-out is very good and people are buying crazy. So that's the situation. Australia by the way, I forgot, Australia also is selling tremendously good.</p>
          <p>Now for the cost, you see the Swatch Group has never changed the approach to cost. We have always done the same thing. We try to get the best conditions, to improve cost, it's a constant effort that the Swatch Group is doing if there is a crisis or not a crisis.</p>
          <p>We have no private planes, will not have and have never even in boom times. We have a very humble approach to cost and the money of the shareholders. We are really taking care of it. But we're taking care also of our employees and our people and we say that's the best invested money to keep them, and not just to get rid of them to have a little bit a better margin.</p>
          <p>So on the cost side, it's a constant work on every single thing. We have always negotiated and tried to cut cost everywhere. And this will continue. So there is not a specific effort that we created. We have not created a task force to get this cost down.</p>
          <p>The task force is always there, and you see we have now two Chief Financial Officers, only for &#x2013; you will immediately say, my God. Mr. Hayek, you have a lot of cost, you have two now...</p>
          <p>But just to clear. Mr. Geiser is now slowing phasing out. We are doing the transition probably during September and since the first half 2009 was still his responsibility, he is here. He will take over the Presidency of the Pension Fund of the Swatch Group.</p>
          <p>And Mr. Kenel will take over now in the next week. We will inform you about that when the official date of the transition is.</p>
          <p>So this is our task force, all our controllers, finance, everybody here in the company is working on it, so I cannot point out a specific cost. But I think you see an industrial group like ours that had in good times 21, 22% margin, I don't see many industrial companies that are capable of delivering it. And with the Swiss franc, now let's not forget that we are sometimes penalized.</p>
          <p>And then in difficult times, like today, when we have declared we will maintain our people in our factories, we still deliver a double-digit margin, so you can be confident that on the cost side in second half 2009 and also 2010, we can probably explode; we can probably in 2010 make a pretty good result because if the demand continues like this and 2010 will be a boom year again, with the cost basis we have then and with our people that we kept, let's not forget we don't have to rehire and train them again. It could be a pretty nice result that is coming out of it. Was there a third question, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was just about production, but it was about third-party demand. Just whether or not you think it can positive &#x2013; the sales to third parties can be positive in 2010, I've got..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think so, I think so, because the Swiss watch industry, the watch market is not in a structural crisis, you see. We have all the products, the whole Swiss watch industry is innovative. They have good brands and good products. And, of course, some brands took advantage opportunistically of the boom, so you put a lot of gold and diamonds and then you can sell everything. But the main players in the Swiss watch industry have good product, good distribution, an innovative approach to the market, and the consumers want our brand. Made in Switzerland is very cool and very in, and as long as we continue to innovate and to invest money, the whole industry will grow, and this will happen.</p>
          <p>So we are not in a crisis because there is &#x2013; we missed the product or we missed technology. It's not like in the 70s when the Swiss watch industry missed the quartz technology. We have everything and we are at the top of the innovation. We have a lot of things in the pipeline, all in common. I'm talking also for our colleagues from the other groups and from the other brands, from the main partners.</p>
          <p>Of course, there are some brands that have never been really strongly anchored in the watch business. And the consumer is not stupid. He discovers who is really doing a product with innovation or who is only doing products with gold and diamonds. And these ones they will continue to suffer throughout 2010, but all the others they will do quite well again in 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the note of innovation, do you mind just reminding us of the percentage of sales that Constellation accounts for as a percentage of Omega, and what the average changing prices of the new line and when you start shipping that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know it but I will not tell you. But Constellation is a very successful line from Omega. And to see that we were waiting for the right moment and now the right moment is there shows how important it is. It's an important part of Constellation, but as important as Seamaster, Speedmaster, and De Ville lines that Omega has. It's a constant innovation. So it will give an additional push to a brand that is already performing very well.</p>

          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Z&#xFC;rcher Kantonalbank. Good afternoon, everybody. I have several questions. First regarding again the watch division, you had sales of minus 16.4%, could you give us again some flavor about the sales development in the main region, meaning what was sales development overall in Europe, in U.S., in Japan, China and other Asia and Middle East?</p>
          <p>Second regarding the Electronic System division, you have sold your last year Sokymat and Michel, what was the sales impact here in H1? Did I get this right that this was probably four to 6 million? Is this number correct, and is there any further impact in H2 or is that it's just in H1?</p>
          <p>And in the Electronic Systems division, you were mentioning, Mr. Darwish, that you were expecting an improvement in profit in H2, does it also mean that you see some sales increase here in the Electronic Systems division?</p>
          <p>And number three in the movement division, I have seen that you had a sales decrease within the group of 18.6%, but with third-parties just minus 1.2%, what was there behind this? Was this really an order backlog or yes what was behind here and what are your expectations here for the second half?</p>
          <p>And regarding the overall inventory level, you had, at the end of June, 2.9 billion, could you comment on this one and what are your expectations are here for the end of the year? And maybe for Mr. D&#xFC;rr, what was the net cash position at the end of June and the asset allocation of this and the CapEx for the current year and maybe also some indication for the next year. And last question regarding...</p>

You see on the balance sheet that you have cash on 585 million, but if now you take the financial assets in &#x2013; for explaining that cash, current accounts and liquid assets, as well as short-term deposits and financial investments, you have over 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Okay. Now, the non-current borrowings and current borrowings, as well as derivative liabilities, you have 524 million that leaves the net financial position of 595, 96 million. Okay. This is the net financial position. But now of course you have to take, and you have been speaking about the inventory level, as well as receivables and so on, the net current values, I'm not talking about financial positions, but values is about 5 billion.</p>

          <p>And in terms of the tax, Mr. Geiser, you want to say something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He will talk about inventory levels and tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the tax side, let me start with the tax situation in which we arrived. We have a rather modest tax rate for the first half of this year, impacted by the change in the applicable tax rate on temporary differences, which we have increased to the expected tax rate for the full year, which has a positive impact on the deferred taxes by about 2.2 percentage points.</p>
          <p>And in the first half of the year, we were normally cashing on the holding level the dividend from the various subsidiaries, which has also a positive impact on the tax rate in the first half. That will smoothen out in the second half, which leads us to believe that we most probably will be somewhere in the 20 to 21% on a full year basis.</p>
          <p>On the inventory, it is right, we have a close eye on inventories. They have increased once again. But, Mr. Hayek just mentioned there is a full load of firing power now on inventories. If I just give you an indication on the Omega Constellation, which is an amount approaching CHF200 million ready to be launched into the market over the sum of which billing components need to be assembled and so forth in order to be able to ship on a regular basis as per the plan in the logistics.</p>
          <p>Also for the Tiffany launch, there needs to be some build-up, and this makes us believe that we can reduce the inventory level towards the end of the year. Obviously, dependent then again on how we see 2010 and whether we have some new ideas in which we will invest in new products. But basically the trend shift would be going downward.</p>
          <p>And obviously there is one element, which we should never forget. With our expansion of the retail stores, we would also equip those retail stores with a full assortment of all products in order to be able to disclose what the brand is all about not just with a few selected products, but with the full range of products and then can easily go up to CHF2 million per store.</p>
          <p>On an inventory level in some of the stores, we think of Breguet major stores that goes up to even more, I hate to say the number because I don't want to get verbally this night in one of those expensive stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know we have some stores with the same demand. For some brands, they do a turnover in one single store of over CHF20 million and you can imagine what kind of watches you need there in this stock. And we have said we continue to invest into stores and the big amount of stock of goods that we have done is also because we have opened about 20 stores, if I remember between 15 and 20. And we will probably open in the second half of the year and other of between 15 and 30 stores, but part of it will be franchise stores and not all will be owned stores in between the different brands, probably, even more if I take Swatch into account.</p>
          <p>And this is all adding of course stock and we had a debate here between &#x2013; when we had a discussion, in finance and here, exactly because of that. And we said, hey, look the stock increase is also coming or mainly coming from the stores because we opened the Fifth Avenue store from Omega, where we are planning and we are on a good track to have around $20 million in one single store.</p>
          <p>You need a heavy stock in there. You cannot have a consumer who comes in and says I want that product and then you say, I'm sorry we don't have it. We do the same thing than any other retailers. We buy not enough stock, this we cannot have. That's something you have to take into consideration. So we are confident, and July has already shown a diminishing stock, if I remember well, and we will go on like that.</p>
          <p>Now for the movement, yes, these are quartz movements that have decreased dramatically. And one thing is that we decided, when Arlette came in also, we want to get rid of stock. We have still stock at Swatch, and we have a good sell-out at Swatch at the Swatch stores. We opened many stores and we said, okay, we want to get rid of the stock and we decreased the orders and it's coming all out of quartz and of Swatch. This whole difference that you have third-parties and our own production in movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now for July, August, it's a contrary to have now heavily orders, again, their products. So you will see this in the second half how this will increase again on the quartz side, because Swatch is doing a good performance. Arlette?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And why was the third-party so good, because the third-parties was just minus 1.2%...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it's a delay. If you call us in January, February, March, that you want to cancel, you cancel products that are foreseen to be delivered in 2009 and '10 and '11. So this takes a certain time until it is implemented because we are not just accepting it like this. We want first to know because we have plans, we have our capacities. So you will see a big difference in the second part of the year. But it is just a delay and then there are some companies, I must say it also.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; you see with &#xE9;bauche, we are forced to deliver because we have the Cartel Commission, who told us until 2010, we have to deliver &#xE9;bauche quantities, and we have to deliver them. Even if these people don't want them, you know, that's the situation sometimes.</p>
          <p>So here you see a delay, so our production will be impacted by the circumstance. That's why we did also short work in Universo, Meco, Comadur. We are working over 50% for third parties, we will start in September to do the short work. You understand because there is a delay when all those are happening in the pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But these would mean that in the movement division in H2 probably we'll see even a lower profitability or what's your guess there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know because Swatch is coming up. They are again moving upwards, it can be, it could be. Perhaps we have to increase prices again. By the way, we have heard nothing from the Cartel Commission. You remember that they wanted to investigate when we said...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...we increase prices. Until today, we have &#x2013; okay, don't say something about it, otherwise they come in &#x2013; no, we &#x2013; it can be, but let see the second half of the year, it can be that the profitability here of course, is a little bit lower, can be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the regions, Mr. Schwendimann, I said it before, I cannot be very helpful in this, because it's a split picture, as I said before some brands are more European, some brands are more Asian, some are more Middle East and Russian. What I can tell you is that Europe has behaved very well and Asia also, except Japan, but Japan we know since many, many years, but we see an improvement, Arlette?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think it's starting again, we feel that it's coming slowly, but surely up, because I have the feeling that Japanese people. They are &#x2013; it is still a rich country, Japan, and I think they have stopped chewing up time to buy, but they will come back and they have started to come back.</p>
          <p>We see the first signals of recovering. For Korea, it is exactly the opposite, it's really booming in Korea, and we are doing very well and also it's a fantastic growth. I think it's a &#x2013; I can say I think the most important growth of the world is in Korea in term of percentage and it's really interesting what is happening there. And, yes, that's what I can say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, the Americas of course are the most hit, that's clear. But unfortunately, Canada is not big enough, but Canada did about 10% plus in local currencies in the first six months. But unfortunately Canada is very small. But the U.S., also Mexico has been hit. You see that's what we can say, it's &#x2013; the only clear picture for all brands that have a little bit more difficulties is the United States, is Spain, is Japan. The rest is a mixed picture. When the brand is strong, it has a good distribution network in the rest of the world. It's performing very well. Okay. Next question.</p>

          <p>Yes, of course, the sales will also increase. As we're saying before, it could &#x2013; not only it can increase, it has already started to increase. But it could even increase more if we wouldn't have this problem of the supply chain where some components which are used with our components or some material, which we need to produce our components. For the moment, Bienne is under shortage because several suppliers have been so much reducing their capability and their work force that they are not able to come on speed in time. And this is the case for Micro Crystal and the EM Microelectronic.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. John Guy from MF Global Securities. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a few questions if I may please. First of all, with regards to the pricing policy, given we've seen raw material prices for example gold increased 35% over the last year. Can you give us some indication as to where you feel pricing can go without putting too much pressure on the consumer, that's the first point?</p>
          <p>The second question with regards to market share movements, if we take Omega for example, it seems that obviously the Beijing Games was a very, very good launch pad for you, and Omega has taken significant share relative to Rolex in particular, could you maybe give us a little bit more clarity as to how those market shares have moved over the last six to 12 months? And with regards to you introducing some more complicated movements in some of your lower end watches over the course of the next six to 12 months, are you concerned around any rates of cannibalization that there might exist?</p>
          <p>And finally I noticed with regards to the buyback, obviously no shares bought back, just the convertible bonds, is that going to change do you think over the next six months? Obviously, the share price may be pretty big today, but would you consider buying back your own shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mr. Guy. Let me start with the pricing policy. Yes, we are very defensive in adapting prices because we know that raw materials, exchange rates, taxes sometimes, &#x2013; taxes unfortunately are not changing too often. But exchange rates are fluctuating. Raw material prices, sometimes they're skyrocket high, they go down again. We are very careful. We don't want to increase prices and then decrease prices again.</p>
          <p>So the Swatch Group has always taken the cautious approach to access perhaps a little bit less profit, but gain market share and then regain the whole through volume because we have a gain in the production afterwards. Gold is higher. Yes, this is true. However, on the other side, we have managed to have good deals and good discussions on steel. Steel has come down on the other side. And you see that there is a tendency that Piccolo watches means steel gold and pure steel, a very much in demand. Gold has been suffering a little bit more because America was a very strong gold market for watches.</p>
          <p>So, there are means to balance this without just running and increase prices, that's what we try to do, and we have some new technologies to apply gold. In some brands, we are working on a new technology that I will not tell you how it works where we can apply real gold with &#x2013; it's much more efficient, and you don't need this kind of layer or you don't have these losses in gold when you have it, when you work usually with it. So that's things that we are doing. So we will not tell you the detail. That's our research and development that is working on that and they are worked to industrialize it.</p>
          <p>So, yes, pricing, careful, Swatch Group in the second half of the year, you will not see a lot of adaptations of prices, exception are new products. When you launch a new product, of course, with a new movement and with something change, then you can put your pricing at a different level. And we will have in the second part, new launches of product in many brands. And, of course, they'll take the approach to have a little bit higher prices there, because it's justified. It's a new movement. It's a new design. It's a &#x2013; so this will be possible, and this will happen in the second half of the year, but we're cautious, we will not exaggerate. We go for market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on that point, with regards to the new launches and as a percentage, how big would the new launches be over the total ranges, so is it just sort of five, 10% of total products being effectively new launches?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would &#x2013; I'm not able to tell you this. It's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see a new &#x2013; a launch of a new product line is creating a lot of public relation, a lot of communication. So usually it's not just a new product that's bought, it's a lot of other products that are bought also. So a new launch doesn't mean that you're just selling only that product. Of course, you do a sell-in, but you're always looking to the sell out. You have more people coming to the store. They see the new product and they say, "oh, that's wonderful, I'll buy this", but I might also buy another one.</p>
          <p>So new launches of high quality products that are well within a range is never &#x2013; if it is well done, it's never cannibalizing, it's always increasing sales also of the rest of the collection. And that's why I'm not able to tell you. It will give a boost to the brand. If it is a substantial new launch, it will always be a boost for the brand in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you talk about Rolex and Omega, I can only talk about Omega. Rolex are good friends, and all I can say is you've all seen performance of Omega the last year, the ones that are with us, new movements, high quality movements, distribution approach, events, it goes even so far that the Kennedy Foundation accepted to have Mr. Kennedy as a testimonial for Omega, which they never allowed because they considered Omega as a very serious and leader brand. So Omega has taken market share everywhere because of the consistency, good products, the good communication that they have. And they have a good pricing because the consumer is not stupid. He doesn't want to pay three times more, if he can have the same or the better quality with a brand.</p>
          <p>Now Rolex has changed the management for whatever reason. That's the only thing I can comment. I have some numbers, but I cannot tell them because Rolex is a client of us, in one side with Netherhouse we deliver them a lot of our products, they are very good clients of ours, and we have a very good relationship. And in China, we have the numbers of the biggest retailers. All I know is that we have all an interest that Rolex is innovating, is continuing because Rolex is a positive element of the Swiss watch industry. And I'm very confident with the new boss there that they will certainly improve the situation. But it's a fact. The U.S. is the strongest market for Rolex and since the United States is really suffering terribly, it's probably difficult.</p>
          <p>But I will not elaborate about Rolex, Omega is doing an outstanding performance, very consistent and they continue like this. And I suppose that they take market share from whoever.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About complications, are you talking about the new mechanical movement for Tissot and Swatch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Absolutely, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's the contrary. It's not complication. It's a very innovative chrono movement. The people do not buy movements, they buy a brand, which brings an innovation. And Tissot by the way is not just mechanical chrono movement, that's innovative with plastic parts in it. It's also the touch screen technology. Longines &#x2013; Tissot had launched Sea-Touch. It's a touch screen for underwater 200 meters, and Tissot is still the leader in touch screen, nobody is following. And that's good. Don't tell it too much in your report. Tissot is doing x-rays. And I think Swatch will soon follow with touchscreen. But there is no cannibalization at all. If you buy a product for 300, 400, 500, CHF600, Swatch has a totally different message, design philosophy, distribution strategy, then Tissot and anyway somebody who is buying an Omega or Longines or a Breguet, he will not be decided do I buy a Swatch or a Breguet. He buys a Breguet and some Swatches probably. Arlette, what do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so and we will launch the new movement of the new automatic watch in about two months. And it's a simplification of the movement, the new movement. It's not a complication, it's simplification. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you see the &#x2013; when there was 1994, we launched an automatic movement in Swatch, Time to Move. Could have been the slogan for today, Time to Move for everybody. And we introduced a mechanical automatic movement into a Swatch. Now what has happened? This has not only made a big success with Swatch, this has created a boost for all mechanical watches that were by the time in the marketplace, also the very high-end. So every brand that brings an innovation, that brings a stimulation, the whole Swiss watch industry is profiting about it, because that's appealing, that's new, brings more watches on the wrists of the people. So there's no cannibalization. However, if we would have decided that this movement goes now into a Breguet watch and we sell a Breguet watch for CHF500, this would have cannibalized Breguet. But that's not seriously what we want to do.</p>

          <p>Yes. About the convertible bonds, we are waiting October 15 in order to see what kind of share price we will have then. But in the normal current applying financial. Now what we do not know is whether if you would have another financial shock within this period. And then it could be that the price maybe is not at those CHF49. Then we have plans how to do it, how we are going to cope with that. But by these days, we are not telling you what we are going to do. I am sorry about that.</p>

          <p>So Mr. Kenel says, as we have to do this company, the management of the company is well prepared for every situation. But it's the Board of Directors that will get the proposal from the management and it's the Board of Directors that will decide what they want to do. And as you know, we have good corporate governance. There's nobody from us here that's in the Board of Directors, we're just the management.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Warwick Okines from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's actually Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. You mentioned in the statements, I know you talked about this to some extent already and that with production you expected to maintain the current level of performance in the second half, but you also said that third party orders are likely to be down. So are you referring to sales or profits when you say you expect to maintain performance? And if it's sales, does that mean group sales you expect to rise? And related to that, would not the need to reduce inventories, reduce the group element of production? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second is a much simpler one, on the financial results, 27 million in the first half, would you expect a similar outcome in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Look, it's on the group level that we are talking about. I was talking about the group level. Of course, we will have, we have some cancellations in the second half. But I anticipated some of these people will come back, of these third parties. And say, by the way, we see it's improving, we would like to have this product anyway, and this will change. On the other hand, we launched Tiffany, and we launched some other things. So depending on the success of this, we will need some capacities for ourselves. So it might be that here in the production, we will need a part of what the third parties are canceling for our needs. And then, sorry, for the third parties because they will not be able in 2010 and 2011 to request more products from us, because we'll have taken into our brands. This is still a scenario that could be possible. The second question was the profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Financial results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>The financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We've been speaking about financial situation, right now. And what it could be in the future maybe, I need your help. If you know what the financial results will be on the stock markets, these months to come, then there we'll need absolutely your input. But look, it's very difficult to say, but you know that we are risk averse. We do not like risk and we would take every possible measure in order to keep that result. But again, financial results, we do not know by these days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But excluding any unexpected financial results. I suppose an other way of asking the question is; did the first half seen a benefit from some one-off receipts of financial income that won't be there in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I can take over here. No, this was &#x2013; as you know, our asset allocation more or less, I think we have been, as the panel just said, very cautious investors. We kept what we had, we shifted some to more secured securities.</p>
          <p>We have some currency mix in that, and that's helped. And if I look at numbers right now, and I'm not talking about the Swatch Group shares but the overall market and also the currency moves, I see some very positive move. But Mr. Kenel is right to be cautious because none of us can predict sharply what the exchange rates are going to be, the euro mainly, in which we are invested to some extent. And also the bond market and the share market. So we will be cautious. We will take the safe side on it, but if I look at the numbers right now, things look pretty positive.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matthias Eifert from MainFirst. First question to Mr. Hayek, I would like to know what actually got worse since March, when you said back in March that you expect flat sales for the full year, and now it's just flat sales for the second half?</p>
          <p>And second point, on the cost side, again sorry, you said you kept up the marketing spend. Can you be a bit more specific about that, does marketing relative to sales stay the same or did you keep the absolute amount of marketing spend stable in the first half?</p>
          <p>And the third question is about on retail business, can you tell us how much sales contribution you had in the first half from the store openings you mentioned before, and how much is now your own retail business of total sales? And related to that, I would like to know, from an accounting point of view, if you open a store and stock it up with your products, that is not booked as a sales yet, is it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do by the way the same thing in between our affiliate. If we sell from Switzerland to Swatch Group, China, we don't account this &#x2013; this is already sold totally. That's basics. Now if we come &#x2013; I don't know what you are referring to? I said in March that we're still trying to reach and to be as close as possible in local currencies, and when I talk about the watches, electronic sector, I took out for the full year. We don't give up too early. And now we see that in the half-year, we are minus 15%, minus 16, and we see encouraging signs for the second half. And I said, we fight to get as close as possible, might be that we are five or six or 7% below the 2008, but it depends of November, December, so nothing had gone worse. It is just confirming what I said. I don't know what you've understood, when I said this. I am convinced that the second half of the year will improve. November, December will show us if we achieve it or not, but this &#x2013; that's what I said, perhaps I was not clear enough, but now I want to make it clear.</p>
          <p>Then you're talking about the contribution of retail. Now, this depends brand by brand. Swatch contribution of own retailer Swatch is, Arlette?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to look at, it's about 35%, Mr. Geiser.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Yes, on the high side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, for the total of the group, it's approaching 12%. And I can maybe take the other one as well, the new stores accounted for about CHF60 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> That was not understandable. How much sales came in the first half from new store openings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From new stores in the first half, about 14 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you cannot say, look the Swatch Group has expanded the distribution like hell and they try to make more sales. That's why I always give, when you listen at the beginning of the meeting, I give like-on-like. Not like other companies. You don't have many who are giving you this. They tell you we sold 3% more, but we don't tell you how many stores we opened. I was clear in the beginning on the Tourbillon stores, on the Omega stores, it was a like-to-like comparison and it's an increase in sell-out compared to the last year, so that's the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That was very clear. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Can you hear me?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, can you speak a little bit louder?</p>

          <p>Hello. Can you hear me?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, now we can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I got four questions. The first one will be, you mentioned some new product launches currently with Constellation Omega. As far as I remember in Geneva, you were talking about two major product launches, which we were being withheld so far. So you have released one. Could you tell us a little bit more regarding the other one? It was also having quite an important impact on your inventory. That will be the first one.</p>
          <p>And my second question will be on your overall A&amp;P in the watch division. Could you give us an idea of its overall amount, and how has it evolved in H1 versus last year?</p>
          <p>The third question will be, you mentioned some interesting opportunity in the retail and distribution activities. Could you explain how you're talking about taking over some retailer under Chapter 11? I think you mentioned some new doors opening, close to 15, 20 in the first half, but maybe can you give us some more precise figure on this one?</p>
          <p>And my latest question will be on the Omega performances, as you mentioned <mark type="inaudible" /> Omega is 42%, total Omega is 22% in Swiss francs. I was wondering whether it's on the first six or seven months of the year or just for July? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I have to try &#x2013; I have to breathe hard now. To explain again, if I was earlier unclear, I don't know. I gave an indication on July when I made an outlook for the months. I said in July, Omega did on like-to-like in the own stores, it's 42 stores, 22% plus in sell-out in Swiss francs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was my point. Not Omega did in the first six months 22% plus, so if Omega would have done this, we would have had not 15% minus probably, because Omega is big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, so can you give us an idea of the evolution of the Omega sales in H1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This you have to &#x2013; positive &#x2013; you see Omega has a very important part of the group. And if you see the level of profitability and the level of turnover that's quite better than what's the rest of the industry, you see that there is certainly also a positive impact from Omega coming. But I will not go more into detail.</p>
          <p>Now let me ask for the man who was before there. I forgot about the marketing because he said something that we reduced marketing, which is not true. We &#x2013; I said, we negotiate better conditions in marketing, but we spend as much or even more, but we get more for the money. So we have not reduced our marketing expenses at all. That was the other gentleman that was there that has forgotten about his own question, when I asked him if something is old.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It seems that in absolute terms you spend more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll probably at the end of the year be not far away from what we have spent last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll see. We'll see. We have always some reserves, where they have to come to me in the second half of the year to decrease some amount of money. We don't give at the beginning of the year everything. We will have to look at it, and if the business develops like it develops now, there's no reason why we should not continue to spend the money, especially in these times as a result of it. So &#x2013; but let's come back to the launches.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, since we talked the last time, there are many, many launches coming up. Apart from Omega, we have Longines that comes with its new female product, <mark type="inaudible" /> in September. Tiffany is coming up. Then we will have Swatch and Tissot with the mechanical simplification complication movement that your colleague was telling afterwards. Then we will have at Breguet, minute repetitive, royal marine, you have a whole line of new products coming in, completing by the way the Double Tourbillon, which is really working very well. I must say price per piece about CHF500,000.</p>
          <p>Then we have Blancpain, launch of the new collection L-evolution, it's called. Then you have Rado. I have not talked about Rado. It's a new collection called AIR '55. Sounds like Audi or something like this. Then you have &#x2013; okay, these are the main launches that we delayed most of them because we said we are not charging the trade now with all this. But, of course, we produced some quantities of it. But after the first selling, we will have to restart the production and push. So that's why I am very positive for our own production in the second half of the year. So we see what's happening and that's where also the marketing money goes. So that's about the major launches.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the most important one would clearly be the Omega, the new Constellation line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and Tiffany and also Longines, because Longines has done fantastic this time. Longines, Tissot are performing like hell. Right in the &#x2013; in the right niche of pricing, Longines is about 2.5 times less expensive than Omega and Tissot. I don't have to tell you and cK also by the way, they are really doing a fantastic performance at the moment throughout this year.</p>
          <p>And the T-Touch from Tissot, I forgot. They have launched it about two months ago and here we need more production capacities but we here we have a touch screen to develop. It's complicated and capacities are not so easy to increase. It's a difficult technology, but we still have some reserves here. Okay. Then what did we have, what else, last question, you had four questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your opportunity in the retail and distribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chapter 11...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look we will certainly not buy something from Chapter 11, I can tell you. We will never put our fingers in a Chapter 11 situation. Now what I said is, a market like the U.S. or like Japan it's not just a downturn, you have probably also a structural problem. If you look how the American market is built, a lot of independent retailers but there are lot of chain and department stores.</p>
          <p>And you have seen that chains, big chains and department stores are working with a very low level of own capital. They work with discounts with very small margins. They are reluctant to give sell-out information through the door because we could help them.</p>
          <p>So I think that it would be time as in some other industries in the United States to bring perhaps some more modern approach to retailing into this country. They showed it sometimes. They have some products not in the watch business that is positive in retailing; but in watches the big chains over there, it's really &#x2013; it's really, yeah, it's really necessary that we think about new possibilities. But it doesn't go so far to say that you have to buy something or you have to buy something from Chapter 11, I just think that there is a &#x2013; there are opportunities out there to improve the business even if there are bad times it's not possible that a market is going down so strongly and you see what's happening in that market. They just sell with discounting, everything they know is, we sell it for 50% less and that's not a way that a high profile product should dissolve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe my last question would be on the jewelry side. It seems that you've almost stopped L&#xE9;on Hatot, are you considering acquisitions taking into account your very nice balance sheet and the cash on hands you've got.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. But you have something in mind. Now look, we have just considered, first of all, Arlette Emch, who was responsible for L&#xE9;on Hatot took over Swatch, much more important. So then we decided also that in this difficult environment the ones that are suffering the most is certainly jewelry, high-end jewelry. Let's concentrate on the watch business. At the high-end jewelry brands, we said, we'll keep it low key and then come back the moment when the economy is showing that on the jewelry side on the high end, we can again expand. That's why we were saying okay, we have to focus on this one. We have to continue to be there but it will be on a small level and then we see what will happen when the economy is again ready for high-end jewelry. Arlette, you want to say something?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I just want to add something on the jewelry side because we are performing very well with jewelry by Swatch and by cK, and also starting to do very well also by Omega and also good results by Breguet, the very high end because the brand is so strong and &#x2013; but the lower side of the jewelry is really good.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. I had two questions. The first question relates to your inventory level. Your inventory level is about 53% of your group sales, that's up from about 41% of group sales in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>And have you any target what you would regard as a normalized inventory level related to sales? And can you remind me how much of your inventory level relates to finished goods and semi-finished goods?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to your margin guidance, if you can clarify it? Have you mentioned that your group margin in H2 2009 will be below of the operating margin in the second half of 2008? And in the second half of 2008, you have an EBIT margin to gross sales of 18.8%. Can you clarify on that point? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me come back on the margin, I'll just say July had a shown a trend going towards 16, 17% on the operating. And we are trying to go further into this direction. Now to achieve exactly the same margin or even more than the second half of 2008, I come again back to November, December. We had November, December that was bad in 2008 and we'll see what will happen in 2009. And it's a bit depending on this. But I am sure that it will be better than the first half of 2009. We have to live with it. 2009, first half, 2009 the whole year will be certainly better than the first half.</p>

          <p>That's all I can say to it. Then about the stock, you see Mr. Geiser or Mr. Kenel, you want to say something then I want to say something also. Please take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. About the stock, we can say that we are not going to do buy like hell, we have been coming down over that. But what we are doing right now is to bring the product to the market. So we are adding values throughout our work in progress and this is highering the value of the stock that we have right now. And we are bringing that to the market front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me say something about the stock. We opted first of all and you see we didn't launch many products that we had prepared for because we didn't want to charge the trade. We prefer to have the stock at our level and then have the right mix and the right stock at the retailer's level. Now we have finished goods and we have intermediates. Now if you look at the situation I told you, you will see an diminishing of the stock, but it's not a dramatic situation at all. If you look brand by brand what's the sales that they are doing? What's the increase in sell-out that we are seeing at the moment? What's the stores that we are opening? So the Board of Directors and our sales, we are not preoccupied at all of this situation. It's about the best investment that we could do over the last year.</p>
          <p>Can you remember last year? When somebody was shouting on us and on me and said, what are you doing with your financial investments, you are &#x2013; that's not your business. You should invest rather in your own products and in your stock. And that was a woman. I don't remember her name. But she was right.</p>
          <p>She said that's not your business. You should stay in your core business. If you want to invest money, invest it in your brand and in your stock. And that's what we did in this period of time. And its true that we also occupy and occupy some of our factories to produce a little bit more because we know that is something that has value that we can sell. It takes a little bit more time. And now what we see in July and I'm really explicit, July, August we see, for example, with Omega how this will transform. It's fine. Okay, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Patrick Inglin from Credit Suisse First Boston. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Most of my questions are already answered. Nevertheless, I still have one. Last in terms of performance for difference price categories, could you elaborate a little bit? If you have seen there significant differences between the high end and the low price segment compared to your group average top-line decline in the first half year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Mr. Inglin, if I look at the sell-out of owned stores et cetera, I see that the consumer is behaving and is buying in every segment. This is important. So if you take Breguet or Blancpain, if you take Omega or Longines or Tissot, or Swatch, the consumer is there and he buys. In the U.S. a little bit less, but the rest of the world is the consumer is buying. So in some areas, he is buying more Omegas, in some areas more Longines or more Tissots, in some areas more Breguet, like in Russia for example. So here we see a pattern that is hovering between minus 10, eight, seven, up to plus 15, plus 20. You have a mix picture. So that's the consumer.</p>
          <p>But if you go to the retailer, the chains that are buying products from us, then you see a different picture. Of course, the lower end brands and the middle range brands where you need to invest less money to buy stock, they are more open to buy because they are less scared to sit on stock, that's very expensive and they hear everywhere that luxury is in a crisis.</p>
          <p>So the retailer was and is in some areas still reluctant to take the expensive pieces. And here you have a difference. The very high-end prestige, they have, for example, in Hong Kong a big problem to sell into the retailer, but the sell-out in the own stores showed that the demand is still there. And here you have a clear difference between the very prestigious high-end Breguet Blancpain, Glash&#xFC;tte to the rest and if I take Omega, also Omega had with the gold watches and the very high-end watches, we felt that the retailer is reluctant because he is scared to block too much of his money. However in the own stores, we have seen that also the high-end pieces are flowing out very well, so this is the difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's fair to say that you have suffered in the first half year also from a negative mix effect i.e. that &#x2013; on the back that your lower price segments has performed better, this &#x2013; on average lower margins, that your margins was negatively affected through that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know, if you can say it that way. I would say we have &#x2013; I mean, if we do 15% less turnover, we have suffered, if you want, so I agree with you. And if we do less profit we have suffered, it's relative but okay, we have suffered. But the problem is the selling pattern of the retailer it's not a sell-out if I talk about our product. You see it's an &#x2013; the problem is that cash was not available for whatever reason. I don't want to elaborate. Many retailers were reluctant or could not buy the stock they need to make the sales and with expensive products it's more difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But again, I told you, June, July, August is just changing the pattern. The retailers need now the product because they are short of product, they are short of product that the consumer is asking for and especially if you have brands that are doing investment in marketing that has new product they need these product because otherwise the consumer doesn't go to them, he comes to our own source.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the risk that this a whole reaction of the retailers that they just do now the stock resetting, that you have for a couple of months relatively good sales to the retailers. But that then the underlying demand is not coming back, let's say, first half year 2010 do you see this risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh my God. If I look at the numbers, I can tell you the demand is already back in the second half of 2009. I mean, if I look at the number you are still &#x2013; do a paradigm shift. We are back, the demand is there. There is no exaggeration, you cannot expect 30% increases. But the demand for the product is there, the stocks have come down but the demand is there. Even in the U.S., it goes again up. And in 2010, I see no reason at all, why we should not have a better situation then at the beginning of 2009. I see no reason. All signals I see are rather going into an improvement and it's the consumer who tells me this. He continues to spend money on all segments and all levels.</p>
          <p>Of course, he is more careful when he buys, what he buys and if it is quality. And we have to tell him this and we have to support the consumer for his choice. And actually no reason, I'm optimistic, I was optimistic at the beginning of the year and I'm still optimistic and I will be even still more optimistic for 2010. I don't see any reason why we should go into a situation that would be worse. Do you see any signals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at the moment, I see it is going up there, but who knows for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see I must really put the finger on what we said at the beginning of the year. You were all a little bit looking at us that we are poor guys. But we have the information from the markets.</p>
          <p>We know the consumer, his behavior and we can judge more or less why he is doing what, we cannot predict in percentages what will happen exactly. But we are here and paid for to do the necessary stuffs to gain this consumer confidence and to sell-in our products.</p>
          <p>And all the conditions are met in distribution, in product, in communication, and also in consumer mood to improve the situation in 2009 already but also in 2010.</p>
          <p>There is no reason for us to see any negative signal at the horizon. We see opportunities as I said before; the U.S. has now the big chance to learn distribution in watches from some other countries in the world, who went that step. And I think this will give us a big boost in the United States for 2010.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been asked. Maybe one on production, can you, Mr. Hayek, tell us the recent developments in the previous proposals for a change in the Swiss-made definition? Do you think this will be implemented when and could that impact significantly your production division's output and of course margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, we are still discussing this on the level of the F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration horlog&#xE8;re, but we are all of the opinion, it's important in the interest of the consumer that the Swiss-made must be reinforced in the interest of the consumer. I say it again; the consumer has the right, because he pays a premium for Swiss-made products. And he must know what does it mean Swiss-made and the reinforcement of the Swiss-made is a benefit for the whole Swiss watch industry, for the small entrepreneur as well as the big one. And all the big groups are in agreement that we should move forward to improve the situation, it's really important for the consumer. Mr. Kenel wants to say something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, about the Swiss made, it's not only a question about decision of the watch industry or the F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration horlog&#xE8;re, it's also about a political question on the European level, because this question has to be accepted by the other countries too. If we are going out with a Swiss-made, then a country like Germany or England has to accept that and this is not yet done and the decision is still open, so it's not up to us to do that.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. You talked quite a bit about the retail expansion. Is there a bigger plan if we look more long-term over the next five years to significantly increase that as a proportion? And just sticking with the wholesale scene, when do you expect to get the first indications from wholesalers for Christmas orders? Is that really September onwards? And then lastly, just specifically on mainland China, there's been a bit of news very recently on the plan &#x2013; or the potential plan that China might reduce the level of import taxes on luxury goods. Do you think that's likely done over the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Louise, yes. The tax issue we are pleading since a long time. It would be good if they reduce the taxes. We heard about these plans and we will see what's happening when they are in place. It will only be a benefit for all of us. So we can live with what is today, but we can very good live with what is happening if they do a reduction in taxes. By the way, it would be good for Russia, it would be good for India.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brazil. We have many countries where an initiative like this would be very helpful. So we can cope with it and we can also cope with it if it is not happening. Then on the retail level, Swatch, depending on the country, the brand Swatch, in the U.S., Swatch is doing practically 90% of the turnover in own stores, very successfully. In other areas and countries, Swatch is about 20% or 10% only in own stores. But I think it's fair to say, the brand Swatch can be between 50 to 60% sold in own stores long-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is for the brand Swatch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could even think it could be more than this. Then if you come to a brand like Breguet, or Blancpain, the high-end mono brands, I think it's fair to say that they could perhaps in five years sell 30 to 40% through own stores. It could be possible, depends on the country and on legislation. You have some countries that don't allow you to own your stores, and then you have a problem. But it could be around 30 to 40%. With Omega, I think the maximum we could face in own stores or our franchise stores would be around 20%. I don't think much more, perhaps 20, 25, but I don't think it's necessary and useful to have more.</p>
          <p>And then, we have the multi-brand concepts, the Tourbillon stores. Here, we are at about 18. We'll not have a big expansion of this one. However, the travel retail, we have our own company, Tech-Airport, that is operating only Charles de Gaulle in France and Nice, and we won the tender for a watch department with a mono-brand store of Omega at the Geneva Airport that will open in November. And this company will make expansion, because there is big potential for travel retail, watch specialists. And here, we will probably see that in the travel retail, we could increase. Today, we do very small amounts in travel retail through our own company, but here we could do probably more in the future. So that's more or less the percentages retail of our Group.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you. Thank you very much. I was just looking at the fixed and variable cost base for the watches and jewelry segment. And would you agree that you have an advantage at the moment in having a lower fixed cost base because of your high exposure to third-party distribution?</p>
          <p>And within the variable cost base, you have the capacity to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of advertising and promotion cuts, if you need to. It seems in the first half of the year, you haven't really taken very aggressive steps to make those cuts. But should there be a &#x2013; well, an unexpected downturn in the second half, based on your comments so far, would you take the necessary action to cut your advertising spend, A&amp;P promotion and marketing by anywhere between two and 300 million?</p>

          <p>There are many measures you can take before that you attack marketing or research and development. Get many fields where we can save money before that you do these steps. Of course, we are monitoring, if there is a worldwide terrible crisis and sales are going down to zero, we'll certainly reduce the marketing expenses in this area. But again, we are very cautious. It's ongoing, we are monitoring every week, every month our numbers.</p>
          <p>We are looking where we can save money, and we have many, many places where we can save money before that we are attacking it. And of course, we try to have more marketing visible and spending less for it, that's important. We are not trying to throw the money out of the window. But what we need to give as the signal is we believing in the marketplace, it's developing and we see it, the sell out is positive. Now what you said, that we have a fixed cost advantage because we deliver to third parties.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, I was saying that your fixed and variable cost relationship is more 50/50, Richmond's fixed cost base might be a little bit higher, around 70%.</p>

          <p>Richmond is taking advantage of the Swatch Group, they leave us with all the cost, no, but this is true. They &#x2013; all the movements, components from us. This is reality. It's a truth.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I know.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a truth. When you ask them last year or two years ago, they could tell what is the evidence Swatch could not deliver us as of much as we wanted. It's a reality. They take advantage of us. They take advantage of our investment, of our money. This is the reality. We don't take advantage from them, it's the contrary. They take advantage from us, from our innovation, from our strength. Look at what is in their product as a base, it's our moments. It's our components. Jesus Christ. You get me angry now.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I know, but this is the reality. And we have also sense of responsibility. We keep our factories open. We continue to invest despite the fact that these people taking the phone and say, hey, guys, we call next year again, if we need something. Now we don't need anything anymore, ciao. That's an approach &#x2013; that's a finance approach, not an entrepreneur approach. Okay, that's &#x2013; not want to elaborate more about that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have the &#x2013; always you have the last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is great. Thanks to hear that. And actually I wanted to turn this around and answer your question and what I was referring to before when I asked you what has changed since March because I looked at your press release from March and you said that you expect modest growth in 2009 over 2008.</p>
          <p>Now you're saying you expect a stable sales in the second half compared to the second half last year. And if I add the development in the first half, I get to something like minus 8.7% sales in 2009, therefore I was asking you what has changed since March?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I ask you what has changed since March?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What did get worse since March that you now guide us a bit lower on sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not worse. We said in May that we would try to achieve the same thing. You are taking the papers, you're reading them. We have some careful statements in there and we will say, look, the second &#x2013; yes, I repeat it for the 250 times. So, one thing that has certainly not changed is the approach of the analyst questions, they are always the same.</p>
          <p>So let me come back to this. We in March said our objective is still to be as close as possible in the watch business as we have been in 2008 in local currency. Now, we have the result, we have minus 15 or 16. We didn't have the minus 15 in March. What did you have, did you think that we fixed it already? As you think also that we put in our stores the turnover and the stock and we sell it already.</p>
          <p>So what has changed that we have the results now? We have the results for the first half-year, and then we say, okay, what will be the second half? We can write in our paper, yes, the second half will be outperforming 20% more than in 2008. We say, guys, we'd expect that there will be a possibility of growth in the second half.</p>
          <p>And I said it before, I think three times, it depends on November-December. If November-December is outstanding, what could be, we will of course reach what we said in March. So nothing has changed in the objective of the group. We're just formulating a little bit careful and we saw that this is very positive to say that the second half of the year is flat or even positive. Now of course, we are aiming to make this happen in a very strong way; it depends on November-December.</p>

          <p>So you took my comments not serious in March. You just told me that you give a shit on my comments on March. So do please the same today also. You will probably do it. So why are you spending my time and throwing my time out of the window? I will not talk with you anymore. So you just showed me that you give a shit on what the CEO of the group has said. Thank you very much.</p>
