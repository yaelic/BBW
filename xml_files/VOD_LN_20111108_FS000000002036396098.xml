      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator and good morning to you and thanks for joining our first half results call. I'll give an overview of the results announced today before opening up for your questions.</p>
          <p>So Group revenue of &#xA3;23.5 billion grew 2.2% on an organic basis with service revenue growing 1.4% organically to &#xA3;21.9 billion. Excluding the impact of mobile termination rate reductions, Group service revenue grew at a healthy 3.8%.</p>
          <p>Our overall revenue performance reflects continued strong demand for data services, which were up 24% and further voice penetration growth in emerging markets offset by regulatory changes and declining voice prices.</p>
          <p>On a regional basis and starting with Europe, service revenue was down 1.3% including improved growth in Northern Europe, principally U.K. and Netherlands and steady growth in Germany. In Southern Europe, Spain reported a decline in revenues of 9% with an improving trend quarter one to quarter two as price reductions and a number of operational initiatives led to early signs of improvement in commercial performance.</p>
          <p>Growth in Italy also declined slightly due to weakening consumer confidence and further regulatory cuts; although in the market, we performed very strongly against our competitors. In AMAP, our emerging markets region, service revenue grew 8.4% with India and Vodacom delivering 18% and 7% growth respectively. Performance from our joint venture in Australia was weak during the period following adverse network and customer service issues in the last fiscal year.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for the Group overall was up 2.3% year-on-year to &#xA3;7.5 billion. The EBITDA margin declined by 60 basis points against the prior year, with the fall primarily driven by our reprising actions in Spain and the performance in Australia offset by good cost control. Besides from those two markets, our margin actually rose very slightly by 0.3% across the rest of the Group.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating profit of &#xA3;6 billion grew 4.4% on an organic basis, supported by strong growth from Verizon Wireless. Finance costs are in line with expectations and rose year-on-year due to two things. Firstly, we decided to fix a greater level of our debt instruments as we move into a period of rising interest rates. The average cost of debt is now just under 5%, against 4% in the prior year. Secondly, dividends from China Mobile and SoftBank gains no longer arise following our disposal of those assets.</p>
          <p>Tax costs and tax charges in the period were also in line in expectations and the effective tax rate for the first half was 25.2%. The India tax case has now finished in court and we await the adjudication of that over the weeks and months ahead.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share of 7.75 pence declined 11.5% year-on-year with the vast majority of this decline coming from recently completed M&amp;A transactions; principally the loss of SFR earnings, SoftBank gains and China Mobile dividends.</p>
          <p>The interim dividend per share will grow 7% to 3.05 pence and this will be paid in February 2012 along with a special dividend of 4 pence per share coming from the $10 billion Verizon Wireless dividend that was announced earlier this summer.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow for the first half of &#xA3;2.6 billion is down 25% year-on-year due to slightly accelerated capital expenditure in the first half along with the phasing of working capital. We remain confident at delivering against our full-year free cash flow guidance of &#xA3;6 billion to &#xA3;6.5 billion announced in May this year.</p>
          <p>Net debt reduced from &#xA3;30 billion to &#xA3;26.2 billion at the end of the period largely as a consequence of the &#xA3;6.8 billion SFR disposal proceeds that we received in Q1. Share buyback spend during the quarter was &#xA3;1.8 billion this includes the completion of the &#xA3;2.8 billion China Mobile program started in the prior year and the commencement of the &#xA3;4 billion SFR program.</p>
          <p>Spectrum auctions in Spain and the announcement to buy out the Essar minorities in India, each accounted for a further &#xA3;0.3 billion of spend. As a reminder, there are a number of significant second-half cash flows to come. The disposal of our stake in the Polish-operated Polkomtel is expected to complete in the near future for &#xA3;0.6 billion net of tax. We will receive a &#xA3;2.8 billion dividend from Verizon Wireless in January, from which we will pay &#xA3;2 billion to our shareholders in February alongside our own interim dividend.</p>
          <p>The SFR share buyback program will continue and the current run rate is expected to be roughly &#xA3;1.9 billion in the second half. And finally, we recently announced the acquisition of Spectrum in Italy for &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me now review our returns to shareholders. Our ordinary dividends are growing at 7% per annum. We have committed &#xA3;6.8 million to share buybacks and have announced a &#xA3;2 billion special dividend to be paid in February 2012. Over the past four years, the aggregate of these cash returns to shareholders is &#xA3;26 billion or put another way, 30% of our market capitalization.</p>
          <p>So to wrap up, we have reported consistent performance during the first half of 2011-12, taking market share gains in the vast majority of markets in which we operate. We have made encouraging progress on our profitability with the EBITDA margin reduction reducing and we have increased our full-year adjusted operating profit guidance to the upper half of the range at the start of the year, namely &#xA3;11.4 billion to &#xA3;11.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Targeted capital investment is driving strong underlying free cash flow, and we are delivering strong <mark type="audio gap" /> (7:32) an increase in shareholder returns. In fact if you take our normal dividend plus the Verizon Wireless dividend, the two together will amount to roughly 13% of the FTSE 100 dividends in total.</p>
          <p>Thank you for joining. And I'll now happily take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to you Andy and thank you for taking my question. One of the highlights for the first half was the EBITDA margin improvement and specifically the direct costs staying broadly flat at the Group level and down about &#xA3;80 million year-over-year in Europe. Was this a consequence of Vodafone's investments in its core and radio access networks of the last several years leading to better economics on the data side, or was there another factor?</p>
          <p>And just a second question on cost, if you could please. In terms of the customer costs, have there been more pervasive handset leasing or was there consistently lower costs of handsets perhaps through the mix across the piece? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Stanley. So direct costs, fairly similar I think that is primarily about routing of traffic and as you say about the focus we have put on leasing and owning core and access network. So it's slightly less traffic volume going through third-party networks and therefore, taking some of the direct cost burden off.</p>
          <p>In terms of customer costs, handsets and leasing is still a very, very small part of the business, so that has not had a particular impact on the customer costs in the period. Clearly in the acquisition, the customer acquisition side, the bigger issue there has been the shift to more Smartphones with the slightly higher level of subsidy that happens with Smartphones compared with the non-Smartphones, but leasing is not a major factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our next question comes from the line of Monroe Helm from Barrow, Hanley and Mewhinney (sic) [Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney &amp; Strauss]. Your line is now open, please go ahead and ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for doing the call. Can you kind of talk about what you think are the biggest headwinds you face over the next 12 months and what you think you can do combat the challenges that are out there in the marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I think the biggest headwind is clearly the macro environment and the impact that it's having on consumer spend particularly in Southern Europe. So on the positive side, I think if you look across our big markets we're actually seeing very strong growth in revenues in India, South Africa, Verizon Wireless, the U.K., and Germany is doing fine. So for those markets, I think all are looking reasonably solid. Spain clearly has been more challenging, revenues down there now for three consecutive years and Italy also sort of in that middle ground.</p>
          <p>So, I think the key thing really is to make sure that we are driving the growth that we can out of the markets that are growing stronger than &#x2013; we have to take the headwinds in the Southern European markets.</p>
          <p>Now, what are we doing about it? A lot of work on price repositioning; clearly customers very, very focused upon value for money and hence, the right sizing many of the price plans to offer more value for money and in some instances to change the sort of perception on value for money and so that has been sort of quite wide spread &#x2013; we've been doing that in Spain, been doing that in Greece and to some extent in Portugal. And so I think that to my mind it's the biggest sort of single headwind; obviously we continue have some mobile termination rate cuts happening progressively over time, but those are mostly known and mostly sort of factored into our plans.</p>
          <p>So I think the macro is the biggest headwind. Counterbalancing that the growth on data is still very encouraging to be in sort of mid-20% growth on data. It is clear that there is a natural appetite to data product and so long as we can get devices at reasonably affordable price points it seems that even in more economically challenged environments that people are still keen to pay for Internet-capable devices.</p>
          <p>So, obviously we'll be pushing that as much as possible; and in the messaging, although I know there's been a quite a lot of talk about messaging, we've actually seen the volumes on messaging still be very, very strong. So actually across the grid for the second quarter, messaging volumes I think were up 19% year-on-year across the Group, up 13% in Europe. So, bottom line is &#x2013; it's all about value in Southern Europe and it's all about making sure that we're really exploiting the growth opportunities in the other markets to counterbalance to the weakness there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A second question if I could, Verizon won't commit to say that the special dividend is going to be continued. At what point in 2012 would you expect a decision on their part and is there any circumstances on which you could see that they wouldn't make this payment to the owners of Verizon Wireless in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think Verizon has said quite correctly that the first thing is making sure that they've got the appropriate funding to develop the business as the business needs, and that we fully understand and consequentially that the issue of what dividend to pay and when will be looked at on an annual basis and further an assessment made at that point in time. We haven't agreed explicitly sort of when in the year that review takes place, obviously this one we did in the summer and the payment date is the end of January. I've just made a couple of observations &#x2013; one is that the ongoing cash flows of the Verizon Wireless business, are still very, very strong. I think the net debts come down from &#xA3;29 billion to &#xA3;3 billion over a two year period, and that rate of cash generation shows no signs of abating. And secondly I am sure Verizon will be looking at their own cash requirements and particularly the cash that they require to pay their own dividends their shareholders, when they are factoring in decisions as to how much cash they want to take out of the wireless business.</p>
          <p>So the bottom line is it will be looked at each year, I don't know exactly when each year. But I'm reasonably comfortable in the underlying momentum, should mean over a period of time that we will see a good dividend stream coming through. But that will be a decision that is made with Verizon.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And thanks again for taking the time to do the call with &#x2013; here in the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's no problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our next question comes from the line of Andrew O'Neill from Central Securities. Your line is now open please go ahead and ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Andy, I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about how you've been managing cash in Europe, given some of the risks around, Greece I guess in particular and that they may at some point re-denominate from the Euro. And also if you could talk us a little bit through the debt position of the Group in Europe, whether it's held centrally or whether you have some debt locally in places like Greece that would potentially be sort of re-denominated if that were the risk to play out as well. And how much debt at this point in time do you &#x2013; do you hold in Euros after you've looked at all the different, I guess sort of derivatives and swaps and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, Andrew. So the Greece question is not surprisingly one that comes up fairly regularly and it's quite a tricky question really. I think, trading-wise, what can we do differently in the event that there were to be something that changes with regard to their currency. And probably actually in trading terms not a huge amount, this is going to be all about consumer confidence and consumer spend and if there were to be in the event of a major consequence there then we will have to react to that at the time.</p>
          <p>In a currency sense equally, because there is no decision as to whether something different to the Euro will happen, let alone if a decision were made to move to something different, that that other currency has been actually identified and setup. There basically are no alternatives. So we consider pontificating, theorizing, and think about it, but actually there isn't an alternate; therefore, we have to live with the world that we live with.</p>
          <p>Now the good news is that in terms of our Group operating free cash flows, Greece is very, very small and gets about 3% of the total and to link maybe a little bit into your second question, every single night this is not something new, but every single night, all cash balances in all of our businesses are swept out of local operating markets and into our Central U.K. bank account. So we essentially do very, very tightly monitor the physical cash.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we do not have any debt that is specific to an individual country, all the debt in Europe has been issued at the PLC level and is essentially <mark type="ph" /> bonds (18:59). There are a couple of markets in the emerging markets where we do have country-specific debt, but not in Europe. Roughly, this will seem strange because it will add up to a slightly strange number, but the make-up of our debt by currency at the moment for the Group is about 60% euro, 60% dollar, 30% other currencies, so rupee and rand particularly, all of which adds up to 150% and then we essentially have got minus 50%, which is cash held in sterling and that gets you back to 100%.</p>
          <p>So 60% is the euro number within the overall mix albeit peaks at 150% to come back to 100%. We deliberately as I think I may have commented on previous calls, we usually will hold a fair amount of sterling cash because we have got the buyback and we've got the dividend commitment in sterling and that obviously avoids some of the currency risk on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay great. Thank you. And then maybe secondly on a slightly brighter note I guess, it looks like this pricing improvement in the Indian market that's helping you. Could you just describe a little more the pricing environment there and maybe some of the levels that are starting to look like there maybe tailwinds at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Definitely that is a brighter point, I would agree with you. Pricing environment two years ago in India was pretty horrible. We had the sort of per second pricing and overall prices in the market really came down very steeply, very quickly. What we've seen over the last two to three months has been a number of competitors and ourselves included, who have actually increased some the prices an order of magnitude probably around 20%. What has been encouraging is that at the moment, those prices seem to be holding in the market, they seem to becoming accepted as being sort of new market norm. And what's also been encouraging is actually that the minutes of use in total in India have actually stayed pretty level quarter-on-quarter despite putting the big price increase through. So, I think that we'll keep the fingers crossed but it appears that a slightly higher price point is now being accepted in the market and clearly that will be good news for us as we move forward.</p>

          <p>Thank you, for your question. Our next question comes from the line of William Pitkin from GE Asset Management. Your line is now open, please go ahead and ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. This is back to the question about India, and if you could just talk a little bit about the longer-term strategy in terms of getting your investment or return on your investment in India. Are you expecting to get it out of data because it clearly won't just come out of voice? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, William, I think there is a number of sort of aspects and angles to this. The first one is there's still a large part of the population that does not yet have mobile at all; and therefore, very much pushing out on voice to those who are sort of first time users, as it were. And bear in mind, we have taken about a percentage point of revenue market share each year since we invested in India and if anything, actually we've taken slightly more than that just recently; so the one is really, really going after customers not yet using mobile.</p>
          <p>The second one is on the data front where, what we are now building 3G networks, actually the early data adaptors tend to be more on 2G devices. But data is still pretty latent there, 62% growth, I think it was in data revenues only one in five of the customers using data products. So the second angle is going to be about really driving for data penetration and getting data to take off.</p>
          <p>And then I think scale is going to help in terms of improving the margin in the business. The price rebalancing just refers to, or price increases should we say, I think also it will be helpful. And for a period of time and this evolving news on the rules that surround the ability for our businesses to merge or acquire in the sector, our sense that over a periods of time this is market that will end up with fewer players than we have got in now, hopefully will be more orderly as a consequence of it. And hence, when you put all of that together, we believe strongly that we can grow this business quite considerate of where it is today, we can improve the profitability margins in the business. And while, as the regulatory and political environment there has been tricky, I think the actual operational execution has really been very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you very much. Could you also give an update on your strategy in Africa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got essentially in Africa we've invested and have invested for many years in Egypt sort of in the north of the continent, Kenya sort of in the middle of the continent and Vodacom in the South.</p>
          <p>Vodacom itself has been invested in six or so territories around the periphery of Southern Africa. So, our broad strategy there has been things that are in the southern part of the continent, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:00) Vodacom look at and keep an eye on and if there are opportunities they will look into making a move on those. And then the rest of Africa as of this stage more being a watching brief. I don't think there's any particular change that has occurred recently, but big markets &#x2013; big population generally under penetrated &#x2013; so it's a sort of watching brief. If there's an opportunity we'll very much have a look at it but nothing to report at this stage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. There is a slide in your presentation showing the machine-to-machine revenues potentially growing four times over the next four years. The question I have is how do the margins on that revenue stream compare to corporate average approximately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By memory they are actually fairly similar to the corporate average. The revenue per unit obviously, is very, very much lower. But so is the cost that actually servicing it. So by memory I haven't got the exact number in front of me but I think it's sort of in the 30s sort of type range of 30% to 40% type range. It's interesting here, we put a team of people together about a year ago now on this and we've been bidding on some pretty big contracts just recently, and good success rate on it. And we're pretty enthused actually by the opportunity we've got in that space. So we'll watch that and we'll report out on it in the future.</p>

          <p>Thank you, just a question on CapEx in terms of the &#xA3;731 million difference between cash and accrued CapEx, was that due to a timing difference or was there some advance purchase of perhaps LTE-related equipment? And then if I look at the &#xA3;2.6 billion on an accrued basis Andy, could you talk about any changes in mix that you anticipate between the core network, backhaul and radio RF devices. So would expect the backhaul cost would continue to increase as you continue at the penetration, but core network spending might come down because of some of the investments that was being made for the last two years?</p>

          <p>Yes. So, let me just, Stanley, take those in order. The $700 million is the working capital movement relating to CapEx, so that is the timing of the actual cash payment to suppliers relative to when we have actually capitalized the equipment. So, I think put another way, we would typically have our peak CapEx quarter in the January to March quarter; if you take our run rate, what did we do, &#xA3;2.6 billion in the half year, so it's probably &#xA3;5.2 billion, so the underlying run rate typically our fourth quarter will be about &#xA3;1 billion higher than that to get to the &#xA3;6.2 billion or thereabouts number for the full year.</p>
          <p>Because we are typically paying suppliers probably 75 days after delivery, then that extra peak in the fourth quarter of our financial year usually fits into the first quarter of the following year and hence into the first half. So that's why you'll see more of a dent, because of CapEx cash flow in the first half and then release in the second half; and hence, why put together we're very comfortable with the overall cash outlook for the year. Sorry your second question was?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's really on the mix within your capital spending program between backhaul, RF devices and the core network, so within the &#xA3;2.6 billion or broadly the &#xA3;6 billion per annum that you spend on CapEx, do you see a mix shift between those categories and the one I thought might occur would be an increase in backhaul spending, but perhaps a reduction in spending on the core network because of some of the core network investments I think you've made the last two and a half years?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So you are absolutely right. If anything, we are putting slightly more into backhaul to make sure we have got the volume capability for data. And we're putting slightly more into IT as we're particularly upgrading from of the billing in the CRM platforms, radio spend and the core spend is slightly lower than at some stages in the past. Not a massive move, but just directionally probably slightly more than the former and a little bit less of the latter.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Jim (sic) [Tim] Daubenspeck from ClearBridge Advisors. Your line is now open, please go ahead and ask your question.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I think &#x2013; it's Tim Daubenspeck from ClearBridge. The first questions are on capital intensity longer-term &#x2013; good success on data, good success on data plans, could you just talk about longer-term capital intensity expectations and kind of gives and takes that could push it either way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've spent typically 10%, 11% of service revenue on CapEx in Europe for the last two or three years. I think the first thing to say is that, we don't run the business to a specific percentage, if we have got the cash generation and we see the opportunity to create some value than we will happily spend more money on CapEx; if we don't, then we will spend at the sort of 10% or so level. As we move forward, we'll have some spend on LTE as we move along the migration path there. But I think it'll be quite gradual because unlike Verizon Wireless, we haven't got until recently the spectrum in quite a number of countries so we just can't go out and build the network, or it wouldn't make sense to do it.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with the HSPA technology, actually there is still runway to get more data speed out of those and because that is still very cost effective for us we will tend to do as much as we can with HSPA before we will default across to LTE.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, within our current CapEx we are actually spending a fair amount of money on preparing our base stations for the day when LTE does arrive, so it's moving to what we call the single RAMs where essentially though it was sort of a card slot that will be freed up so that we can put LTE onto it.</p>
          <p>So I'd say in Europe sort of 11% or so give or take is sort of a number that we will be around, it might be a little bit more, it might be a little bit less. If it's more, it's because we see an opportunity. The emerging markets tend to be a little higher than that because there is obviously some more coverage to deal with there. But the rates generally in the emerging markets have been coming down over the years.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a second question I had. Vittorio was, I think quoted, I'm looking at some headlines about European consolidation. Could you just, I mean I know it's not a new topic, but could you just talk about the magnitude of consolidation we're talking about &#x2013; how much, how big could some of this consolidation be over the next several years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again it's a tricky question. In theory, one could look at a number of markets and say, they've got four players, they've got five and logic suggests that there is no reason why you couldn't have a fully competitive market with say three. But moving logic to something actually happening sort of requires a willing party to be a protagonist and a willing party to sort of join in and a willing regulator. And I guess we've seen one instance with Deutsche Telekom and Orange putting the businesses together in the U.K. a couple of years ago. We are at the moment going through a process to see whether we could merge our business in Greece with the third operator, and that actually would be a three to two move, which has obviously also got is challenges, but so has the local economy. And thereafter, there are many sort of combinations where people take off, it could be two small players in Germany, or two small players in Spain get together, or one of the bigger players and a smaller player in one of those markets get together and to be honest it's unclear as to whether or who will make a move and when they'd make the move.</p>
          <p>What we have said consistently, what Vittorio has said consistently is we are strong believers that consolidation makes sense, there are huge overlaps on networks. There are huge overlaps on retail distribution and wherever we have been involved with it or Verizon Wireless has been involved with it, we do see that there has been a real opportunity to create value. So we are strongly supportive of it but exactly how much will happen and how quickly is a little bit difficult to predict.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to clarify, and I apologize because I've got other contacts to today's comments but basically the strategy and the commentary has not changed in terms of consolidation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, we supported the concept if it makes sense to be involved, we'll happily be involved, if others want to be involved, we'll happily support them. But basically that is as it previously was.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks again, Andy I just had a follow-up question to understand some of the costs around Smartphones for you. I noticed that you pointed out in the slide that certainly at the sort of entry levels Smartphone prices have been coming down quite nicely for you at an unsubsidized level. But obviously there is a mix and Apple iPhones are quite expensive. What broadly is the sort of general cost burden of Smartphones in the business right now? And then as penetration sort of gradually rises, when might we see &#x2013; well, how would those sort of trends develop I guess in the business? Is there a sort of plateau or a peak that's reached from which hopefully some of the underlying reductions in the technology might start bringing &#x2013; bringing the burden down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah so, the simplest way to answer this is the amount we're spending on acquiring and retaining customers as a proportion of revenue has stayed pretty well static. Within that, we have got a significant move towards Smartphones &#x2013; roughly 50% of our new customers are on Smartphones and hence the numbers that are on non-Smartphones is clearly self-evidently reducing. So we get some benefit in terms of the revenue side with the Smartphones but it does come with a cost disadvantage; but overall it's sort of managed to pretty much cover the two off against each other and I think the trick going forward is sort of two-fold.</p>
          <p>One is some of Smartphones are very expensive but there are other manufacturers who are making ones that are a more affordable price and how could we make those latter ones a richer part of the mix. And secondly which has not so much to do with the cost side but a real focus within the business as to how we can leverage the revenue side of the equation such that as much as we possibly can do we are getting these customers onto integrated price plans and we are getting an ARPU uplift that is commensurate with the extra costs we're taking on. So at the moment, when you put it all together the higher proportion in Smartphones, the higher costs of that, with funding out of savings elsewhere and overall as a proportion of revenues, the acquisition and retention spend is remaining fairly constant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But it sort of sounds a little bit like, you hold out hope that at some point down the road we might sort of see the percentage of revenue burden separate a little bit and that would then be margin enhancing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:50)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right. I think that's right. I mean we are working hard at it, but therefore it's not an easy combination. Just as we start making roads there, tablets come along and they've got a different subsidy model with them. But a big focus in the business to see what we can do. The A&amp;R spend <mark type="ph" /> fees (39:05) as a proposition of our total cost base and just the odd percentage point of change here and there does make a big difference. In the emerging markets, I think actually we need to get a more affordable entry price point for the 3G devices, in clearly markets like India. There is a dollar price point above which one is not going to make many sales and there is a price point at which hopefully one can do. So we have been strongly encouraging some of the manufacturers to address that significant opportunity in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you generally see in Europe that your competitors are staying fairly rational on subsidization strategies and &#x2013; around Smartphones and it sort of seems like a sensible market or I mean I know that there's obviously local variations all the time but broadly speaking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's sensible, but I'm not sure that the conversion of the risk of the upfront subsidy relative to the ARPU uplift that the economic equation is quite where we would like it to be.</p>

          <p>Good well thank you very much indeed for joining the call. Just to reiterate I think a fairly steady set of numbers for the half year, a big focus on progressively repositioning the Group so that more and more of its revenue are coming from the growth areas of data, enterprise and the emerging markets. Good cost control has helped on the margin front, reconfirming the full year cash flow, slight increase in the profit guidance and very, very significant returns, cash returns to shareholders. So thank you all very much and have a good day.</p>
