      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning to you all. Before I begin here, I'd like to say that we have with us today Mr. Denilson Molina, Credit Card Director; Mr. Mark Mendon&#xE7;a M&amp;A Unit; Mr. Gueitiro Matsuo Genso, Director from Consumer Finance; Mr. Jos&#xE9; Carlos Vaz, Director from Agribusiness; Mr. Paulo Roberto Evangelista de Lima, Risk Director; Mr. Walter Malieni J&#xFA;nior, Credit Director and Mr. Clenio Severio, Director for SMB.</p>
          <p>The performance in the quarter confirmed the success of the strategy adopted by the management, ratified by the achievement of the most part of the estimates in our guidance. We are pretty confident that Banco do Brasil &#x2013; we have achieved its goals due to the good prospects of the Brazil economy and the banking industry.</p>
          <p>Beginning by the slide number three where we bring some information about the dynamics of our economy showing the growth potential of our country and improvement occurred in the economics dynamics in recent years.</p>
          <p>The movement among the social classes observed during the last six years allows great access to more resilience, benefiting the bank industry especially as financial institutions focus on retail.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number four, the numbers presented here confirm the information from the previous slides showing that the credit volume in the Brazil economy is increasing with a stable risk level. The highlight of this slide is the right bottom graph, which shows the evolution of loan to GDP ratio, which increased from 30.2% to 45.7% between 2006 and June 2010.</p>
          <p>On slide number five, we have our market shares in some segments. We are leaders in everything that matters in bank industry. Once again, the highlight is our leadership in total assets with a 21.5% market share.</p>
          <p>Moving to next slide, slide number six, we have the Banco do Brasil results. We ended the first half 2010 with a net income of R$5.76 billion and a recurring net income of R$4.383 billion, an increase of 34.9% when compared to the first half of 2009, confirming that the strategy adopted by Banco do Brasil during the past years are guaranteeing consistent results.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number seven, now talking about the financial results. Net interest income, we can observe the evolution of those revenues, which grew in comparison to the first half of 2009 led by a strong growth in revenues from loan operations. Once again, the expansion of loan operation revenues was driven by the increase in the average volumes of credit transactions, compensating the behavior of the spreads as we'll see on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight. We have the behavior of the spread in each portfolio and also the net interest margin compared to cumulative Selic rates. The contraction of spreads in the individual business portfolios is mainly due to the concentration in those operations with less risk and which also bring lower margins such as payroll loans and car financing to individuals and working capital and investment lines to mid and large companies.</p>
          <p>On second quarter, we introduced a new metric to analyze Banco do Brasil's net interest margin. It is the net interest margin adjusted by the risk. As you can see in the right graph, although there is a reduction in net interest margin, when it is adjusted by the risk, the behavior is quite different. It proves that the strategy of choosing products with lower margins, but with better risk profile is making sense.</p>
          <p>Since, last year, the net interest margin adjust by the risk is stable around 4.5% despite the drop of 80 bps in the net interest margin in comparison with the second quarter that measure asset before the risk .</p>
          <p>Slide number nine, on slide number nine, we can see that our funding costs are improving, mainly due to the higher growth of core deposits than the total deposits. Our foreign borrowing is stable as you can see in the bottom part of this slide, and our market share of assets under management is close to 23% of the Brazilian market.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 10. We can see Banco do Brasil gained share in the loan market, expanding its leadership with 20.1% market share in June 2010, amounting at the end of that month, R$326.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Here we're highlighting the share of individuals' portfolio with the total portfolio. In June 2009, this portfolio represented 27.1% of the total Group. In June 2010, its share reached 31%. So that's R$100 billion. We will talk briefly about the main segments of our book.</p>
          <p>Moving to next slide, number 11, we have the breakdown of our consumer finance operations, credit to individuals, which grew 47.7% in 12 months. As we can see, the payroll and auto loans are responsible for 52.5% of the total credit to individuals which explained the drop in the spread since those operations have lower risk and lower margins. To continue to grow our payroll loan book, we will focus on increasing our share in social security retirees and pensioner segments, and increase on the term of loans related to municipalities agreement and our partnership with Banco Votorantim complementing the origination of digits outside of the range.</p>
          <p>Regarding auto loans, we will keep our strategy of acquiring portfolio from other financial institutions and we will launch new products in order to meet our client needs in terms of convenience.</p>
          <p>We cannot forget to mention that at the end of June, we set back R$2 billion in mortgage operations. In this business, our strategy has been the origination of individual loans through the finance of real estate projects. The government project Casa Minha Vida and of course the use of our distribution network to originate the operations.</p>
          <p>Slide number 12, we show the evolution on the balance of business operations, which in 12 months grew 31%; please observe that the strongest growth was in the operations with mid and large companies, which explains the spread reduction from those operations, that bring risk improvement.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we will have further details on that book. Slide number 13, we have the breakdown of our business portfolio credit into companies. We've highlighted working capital lines and investment lines, that together represent more than 76% of the total book for companies raised in the second quarter around 10%, surpassing 40% when compared to June last year.</p>
          <p>Next slide, slide number 14, we have the evolution in the balance of working capital operation to SMEs, especially those guaranteed by FGO. The balance from those operations increased 47.1% from the first quarter to the second quarter 2010 and in the quarter with R$5.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The delinquency ratios in SMEs portfolio after the raise seen in the first half of 2009 due to the financial crisis is having consistent improvement due to the refinement in conditions for new operations with the use of mitigators as FGO and the prioritization of transactions backed by receivables.</p>
          <p>Slide number 15, the information in this slide &#x2013; it is confirming Banco do Brasil's position as the largest partner to the Brazil lines of businesses with a 60.5% market share. Indeed, the highlight from the second quarter was the growth of marketing operation up 37% from March due to seasonal reasons. Through the rest of the year, we'd expect with the beginning of the next crop, a growth more concentrating in working capital line to finance our crop inputs.</p>
          <p>Slide number 16, complement the information from the slide 15. We observe the increasing use of rural insurance, 61% from the crop operations from 2009-2010 crop were contracted with rural insurance, while 2007-2008 crop only 50% were insured.</p>
          <p>On the bottom of this slide, we have for the first time a chart with the amounts and the percentile of risk mitigators to main Brazilian cultures &#x2013; I mean grain cultures. We have highlighted cost of risk of wheat and soybeans, which had respectively 88.6% and 83.3% of the operation insured.</p>
          <p>On the slide 17, we have the comparison between the levels of risks from Banco do Brasil and the banking industry. And as we can see, the percentage of operation AA-C risk from Banco do Brasil increased in the past 12 months and in June 2010, 92.5%. Besides that the concentration of the operation AA-C risk is higher than in the bank industry.</p>
          <p>Slide number 18, the graph on this slide shows that the strategy adopted by Banco do Brasil in focusing its operation to low risk line is being successful. The delinquency ratios to individuals business have a declined trend for the past 12 months in lower level than the bank industry.</p>
          <p>On the slide 19, we highlighted delinquency ratios to the agribusiness portfolio is the breakdown to rolled over and non-rolled over operations. It is worth to highlight that despite of being rolled over or non-rolled over operations, the delinquency ratios are in better levels than in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Thus, out of the delinquency of the total agribook had an improvement ending the first half 2010 with a ratio below the presented &#x2013; in the first half 2009. I would draw your attention to the coverage level of past due loans over 90 days in provision. 456% of coverage to rolled-over operation that are delinquent are more than 90 days.</p>
          <p>The slide number 20, and in here the information are related to credit risk. We can observe, although our delinquency is in lower levels than the bank industry, our percentage of write-offs in comparison to average portfolios lower than the average of our peers and now cover our write-offs ratios higher. We kept our coverage ratio of due loans over 90 days above the bank industry.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, three events led the reduction on the balance &#x2013; on the spending additional loans for loan losses. Due to the improvement in the quality of the agribusiness portfolio, an amount of R$332 million and was reversed. The reversal is being considered as of one-off item in the quarter so it is not considered in our recurring net income.</p>
          <p>The other events are related to additional allowance balance reclassifications to required allowance of loans from Banco Nossa Caixa and retail loans amounting less than R$50,000. These events didn't impact the result of the peers. Prove that this movement is only a reclassification and the fact that in comparison between June and March a rise can be seen in the coverage of loans that's due over 90 days as well as the coverage of loans classified as six to eight weeks required provision.</p>
          <p>In slide number 21, we can see the contribution of non-interest bearing businesses, fees and insurance to the results that increases share in 160 basis points in the second quarter over the previous quarter, being almost a third part of the total commercial revenues.</p>
          <p>Slide number 22, we have the administrative expenses with the first quarter 2009 adjusted with expenses from Banco Nossa Caixa and Banco Votorantim so, it is pro forma. Considering the half yearly comparison the admin expenses grew 9.1% below the guidance in line with our business growth, reaffirming the vigor of Banco do Brasil in expenses management.</p>
          <p>On slide number 23, we can see that the increased admin expenses below the project debt brought improvements to the productive ratios, especially regarding fee income to personnel expenses ratios.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide number 24, we can observe that Banco do Brasil has consistent growth in the card markets, credit card and debit card, keeping its market share above 20% in terms of turnover.</p>
          <p>Looking for synergy gains between common business Banco do Brasil, Bradesco are working in establishment of holding through the launching of Elo brands, which focus will be the lower income customers, which still represent a low share in the credit card markets with low penetration.</p>
          <p>Aiming at increasing the credit card use among those clients recently, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco and Caixa Economica Federal signed an LLU in order to include Caixa Econ&#xF4;mica Federal in the Elo operation and we have increased the distribution, ability and the access of new customers through the deal.</p>
          <p>The slide number 25 brings us the share of the insurance business in the Brazil Stock Banco do Brasil. It is worth to remind you that recently, we restructured our insurance area, including the reorganization in all of our affiliated companies, aiming at increasing our market share to allow the selling of insurance companies' products in alternative channels with automated solutions and launching product through specific niches. The reorganization increased Banco do Brasil's shares of the insurance companies, which standalone add results to Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Slide number 26, we have a before and after comparison for Banco Nossa Caixa acquisition. The acquisition of Banco Nossa Caixa, besides the information that we have in this slide, improved the businesses of the bank and the reduced the net trend default 98% mainly in credit card business and increased the use of ATM in 114%. The fact that 100% of the branches are fully integrated allowing Banco do Brasil to have the largest distribution network in the state of S&#xE3;o Paulo, 1,391 branches.</p>
          <p>Slide number 27, brings us some information of Banco Votorantim. We've highlighted the fact that the volume of this operation increased as the partnerships signed with Banco do Brasil in September last year, especially the growth of its market share in auto loans originations.</p>
          <p>Another highlight is the fact that even with the growth of the origination, the delinquency of Banco Votorantim has, the total passport volume in has a declining trend since the beginning of the partnership with Banco Votorantim.</p>
          <p>Slide 28, we have the summary of the book offering of shares, and in June 2010, which amount R$9.8 billion range.</p>
          <p>At the end of the offering, Banco do Brasil free float came to 30.4%, surpassing the new requirement by Novo Mercado rules, a special segment in Bovespa. Besides that our shareholders base increased 22% in the number of shareholders following 420,000 new &#x2013; sorry not new, but outstanding shareholders base. Actually, we increased our shareholders base in more than 78,000 new shareholders.</p>
          <p>The slide number 29, in addition to the increase in the number of shareholders and the adequacy of the free float to Novo Mercado, the offer ended in June also improved our BIS ratio as shown slide 29, raising our growth strategy. Actually, we have a pro forma number here, after the offering our BIS ratio in July would be at 14.3%, 10.3% Tier 1, 4.1% Tier 2.</p>
          <p>Slide number 30, you have our guidance to conclude our presentation. As you can see here, initially that we have reviewed our estimates to our loan losses over the total portfolio in average due to the improvement in the quality of our loan book.</p>
          <p>Previously, it was at 4.4 to 4.8. Now we have four to 4.4%. Regarding spreads, our expectation is a recovery in second half of 2010 motivated by the gain of share in individual operation that will be &#x2013; that's our assumption will be within the guidance 27 to 32% growth for individuals book. The total deposits were below our estimates due to seasonal reasons, but the expectation is a large liquidity in economy in second half 2010 which will allow us strong growth &#x2013; a better growth in the broad space.</p>
          <p>Well, those were the subject that we would like to highlight. We can now move to Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Carlos Macedo of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Gilberto. Good morning, all. I have one question with two parts; it basically comes to margin and your recent &#x2013; you just said that you expect margins to go up as you go through the year. And I just go back to the loan portfolio for you guys, if you take away the loan purchases that you made, your quarter-on-quarter growth in loans individuals was only 3.7%, which was weaker than other banks. And on the other hand, there was a very strong increase in loans to companies in agro loans, particularly agro loans to company that grew 30% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>I just want to understand, if could give us some a little bit of more color on &#x2013; I know you have the guidance on whether you expect to continue loan purchases on the individual book and how do you expect this corporate book to continue to behave going forward. Is the strong growth that we saw in the second quarter something that you expect to be sustained in the second half, particularly in the agro book, because you really hadn't grown 30% quarter-on-quarter to companies in agro books since 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Macedo. Actually the growth that you have in this quarter, it was more concentrating two companies in agribusiness. In agribusiness, actually it's a seasonal effect, because we have concentration of marketing seasons in that period. Okay. That's why you have &#x2013; if you take the breakdown of credit portfolio of the agribusiness, you can see that those loans went to marketing that grew the most, 37%.</p>
          <p>There is no working capital line related to influence financing, because the new crops contract will be in place in the third quarter and also in the fourth quarter. So, in the second part of the year, in agribusiness, we have more in the business operation because of the new crops, of course with higher margin also because in individuals we can have more colonization and so on. But you do have the colonization this quarter also in agribusiness, but and you have recovery in the margins, but as you can see our margin, agribusiness is below the average.</p>
          <p>So, as long as you have growth in that portfolio, it put negative pressure in our margin. It's the same case of companies, because as you can see, we have dropped in margin in two companies, because the growth that we got in company's business was more concentrating in medium and large companies, working capital lines in investment, and why, because companies prepared for demand that it going to have in the second part of the year because of the increasing consumption.</p>
          <p>So that's why our assumption is to see more growth for individuals <mark type="inaudible" /> expect to see those season of Christmas, Student Days and so on more consumption and more use for credit in individuals, that's why we're going to keep our guidance for individuals. And because of this &#x2013; on the back of this, we are going to see a recovery in margin in Banco do Brasil, because the net interest margin in credit to individuals is quite above the average spread, average of 17.4%, and the spread of Banco do Brasil, 6.4 at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Of course, we still have room to increase the benefit in our asset side, because the average spreads for credit portfolio as a whole is 9.7% and other earning assets amount 3.3%. So, as long as we increase even more credit portfolio in assets side, we can do increase productive in assets and maintain and defend our spread.</p>
          <p>Sorry, of course, as Walter reminded that we take part in some M&amp;A in granting bridge loans that bring some pressure on our margins. I must say to bear in mind that. At the end of the day, if you analyze our net interest margin after provision, it brings us very good numbers, because that's a provision we got to recovered, we got the reduction that we had in the provision charge, because we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just so, again maybe back to the loans to individuals, 2.5 billion in purchases in the second quarter, two questions in that. Are you going to continue that and is the spread that you get on those loans similar to the remainder of your portfolio of loans individuals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course not, because you have to share revenues with the bank when we are buying the portfolio. And the answer is yes, we are going to continue to buy portfolio mainly in car financing business, but also in payroll loans business, okay. But if you compare to the total book, the outspend balance was 3.5 for payroll loans and R$3 billion for car financing compared to the total book that you have for individuals more than R$100 billion. It's lower level, but again we are going to do buy portfolio from smaller business.</p>
          <p>But I don't know if it is enough to affect our margin, what has affected the most it is the affect that you're going to have changing mix in the total book towards those operation like payroll loans that it is originating within Banco do Brasil, car financing in Banco Votorantim and also a gradual increase in mortgage business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect, thank you, Gueitiro.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Gilberto. My question is on capital. You go to page 29 of your presentation, you provided us with the pro forma capital ratios, given the fact of the recent offerings and you are now at 10.3% Tier 1 ratio, 14.3% all includes the BIS ratio.</p>
          <p>If I recall correctly, you have guided prior to the offering, you are trying to get your ratios up to about the 11% level for Tier 1 and 15% level for BIS ratio. I think that was during the time where you can still count your excess reserve for additional capital, which you no longer can, given the change in regulation. So, with the current capital and the current rules, how much &#x2013; how long can you go in terms of your organic growth and your potential acquisition without needed to come to the market again for more capital?</p>
          <p>Taking there that you have a leverage potential of R$143 billion, your loan portfolio is about 350 billion, so that would indicate that you can do a couple of years of 20%-plus type of loan. But you also have the acquisitions and you recently announced something, in Africa, you have a venture in Argentina and potential other things. So, is it fair to say &#x2013; to think that &#x2013; within the two years' timeframe probably less you are going to need to come back to the market again for more capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have those number pro forma as in &#x2013; of course 14.2% that would better have more than 15%, but we still have growth in the second quarter, core concentrating from that demand, 100% in risk-weighted terms. So we &#x2013; that caused some harm now in our capital base. If you concentrate your growth in companies, then you have to weigh your assets in 100% while in the retail business, they weigh about 75%. That's one point that you bear in mind, okay. So considering the fact that we have intentions to reach &#x2013; grow more in retail in this year, probably we're going to have less pressure in capital moving forward in 2010 compared to that we had in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>So, secondly the fact that we raised our Tier 1 capital from 8.8 to 10.3% is, we have allowed Banco do Brasil to raise also Tier 2 capital. So, the level of Tier 2 capital Banco do Brasil in my assumption just considering the current regulation that we have in Brazil, okay.</p>
          <p>We have only 12.1%. So we can reach 100% of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 split in subordinate debt and hybrid instrument, okay. So I made the accumulation if by any chance we have all &#x2013; fully use Tier 2 capital. The BIS ratio of Banco do Brasil, considering two regulations that we have in Brazil, would go to 18.77%, okay. And at the end of December 2012, considering the expectation that we have for credit growth, until then &#x2013; and considering the stress for market risks, the BIS ratio of Banco do Brasil would go to 15.2%.</p>
          <p>So, before I think about going again in the market and raise capital through a primary offering, we can use &#x2013; you can have other instruments to face our needs of capital, to face our needs of growth because of this strategy that we intend to put in place in growing organically and the acquisition that's not a big deal. There is no big acquisition compared that we had last year and also <mark type="inaudible" /> those acquisition that we announced in Argentina and the problem &#x2013; there might be movement that we intend to do in Africa, small operation, so no pressure at all in terms of capital. But consider all facts together, we are pretty confident because the Argentina deal that we have to face our capital needs, okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gilberto. If I can make sure I understood you correctly, given the potential additional use of Tier 2 under the acquisitions that you have done outside Brazil, you're going to keep it small what you are saying is that you don't foresee any need for any additional primary offering at least for the next three years or so. Is that correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Doing the math, okay, of course, we can take advantage from opportunity. But doing the math, considering the number that you have and the regulation that we have in Brazil, we can have &#x2013; we can have increase in our Q2 capital that would allow Banco do Brasil to reach 15% &#x2013; over 15% at the end of 2012, okay.</p>

          <p>As a quick follow-up, Gilberto, maybe early day for you to give us a specific range, but can you give us any range in terms of the possible size that this investment in Africa could imply for a probable capital consumption?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>The capital consumption, I'm talking about less than R$1 billion in property investment, less than that 600 million maximum, okay. So, no significant &#x2013; less than &#x2013; around 10 bps impact in our capital base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. My question is a follow-up on Daniel's question on the BIS ratio. You still have about R$9 billion in surplus at Brazil yet to be recognized in the results. Would you consider maybe accelerating the recognition of that R$9 billon because this will probably help your Tier 1 capital base going forward? And if so, what is the timeframe for you to recognize that 9 billion? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's so &#x2013; very volatile. The only the revenue that it can proceed is those related to update that went to Banco do Brasil this year. Only this year we are considering the simulation. For 2011-2012, there is no revenues considered in those calculation, the simulation that you've made regarding BIS ratio. I mean, the revenues relate to Previ, okay. Because the big part of Previ is more relate to reassessment of assets that's very volatile. There is no sense to consider in our projection.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for this year, I mean, what is the amount that you are considering, let's say, in your budget in terms of recognizing the amortization of the surplus, I'm not talking about the accrual of the surplus, just the amortization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The amortization of the asset that we have in our balance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The amortization of the surplus that you have at Previ, for instance, in the first half was R$390 million, right, and how much you're considering for the second half of the year could we expect some extra gains on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That probably depends on the whole year. So you had R$1.8 billion accounted, okay. So we're probably going to have again &#x2013; 1.8 again, okay. Small part to the third quarter, probably close to R$600 million before taxes. In the fourth quarter, a little bit more because we have the reassessment of the total assets. So for the whole year, something close 3 billion &#x2013; 3 billion something in revenues before taxes come from Previ.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up. I mean in case &#x2013; I mean, now you are evaluating the Previ portfolio on a semi-annual basis, right. In case there is an upward revision in the surplus at the end of the year, would you consider increasing the &#x2013; that to recognize higher proportion of that for higher surplus or you think that you're going to stick to that number despite a potential increase in the surplus at Previ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to &#x2013; there is impairs enough, okay. We have to recognize the amount that it is considered for 2010. We have to divide by the tariff of the plan &#x2013; of the surplus in average, seven years, six years. So you have to divide and you have to recognize the revenues related to 2010, so, it depends on the amount of the surplus at the end of the year. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to give an idea, we have a reduction close to R$9.5 billion from December to June of those gains that are out of balance sheets, okay. From June 30 until August 16, we have a recovery of R$6.5 billion, considering the stock price that we have in the market. So, when we got &#x2013; when we get December, we have to re-evaluate, we have to reassess the assets and to account the revenues because of this reassessment. So because of this revenue after-taxes and after fix them we're going to have those revenues accounted in our shareholders' equity and increasing our capital base. That's the point, okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. How are you guys? A follow-up again on capital. In the past, you have talked about not feeling comfortable if your Tier 1 capital falls below 9%, is that still the case that 9% is sort of a line in the sand where you wouldn't want your tier-1 capital to fall below.</p>
          <p>And secondly, all of these assumptions we're making are based on the assumption that capital rules in Brazil are &#x2013; don't change. Do you guys feel that there are any changes in the capital rules that could happen say in the next 12 to 24 months that could either help or hurt your capitalization ratio?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Hold on a second. <mark type="inaudible" /> I got Mr. Alexandre from the Risk department that he is going to help us in response to your question, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mr. Martinez, it's Alexandre speaking. I'd like to make some comments about Basel III. I suppose that your concern is about this. The first point that prudential regulation is an ongoing discussion, it's not totally closed. And it's one important topic that we had to consider. The talks on discussion, we achieved all the banks in the market, so the fact that the new regulation affects all the banks. The other point that's important and you mentioned is Central Bank is in the discussion process with the industry about how they are going to introduce this rules in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So, what I say to you that here in Banco do Brasil, we have a very consistent capital planning process through &#x2013; that considers and that take into account this kind of change. So in our point of view, this new regulation and you are correct about your concerns, really affected the whole market, especially considering that Banco do Brasil and the other banks that compound our peers, has assets that we will deduct.</p>
          <p>One point that's important to say, considering the new regulation, is related to the preference shares that Banco do Brasil doesn't has and our &#x2013; the other banks and our peer has, it should be a point that we will support Banco do Brasil to sustain our strategy. So, we had made some early simulations to consider that this impacts, but in our point of view, it's early to define the real impact of this change in our BIS ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add, we had to face &#x2013; we have to face the regulation that is in force in Brazil nowadays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do have 14.3% as pro forma number in BIS ratio, but again, room to increase Tier 2 capital. I'm not saying that we're going to go to market and raise any kind of debt to reinforce our capital base. What I'm trying to say that we have alternative to face our capital needs for 2010, 2011, 2012 considering the fact that risk increased with offer, the Tier 1 capital. That will allow Banco do Brasil to increase Tier 2 also. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. Now I understand, but a couple of follow-ups. One is, do you still feel comfortable if you have to fall in below 9% Tier 1? And secondly, just a follow-up to the earlier comment, are you &#x2013; do you feel &#x2013; are you concerned at all that there could be any changes coming that would not allow you to include goodwill and intangibles in your capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We are comfortable with the level of capital that you have after the offering, Tier 1 and Tier 2. Okay. Now you've got 10.3% and we had 9.5 with 13.7%, but as we know &#x2013; as we try &#x2013; try to explain that, if by any chance we increase the Tier 2 capital, we're going to see reduction for proportionally in the Tier 1 in terms of the compounding of the BIS ratios.</p>
          <p>So, in Brazil, we can have 50:50, of course we've been &#x2013; the Tier 2 capital 50% of subordinated debt and 50% of hybrid instruments. So at the end of the day, I'm not telling that we're going to have it, but we can have 5.5 and 5.5, 5.5 Tier 1 and 5.5 Tier 2. Half of those 5.5 in Tier 2 subordinated debt and another half hybrid instrument.</p>
          <p>So, of course, the guidance that we have through the market in terms of BIS ratio is considered as a whole and the guidance is to have the minimum of 13%. That's the minimum we're considering for Banco do Brasil, we consider Tier 1 and Tier 2 consider the fact that we have opportunity to increase even Tier 2. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second question on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That potential deduction of goodwill, Alexandre can comment on it. Alexandre, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, as I said before, we have established consistent capital planning process. When we take into account in our stimulations, the new talks on the recent regulation, it's not totally closed even by BIS. They have issued some papers, constituting papers, and what we are doing now is making some simulations to have a clear position how does it impact BB. You are correct in your concern about this, but it's one impact that will affect all the banks, not only Banco do Brasil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. That's fair enough. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mario Pierry of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Let me ask you two questions then. One is a follow-up to the question on Previ. As you stated, you think this Previ gains can total about R$3 billion this year, what is your expectations for next year?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is related to your excess reserves or the reserves above the minimum required by the Central Bank. I understand quite correctly that they fell by about R$500 million due to a reclassification of loans in Nossa Caixa. Can you tell us if you expect anymore reclassifications in Nossa Caixa?</p>
          <p>Also about a 300 million drop in your excess reserves was related to this reversal in allowances for the agricultural portfolio. So, now you have about R$1.8 billion in excess reserves, should we also expect a further reversal of provisions or do you feel comfortable with the 1.8 billion if you're comfortable maintaining this level of excess reserves on your balance sheet? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mario. I'm going to answer the Previ issue and then we're going pass through to Mr. Walter Malieni, okay, the Credit Director. So my expectation for 2010, the first half 2010, we have per quarter &#x2013; R$720 million per quarter. Okay? Consider the fact that we got a reduction in the surplus from 57 to R$47 billion, the revenues that come from activating will be reduced the expectations to see those revenues reducing to R$600 million. So, in the third quarter instead of having R$700 million, we're going to have something close to R$600 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In fourth quarter, we're going to have other R$600 million, but then fourth quarter is the time that we have to reassess considering the commitment that you have to reassess the assets and the liability annually, okay.</p>
          <p>So in the fourth quarter, considering the number that we have nowadays &#x2013; today, okay, we would have accounted instead of &#x2013; instead of accounting close to R$300 million that we accounted at the end of June, because of reassessment, we would accounted at that time considering the price nowadays, R$1.2 million or R$1.3 million. So, we account more R$800 million.</p>
          <p>So in the fourth quarter probably, we're going to have again reassessment bringing in the revenues for Banco do Brasil. I am talking about pre-tax revenues, okay? So if I can give you an expectation in terms of our revenue, probably we're going to have again R$1.8 billion for the whole semester. We had R$1.8 billion in the first half 2010, and again probably going to have 1.8 close to R$2 billion in the second part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For 2011...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But again, that to the third quarter and more in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But for 2011, what are your expectations? Also when you say, the assets &#x2013; the value the assets and liabilities, are you marking to market all of your holdings, because my understanding was, I think some of your Vale ownership was not mark-to-market, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Now we are mark-to-market all the holdings that we hasn't. Okay. CVRD, Banco do Brasil, Banco Itau, the holdings that Previ has in its assets. Petrobras that was very depressed price because of the overhang of the offerings. So, we &#x2013; what we're trying to tell you, we have a drop of R$9.5 billion from December to June 2010. From June 2010 to August 16, we have an increase of R$6.5 billion, okay. So, the accounting that we made in June 2010, considered the drop of R$9.5 billion in asset value of Previ.</p>
          <p>So, we are going to have recovered, but again that's the market approach. That is very high to anticipate. It is easier for you to anticipate than us. But the fact is at the end of the year we have to reassess and if by any chance we got recovered that very good possibility to do so. We're going to have again revenues because of reassessments. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay that's clear.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, just for a second to let it clear, so the value that impact the results of the Bank was the reversal related to Agribusiness R$332 million, okay. The other reversion R$500 million was related to migration from additional provision to required provision, okay. So we have improvement even in the coverage of the required provision over 90 days overdue. So no changing &#x2013; no &#x2013; from those R$500 million, that is nothing passing our P&amp;L, okay.</p>
          <p>As Walter Malieni said, there is no expectations to see any other reversal from the additional provision because the change in methodology or because of integration of spread portfolio not for cash, that is because the bulk of it is now integrated. And in other reason reduce additional provision. So the idea is to maintain the level of additional provision at 1.7, R$1.8 billion, okay, to face stress and credit risk because of prices, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so just to be clear then, you do not expect any more reclassifications on long-term of loans from Nossa Caixa.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I just have two questions. The first one is related the Agri book, I noticed that the equalization revenues reached the record amount this quarter above R$600 million. Also I know that Banco do Brasil usually negotiates with treasury, the terms of equalization contracts for the coming 12 months. So could you give us some color about the evolution of these negotiations and the expected recurring level of equalization for the coming four quarters?</p>
          <p>And the second question I noticed that the cost behavior in this quarter was affected by the reversal of provisions for civil claims at Nossa Caixa. I also noticed that you did not include labor and civil claims in your guidance for expenses, and your guidance is about 10 to 12% in terms of growth year-on-year in the operating expenses. So if you add those claims would be reasonable to expect this growth to surpass this 12% level. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jorg. Beginning by the end, regarding the civil claims provision, it's hard to project even for us, okay. If you take a wide &#x2013; widen our figures, you're going to see that &#x2013; what &#x2013; we see the most is to see the level both labor claims and civil claims around R$250 million per quarter. That's the number that we use in our projection. This quarter we got R$239 million, okay, for civil claims and labor claims.</p>
          <p>Regarding those claims relate to those economic plans, the expectations to see per quarter 60, R$80 million. So, if you add any &#x2013; all kind of civil, labor claims, consider our economic plans also, we're going to have something &#x2013; surpass a little bit R$300 million per quarter. That's the regular numbers than we expect to have in our P&amp;L. Okay? Sometimes you got higher, sometimes you got less level of those expenses. So &#x2013; but again it's hard to project.</p>
          <p>But if you take wider figures we are going to see that 250 something a very frequent in a quarter over time. Talking about the equalization revenues, we do have more revenues in this quarter because we have more loans in equalization using equalization &#x2013; equalizable resource for marketing and for cost also. So if you take a look in the table number 48 that we have been our MD&amp;A, those loans relate to equalizable. I don't know the word is that, okay? Sorry for that. Equalizable resource, those loans had a growth of 9% over March and 23.8% over June last year.</p>
          <p>More concentrated in marketing those loans relates to marketing season. We &#x2013; they have a growth of 38%, more than 200% over June last year. So that's rent month to review those &#x2013; the level of revenue that we got in the second quarter 2010. For next crop, we expect to see again the level that we are seeing in the previous crop around 400, R$500 million third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we can expect about 1.8 to R$2 billion in the next 12 months coming from equalization revenues, is that reasonable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes that's reasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for the clarification, Gilberto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Considering &#x2013; consider also those cash &#x2013; the value that we're considering the &#x2013; what is the number of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the name in English?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Weighting factor, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Weighting factor, yes. The weighting factor, we have full of course lower level, but we're talking about 400 to 500 considering the cash revenues and the weighting factors, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a follow-up, if you allow me as you, Gilberto. In terms of the &#x2013; how the contracts are set up, I understand that every year, you take into consideration the prior 12 months to have an idea about the assumptions that will reflect the negotiation of the equalization revenues in the upcoming 12 months.</p>
          <p>So given the evolution of asset quality in the Agribusiness book, which was pretty good this last year, would you attribute any risk for those estimates that you just gave me in case Agribusiness sales are little bit more volatility or are you comfortable also with regards of the insurance linked to the Agribusiness book at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the guidance that we're trying to give you in terms of equalization revenue, bear in mind that before the crisis 2005-2006 crop even 2006-2007 crop, the levels equalization revenue of course, I'm talking about the lower level credit portfolio are used to be a R$500 million per year crop. Okay. And after the crisis it increased to 1.5, 1.8, R$2 billion per year crop.</p>
          <p>So that have been affected by the risk deterioration that we got since then, since the drop that you have in 2006-2005, 2005 and 2006 crop and also the price problem and the FX problem that you have in 2007 crop. So that it is affected by that in terms of risk and we are taking to consideration the losses that you have in the past, because the loss that we consider in calculation of equalization revenues, it is considering four to five years in the past.</p>
          <p>So considered the fact that we are in the four to five years, we have rolled over operation with higher yield. It is affecting the calculation that we have. But we are seeing gradual improvement in the risk demanding in terms of expenses for provision. And of course we &#x2013; as the consequence, we're going to see improvement in profitability of the Agribusiness portfolio, considering the fact you got to maintain our equalization revenue with improvement of credit risk.</p>
          <p>So that's the mismatching time that we have in this sector, Jorg, because we have &#x2013; we increase the equalization revenue to compensate the problem that we have in the past. So, we have a kind of compensation over time. Okay. So, they can look in three to four years. We can have all kind of expense that we have in terms of provision and with revenues and recoveries that is still matching. Okay. Because it is matching time that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now that's perfect. Just to understand, how safe you were in terms of this projections and it seems that it's very secure to assume that you're going to have about R$2 billion in term of equalization revenue in the next year or so now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because we already have set the &#x2013; we have agreement with the government with the new crops. So it is well established. The price those 400 to R500 million, it is established. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Victor Galliano of HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My questions have been pretty much answered, but if can follow up. Firstly on the capital side of things, I remember in the past in conversations not with you, Gilberto, but with other members of the team, talking about capital calculation, and how you currently assess credit risk on a Basel I basis. And how this is likely to shift to Basel II by year end 2010, which will be a kind of apples-to-apples comparison with the private sector banks.</p>
          <p>Now is this still something that is likely to happen and what are the potential implications for your capital ratio on that basis? As I understood before it was suggested to me that this could lead to a little bit of a liberalization of capital given that you have some relatively low-risk weighting assets within that and some of the credits within the loan portfolio like, for example, the consignable portfolio. So firstly your comments on that and then I'll ask you question on credit quality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Galliano. Wait, I'm going to ask Mr. Alexandre to help me up to answer this question. He is asking about the change of regulation regarding the advance approach in Basel II or if we are using the base approach mainly to consider the difference that we had in our assets regarding credit portfolios, retail portfolios used some different weight for instance in credit consignable, payroll loans different another kind of loan that you have, so you are going to <mark type="inaudible" />. So those data we have regarding Basel nowadays in the regulation. Could you hold on a second, Victor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry. Could you hold on a second please? Could you hold on a sec ma'am? I'm trying to answer the Victor question, okay. Hold on a second. If you please Mr. Alexandre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Victor it's Alexandre Aoude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nowadays, we have in course in Brazil, Basel II but in the first stat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we don't see there in its regulation due to differentiations about the risk, so I have, for example, to retell stories, I would say, in fact all of them consider one risk weighted assets 75%. And Basel II approach considering the IRB approach using own methodologies. Secondly we have &#x2013; we are able to considering a best way. The risk that we have relating to the counter party and the exposure that we have, you mentioned payrolls and consignable, certainly we have different capital charge for this exposure where as on the other hand we had to thinking about the old movements that is in course related to all the regulations. It's probable &#x2013; it's likely we have a revision of the standard approach for all the markets, BIS is discussion this in the first step described to the market risk and created increase capital for the standard approach, and how do you &#x2013; how do we view this situation? Probably in IRB invest approach, I have more capital than I have today in terms of charge of capital, but less that we will have when the standard approach we will revise it. Is it clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so, but maybe we need to take this offline later on. We probably need to have a conversation. I think that's probably the best thing, but what I think you're getting at is you're not on a comparable apples-to-apples basis with the other private banks right now, but the rules will change, and so on that basis, it is kind of your &#x2013; you're trying to hit a moving target effectively. Is that.....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Victor, first of all, we are following the rules that all banks in Brazil have to face. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the change that we had in the past regarding credit risk was that they changing in weighting, okay for those loans up to 200 &#x2013; R$200,000 that are considered retail loans that demanding &#x2013; that demand 75% weighting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That was a change that we had in 2008, I believe or 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2008. So that's for all banks there is no difference the way Banco do Brasil assess, evaluate its assets for BIS purpose when compared to other banks' criteria. It's the same case, okay. Only for &#x2013; from 2012 on that we are going to have some changes in that regards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By using internal modeled approach. Okay. But for now that we have in Brazil, it is the basic approach not only for credit risk, but also for operational risk and market risk. Okay. In case of market risk, the deal was they stress were for 2012, the first half of 2012, that again the demand R$1.5 billion capital from Banco do Brasil. That's only change that we have, okay for all banks. Okay, Victor? But again, we can set a meeting for you if you want to go deep in that issue, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, yeah we will talk offline on this thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly on Agribusiness credit quality, I mean, what &#x2013; just a comment from you in terms of the farm economics outlook. How do you perceive the farm economics outlook? Do you see it as positive at this point? What are the potential risks here on credit quality in farm economics insurance aside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of weather, that's quite good. There is no setback in terms of weather. Okay. Actually you are going to see an increase in production 2009-2010 crops, compared to last year of 7%. The increase in crop in production Brazil, in terms they are facing hard time in terms of price, but on the other hand they got a very good momentum in terms of cost of input. Okay. They are in a lower level. If you should take soybeans, the average margin, the average base EBITDA for soybean is about 30%, and corn, it is around 25%.</p>
          <p>So they are &#x2013; if you compare to previous crop, it is worse, but they can face that time, because the production size of the inputs, okay. For next year, the expectation is good. Crop &#x2013; for next year crop, we're going to have drought, because the La Ni&#xF1;a phenomenon. But again drought is not a big deal for Banco do Brasil, because as we saw, we have more than 80% insured that will be the case next year in terms of soybean or next crop in terms of soybean, in terms of corn, in terms of wheat. So for those not permanent crop, I mean, they &#x2013; with few demand insurance, so drought, we're going to got the &#x2013; we're going to get the only positive effect from drought, that's the affecting price, okay.</p>

So he &#x2013; are you having problem in line, Denilson? He's asking about the Elo strategy regarding non-account holders and are you a part on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the strategy with Elo means that we will issue for non-account holders through Bank of Elo &#x2013; Elo Bank. Right? And Banco do Brasil and Bradesco and now Caixa Econ&#xF4;mica Federal new give, issue cards to the account holders. And Elo banner will serve like a Visa and MasterCard, Amex to these banks today. So the relation between the Elo banner and Elo issuers will be the same scheme that we have here in Brazil. Of course some kind of interchange fees will be negotiated through managers through these three partners as sub-holders of Elo banner. But the relationship with the Banco do Brasil as an issuer and Elo banner will be under a contract like the other vendors. I don't know if the question is answered or not.</p>
