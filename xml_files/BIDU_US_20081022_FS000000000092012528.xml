          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to Baidu's Third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. We've distributed Baidu's third quarter 2008 earnings release earlier today. You may find a copy of the press release on the company's website, as well as on newswire services. Today, you will hear from Robin Li, Baidu's Chief Executive Officer, and Jennifer Li, Baidu's Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, Robin and Jennifer will be joined by Peng Ye, Baidu's Chief Operating Officer, and Haoyu Shen, Baidu's Vice President of Business Operations to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we continue, please note that the discussion today will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Baidu does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required under applicable law. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. In addition, a web cast of this conference call will be available on Baidu's Company website at ir.baidu.com</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Baidu's CEO, Robin Li.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. I know there might be clouds somewhere in the US or elsewhere but it's a beautiful, beautiful morning here in Beijing. So, again, welcome to our third quarter conference call.</p>
          <p>As may have seen from our press release issued earlier today, we had a solid quarter. In the midst of global market turmoil, we generated healthy revenue growth and more notefully, improved profitability. Once again, our operating profit grows faster than revenue over the corresponding period form the previous year, showing the scalability of our business.</p>
          <p>Even though global markets are going through a hard time, I like to point out China is still a growth market and we believe the Internet industry still has tremendous long-term growth potential. Baidu has diverse customer base. Companies large and small increasingly appreciate the benefit of our platform.</p>
          <p>Working closely with customers from so many different industries and from so many regions of China, we meet the varied and complex needs of almost every sector. We leverage this knowledge to deepen our penetration in the market and our diverse customer base provides a strong foundation for future growth.</p>
          <p>We maintain our focus on providing the best possible products to our growing user base. As a core of search, we emphasize a long-term focus and we continue to invest in and improve our output and tools for customers. We believe our platform is more targeted, more measurable, more effective and more cost efficient than many other means of advertising.</p>
          <p>Baidu is well positioned in China's Internet landscape and we remain confident in our future growth prospects. This quarter, we made two important additions to our executive management team, bringing on board Yinan Li, Baidu's Chief Technology Officer and Toshikazu Inoue, as President of Baidu Japan. Mr. Li took on the role of CTO just this month, bringing 16 years of technology management experience to Baidu. In the past, Mr. Li has led large technology teams and has been at the helm of many new products and technologies that saw successful reception in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Mr. Inoue is a recognized pioneer in the Japanese search market. Before joining us in July, Mr. Inoue successfully served as Vice-President of Yahoo! Japan's search engine and CTO of Excite Japan. We are confident that Baidu Japan will benefit greatly from his leadership. We make it a priority to assemble the best possible leadership team and I'm excited to welcome both aboard and look forward to working with them.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, Beijing hosted the Olympic Games. An event of this scale and popularity was a powerful driver for products, services and infrastructure of the internet in China. As China's largest search engine, we created improved functions for Olympics specific keyword search. When users searched for an Olympic athlete or an event on Baidu, the first hit was a link to bundled information on competition times, results, medal count and other Olympic updates. Our improvements were well received by our users.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we continued to make improvements in sales operations. Both our transition to direct sales and the consolidation of sales centers have allowed for higher efficiency. We will continue our efforts on efficiency and productivity, as there is still more room for improvement.</p>
          <p>Staying ahead of the development curve by listening to our users and developing products that address real needs is at the core of Baidu's success. Last week, we launched the beta version of our C2C platform, which complements paid search and enables transaction fulfillment among our users.</p>
          <p>E-commerce is emerging in China and people are becoming more comfortable with shopping online. As China's largest search engine, we have superior technological capabilities and a deep understanding of user needs. We see E-commerce as a great opportunity because of the synergies with search. Our enormous user base also gives us a strong and unique competitive edge in E-commerce.</p>
          <p>Another development this quarter was our partnership with UiTV. The transaction transfers operations of Baidu's Internet TV channel to UiTV. Baidu Internet TV is unrelated to our video search business, which is on our web &#x2013; home page.</p>
          <p>We view this cooperation as a win-win for both parties involved. Baidu is able to continue to focus on our core competency in search and UiTV their specialty content platform operation. Together, we will utilize our respective strengths to deliver a better online experience for users. We expect the deal to close in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Both of these recent developments reflect Baidu's focus on our core competency in search to fill user and customer needs in an ever evolving Chinese Internet market.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Jennifer Li to take our &#x2013; to take you through the financial highlights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin and hello everybody. As you have just heard, it's been a solid quarter for Baidu. Now I'd like to highlight a few areas of financials with more detailed explanations. This quarter we generated total revenues of RMB919 million amid the expected changes in user behavior and user spending during the Olympic Games. Our results were up 85% from the year ago period. We increased our number of active online customers by approximately 36% year-over-year, an increase in revenue per active online customer -- marketing customer by 34% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Overall, we have continued to see improved profitability this quarter. Specifically, adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure was RMB457 million for the third quarter, a 105% increase from the year ago period. And operating profit was RMB368 million, a 119% increase over the corresponding period in '07.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition costs, a component of cost of revenue in the third quarter, were RMB109 million, or 12% of total revenue, a small decrease from Q2, '08 primarily reflecting our review and update of business relationships with some union members.</p>
          <p>Cost of revenue, excluding TAC, were RMB201 million, representing 22% of total revenue, compared to 24% in the corresponding period of '07. The decrease is mainly due to decreases in bandwidth and depreciation cost as a percent of revenue, reflecting improved usage of infrastructure.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the Olympic period, we delayed equipment purchases, resulting in lower depreciation for the quarter. Cost of revenue, excluding TAC before, share-based compensation were RMB200 million. Total operating expenses were RMB551 million, a 68% increase from the year ago period. Specifically, SG&amp;A increased 48% over the year ago period due to expansion of our direct sales force and increases in our customer service staff to serve our growing customer pool. R&amp;D increased 109%, mainly due to an expansion in head count. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, SG&amp;A was 42% year-over-year and R&amp;D increased 113% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Our Japan operation is making progress and we're excited to welcome Mr. Inoue aboard. Baidu Japan incurred operating costs and expenses in the third quarter close to RMB33 million and we expect the Q4 expense to approximate the Q3 level, likely slightly higher. The third quarter of &#x2013; in the third quarter of 2008 our income tax expense was approximately 35% R&amp;D. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 9.1%. Year-to-date we have had an effective tax rate of 8.9%.</p>
          <p>Net income for the quarter was RMB348 million, a 91% year-over-year increase. Net income including &#x2013; excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure, was RMB365 million, a 95% increase from a year ago. Basic and diluted EPS, excluding share-based compensation expenses &#x2013;  both non-GAAP measures &#x2013; were 10.65 and RMB10.49, translating roughly to a $1.57 and $1.54, respectively.</p>
          <p>Now, moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter of 2008 with cash, cash equivalent and short term investment of RMB2.3 billion, or 338 million U.S. dollars. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was RMB482 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 89%. Capital expenditure on a cash basis for the third quarter was around RMB85 million. A portion of the capital expenditure was associated with a construction of Baidu's new campus facility. Compared to prior quarters, CapEx is lower. This is due to greater optimization of existing equipment, as well as lower equipment purchases and campus construction during the Olympic period.</p>
          <p>We ended the third quarter with approximately 6,800 employees, largely flat versus last quarter. We continue to grow our R&amp;D workforce, while further consolidating sales, marketing and customer service staff. The consolidation is going well and, as Robin mentioned, we have started to see improved efficiency and will continue to focus on improving productivity.</p>
          <p>Now, let me provide you with our top line guidance for the fourth quarter of '08. We currently expect total revenue to be between 1,025,000,000 to RMB1,055,000,000, which would represent year-over-year growth of 80% to 85% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 12 to 15%. I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I now turn the call back to operator, who will invite you to ask questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning and congratulations. Robin, if you could talk a little bit about the &#x2013; I know you addressed some of the bigger picture questions about some of the economic &#x2013; obviously, for those who follow Google they've been impacted by a slowdown in paid clicks and just total queries. Can you talk about just the paid click trends with Baidu and also just how you feel that the broader economy is impacting Baidu's business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I just mentioned before, China is still a growing market. So far, we have not felt any material impact from the financial crises that has happened in the U.S. Granted, there are some companies, small and medium businesses in the coastal cities who do export businesses. They have been hurt quite badly, starting from &#x2013; probably the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>But, as I mentioned before, we have a very large and diverse customer base. And more and more companies realize the benefit of paid search so they are shifting more &#x2013; in general, they are shifting more marketing dollars to the Baidu platform. So we &#x2013; of course, we are keeping a close eye on the macroeconomic condition changes. But so far, we don't see anything material. Maybe Haoyu can talk about the paid click thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. This is Haoyu. As far as, click-through rates we haven't &#x2013; in third quarter we haven't seen any major changes from previous quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one other follow-up question is that the operating margin was well above our targets. Is this kind of a 40% the level we should be thinking about going forward? Or should we consider maybe bringing that back in going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gene, its Jennifer. Thanks for the question. Operating margin did improve this quarter. And as we mentioned, gross margin improved, but primary flavor was TAC. And you might, Haoyu, later on to give more color on that.</p>
          <p>And on the SG&amp;A expenses, obviously, would be leaving a lot of inherit scalability in our business model. As we mentioned, we continue to invest in the R&amp;D capabilities and in the staff and manpower. But at the same time, we believe there is more efficiency to be gained on the SG&amp;A side. So overall, there is a lot of scalability in our business model. However, we don't want to lose sight that Baidu is investing in this business over the long term. China's internet market is still emerging. There will be a lot of opportunities that Baidu will have to participate in. So it's &#x2013; we never really have a long term margin target, per se.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we &#x2013; this should be a play it conservative model for margins to come down slightly or is this a good base level moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the near term, we shouldn't see a significant variations of margins. But as I mentioned, we &#x2013; to the extent we make investment for the longer term future growth there will be changes to the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I have a question about your C2C initiative. I was wondering if you could maybe just discuss in general what the ultimate goal of the move in to C2C &#x2013; you clearly faced a huge competitor in Taobao that has a tremendous amount of cash. And I'm just wondering should we be thinking about your effort as really an attempt to go after that market and own it and own the associated transaction seeds that may sometime develop in future? Or is it really more conceptually a way to capture advertising dollars, such that the companies that will be selling goods on the C2C platform &#x2013; you'll sell them key words directly and there will be associated page traffic to that C2C site that you can monetize with banner ads. If you could put that into a competitive landscape with respect to what your ultimate goal is there that would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason, this is Robin. I think that I mentioned that the rationale for our entrance into the C2C market is because of user demand. We saw a lot of Baidu users searching for product related information and we think that the current web search does not necessary meet all of their needs. So we started to develop a C2C platform roughly a year ago and we just had a beta launch last week during the weekend. We understand there are competition in the market, but our focus is meeting the information needs of our existing users, which probably covers more than 90% of the Internet population here in China.</p>
          <p>In terms of future business model, it's probably too early to tell, but such platforms definitely have a lot of synergies with our existing paid search platforms. As e-commerce become more popular in China, they will certainly help to grow the page search business and going forward we might just consider the C2C platform as yet another advertising platform so that sellers can advertise on our C2C site. It's also an educational platform that as more and more companies or merchants start to analyze the traffic of their online store or online transactions, we will be able to appreciate more of the paid search platform we are offering. So it's because of the synergy and we are confident that that we can deliver very good user experience here on the C2C platform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. If I could, just maybe ask a really quick question. You guys have about 340 million U.S. dollars in cash. Have you considered doing share buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jennifer. We obviously are very conscious to put our cash into good use. Our cash manage &#x2013; we have very prudent management towards the investment and cash. We constantly evaluate the best opportunity to use our cash. At this point, we don't have any decisions that we wanted to share at this point. But keep in mind, that we do want to definitely put the cash into best use.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the good quarter. Just a follow-up question on Jason's C2C platform. There are a lot of concerns about spending or the operating losses from the C2C platform. I wonder if you can comment on the &#x2013; any types of spending on the C2C platform so far, the size of the team and would you able to see even &#x2013; like pretty soon just with the increased data, a page view from the C2C site? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dick, this is Robin again. And regarding to the spending of C2C, we mentioned earlier in the year that it's going to be less than what we spend on the Japan operation. We still maintain that statement for the next couple of quarters. That's because of the synergy we have between paid search and C2C. We do not need to spend a lot of marketing dollars to drive traffic to our C2C platform. So we &#x2013; going forward, we don't think we're going to spend even close to what our competition is planning to spend on. Regarding to the team size -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We have a good, a very solid team of engineers that we have leveraged off our existing R&amp;D workforce to develop the technology on the C2C platform. So, so far from a spend perspective Dick, as you know, we haven't incurred the material expense.</p>
          <p>Going forward, as Robin mentioned earlier, we see a lot of synergies between the C2C platform on paid search. And these two product &#x2013; platforms are interlinked. So one will help the other. And essentially we're definitely providing better tools for merchants and buyers to transact and be able to help them. And frankly, today, we have so many SME customers and that &#x2013; the C2C platform itself really helps them see the transaction soon. So, these two platforms are interrelated and we as mentioned &#x2013; Robin mentioned also, the traffic itself is kind of you all within the same frame work. So we don't think as we spend &#x2013; we will spend as much of marketing dollars as some people might expect and as the business size go up, you know, we will invest in the platform accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, as you probably all know, there's basically no proven business model for C2C in China. Nobody can charge a commission or listing fee for &#x2013; from the sellers. So from our point of view its more like a integrated experience for our users so that they can do all sorts of things on the Baidu platform.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Erica, sitting in for Jason. Hi. My question is, you &#x2013; revenue per customer increased 34%. And could you break down that? Which part is from pricing and how much is from increase of web traffic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Haoyu?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the ARPU and growth, I think that comes from both traffic growth, core growth and price. I don't know the exact numbers. But I would expect both are contributing through the growth of ARPU significantly. I do want to point out that we don't control price. We do adjust minimum bid from time-to-time based on different sectors and different information we have about the bidders. But at the end of the day, the price we charge is based on how much people bid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You increased your minimum price in August by at least 30% and can I say that in that case maybe pricing increase is contributing more to your quarter-over-quarter growth on revenue per customer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as I said. The impact of minimum bid on the average ACP is not direct. It's not <mark type="inaudible" /> totally have to clear to be able to show you ad on our search result page. Eventually, how much will it charge depending on how many bidding and how much they're bidding. So you can not draw the conclusion from the fact that we're raising minimum bid by 30%, the ACP is increasing by 30%. That's definitely not true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also I don't know, where did you get the 30% number. We don't have that number in our mind. Probably, one thing that's worth mentioning is that we increased the minimum initial deposit for some of our sales regions like Beijing. So don't be confused that that's the minimum pricing. It's really a initial deposit. It has nothing to do with pricing.</p>

          <p>So, we review the performance of our unit partners from time to time. So based on their performance &#x2013; because we do put into &#x2013; put that form contingencies in our agreements with them. So when we review their performance, we'll adjust our TAC ratio accordingly. So I mean these things happen all the time. Every quarter.</p>
          <p>But other than that, we have lot of other factors contributing to fluctuation of TAC ratio from quarter to quarter such as different product offerings and signing of new partners, things of this nature. And the timing is a big factor. So when you look at quarter-to-quarter, you might see fluctuations. Having said that, we think the TAC ratio this quarter is probably on the low side. The other thing I want to point out is our unit business is continuing to grow at a very healthy rate and that will continue to be a major contributors to our business.</p>

          <p>Hi, Robin, Jennifer. Congrats on a good quarter. And I am very curious about your -- about the new competition from Google, China. In our observation, Google has been steadily gaining traffic and market share and recently they also rolled out its online and music downloading service and I am very interested in your view about such competition and I have a follow-up. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Richard. This is Robin. I think we still have a very dominant position in the digital music market. We recently launched two improvements to our music search. One is the online video station collection or directory, there has been a facelift on that. We have partnerships with lots of the radio stations across China. Secondly, we launched a separate section for new songs. We help those record companies and publishers to promote business the songs they want to promote.</p>
          <p>We do not see &#x2013; at this time we do not see any meaningful competition on this front. In terms of the traffic share, we think our traffic share is at around 70 to 75%, based on various third party reports. Of course, we don't know the exact number from our competition, so we have to rely on the third party reports. Those reports may vary by one or two percentage but that's like a statistical error. So we cannot say whether we are gaining or losing by 1 or 2% but we are quite confident that we have a dominant position in music search, web search and many other type of searches.</p>

But going forward, what are the new initiatives that will be in place? Especially given that you are fighting a difficult battle, if not up-hill battle against the incumbent leaders, such as Google Japan and also Yahoo! Japan in the search business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We just have hired a president for Baidu Japan. We are quite confident we have assembled a good team to tackle this issue. I understand there are strong competition in the Japanese search market and we are a latecomer, but I also think that there is a lot of room to improve for the Japanese search because there is basically no local player and no local development team, R&amp;D team to really work the fundamentals of Japanese search. We believe that our technology trends and our reliance on local talent to set the product directions will give us an edge going forward. Having said that, you probably know that the Japanese market is a little bit different from the Chinese market in the sense that consumers usually are not that quick to embrace a new brand, so we need to have some patience for this venture.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thank you for taking my call. Good morning. I have a question about the business revenue from the big enterprises versus the SMEs. If I look at your accounts receivable, it grew faster than the revenue. Would you say, this is because of more revenue coming from the big advertisers or the accounts receivables days becoming longer? And talking about TAC ratio, is that because there is more revenue coming from big advertisers, so that your TAC ratio has come down?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, Ming. In terms of revenues earned from large clients, as you know we started last year to focus the efforts to grow our revenues from the large clients. As we worked from a smaller base, obviously, we expect a faster growth in the large customers account. From our perspective, the average outstanding days or the &#x2013; for the receivables has not increased. So it's purely a reflection of really strong revenue growth that's coming from the large customers. Our TAC ratio, as Haoyu explained earlier, that's not &#x2013; I mean, that's not the reason for the TAC ratio to go down. Despite the fact that are growing our large customers it's still not the majority, is not still a very material part of our business. Our P4P platform supporting the SMEs are still going very strong and that's a major contributing revenue factor for our revenue.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just want to follow-up on Eddie's question. Is it fair to say that your B2B customer base might be more vulnerable given the economic slowdown versus the B2C space? And if that's the case, how do you guys plan to defend &#x2013; to deal with that potential weakness? And also I was looking at your customer growth per quarter was slower than what you did versus last year, I believe. Is that a function of maybe you're signing up more larger customers? Does the sales cycle go a little bit slower? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; we're not economists so it's very hard for us to predict what &#x2013; how the difficult economic situation will impact B2B versus B2C. But what we do know is as a lot of business is facing tougher situations, they will probably come to appreciate marketing channels with a higher ROI and higher effectiveness. So we are pretty confident in power of our model. As far as the customer addition I don't think we added fewer customers than before. Of course, we have a much bigger base now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One other things, Jim, is &#x2013; on the customer growth side last few quarters we have had between 40 to 45% year-over-year customer growth. This year, as we came into the quarter we anticipated an altered consumer behavior and customer spending behavior. So the fundamental driver for revenue, as you know, is number of customers in our pool. So it's natural for us to see this level of customer growth rate.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is it fair to say, Robin, that your B2B base may be more defensive than that of Alibaba? Maybe a lot of your B2B customers are domestic driven as opposed to export driven?  Maybe that explains that you may have stronger customer growth on the B2B side in general than that of Alibaba?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Sorry to keep circling back on the TAC issue, but I think you had talked about business review with some union members in the prepared remarks and I think, Haoyu, you talked about the performance criteria. Should we take this to mean that you are cutting off some of the affiliates with, say, lower quality traffic or you've been decreasing its TAC payout contingent upon traffic quality? And also when did Taobao remove paid listings from Baidu and do you think their blocking of Baidu crawlers on the natural search results impacts your traffic to the extent that users are probably not finding as much product in the search results as usual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the TAC question. So, there are two things. So we review the performance of partners from time to time because a lot of these agreements we have with them have performance contingencies. And if they meet certain performance metrics TAC will be at this level; if not, at a different level. And we have scheduled reviews of their performance and if they are not meeting the criteria, we'll adjust the TAC down and sometimes we need to do some catch-up for some previous quarters. So that's what happened. The other thing is on traffic quality. That is definitely something that we have been focusing on. We definitely want to make sure that the traffic generated, the click generated on our platform are of high quality &#x2013; are of high ROI for our advertisers. We do that on an ongoing basis <mark type="inaudible" /> factor this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Taobao question, in the past we did not direct many traffic to that site, so after the block we also did not see any sensible impact to our users. Plus, although we just rolled out the beta version of our own C2C for less than a week, we already have more than 1 million items listed. So, consumers will be able to find information on other e-commerce platforms from Baidu's site.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I guess this relates to the TAC question a little bit more. Can you tell us what is growing faster Baidu proprietary properties or Baidu union properties? To help us gauge the relative performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the question is whether union revenues grow faster or organic revenues growing faster, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah. So, as we said, in previous few quarters our union businesses has been growing a little bit faster than our organic business and I think that that continues to be the case but it's not as &#x2013; the differential is not that big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then I wanted to follow-up on the SG&amp;A to understand if there may have been an Olympic impact there, because you did have sequential decline in total SG&amp;A spend and if there are any other notable Olympic influences on the P&amp;L? If indeed there was one on SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the SG&amp;A side there is no particular Olympic related impact. This quarter, actually, if you notice, the primary driver that drives SG&amp;A are head count and our head count stayed relatively the same. During the quarter we did have a lot of new staff join us, primarily the R&amp;D workforce. At the same time, we've further consolidated our sales force. So some reduction on the sales side. So overall, these two factors were not Olympic related. So SG&amp;A has demonstrated the scalability of the business model and we continue to focus on improving the productivity of this workforce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's fair then to assume that there were no SG&amp;A &#x2013; there was no SG&amp;A spending that would have been pushed out into the fourth quarter? That this is just a natural leverage in the model?</p>

On one hand, we continue to improve the &#x2013; or optimize the infrastructure uses and equipment uses. Part of the spending related to Baidu campus normally happen on a regular basis. However, this quarter on both fronts, both the equipment and CapEx for construction related expenses were slower than before.</p>
          <p>Going into next quarter on the construction for the Baidu campus site, we expect that to comeback to normal.

          <p>Yes. And so, as Robin mentioned, we do see some B2B customers, most manufacturing companies in the coastal areas are impacted more starting from this year. So, other than that, I think all the other industries are growing healthily and we don't see any sort of pattern or trends in the ACP of bidders from different sectors.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Peng. Regarding the efficiency of the sales force, we have already started our efforts in terms of how to improve <mark type="inaudible" />. And you can see a marked improvement last quarter. On the other hand, there is still a lot of room for us to make improvements.  We believe we can do a lot of things <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. One is, I want to take your view on how you look at the customers service aspect of C2C? Your revenue &#x2013; your employee mix in cutting the C2C factor. Do you plant to hire very large size of customer service call center employees or you have a different model?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding balance sheet. I noticed that there is a healthy increase in customers deposit, as usual ,but there is a decline in deferred revenues in third quarter which doesn't show up in last years result. Of course, that's compared to overall revenue slightly small. But I guess if Jennifer can just go over to &#x2013; go over that on what's going on there with those three lines? That will be much appreciated. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Eric, this is Robin. On the customer service for C2C, we will initially use our in-house team to do the customer service. Depending on how successful our C2C platform is, we will make the decision of how many people to hire. We do have experience of running customer service in-house. Our paid search platform hires a lot of customer service people. So that's not something unfamiliar to us but in the long run we cannot go out any other possibility like outsourcing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Eric on your question on the balance sheet items. Yes, customer deposit is growing and that's really a reflection of what's in the pipeline from a revenue generating perspective. Deferred revenue, the nature of deferred revenue is basically services provided but it hasn't meet the test threshold for revenue and recognition.</p>
          <p>As an example maybe services provided the agreement is all reached but we haven't have the paper document back in the company for us to kind of meet all the tax for revenue and recognition. It did come down this quarter and at the end of September you see 9 million of deferred revenue that's less than the prior quarter. What this really reflects is a process issue. It's just better process and people follow-up on completing the sales transaction and in itself these deferred revenue is primarily related to larger clients.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you. Morning. I have one question. I see that there is increasing pressure from the music industry on your music search platform and there is also &#x2013; LG reportedly pulled out their advertisement on your platform. an you comment that and can you comment on what's the impact on your platform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you just said &#x2013;  that is not true. LG did not pull out their advertising from our platform and we are not facing increasing pressures from the music industry. On the contrary, we signed many corporation deals with the record companies and we share revenue with that with them. As the matter of fact, one of the channels on our mp3 search &#x2013;  there is a music streaming service related to the defined record company. That part of the revenue has more than doubled compared to the same quarter of last year, so we are very optimistic about the advertising supported music streaming service in China.</p>

          <p>Robin, I was hoping that you could maybe comment about the outlook for 2009. Can you sort of characterize &#x2013;  given all the potential economic slow-down, global financial crisis. Can you sort of characterize your view heading to next year? Given the fact that, your industry is still relatively under-penetrated, would you see most of the growth coming from new vertical customers? Or do you see as you get more of the larger the potential growth that really coming from ASP? And maybe you can comment about visibility of your revenue heading to 2009 as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks James. I think it is a little bit early to tell too much about the outlook for 2009, as we usually only give guidance for one quarter. Having said that, I would say that the paid search market in China is still in its early stage. And we see &#x2013; we continue to see many, many companies start to stand their marketing dollars on our platform. And those more mature companies, mature meaning they have a better understanding of the internet, generally spend more on our platform.</p>
          <p>Internally, we see lots of things to be done. From the sales force efficiency to the maturization <mark type="inaudible" /> into web search quality and to the new product and services that we are offering and we plan to offer. We just see lots and lots of things that we need to work on.</p>
          <p>So the performance of our 2009 would pretty much depend on how good we can execute and how fast we can run. Of course, we are not exempt from the market of economics conditions, if China's economy crashes, we will be affected. But if it's just a couple of percentage of fluctuation, I think we should be fine going forward.</p>
          <p>Regarding to the customer mix I think, Haoyu, already talked about it. Companies large and small are all becoming more receptive or start to appreciate more of our platform. Especially for the larger companies. In the early days of the year, larger companies rely on big sales team not big but high paid sales for to build relationship with them and we thought that was not what we &#x2013; not a priority in the early days. But this day time I think as the companies start to get ready for pay search and the growth on that front should be better than the average customer.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jim. This is Peng Yi. Regarding your question I think according to government statistics in China we have more than 40 million enterprises. Among them we have more than 4 million B2B enterprises. So, compare these figures with our currently active customer base, we see a lot of room for us to pick up. So apart from Baidu I cannot see any other <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
