          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS's 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Louis Gallois, our CEO and Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about one hour and 30 minutes. It includes Q&amp;A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation.</p>
          <p>It is also web cast on our website. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. The supporting information package was e-mailed to you two hours ago with slides, which we will now walk through and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain a Safe Harbor statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now to Louis Gallois.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us for this review of our 2008 performance. I come to this discussion with a combination of confidence and caution. The confidence flows from my strong belief in what this company, its management and employees can achieve despite difficult challenges.</p>
          <p>As you will see from our 2008 highlights EADS has maintained a strong financial perform and achieved a number of significant accomplishments despite its program challenges.</p>
          <p>The caution, you are not surprised, stems from the difficult economic environment that faces most companies in most industries worldwide. Yet in our case I believe that we have learned in redesigning our company in the past years with, will help us weather the current downturn. I think it is important to keep in mind several factors as we discuss our results.</p>
          <p>So first is that the commercial speed of this company stronger than ever as our sale successes of 2008 indicate. Every division has contributed to a strong product backlog, and we are creating new opportunities and services. The second is that we are substantially more integrated, more efficient company. This is a continuous, it's not finished and challenging process, but we have come a long way as a business enterprise.</p>
          <p>The third is that while we are managing the risk that we face and therefore have spoken to you frankly about this in past, in past meetings, I believe that EADS should expect the cooperation of European governments in resolving some of these issues. Certainly this is a case with the critical program such as the A400M.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, let me turn towards the highlights of 2008 on page four, before that have a close look please at our Safe Harbor statement on page two.</p>
          <p>Commercial success and strategic progress have delivered a solid set of results. Our record order book, now at more than &#x20AC;400 billion with different activities at &#x20AC;55 billion provides stability and a certain level of visibility. 2008 was a year of ramp up activity. Airbus delivered a record 483 aircraft, 30 more than in 2007 including 12 A380. Substantial reorganization of production lines and the opening of new facilities in Eurocopter enabled a 20% increase in deliveries. 588 helicopters were delivered in the year.</p>
          <p>IM5 achieved six launches during the year. It has provide, proved highly, it has proved highly reliable performing 28 successful launches in a row. This commercial performance intersects with solid financial results.</p>
          <p>Our underlying business has led to better than expected cash flow generation and a solid EBIT performance, which was also boosted by significant currency impact. Each of our divisions have made strategic advances during this year.</p>
          <p>For Airbus, the mandate has been a resilient and far more integrated operation that can better execute. In the case of Eurocopter, I think you are seeing the template of EADS evolving business model. Substantial success on military helicopters in both the U.S. and Brazil demonstrate progress in the move towards globalization. Our focus on maximizing high margin services provides some protection against the commercial cycle.</p>
          <p>Defence and space activities are delivering profitable growth through a combination of efficiency and productivity initiatives as well as external growth. So taken as a full picture, 2008 was a very solid year for our company.</p>
          <p>Since efficiency is going to be critical for EADS in the years to come, let me walk you through the Power8 achievement to-date. Through a new organizational structure, leaner processes and careful cash management, Power8 has significantly reduced Airbus cost base for the long-term. For the second year in a row, it exceeded targets, delivering gross cost savings of about &#x20AC;1.3 billion compared to the projected base line of the costs. This is more than half way to the &#x20AC;2.1 billion 2010 confirmed objective. Reduced overhead costs have already delivered 50% of the original target of 10,000. Smart buying is delivering result and lean manufacturing has now been deployed in all plants, enabling tighter control on working capital.</p>
          <p>On top of Power8 and in case of further weakening in the market, we will review expenses in all areas. The divestment of non-core infrastructure sites has also progressed despite a difficult financial climate. Laupheim and Filton sites have been sold to long-term Airbus partners, enabling Airbus to concentrate on its core business as aircraft architect and integrator in the future. I remind you the, also the creation of Aerolia in France and Premium Aerotech in Germany from our aerostructure facilities.</p>
          <p>Power8 PLUS and the EADS wide effort leading to &#x20AC;1 billion additional savings in 2011 and 2012 will meet its targets through cost reduction project and a focus on expanding industrial footprint and an increasing level of U.S. dollar sourcing in the cost base.</p>
          <p>Within the scope of the future EADS program, EADS has adopted a simpler and leaner organization. Our Military Transport Aircraft division is now integrated within Airbus, maximizing synergies and reinforcing the management of the new entity Airbus Military inside Airbus.</p>
          <p>Space and defence divisions will develop a consistent approach towards common customers and develop commercial, technical and strategic synergies. Support functions are currently under review, real estate, facility management and general procurement will be organized in a shared service to standardize processes and leverage economies of scale and efficiency.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Hans Peter to discuss the financial picture in more detail. Hans Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louis and good morning everybody. I'm on page six. We have kept you regularly updated on the delayed A400M program. You are aware of the new approach we made to OCCAR to solve the technical and contractual issues. We have recently strengthened the program management by integrating MTAD into Airbus, creating Airbus Military. This will optimize resources and streamline decision-making.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2008 financial statements we have adopted a temporary accounting treatment allowed under IFRS 11. The high level of uncertainty leads us to maintain early stage accounting and suspend the milestone accounting. Therefore the net EBITDA impact of minus &#x20AC;700 million taken does not reflect the complete new estimate of the loss at completion.</p>
          <p>Once the situation becomes clear we will resume the milestone accounting and update the provision in its entire scope. Obviously, the magnitude of the final adjustment will be dependant on the outcome of the overall assessment of the A400M program and of negotiations with customers and suppliers.</p>
          <p>You will see in the press release that OCCAR has the right to cancel the contract and to recover all initial and pre-delivery payments. It requires unanimous consent from the different nations, and we do not expect OCCAR to cancel the contract at this stage. Formal negotiations will begin in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p>If we now turn the pages, to page eight to the financial highlights. 2008 results demonstrate a combination of top and bottom-line growth across all divisions. Volume ramp up across all divisions provided positive contributions to revenue growth and more than compensated for the weaker dollar.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the shift to early stage accounting for the A400M program increased revenues by &#x20AC;1.1 billion. We will expand on the EBIT explanation shortly, and I will emphasize the good underlying performance.</p>
          <p>Order intake over the full year remained strong, containing considerable order inflow from Airbus, Defence, Eurocopter and MTA for the tankers.</p>
          <p>Backlog remains at record levels, increasing 18% compared to 2007 figures. The backlog is now benefiting from a strengthening dollar rate due to the revaluation impact at the closing spot rate of 139 dollar versus euro at the end of December versus 147 at the end of December 2007 worth around &#x20AC;10 billion.</p>
          <p>If we turn the page and come to page nine, this slide demonstrates the underlying EBIT trend in stripping out non-operational and non-recurring items. Firstly, we have explained to you the impact on the accounts of the shift to early stage accounting, and the resulting charge on the A400M. The business update of loss making contracts amounts to approximately &#x20AC;1 billion for 2008, mainly relating to A380.</p>
          <p>The increase incorporates the latest change to the A380 production plan in 2009 and some higher recurring costs reflecting the ramp-up challenges we are facing. You are aware that as the dollar fluctuates so do our loss making contract provisions that are revalued at the closing spot. This now includes two components: the effect from the dollar and the declining British pound.</p>
          <p>And a significant portion of our costs are denominated in pounds. The recent weakening of the pound against the euro has triggered another positive currency component. The combination of the dollar rebound and the pound decline has led to a positive revaluation of all loss making contracts amounting to around &#x20AC;900 million.</p>
          <p>The benefit from the temporary excess volume of matured hedges, representing the hedges put in place before the A380 delivery shift in 2006 has now fully reversed as expected.</p>
          <p>During the year, other one-offs include the dollar mismatch impact coming from the reversal of pre-delivery payments, the revaluation of trade liabilities, the sell-down and provision release of customer financing at Airbus and a provision revaluation of, for Power8.</p>
          <p>Up to page 10, EBIT margin has reached 6.5% for the year 2008. R&amp;D increased to almost &#x20AC;2.7 billion. The increase is a result of higher innovation led R&amp;D at Eurocopter and Airbus.</p>
          <p>The interest result mainly reflects a strong net cash balance throughout 2008. Meanwhile the other financial result is roughly stable. It includes the unwinding of the discounts on provisions whose present value grows as we move towards their consumption. The positive valuation of the premium paid for options and the revaluation of cash balances due to foreign exchange effects. It also includes some embedded derivatives and treasury swap operations.</p>
          <p>The strong earnings improvement led to a tax expense of &#x20AC;703 million, compared to a tax benefit of &#x20AC;333 million last year. Our tax rate for the year is 31%. On the bottom-line it leads to a net income of &#x20AC;1.57 billion for 2008 compared to a net loss of &#x20AC;446 million for 2007.</p>
          <p>Up to slide 11, you are aware that our portfolio of hedges now contains forward, structured forward and plain-vanilla euro call option. Options added during the summer period amounted to $9 billion, improving our level of protection and flexibility especially. Due to the strengthening value of the U.S. dollar, the mark-to-market value of our hedge book has decreased by around &#x20AC;5 billion, compared to December 2007 and now amounts to &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>The volatility of the dollar, the change in mark-to-market and the risk pricing of financial institutions make hedging implementation more difficult or impossible with a number of banks. Despite that and due to the rebound in the dollar, we increased the pace of our hedging activity.</p>
          <p>Our hedge book further increased from 51 billion last year to $68 billion. While $16.4 billion of hedges matured, $34.6 billion of new hedges were added in 2008 at an average rate of 142 if we exclude the option. Regardless of the pace at which we hedge our activities, we always ensure net exposure for the next two years to be nearly hedged.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12, cash flow generations for 2008 is better than expected. We finished the year with a net cash position of &#x20AC;9.2 billion, which provides a solid liquidity base for the future.</p>
          <p>Gross cash flow from operations was &#x20AC;4.6 billion, thanks to a solid operational performance translated through the net income. It was weighed down by cash consumption of provisions including A400M effects.</p>
          <p>Overall, PDPs were still growing across all divisions including Airbus. The deterioration in working capital is attributable to a lower level of advance payments received compared to 2007 level when Astrium benefited from a significant slowdown for Paradigm. You can see it on the slide, it was 1.2, 1.1 to 1.2 billion. Around half of the customer advances are generated by non-Airbus activities.</p>
          <p>Lower customer advances were partially offset by a lower ramp-up in inventory versus one year ago in particular at Airbus and MTA. The change in working capital now contains the net effect of customer financing, following a change in presentation under IFRS. 2007 figures have been restated to incorporate this change.</p>
          <p>The payments for option premiums are reported in the working capital. They are around 300 million. As expected, we began to support some customers during the fourth quarter. Sales financing represented a cash outflow of approximately &#x20AC;300 million in the year.</p>
          <p>Investing activities consumed &#x20AC;1.8 billion of cash in 2008. CapEx at Astrium was lower than last year due to a lower level of investments in Paradigm. The cash contribution to pension plan assets increased versus 2007, and free cash flow was &#x20AC;2.6 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>We will now dig into each division's performance, and Louis's going to start on the Airbus slide, which is on page 14.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Hans Peter. Airbus delivered a solid set of results in 2008 with record deliveries and a growing backlog. With the record order backlog, Airbus has some flexibility to adapt each customer's wish to reschedule some deliveries. With significant progress on Power8, Airbus is preparing to face economic challenges.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased by 9% due to stronger volume and a favorable mix. Revenues also include an effect from the shift to early stage accounting for the A400M program, reflecting Airbus work share &#x20AC;765 million.</p>
          <p>Overall revenue growth was weighted down by dollar headwind and price deterioration on deliveries. The business delivered a strong EBIT recovery versus last year due to a good underlying business performance and seamless ramp-up on the A320 and A330, less exceptional program and restructuring charges and significant gains from foreign currency from both the U.S. dollar and the British pound.</p>
          <p>The A380 costs represent a run-up of changes we are facing. Back ended facing of R&amp;D, non-series cost, sales financing and the reversal of excess temporary volume from hedging weighed on the fourth quarter as anticipated.</p>
          <p>Airbus continues to expand its industrial footprints, the new A320 final assembly line in Tianjin will secure access to the Chinese market as well as taping into the country's brightest engineering talents.</p>
          <p>The A350 XWB passed its detailed definition freeze review called M5 at, as across the level in December. For the first time, Airbus has a single Digital-Mock-Up and the single tool-set uniting the whole A350 team both within Airbus and its supply chain.</p>
          <p>Hans Peter now is going to walk you through the other divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Which starts on page 15. As we have already mentioned as of 2009 our Military Transport Aircraft division will be integrated within Airbus and called Airbus Military.</p>
          <p>Now let us walk through the 2008 financial advances in the old perimeter. In 2008 revenues increased to &#x20AC;2.8 billion. This figure includes the A400M Power on milestone. The growth is driven by the shift to early stage accounting for the A400M program, resulting in an uplift of &#x20AC;1.1 billion and an increase in invoicing for both the tanker and medium and light activity.</p>
          <p>Despite the new charge taken on the A400M program of &#x20AC;41 million, EBIT has improved due to ramp up in tanker activity and less exceptional charges taken then in 2007. Higher end demand for tankers has resulted in the MTA order book expanding to &#x20AC;22.2 billion. We booked 20 tankers in the year with orders from the U.K., Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
          <p>The A400M passed two key events in 2008, the Power-on milestone was reached in March and the flight-tested flew for the first time in December. The second flight test was completed at the end of the January as planned and tests are making progress.</p>
          <p>Development of tankers is also progressing. The air-to-air refueling boom system is finalized following several airborne contacts and the fight test campaign for the tanker to Australia is ongoing.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to Eurocopter on the next slide. Eurocopter has achieved its second highest level of orders and delivered more helicopters than ever before. The order book is at &#x20AC;13.8 billion, cancellations were limited and concentrated in the civil and corporate segments.</p>
          <p>Revenues rose by 7.5% to &#x20AC;4.5 billion due to a 20% ramp up in serial activities. Customer services and development activities also brought strong contributions. EBIT increased by 39% versus 2007. EBIT margin expanded to 6.5%.</p>
          <p>Strong volume growth and a better mix more than compensated negative currency effects and higher innovation led R&amp;D mainly related to the EC175 joint development with China.</p>
          <p>Industrial partnership has been reinforced with Brazil for the manufacture, assembly and maintenance support of the EC725 as part of a joint declaration on defense cooperation. Eurocopter has achieved major advances in globalization. In the U.S. the armed forces placed an additional order for 44 LUH.</p>
          <p>The 50th helicopter was delivered during the year, including the first from the new Mississippi final assembly line. Final qualification for HAP and UHT versions of Tiger occurred in December. This qualification ends the development phase and paves the way for the Tiger's operational entry into service and its use in external operations.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter reinforced its European footprint with the first EC135 manufactured in Albacete, delivered to the Spanish Army response unit. More than 30% of Eurocopter's revenues are derived from services in line with its goal of increasing this share to 50% by 2020. Investment in services increased, particularly in the flight simulator sector. The number of power by the hour service contracts increased by 20% and Eurocopter acquired Motorflug, a German maintenance repair and overhaul specialist.</p>
          <p>Let's speak about Astrium on the next slide, number 17. Operational execution and efficiency have driven strong, top and bottom line growth in Astrium. The order book is robust at more than &#x20AC;11 billion. Astrium reinforced its competitive positioning in 2008, generating revenues of &#x20AC;4.3 billion, a 21% increased compared to 2007. The main drivers were telecommunication satellites, a ramp up in Ariane 5 production and the completion of Skynet 5 which enables Paradigm to service the U.K. MOD secure communication system. External growth in services came from the acquisition of the majority share in Spot Image.</p>
          <p>Astrium grew profitability for the fifth consecutive year and delivered on its margin outlook. EBIT expansion of 34% was driven by a strong focus on productivity for both Ariane and M51 Ballistic Missile Program and growth in services. The solid performance in Paradigm services more than compensated the unfavorable translation effect from the declining British pound to euro foreign exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Astrium's contributions to the internal, international, sorry, space station achieved technical success as the Columbus Laboratory and Automated Transfer Vehicle connected with the ISS in space early in 2008. ESA has since commissioned Astrium with the European share of the ISS operation service contract to 2010.</p>
          <p>France's new generation M51 ballistic missile completed its third qualification flight and proved its underwater launch capability. Bolt on investments in services enable Astrium to deliver a full range of integrated earth observation services. Furthermore, the acquisition of SSTL is finalized, which increases capabilities for the design and manufacture of small and micro satellites.</p>
          <p>Let's move onto defence on page or slide 18. The order book of &#x20AC;17 billion continues to shift towards high growth products and services. Revenues grew 5% lifted by new growth areas and the consolidation of plant CML from May onwards.</p>
          <p>The early stage accounting adjustment made for the A400M generated a revenue increase of &#x20AC;171 million. The division delivered a year of record profitability with EBIT margin increasing to 7.2% due to operating improvement across all businesses driven by maturing programs and cost reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Eurofighter Tranche 1 is fully delivered. For Tranche 2 partner nations and export deliveries are underway. Discussions are ongoing on Eurofighter Tranche 3. In line with group strategy, security capabilities continue to expand significantly. The acquisition of Plant CML has brought access to the U.S market.</p>
          <p>The effectiveness of the Tetra Network was demonstrated by the vital role played in the safety of the Beijing Olympics. Delivery milestones were achieved for the two French programs PARC and SIDM. SIDM is now in service in Afghanistan supporting the French troops. Furthermore, aerial target drones were delivered to the U.S army.</p>
          <p>Defence electronics has made inroads in naval radar with customers such as the U.S. Coast Guard and German Armed Forces. This market should bring further export opportunities. All military air systems in Germany have been consolidated in Manching now enabling EADS to strengthen its customer offering and industrial process.</p>
          <p>Now on to other businesses on slide 19, EADS North America is consolidated within these other businesses. 2007 figures have been adjusted accordingly. The different divisions, i.e. for example Eurocopter and defence will continue to report their relevant work share in their results.</p>
          <p>The order book has grown to almost &#x20AC;3.4 billion. Growth comes from strong LUH order intake in EADS North America, the high level of cabin interior activity at the Sogerma and 25 new freighter conversions at EFW.</p>
          <p>Revenues in other businesses have increase 9% driven by a higher ATR deliverers, the LUH program ramp up at EADS North America and higher passenger seats activity at Sogerma. EBIT is roughly stable due to some negative effect from foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Sogerma finalized the sale of Revima in the October. Operationally Sogerma confirms its recovery. ATR ramped up deliveries in 2008 with 55 aircraft delivered, 42 orders in ATR but 22 cancellations clearly show the weakening regional aircraft market. The ramp up has been stopped.</p>
          <p>ATR backlog stands at 160 units. EFW aerostructures will benefit from the cooperation with Lufthansa Technik for the conversion and modification of Airbus aircraft in partnerships with Russian Irkut and UAC on the A320/21 freighter conversion. From January 2009 EFW will be part of the Airbus division.</p>
          <p>EADS Socata is classified as held for sale in the 2008 accounts due to the final agreement announced between EADS and the Daher Group for Daher to acquire a 70% majority interest. The sale has since been finalized in January.</p>
          <p>Louis will now comment on our guidance on page 21.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans Peter. Now I will share our view of the 2009 outlook. We have begun 2009 with a mixed level of visibility, which at Airbus is satisfactory for the first half of the year. However, the level of uncertainty increases as we look beyond.</p>
          <p>Our bottom-up analysis is supported by our backlog and by our recent decision to adjust production rates. On the single aisle family, rates are reduced to 34 aircrafts per month from October 2009, and ramp-up of the long-range family is frozen at 8.5 per month to reflect the weakening outlook.</p>
          <p>This analysis shows overbooking for the next years. Nevertheless, this backlog is challenged by the present deterioration of the macroeconomic and traffic indicators. Therefore, we are continuously monitoring the market, our customers and suppliers, ready to adapt our production rates to development of delivery perspectives.</p>
          <p>As a result, the management is applying a rolling plan concept besides our commercial backlog, our solid backlog in defence and institutional activities provides a certain level of protection and stability.</p>
          <p>EADS expect Airbus to capture between 300 and 400 new gross orders in 2009, which is changing taking into account the current market conditions. Based on the stable delivery assumption of U.S. dollar rates at &#x20AC;1 for US$1.39, EADS revenues should be roughly in line with 2008 level.</p>
          <p>Under these assumptions, EBIT before one-off should be down in 2009 but significantly positive supported by robust underlying performance in divisions. Revised industrial plans to complete the A400M program could lead to a significant charge, weighing on EBIT depending on the outcome of negotiations with customers and suppliers.</p>
          <p>EBIT will also be negatively impacted by increased research and development expenses, by significant hedging deterioration, price deterioration, increasing customer financing and in-service support costs compared to 2008. This elements will be partly offset by further Power8 cost savings.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow for 2009 will reflect some negative impacts from lower customer advances at Airbus and some inventory build-up in the last quarter reflecting the reduction in single aisle production rates. We expect to support our customers in financing their deliveries on a discretionary basis in 2009.</p>
          <p>The cash consumption of provisions taken over recent years will also wait on the cash flow. At this stage with the current level of visibility, EADS is not expecting to consume more than &#x20AC;1.5 billion of free cash flow over, after customer financing in 2009.</p>
          <p>As soon as the group has better visibility of the outcome of the A400M discussion, the development of its commercial markets EADS will update its guidance more precisely.</p>
          <p>Finally, page 22 in view of the cash performance of the group, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of $0.20 per share to the Annual General Meeting of shareholders, $0.08 higher than last year. The dividend will be paid out of the distributable reserves. The low payout ratio of the dividend acknowledges the turbulent macroeconomic and capital market environment. But the Board of Directors wishes to recognize the importance of shareholder loyalty to EADS, and management wishes to express confidence in the company's medium-term prospects.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning. I just have a one question on your guidance and when you actually saying EBIT for 2009 to be excluding the one-offs below 2008. Are you taking the 2008 EBIT, excluding the one-off as well or your reference is the 2.8 billion?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions if I could? First one, could you share with us the net level of Power8 savings? Thank you for giving us the gross number, the 1.3 billion, but the net level that was achieved in 2008. The second question is whether you could also just help us understand a little bit some of the moving pieces around the 2009 profit outlook, particularly some of the effects that you talked about. So what sort of scale you would see R&amp;D change, the pricing pressure, incremental Power8 and customer financing provisions? Just some help to understand those movements, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On net level of Power8, I guess you mean net Power8 net of investments we need to make to in order to get the savings. It is a little bit in excess of a billion if we take it on a netted basis. Secondly, I think you wanted to understand a little bit the movers of the outlook for 2009, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Yes. Please, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean it's clear first of all one big level of uncertainty is A400M and I will not talk about A400M but rather on some of the other elements. I mean there is, as we say, higher R&amp;D. R&amp;D level is in 2008 between 2.6 and 2.7 billion and might reach up to three billion for the full year. But obviously depends, this depends upon also the further development during the year because clearly if markets further would deteriorate we would react. Then another element, where we see some increase, not dramatic but still increase is in support costs in service support costs mainly for our A380 fleet, which is growing and with the number of aircraft and the number of destinations. There will be some more to come in 2009.</p>
          <p>And then we have a number of other issues, which are related to currency and to market obviously which are in a way difficult to predict. One is the commercial market. We say we deliver up to the same level we have seen in 2008, which means it could be a bit below. We are closely following that, and in case necessary we obviously would further adapt. We will have to look into the development of customer financing with the expected increase and the assessment of the credit standing of the customers behind those increases. Obviously, there might be some provision to be taken, i.e. some negative EBIT impact. Then we will see most probably the same as we have seen last year a huge volatility in the currencies. Not only the dollar, now we have additionally the pound. And in so far this will fluctuate from closing to closing and makes it challenging obviously to predict.</p>
          <p>And finally, we will potentially see a phenomenon which is that in case we would lose loss making provisions simply due to the fact that the dollar strengthens as an example. We would have to account for the aircraft delivered, and this is A380, not at the average cost but at the cost along the learning curve, which obviously would weigh also a little bit on EBIT. So there are a number of issues in 2008. We have to keep in mind, when we, I would say, talk about our outlook.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Sandy Morris from The Royal Bank of Scotland, UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Hope everybody is well. Slightly broad question, which I'm, I suppose is irritating. Given that cash protection is key and given what you've just said about aircraft customer financing, what is your view upon delivering an aircraft or not delivering it in order to avoid financing? In other words, would you take aircraft deliveries down in order to guard your cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to answer this question. Because we, we feel that there is a reasonable volume of customer financing we could deliver, linked to our, the level of our net cash for the time being. It means that we have room, but we know that we can't go beyond a certain limit. And it will depend on our capacity to sell down the, our customer financing to other operators and if the market is allowing such as a loan it could increase our capacity. Hans Peter you want to be more complete.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I probably want to add a few things. First of all, Sandy it's clear our customer financing support which we envisage for 2009 cannot obviously solve everything if the financial markets are not working and if ECA agencies would not come up with a significantly increased frame of export guarantees. Which by the way is very, on a very good track and looked at very constructively by our nations. So, yes, we might refrain from delivering aircraft. In case we come to the conclusion that the credit standing is not good enough. The pre-condition for that is obviously that this is not happening last minute. In other words in a situation where the aircraft is already built and more or less on the tarmac, then the, this decision is much more difficult. But in any case, we might refrain not to give the support and as a consequence not deliver. And by the way, we are currently already envisaging that in not taking into account overbooking which still exists. So there is still a very small level of overbooking on 2009 and more significant in 2010 and more, even more significant in 2011.</p>
          <p>So already now we envisage not to satisfy all the customers which are in the order backlog of today. I mean the process is one, which is followed online, I would say, every two weeks we are meeting in a risk management committee to look at that and to take decisions proactively. And proactively means four to six months before a delivery on single aisle and probably eight to ten months on a long range, where you already have to decide whether you customize the aircraft or not.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Antoine Boivin-Champeaux from Cheuvreux. Good morning, Louis, Hans Peter, Nathalie. I have two questions. First of all, could you tell us what percentage of the aircraft value the export credit agencies are currently ready to guarantee, that's my first question. Is there a change as compared to last year, thanks to government support so I would be interested in the level. Secondly, could you tell us regarding Power8 what is the net contribution within the P&amp;L and not as a net of cost issue that you mentioned before? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On ECA, Louie if allow, roughly 50% of the deliveries are expected to be supported by the ECAs. That is the current level of discussion we have in the, in our European capital. And obviously the ECAs are doing their due diligence in each and every case. But this is I think where we can count on for the time being. On net contribution in the P&amp;L, it's, I mean, we are deliberately or intentionally not giving a figure here because we are following those projects on a project-by-project basis and as the savings have materialized they are reported in a reporting tool. To flow it down into the EBIT line is rather complicated not the least because it, a lot of it is or some of it is flowing through inventories. So to give you a precise number on EBIT is difficult and so it's more of a guess and.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Will Mackie from Main First. One real question to focus on cash flow in a number of parts, could you just step us through some of your assumptions behind the 1.5 billion cash outflow? Particularly, how you see provision utilization developing in terms of cash burn for '09? And on the customer financing side what are your assumptions about the level of capital you may allocate to customer financing in this year? And lastly, you've mentioned the potential build-up for inventories towards the end of the year. What sort of assumptions are you making about working capital development as we go through '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of the elements were to start with provision utilization. Yes, there are significant provisions in our balance sheet, which flow through the cash flows over the next years to come. The level now excluding the A400M is about 2.6, 2.7 billion in total. 1.5 billion out of this will be turned within the years 2009, '10, '11, and the remaining ones in the years after so there are some cash outs we have envisaged within the number you have. The customer financing, we have given you some I would say flavor on what we expect on the customer financing. Already it is between, let me look, it's, I mean we didn't put a figure on the slide, but what we said is already that it is roughly the level we had during the last cycle which is on a yearly basis probably around or close to &#x20AC;1 billion. On.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were obviously structured as we did in the past to be able to sell it down at anytime so we are not there to keep this exposure, and you've seen that we successful sold down a lot of this exposure. We have obviously, we envisaged to have some decrease in pre-delivery payments compared to 2008. So the inflow is probably not at the same level. I wouldn't give you a precise number for that, but clearly we see some decrease potentially and have taken some protection there. I think that are probably the main elements.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just coming back on a follow-up there, you mentioned that 50% of the deliveries maybe supported by the ECAs in the current year. How does that compare to prior years in '06 or '07 or '08 for example?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>The next question comes from Reuben Arvag from Morgan Stanley, UK..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Two questions if I may please? The first one, Hans Peter, you talked about sort of monitoring demand for deliveries very carefully. How quickly can you ramp down further if need be? You're already announcing you'll be ramping down from 36 to 34. How quickly can you do that beyond that if need be? And how do you manage the supply chain in that duration? And then just second question A380, how is a kind of ramp-up there progressing? What do you expecting in term of the deliveries for next June? Are there any upcoming orders that we should be thinking about that you are currently contesting? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the ramp-down, the potential ramp-down, we have to take decision on the single aisle between six months and four months before delivery and for the long range between nine and seven months before delivery. It means that we have some flexibility inside the year, but for the long range we will have to, we have to monitor the situation almost one year late.</p>
          <p>The question you are raising on our supply chain is perhaps a most difficult we have to solve, and we are in close contact with our suppliers to inform them as early as possible of change in production rate because they are, I could say, they are more sensitive than us and they see things later then us. It's for that we have to be extremely attentive to the situation. That it's on the A380, we have not changed our production rate target. It's 18 for 2009, 18 for 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add something, I mean we have some flexibility in our manufacturing system obviously to adapt. The difficulty is really to early enough decide which aircraft finally is customized as Louis said before. But in case we would have to ramp down, there is some flexibility we have discussed already in earlier calls.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Doug Harned. When you go back to September October, you were looking at forty alliance on the single aisle. Then you are over sold with that point. Now we're, you've taken the number down to 34, still over sold at some level. When you looked at what's changed since that point until today and then you look forward, how do you get comfortable that that 34 rate looks pretty good, but you won't have to take another step down from that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>We are following that very carefully. And we will adapt. We think the decision we have taken is, was adapted when we took it. But we have only taken the decision for the last quarter of 2009. And we could adjust if we see that the market is deteriorating. And we are following that every week airline-per-airline, airplane-per-airplane.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I was getting at is I would expect in some customer situations, you have flexibility to work with the customer. They clearly want the airplanes. You have long-term negotiations with them over deliveries. Other ones maybe more one-off, they may have, they may be smaller, have serious issues themselves. And I was wondering if we were heading into a different part of your customer base where you felt more secure about their ability to take those deliveries in 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, the analysis we are managing is done airline-per-airline. With, we are assessing its capacity to finance airplanes, and we are discussing with them. And we take a decision; we take decisions airline-per-airline. And I, we have no general rule because each airline is a specific case. I can't say we are splitting our portfolio in two parts is a good airline, is a bad airline. We are not doing what the banks are trying to do with the bad assets. We are not doing that because we think it's airline-per-airline issue and we stick to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, then related to that when you look at these lower production rates, how has this changed your outlook for, of total head count numbers, say production personnel and other personnel in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that we have capacity to adjust because we have a lot of interim, temps and sub-contractor in-situ inside Airbus. And it give us some capacity to adjust. We could consider that we have a capacity to adjust up to 20% without reorganizing composites of production. But it means that we have to be prepared to any situation, and we are looking at any, at all scenarios to be sure that we have the flexibility needed if we have to adjust. But as I said earlier, my main concern is a capacity of adjustment of our supply chain.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That is the main concern. The added value of an airplane is 84% outside Airbus. And it means that the capacity of adjustment of the supply chain is more essential than our own capacity even if we are looking very carefully to it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. I have two questions as well please, one on Airbus and one on A400M. Just on the Airbus side, and it's a follow on from Doug's question. You in the release give the number of employees at the group as 118,000, which is up about 2000 on last year on '07. Could you please tell me what the core employee number at Airbus was at the end of 2008? And how that compares with the core employee number end of 2007? And what I mean by core employees, I mean, I want you to exclude the employees that were transferred out effectively in the deals with GKN and Daher in all the other sort of deals you've done there. So that's the first question on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could give you a figure of, could give you a figure on Airbus head count. At the end of 2007 it was 56,029 and at the end of 2008 is 53,906. But we have to, I don't know if Filton is out or not, not yet, it's Laupheim is out. Laupheim is how much is it? How many.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>12 to 1500.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>1200. You have to take into account it's not the same parameter because of Filton, of Laupheim sale, it's a 1200 people. We said it very clearly that we are reducing employment in overhead, but we have to increase employment in production activities. We have delivered 30 airplanes more in 2008 compared to 2007. And more than that among these 30 airplanes, you have 12 A380, and you have to know that for us one A380 is nine A350.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A320, A320 so, sorry. It means that in the production for the blue collar and engineers we, Airbus was increasing in 2008 and decreasing on overhead, that's the mix. If I could give you figure on the temps, sub-contractor in-situ and the interim it's in Airbus, it's around 35 to 40,000 people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And has that number changed over the past year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How that number change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, I have not the figure compared to past year, and it's a rough figure I am giving to you. To give you an idea of the magnitude of our flexibility, which is not total because we need some of this subcontractor in-situ because we have not the same competencies inside the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so far it has decreased at least on the overhead side already because we reduced in the return of overhead cost module of Power8 already 5,000 people, a significant part of them being external or subcontracted work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We could say that it's, at the end it will be half-and-half, between subcontractor, temps on one side and the Airbus permanent employees. And we could consider perhaps in the first two years it was a bit more external employees, but you could take 50-50 or 45-55 as a good basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The other one is on the, the other question is on A400M. Could you please just bring us up-to-date with where you are? You mentioned in your press release about the propulsion system suppliers. Now the engine guys are saying that actually they've delivered on time and their product works fine. Airbus Military is the guy that's putting it all together and that's where the problem is. So we're getting somewhat conflicting stories from yourselves and from the engine guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am extremely surprised. But I could give you my side of the truth. The, first good news, the engine is tested in, under flying test bed in Cambridge. And the flying tests of the engine are good. So far we had three tests, and all of them are good so far and it's a good indication of the quality of the engine</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what's the problem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The engine is good that's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what's the problem then if the engine is good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I continue please? The problem is that to put the engine on the airframe on the airplane, we need the computer of the, for this engine, which is, controlling the engine is called FADEC, Full Authority, I don't know exactly what mean FADEC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Digital Engine Control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But FADEC is a computer of the engine and the propulsion system. This FADEC is not tested on the flying test bed because we are using a very simplified FADEC because we have only one engine on four. It means that this FADEC is not available today. And it's because of the FADEC that we are late.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are discussing with the engine manufacturers on the delivery and clearance of the FADEC allowing us to have the first flight for the airplane. We are discussing in a very positive way with engine manufacturers. And we want to have a date, which is realistic, and we could announce to our customers. Because the date of the first flight is an essential milestone for us because we said we will deliver the first airplane three years after the first flight. It means if we want to give a delivery schedule to customers, we need to know the first flight date. It means we need to know the availability date of the FADEC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's a FADEC issue. Is the airframe air worthy, is that all resolved? Is there an issue, any other issue besides the FADEC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have, if you take the global airplanes, we could say that for the time being the FADEC is on the critical path. We are, I have to say, we are late on the final assembly of the fuselage. It's not on the critical path, and we have to avoid to put it on the critical path, it's clear. But Airbus is working on it. And after that we have to secure the availability of the systems, and we have three or four major systems we are following very carefully. The first one is the navigation system. The second one is a flight management system. The third one is a military mission system. And fourth one is the cargo-handling system, which is also complex. It's not unusual. It's a very advanced airplane for the next 40 years. It's clear that on each of the system we have a state-of-the-art, and we have to check that it's not becoming a new cause of delay. Some of the systems are under our responsibility of Airbus. Some of this are on the responsibility of big suppliers you know them Sajem, Paris, Reim, Vitale and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I know it's a remote possibility and I'd attach a very low probability to it, but if the OCCAR members were to say, thank you very much, we don't want this product anymore, could we have our money back please. Can EADS withstand that kind of a hit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will need some negotiation with customers. I don't believe that anybody wants to create such an issue to EADS. To be very frank, I, we don't, we have no sign of such position by the different customers. The German and the French have expressed clearly the wish to negotiate. It means to continue the program. It is same for the Spanish. For the British have not said the opposite. It means that the unanimous consent to terminate the program seems to be absolutely unlikely, but we are in the end of our customers, is that clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you say everyone is willing to negotiate. What exactly are you negotiating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will negotiate first the time schedule. The time, the time schedule for the delivery, that it's the main issue for the customers. They want to know when they receive airplanes and not only the first one. But they want to know the ramp-up of production and at what reason we are able to ramp-up the production, that is a first point. Second, we want to discuss with them different standard for deliveries. It will allow us to deliver earlier airplanes if we are able to deliver different standards. And we have to discuss with them what kind of standards we could deliver the first one and the second one.</p>
          <p>Third, some element of the contract seems, seem important to be discussed with customers. I could the penalties, for example, that it's an issue and that's clear. And also perhaps some element like the escalation for taking into account inflation and other technicalities. It means that we have a lot of things to discuss with the customers. And I don't expect an easy discussion. But I am recognizing that the different countries are ready to open the discussion. I could say also they will wish to discuss with us the bridging solution when they have, when they have a capacity gap due to delays. They want to see if there are some bridging solutions to help them for, to wait for the airplane.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Olivier Brochet from NATIXIS, France.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning to all of you. I have two questions. The first one is the regarding Airbus and the funding support that you got from France on export guarantees. Do you expect similar measures from the U.K. and from Germany and when do you expect such announcements? And second question is on price pressure that you mentioned on Airbus. Is it pressure that is built in the order book and that will continue to flow out in '09? Or is it something new coming from negotiations with client? And what is the current situation in terms of pricing at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could give you the answer for the second question. I shall leave the first one to Hans Peter. The pricing pressure we have in 2009 is due to orders agreed in the past years. It's not due to 2008 or 2009 new orders. And the opposite 2008 orders have been taken at a fairly good price and above our forecast. And we have not seen deterioration of price last year. For this year the number of order is not significant enough to have an idea on the evolution of price. But when we are talking about price deterioration, in, it's on deliveries. It means with orders taken in the past years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>On the.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the funding support, Olivier, of Airbus, yes, there was the announcement on the French side, the five billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>package, which was announced, support we should get through the French, big French banks. As you have probably seen there was immediately after, I think it was only a few days after a statement of the State Secretary in Germany announcing that Germany wants to help as well in case it's necessary. All of this is required only if we do not find the liquidity behind the ECA guarantee in the market to be clear. I mean this is not something, which is going to be a subsidy sometimes. There is an impression we are getting a subsidy here. It's not the case. We are paying market prices. And we are doing it at market conditions.</p>
          <p>And it's just the issue that for some of the European banks it has become rather difficult to get liquidity in dollar. And we need dollar liquidity. The issue we are discussing currently in case this support becomes necessary is really to establish a tool through which we can do it. We still discuss in France, in Germany. And we have initiated that into the UK as well. So we are, I think, on a good track and what we can see today is that some of the banks are coming back to ECA funding because simply the spreads have significantly changed compared to what we've seen in the past. So ECA backed deals for banks were until mid of last year rather unattractive because of very low margins. This has changed in the current environment where liquidity has a significant price again.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Edward Stacey from HSBC UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes, it's Ed Stacey here. Two questions if I may. The first one on cancellations, I know you gave a number already for the cancellations and deferrals in 2008 in civil aircraft. So if you could update us what you've seen so far this year, and what kind of your guidance, your current plan for maintaining current build rates. What kind of cancellations could be absorbed in that plan? And then the second question on the A380 ramp-up, which you're still saying challenging. You talked previously about wiring still being an issue. That you're still having to do some of that by hand. Is there some other issues that still need to be resolved, and when could we think about A380 starting to book positive series margins, do you envisage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first, the figure, we have given the figure of the cancellation in 2008. It's mainly due to two elements, which are the bankruptcy of Skybus and the shift from the last A350, the first A350 to the new A350. And we have not seen many cancellations linked to the present financial crisis. It's the same for the two first months of the year. It doesn't mean that we are not expecting cancellation for the rest of the year. And we will see some of them I'm sure.</p>
          <p>Hans Peter is saying to me that we have twelve announced in January, which is not for the timing, is limited number compared to other crisis. We are more under pressure for deferral of airplanes, and you have seen that for example Air France is wishing to defer, to delay the delivery of two A380. We have more discussion with airlines on deferrals than on cancellations for the time being. And we, for the time being, we manage it in a way, which allow us to confirm that we still expect to deliver the same number of airplane in 2009 as last year, almost the same. We will see at the end of the year. It could be a bit below, and we are managing, we are trying, we are managing 2010 with our, what, with our over booking. On the A380 ramp-up, it's a still challenge. I have to say. It means that we're putting too much resources on each airplane and putting too much resources on each airplane. It's costing more. And we have, we have not the resources needed for the next airplane. And it means it is slowing down the ramp-up, the ramp-up. It means that it's a still challenging, but we are confident that we could reach the 18 engines, the 18 airplanes for 2009. And we see improvement in the process. It means that progressively we are recovering control of the equipment of the fuselage. But it's certainly, it's a longer than expected and more costly than expected.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's actually, Andy Hobesian here calling on the line. I've got two questions. The first of all, on R&amp;D you're guiding it to going up. I assume that increase is pretty much all A350. So if you can just provide some color on what's causing the R&amp;D number to go up? The second one, could you just comment on what percentage of your deliveries, which you planned in the second half of this year, what percentage actually has hard cash funding behind the delivery? So I am not just talking about something that ECA backed, but actually something where the banks have signed-off and the money truly is there, if you could give some color on the coverage that you have there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On R&amp;D, first question indeed A350 is a major driver of that. We increase on A350. There is some increase on continuous development in Airbus, but major driver is A350, and on top of it we see some increase in R&amp;D as well. In Eurocopter, we said that's linked to the Chinese co-development program and also a little bit in Astrium and the defence, so it's spread over the divisions. But obviously the Airbus numbers are the significant ones.</p>
          <p>On the transparency, I think the second question was on terms, in terms of transparency of the delivery funding going forward. What we can say as of today is that until the summer break we think there is good visibility, and there is funding in place for nearly all of the delivery positions as far as we can judge that in discussions with the airlines obviously. So we expect limited funding support in the first half as of now. Obvious, we are working on getting the same level of transparency for the second half, which obviously is much more difficult because as we go into September to December the uncertainty is obviously bigger and not all of the commitments, funding commitments are in place with the banks. But for the time being near-term, we think, we have a good level of visibility, and we think the delivery program can be somewhat executed as we have envisaged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean in the second half, let's say. I mean I appreciate maybe that it's early days but how much of the second half are you currently totally comfortable with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot give you any more precise answer on that. I just can say the level of uncertainty is increasing in the second half, and I would not be able to put, I would say, somewhat meaningful reliable number on that.</p>

And I think there is a convergence between U.K and Germany, which we are at the beginning not on the same line. There is a convergence between both countries and I don't want to be more precise. And I, we could expect a decision on Tranche 3 in due time to avoid the interruption of the assembly line. And we could have this decision, perhaps before the German elections. It's, I am, I think we could because I'm not sure, and it's depending on the customers. But discussion is progressing fairly positively, I have to say, for the time being.</p>
