          <p>As usual Chandra and Maha will give us a brief overview of the company's performance and that would be followed by a Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue or earnings guidance and any thing said on this call, which reflects our outlook for the future, or which can be constituted as a forward-looking statement, must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the results presentation e-mailed to you and which is also available on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chandra to begin the proceeding.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we have had a quarter of an all round out performance. This is a quarter in which we have delivered a volume of over 8% &#x2013; 8.1% and rupee term revenue of 6.2% and a constant currency revenue of 7.3%.</p>
          <p>From the historical point of view in absolute numbers, this has been the best quarter since September 2008 and in terms of constant currency, this is the best quarter since September 2007. And this result has come about in a very holistic manner. All our industry segments have done very well. In the past few quarters, we saw the BFS segment leading the growth. In this quarter BFS has done extremely well, however, there are other industry segments who have done very well as well as some who have done better than BFS segment. At least, three industry segments have delivered double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>From a geographic point of view, the growth has come from all markets in terms of constant currency, again, we have grown all the geographies, U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe both continental and U.K., Middle East, Africa, India, Asia Pacific. All have delivered growth. However, the growth has been led by both U.S. and Asia Pacific in this quarter. In terms of the deals that we signed, we signed 10 large deals, and all of the deals are in the non-BFS segment. Couple of deals each from manufacturing and hi-tech industries, and then a deal each in various segments like Retail, Life-Sciences, Healthcare, etcetera.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the quarter, very clearly we knew that there is a significant headwind in terms of margin from the salary increase perspective that only got compounded by the Euro and the Sterling causing another headwind.</p>
          <p>Our teams, both the business teams and the finance teams have done an incredible job of managing these segments and deliver an operating margin of about 27.15%, just a 36 basis points below the last quarter, sequential quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of employees, we added a significant number of employees and considering the demand environment we're going to increase the target from a gross of 30,000 to a gross of 40,000 at this point. As for the bank's product, it has done extremely well this quarter, eight of the implementations have gone live and we signed 13 new deals, which are very good. About the deal pipeline, it is very robust and again we have a good number of deals in all markets across industry segments I would at least specify there are 15 important deals going on one-third of which are coming out of discretionary spend critical projects.</p>
          <p>From the overall environment point of view, I'm very well aware and we as a management team are fully cognizant of the macroeconomic conditions, which is very dynamic at this point in time. But our bottom-up data indicates that the momentum is good, the pipeline is good, and we're seeing signs of discretionary spending with the type of deals that we are participating in.</p>
          <p>So there is this disconnect between the macro situation and the bottom-up data. I would just leave it at that. But we remain very positive and we remain closely engaged with our clients, and look forward to good coming months.</p>
          <p>With those opening remarks, I'll pass it on to Maha, to provide a little more color on the financials and later on we'll be happy to take any detailed questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Chandra. So let me begin by repeating the headline number. We posted a revenue of INR 82.173 billion or 8,217 crores, which is a growth of 6.2% Q-on-Q and 14% year-on-year. In constant currency, we grew by 7.3% quarter-on-quarter</p>
          <p>In dollar terms, there was the cross currency impact of 86 basis points negative this quarter resulting in the reported revenue of INR 1.794 billion that's a sequential growth of 6.4% and 21.2% on a year-on-year basis. The break up of quarterly revenue growth in INR terms is volume growth is plus 8.1%, exchange is negative 1.09%, pricing is negative 0.32%, effort mix that is shipping from onsite to &#x2013; from offshore to onsite that is a negative 0.48%; total 6.2%.</p>
          <p>Moving onto costs, you may &#x2013; you will &#x2013; you might recall from last year's &#x2013; last quarter's call that we implemented across the board wage increases that went into effect of the start of the financial year. We were able to mitigate the resulting margin impact almost entirely through a combination of three things, better operational leverage, through holding many of the non-employee cost at about the same absolute level, this is what I've been saying. So second one is some offshore shift and the third one is better collections due to which we could reverse some past provisioning for bad debt. That is how we were able to hold the operating margin more or less steady at 27.15% even in a quarter with the severest margin headwind suffering only 36 basis points sequential decline that too mainly because of currency volatility.</p>
          <p>The impact of different levers of the operating margin is as follows: Currency &#x2013; minus 32 basis points, impact of wage hikes &#x2013; minus 215 basis points, offshore shift &#x2013; plus 15 basis points, rate productivity improvement &#x2013; plus 57 basis points, SG&amp;A efficiencies &#x2013;  plus 139 basis points.</p>
          <p>Other income was lower this quarter due to net foreign exchange loss of INR 472 million compared to the gains last quarter. Our tax rate also went up this quarter to 19.1% giving us a negative &#x2013; net margin of 22.45%. Our DSO for the quarter was 77 days. Cash and liquid funds stood at INR 95.2 billion.</p>
          <p>In summary, we matched the strong market-leading growth we posted this quarter with an equally strong, robust defense that took us fee-based hike and adverse currency movement in the stride that speaks to the resilients of our financial model and its ability to deliver in bad times and good.</p>
          <p>With that, we can open the line for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from the line of Balaji Prasad of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, good evening gentlemen. Congratulations on a good set of results. My first question is on your UK growth. This has been a quite impressive at 5.5% despite the pressure on the pound, do you see the upcoming renegotiation with PADA and any kind of pullback from BP affecting this and to what extent this will be affected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as far as the product contract is concerned, I think the government is doing the diligence and we are not at this point in time aware of any decisions where in the any negative decision towards the contract. We are in a good discussion with the client and the project is going on as per schedule and we have a very good contract. But any decision on the PADA contract, I don't think will have a negative impact on our performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's good to know. Also on BP, have you seen or have you been into that any kind of pullback in kind of projects that you're doing for them, that this could reduce in size?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Neither of these relationships are a cause of concern from our point of view, but in any case, at this point in time I don't envisage any negative impact to our performance because of these contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's &#x2013; that's wonderful. Secondly, if you look your collective impressions that you are having when you are discussing pricing with clients globally, I mean, also what kind &#x2013; how receptive have they been to any kind of pricing increase going forward? What are your thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have said repeatedly in the last three &#x2013; four months that the pricing environment as far as we are concerned is stable and we are looking to maintain the pricing environment in the immediate quarters. And there is definitely a demand pickup. And so I expect the pricing to go up in the latter part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. Any insights that you can provide on how this has been quite stable at your end while your peers have &#x2013; going through some pricing pressure. We've seen recently one of your peers have around 1.5% decline in pricing. Any particular insights that you can share with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really I can only say about us and I think the pricing environment is stable from our point of view. And we hope to maintain that in the immediate quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you so much for your time. Good luck for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Prasad. Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your Business Process Outsourcing business, particularly now that you've gone a little bit more than a year since the Citi acquisition and have you been able to leverage that. Any thoughts on sort of current pace of business and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the Business Process Outsourcing business is doing well. In fact post the crisis, the momentum on the BPO has picked up even from the financial services clients. We've been able to leverage the Citi deal and we have won more than five clients in the Financial Services segment. There we are continuing to ramp up and the Citi acquisition per se is ahead of the business plan at this point in time on the last five quarter &#x2013; last six quarter performance, it is ahead of the business plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing any change in the pace of either interest level or contracts actually being signed, I mean are your &#x2013; as the sales cycle starting to finally shorten a little bit or it's a spear off a Double Dip Recession extending them again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See the sales cycle for BPO is always long and it will continue to be long, it's always a long sales cycle for BPO. I don't want to say long and short, it is BPO sales cycle takes a little bit more time than the IT sales cycle in general. And that is a trend we are witnessing, as I said, we are aware of the macro environment and are carefully watching, but we are not seeing any impact of that in our sales cycle or at the delivery cycles or in the ramp ups.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my last question revolves around employee attrition, which clearly had stepped up for TCS in this quarter, as well as for some of your competitors and we read about significant coaching is that often some of the Tier 2 didn't have any bench, we are wondering sort of what's &#x2013; what steps you are taking sort of offset that and have the sort of the initial flurry of coaching eased at all or is the &#x2013; the coaching still very high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, is it from attrition point of view we have it has gone up to about 13.1% at this point in time compared to last quarter which was at 11.8% and there are a couple of reasons for that one is the seasonal part which is the &#x2013; this is the time some of the people leave for higher studies, and so usually quarter one the attrition is higher as compared to the remaining quarters in the financial year. The second one is, this is the time when we complete our appraisal process and we also announced our increments. So, as a result &#x2013; that led to some amount of attrition as a result of that. And the third one is of course which is industry growth related. And if there is a growth, it's bound to reflect on the attrition.</p>
          <p>But as far as the overall focus is concerned for us is on retention, so we are &#x2013; we have different schemes, different initiatives to &#x2013; for retaining our employees, and we have been able to retain our critical talent. So that we have been able to do pretty successfully going and as far as coaching is concerned, it depends, companies for example, we will not go ahead and coach people deliberately from other. It depends on kind of need that we have in the talent that is available in the market. So, it's at that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But having said that, retention &#x2013; employee retention is a key initiative the company at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Caso. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Jeff Rossetti calling on behalf of Joseph Foresi. Just wanted to follow-up on the question regarding attrition, could you &#x2013; you mentioned that the gross hiring guidance was increased to 40,000 from 30,000. Is there a certain amounts attributed to increased attrition and a certain amount attribute to expected growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The gross hiring increased that we have done it is primarily being driven by the demand growth that we see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so not too much related to the &#x2013; on the attrition side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on Continental Europe I know you mentioned that there is  a constant currency growth for all geographies, but could you may be discuss what kind of demand you are seeing within the Continental Europe and how that is changed in the last month or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of all markets the Continental Europe market has had the slowest growth in this quarter. The demand environment in Continental Europe is good. But the sale cycle in Continental Europe also tends to be a little longer. We expect that it will get better from here. For example, in this quarter we've had a constant currency growth of about 1.2% in continental growth. And we expect things to get better from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much and congratulation on the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to just clarify a bit more about the Europeans and you just said that the constant currency growth in continental Europe was 1.2% and can you just give what the U.K. constant currency growth was in comparison please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was sorry, 5.1%, because you, sorry, so you said that even that comes in &#x2013; those 1.2% you felt confident that things will get best from here. What is it that gives you that confidence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just based on the conversation we have with clients and the engagements we are pursuing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just &#x2013; just finally, you also mentioned that you had a number of banks deals, you signed 13 new banks deals in the quarter. Can you say, which geographies those were in and what the sort of application &#x2013; specific applications they were?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well distributed across the globe and there are four or five core banking deals. There are deals in the insurance sector. There are deals in the market infrastructure and custody area.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good evening and congratulations on a great quarter. Chandra, if you could just give us some color on the trends in the banking vertical because last few quarters we've seen strong growth led by merger and integration related work. I just wanted to understand is that leveling off. Also, I thought you mentioned that there were no new BFS deals in the large deals that you signed this quarter. So again, just trying to understand what sort of demand you're seeing there and finally if you could share what the constant currency growth was for the banking vertical this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The constant currency growth rate for banking vertical is 6.5% this quarter. And banking vertical, the demand environment continues to be good and it is not that we are not signing the banking deals. There is a number of deals we have signed in the banks product related deals. In terms of pure IT services, we're pursuing a good number of deals in the banking and financial services vertical. In fact, of all the deals that we are pursuing I would say that banking and financial services has more number of the deals on those sectors. So I would say that the outlook for banking and financial services and insurance sector looks good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up to that. If you could give us some color in terms of what is the kind of demand you're seeing from the banks in terms of nature of projects now that probably integration work is more or less getting completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing some transformation deals, deals in the area of compliance, deals in the area of replatforming. When I say replatforming changing from legacy to go to set of our application. There is interest in terms of analytics. And there are also deals coming in the remote infrastructure management space. So and then there are deals in the BPO space from the financial services sector. So I think the type of deals vary, Mitali.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. It's very helpful. And overall on the pipeline, you have mentioned that the discretionary project is a large chunk. How has that changed over the last three months , has the proportion in the pipeline actually moved up? Also if you could comment on what is the mix in the pipeline from new customers, may be perhaps first time offshorers, and from sort of existing outsourcing deals coming up for re-bid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, in terms of the pipeline definitely the deals from a discretionary spend proportion of that in the pipeline has gone up. In fact three quarters, last three quarters, until the previous quarter we have said that the most of the deals are non-discretionary fund in nature, efficiency related in nature, but we are seeing deals coming out of the discretionary spend in the pipeline. Clearly that is a positive that I'm happy to report this quarter. Then, from the point of view of existing versus new client, I think it's a good healthy mix, most of the deals that I'm talking about are either new clients, or clients where we have a smaller presence and we are having an opportunity to increase the presence, but although there are also deals with existing customers that we are pursuing. I don't know whether I answered your question or did you have anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and just on, is there a large chunk coming from existing deals that you are perhaps gaining share from incumbents?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, whenever there is a deal that is in the area of efficiency or taking cost out, there will always be incumbents. Okay, so those type of deals always face incumbents plus new providers, but the discretionary spend deals are probably &#x2013; are all new projects where we have to compete.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just one last question on pricing. I heard your comments earlier. Just wanted to understand what is the risk of volume discount perhaps kicking in, as some of the older renegotiations -- as a result of some of the older renegotiations in the past few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mitali, I think all I would say is that we believe we can maintain the pricing at the current levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Ghosh. Our next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah of ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just on the attrition if we look at this quarter, the percentage of three &#x2013; more than three years of experience has moved up by almost 300 basis points. Is it fair to say that, we are realizing attrition more towards less than three years experience bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way to look at that is also there has been a significant lateral adds this quarter, and our HR team has done a stupendous job of meeting the volume growth demand by ensuring that we've hired a large number of people and provide the right mix to the engagements. So that to some extent we'll have a distortion. And also in this quarter, traditionally, I mean though I don't have the exact number to give you on the call, traditionally in the first quarter, we have people who have been &#x2013; who have joined one or two years quitting for higher studies and that adds to the attrition. So a portion of that that you see is due to that. So these are the two explanations I can give you and obviously if you want more data you can contact Ajoy later on and he will be happy to share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is helpful. Second, in terms of the new deals, which are coming, are they coming at higher than the company average billing rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandeep, why don't you just leave at the fact that the pricing is going to be maintained and we are looking at an upward bias at the end of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And just Maha...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, end of the &#x2013; end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and Maha, just on the hedging can you give us a color in terms of the outstanding old covers and any new covers taken for the coming quarter or for the quarter beyond Q2 FY '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know they are very little of outstanding of the old cover. This quarter we will have something like $75 million of old cover &#x2013; which was taken at I think 42.30 that will come back. And then the balance remaining is something like a $30 million over a period of time. So then it will all be over. And as far as the current hedges are concerned, we took some hedges for Q2 and the &#x2013; and something more little later but they are all reasonably small. We have outstanding hedge of about $455 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Okay and any color in terms of the average strike rate for these contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For those ones, they are a combination of dollar and euro and so on. As far as the dollar is concerned, the &#x2013; the best strike is about 46.33.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And just Maha in terms of the margin in the coming quarter we may have a headwind through promotion as well as there could be a normalization of the provision for doubtful debts. So I am not asking for a guidance but just in terms of a direction of the margin do you believe it's sustainable in the coming quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I have said, our intent as these &#x2013; we've always said we don't give guidance. But our intent is that it should be around the 27% mark. As you have correctly put it, the base increase comes in two places for us &#x2013; April to June we have got the increments and July to September, we've got the promotions and therefore it will kick-in. So that is a headwind that we have. We are also in a growth phase in that &#x2013; Chandra and Ajoy have said that there is a fairly big recruitment program that is going on. And therefore, there are going to be additional employee costs that are coming in. And as you may have noticed and so on, we have also not cut down on some of the sales related costs and so on, some of the costs have gone up, while other costs we have controlled. So these are there. But in a growth environment, we believe with adequate cost control measures and the productivity improvements and so on we would be able to take on these headwinds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. So we still maintain our internal target of 37% EBIT margins for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, no guidance, no guidance at all. I mean these are all aspirational statements and I just want to also add that that I said we would be able to take on, I am not saying that we will be able to take on so we would be &#x2013; we'll. You know the direction of the board it's critical quarter, where we have had a 215 basis points issue with this you know a wage hike we have still managed to restrict the decline to 36 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. The Telecom vertical seems to have grown pretty well this quarter. What are the trends there and how do you see that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>: In the Telco vertical, we've done well. But you should also note that the Telco vertical had the biggest fall over the last few quarters. So it's coming of that and it is a strong good growth and I think our pipeline is good, our ramp ups are good so and positive good growth but I am not going to give you a number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. And with reference to your constant currency for manufacturing, how does it look?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Manufacturing on a constant currency basis delivered close to 4%, 390 basis points.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congrats on a good set of numbers. Just a couple of questions. I think we've seen &#x2013; we've seem to have seen a good revival in some of your 12 double sectors notably Manufacturing and Telecom. What do you think has driven this revival and how sustainable do you think this would be going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as I have said the &#x2013; we are happy that these verticals have come back. But you know the macro situation can affect these verticals, definitely Manufacturing it can affect. But as we see today, the data points we have, we're positive good growth in these verticals. The pipeline is good and we have had a good conversation with client. But these are verticals, which are susceptible to the macroeconomic situations. We just need to watch out but it looks good at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. My second question relates to the strength of this overall recovery. It seems to have been surprised quarter-after-quarter by that kind of volume growth that large caps such as yours have reported. My question is, is this, should we view this is a beginning of another wave of offshoring there, you will continue to gain market share at a much faster pace than expected and if that's happening where do you think that the new pockets of penetration are opening out for you?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, congrats on great quarter. My questions are well under your Enterprise vertical. What has been the constant currency growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Enterprise Solutions, constant currency growth is 4%, but the business entities separate between Enterprise Solutions and Business Intelligence actually both  should be looked at together, Business Intelligence constant currency growth is around 0.5%, Enterprise Solutions in 4%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. You know in the last quarter, we had a slight decline in enterprise, in this quarter you know but it has grown slower than probably other verticals. And you've said that discretionary, signs of discretionary pick are visible. I mean what's our expectation or from this particular service line as such?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you know, please see what a same context, from a point, where we did not see any discretionary spending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing signs of discretionary spending. And their business engagements, in these engagements then deliver these engagements then book revenues. So you're not going to see a dramatic shift in the next quarter or so. But the momentum is good, it is going to increase from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, right. That was helpful. And secondly on your lateral hires, we've seen almost two consecutive quarters a very strong lateral addition more than 5,000 employees each quarter. I mean has our focus on lateral addition increased and if so what are the demand led moves that have made us increase our focus on lateral addition as such?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the lateral addition part, yes. And normally in Q1, which is the first quarter, the lateral addition is higher because the trainees start joining in towards the end of Q1 or early Q2 onwards, but as far as our overall pyramid since then we are pretty conscious of that and we are going to maintain that pyramid.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It looks good.  And in terms of discretionary spend again, any particular vertical that you're seeing in this quarter, the higher rate increase in terms of in client interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>BFS definitely. I mean, three or four or five verticals I can mention; BFS, retail and consumer goods, then we have travel verticals, we are seeing utilities. So we're seeing interest starting to pick up in many of our verticals, but again, although the proportion is small. So we just need to wait for this to pick up momentum.</p>

          <p>Hi, good evening, Sir. Congrats on a very good set of numbers. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to get some sense on the verticals that you spoke about. Most of the verticals at this stage has grown more than the BFSI vertical. As I am reading numbers correctly, there has been almost a double-digit growth in most of your verticals, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. Double-digit growth at most, I'd love that, but in &#x2013; I'd love that &#x2013; I'd love that situation, but it's not true. I think on actual currency basis, there are four verticals, which are double-digit.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

          <p>Okay, okay, great. So what is the sense of going forward for all these emerging verticals, which are being strong right now for you in the retail and the energy particularly? So does this pertain to a particular sort of service line that you are catering to or a particular geography that you are looking at right now for all these emerging verticals?</p>

          <p>As long as the overall macro situation does not result in a serious impact, which we are not seeing now, but should something happen, then that's the concern we should have.

          <p>Yeah, thanks. All of my questions have been answered. Just one book keeping question. Sir, your tax rate of course were as expected has gone up quite steeply during this particular quarter. You would expect it to remain at this level at around 19% for the full year?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is no rationalization per se, but there's a lot of cost management that really takes place. And, I think we have &#x2013; we had initially set a target of 19, we are doing somewhat better than that. And we'll probably be around this level.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good evening gentlemen and congratulations on a very strong quarter. I have two questions, very brief ones, one is on your utilization rates getting up towards 83% including trainees, to what extent are you comfortable with this? And can you give us any sense of how you see it going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so utilization rate if you look at excluding trainees it's 82.6 and normally as we said the utilization rate is pretty high and we are going to increase our recruitment and that is what we're doing. We have increased our recruitment target also from 30,000 to 40,000. So that's what is going on and including trainees if you see it is still at 74.8% and usually we like that to be somewhere around &#x2013; it depends, at the time, when the trainees come in they go through training and then they get deployed. So it varies from 72 to 76 somewhere in that range. Including trainees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And Salim on the &#x2013; there were questions early on about Continental Europe and you sound very bullish about your pipeline in Continental Europe which is interesting. Could you give us some flavor please in terms of which states to &#x2013; which industries, what services, and even what region your &#x2013; your pipeline is particularly strong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to correct this. I want to make sure that I am rightly depicted. I did not sound bullish. I did not sound negative. I was not negative and I said the  Continental Europe has the lowest book rate ouf all markets at this point in time. We had a 1.2% constant currency growth. From here I expect to grow further. And we are seeing opportunities in the BFS segment, in the manufacturing segment, utility segment, pharmaceutical segment. In all these areas we are definitely seeing opportunities. As I said, I really can't comment on the macro situation. That's &#x2013; that is there for all of us to see, but from our flow point of view, discussion point of view, I think it's going to get better from here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">

          <p>Yeah, hi. Despite having strong growth, we continue to have some amount of offshore shift. Do you think that's sustainable when growth continues to be strong or it &#x2013; we could have some proportion moving onsite going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>We continue to drive the offshore program.

So, the kind of deal what we are foreseeing and speaking right now 15 odd deal, what we have said. So, what kind of demand environment we see for consulting kind of assignments.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think consulting seems to be good at this point in time. As the discretionary area picks up, there will be more opportunities. But I think, overall the mood is good in consulting. But actually it's not showing in numbers yet, but I think as the environment picks up on the discretionary spend, I think we will see more opportunity for consulting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">

          <p>Definitely I &#x2013; as I have said Europe in general, U.K. including is lagging behind compared to U.S., and the emerging markets Asia-Pacific and other markets in the emerging region will show a good growth.</p>

          <p>I want to thank all of you for joining the FY11 Q1 earnings call. To sum up, I would just say that it has been a good quarter and our metrics across the board on the revenue side, volume side, pricing side, margin side are all very satisfactory. I think we have a good base for the year and the customer portfolio has done very well. If you see the mix across the 1 million, 5 million, 10 million, 20 million, 50 million customers, they are all nicely moving up and we see a healthy pipeline. We are looking good to add additional employee targets that we have.</p>
          <p>Overall, we look positive, despite the fact that we have a macro environment, which is very, very dynamic. We'll continue to be very watchful, as far as the environment is concerned. And should there be any cost corrections we need to take, we will take. Thank you all. See you next quarter.</p>
