        <plist>
          <p>...and welcome to Procter &amp; Gamble's quarter end conference call. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&amp;G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.</p>
          <p>As required by Regulation G, P&amp;G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items.</p>
          <p>P&amp;G has posted on its website www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&amp;G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'm here with &#x2013; this morning with Bob McDonald and Teri List-Stoll.</p>
          <p>The second quarter results we released this morning were good, at the high end of our initial forecast on the top line and well ahead of the forecast on operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow. These better than expected results will enable us to raise our sales, earnings per share and share repurchase outlook for the fiscal year while, and this is important, simultaneously strengthening our innovation and marketing plans in the back half.</p>
          <p>Organic sales grew a strong 3%, which is at the high end of our 1% to 3% guidance range. Organic volume grew two points and pricing added two points to organic sales growth. Product and geographic mix reduced sales by a point. Organic sales growth was broad based with all segments up 2% or more for the quarter. Foreign exchange impact lowered sales growth by one point leaving all-in sales up 2%, a point above the high end of the guidance range.</p>
          <p>Global market share trends have continued to improve, we held or grew market share in businesses representing 50% of sales in the December quarter, up from 45% of sales in the September quarter and 30% in the June quarter. We have more work to do, but the underlying trends are improving.</p>
          <p>Moving to the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $1.39, ahead of our guidance range of $1.18 to $1.25 per share. All-in earnings include $0.21 of non-core holding gains from the purchase of the balance of our baby care and feminine care joint venture in Iberia, which we completed in October, and $0.05 of non-core restructuring investments to drive productivity improvement. Core earnings per share were $1.22, up 12% versus the prior year, much stronger than we had initially forecast. The better-than-expected earnings were driven by top of range sales growth, strong productivity savings, and a small pick up from a higher than expected gain on divestiture of our Western European bleach business.</p>
          <p>Core operating profit margin grew 110 basis points, including 160 basis point of productivity improvements and cost savings. Core gross margin also improved 110 basis points. Cost savings and productivity helped gross margin by 100 basis point and pricing improved gross margin by roughly 90 basis points. These benefits were partially offset by a 100 basis point negative impact from a combination of product and geographic mix. Commodity costs were essentially neutral to gross margin for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Core SG&amp;A costs were in line with the prior year as a percentage of sales. Overhead cost savings of approximately 60 basis points were offset by increased plans and benefits costs, and modestly higher marketing spending.</p>
          <p>The core tax rate was 24.4%, slightly below the prior-year level. That impact on year to year change in the tax rate was about a penny on the quarter.</p>
          <p>On an all-in basis, including restructuring costs, gross margin improved 80 basis points, and SG&amp;A costs were in line with the prior year as a percentage of sales. All-in operating profit margin improved by 800 basis points, driven by non-core charges taken in the base period.</p>
          <p>We generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which was also ahead of our initial forecast. We expect to deliver around 90% cash flow productivity for the year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we returned $3 billion of cash to shareholders, $1.6 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchase. During the first half of the fiscal year, we returned $7.2 billion to shareholders, $3.2 billion in dividends and $4 billion in share repurchase.</p>
          <p>These second-quarter results combined with those of the first quarter enabled us to raise our outlook on the top line, bottom line and on share repurchase while simultaneously strengthening plans. We're continuing to make good progress on the productivity plan we outlined at the CAGNY conference last February and on the growth priorities we discussed at the Citi conference last May. Our priorities continue to be maintaining strong developing-market momentum, strengthening our core developed market business, building a strong innovation pipeline, and aggressively driving cost savings and productivity improvements.</p>
          <p>We maintained growth momentum in the developing markets in the December quarter with organic sales up 7%. BRIC were markets up 11%, led by Brazil and India with organic sales growth of over 20%.</p>
          <p>An important component of our developing-market plans is continued expansion of our portfolio. The globalization of our oral care portfolio has been one part of this. We've added the oral care category in 34 countries over the last four years. Every market is delivering at or above our going-in expectations for both sales and market share.</p>
          <p>Progress in some of the early-expansion markets continues to be very strong. In Brazil, oral care shipments were up more than 50% in the December quarter, driven by the launch of 3D White toothpaste, Whitestrips and the benefit of full national distribution. We're growing in all channels and across all forums in the oral care category in Brazil. Oral-B toothpaste share is now fast approaching 9% on a national basis, up nearly 3 points versus year ago.</p>
          <p>Additional oral care geographic expansions are planned this calendar year, including a launch in Australia in a few weeks.</p>
          <p>Another example is Gillette Guard, our breakthrough, value-tier system razor, which has been a big success in India. We expanded Guard to Egypt last quarter, and we're testing it in other developing markets where double-edge blades are still the predominant shaving tool.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to build scale in developing markets, which is enabling solid profit growth. We're localizing production, which lowers supply-chain costs, and we're improving the productivity of our SG&amp;A spending as these businesses grow. These are two important drivers of the profit improvement we expect to deliver in our top-10 developing markets this year. In aggregate, we expect after-tax profit in these 10 markets to increase by about 35% versus last year, including negative foreign exchange impacts, and around 50% on a local-currency basis.</p>
          <p>We're doing all of this while increasing marketing spending and accelerating the pace of innovation. While we're being appropriately choiceful, we are in no way pulling back in developing markets. To the contrary, we're moving strongly forward.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're strengthening our core developed-markets business. We're ensuring we have sufficient plans to achieve our objectives in the 40 largest category/country combinations, most of which are in developed markets. These businesses account for about 50% of company sales and 70% of operating profit.</p>
          <p>The interventions we made during the last calendar year in four core U.S. categories are continuing to drive strong results. In U.S. laundry detergents, value share has been progressively improving following the consumer value corrections on the Gain brand and the growth of Tide Pods. Value share for U.S. detergents are up sequentially on a past 12, 6, 3 and 1 month basis. Tide share in the high-30s, up a-point-and-a-half versus prior year and Gain value share is back to 15% for the first time in over a year.</p>
          <p>Market share results in U.S. auto dishwashing detergents have also improved sequentially. Past three month Cascade value share is now at 60%, up a-point-and-a-half versus prior year.</p>
          <p>Gillette's share is up nearly 2 points at 74% in the U.S. male blades and razors category. The Fusion franchise is up more than a point at 37.5% and Mach3 is in line with prior year at about 21%.</p>
          <p>In U.S. oral care, Crest toothpaste's market leading value share is above 36%, in line with prior year levels. Across the U.S. business, we held or built share in businesses representing nearly 60% of sales. We've seen strong sequential improvement in the share trend across our top 20 brands in the U.S. on a past 12 month basis, only 25% of the top 20 brands were holding or growing share. That figure is up to 60% on a past three month basis and 65% for the most recent period in the United States.</p>
          <p>January marks the first month of full plan deployment and innovation strengthens as the year progresses, so we expect further improvement in market share results in back half of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Innovation underpins both developed and developing market efforts as does our work to drive greater productivity in everything we do. On the point of innovation, Tide Pods have reached a 6% value share in less than a year. We expect Pods will generate about $0.5 billion of sales this fiscal year on one brand in one country. Tide Pods deliver as much cleaning powder as the six next leading competitive unit dose products combined. A big reason we currently hold a 75% share of the unit dose form. We've now established Pods capacity in Europe and will begin the rollout of Ariel Pods in April, additional markets and brands will follow.</p>
          <p>We've driven the growth in a new category with Downy Unstoppable in-wash scent boosters. Unstoppables keep clothes fresh for up to 12 weeks until you wear them. Unstoppable consumption is twice as high as we initially expected. We launched a new spring scent earlier this month to further expand the Unstoppables lineup. We are marketing this innovation in only three countries so far: the U.S., Canada and Japan.</p>
          <p>Our air care business just introduced new Febreze Stick &amp; Refresh, which combines Febreze's unique slow-release scent technology with a no residue adhesive from our Connect and Develop innovation partner 3M. Febreze Stick &amp; Refresh sticks to any surface and works anywhere in your home to keep it fresh and odor free without plugs or batteries.</p>
          <p>The surface care category launched a Swiffer with Gain scent line extension to provide consumers with the fresh scent of Gain as they clean with Swiffer Dusters, WetJet and Sweepers. Swiffer is a good example of the benefits of scale and innovation coupling our substrate and perfume expertise with a strong brand equity from our laundry category to obsolete mops, feather dusters and rags.</p>
          <p>Cascade Platinum launched earlier this month. This follows the successful launch of Fairy Platinum in Western Europe earlier this year. Cascade and Fairy Platinum are designed to deliver powerful cleaning for dishes while also providing film protection to help maintain the sparkling look of dishwasher interiors.</p>
          <p>Next month we have three new things to communicate on Bounty. On the main Bounty lineup we'll be announcing towels that are two times more absorbent than the next leading national brand, we're upgrading Bounty basic with towels that are 50% stronger than the leading bargain brand and we're launching a new line called Bounty DuraTowel, letting consumers ditch their dishcloth and switch to Bounty DuraTowel, which is three times cleaner than their dirty dish cloth.</p>
          <p>Our entry into the sleep aids category continues to go very well. ZzzQuil is a non-habit forming sleep aid that is not for colds, not for pain, just for sleep. ZzzQuil has grown to nearly 20% value share in the U.S. sleep aids category, making it the number one branded sleep aid in terms of both units and value in the U.S. We began expanding ZzzQuil into Canada earlier this month.</p>
          <p>The expansion of Vicks cough and cold products in Russia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is also progressing well. The launch features the Vicks Nature Fusion line that combines effective medicine with the soothing experience of natural remedies. Sales in the expansion markets are ahead of initial expectations.</p>
          <p>Oral care launched its Oral-B Deep Sweep Power Brush two weeks ago. Deep Sweep cleans like a power brush and moves like a manual brush to remove more than 2 times the plaque of a regular manual toothbrush. 3DWhite toothpaste has now delivered market share growth in the U.S. every month since its introduction over 2.5 years ago.</p>
          <p>We're expanding the 3DWhite line, which includes toothpaste, brush, rinse, floss and Whitestrips around the world to continue building out our full oral care portfolio. Over the last nine months we launched 3DWhite products in the U.K., Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Switzerland, Austria, China, Brazil and Mexico. 3DWhite is driving strong share growth in Mexico and the U.K. Mexico reached an all-time high toothpaste value share of over 14% for the quarter, up nearly four points versus the prior year. In the U.K. the combination of 3DWhite, Oral-B Complete and Oral-B Pro-Expert drove value share to over 10%, up nearly 3 points versus prior year.</p>
          <p>Salon hair care's Illumina Color from Wella Professional launched in Western Europe in July and in North America in December. Illumina leverages a new patented microlight technology and is Wella's biggest innovation in the last 20 years. With Wella, consumers experience hair that appears lit from within. This breakthrough innovation will be launching in Latin America and Australia, New Zealand in March.</p>
          <p>U.S. skin care began shipping Olay Total Effects CC or color correction cream in December. Total Effects CC cream fights the seven signs of aging to correct fine lines, wrinkles and age spots and covers to provide a flawlessly beautiful complexion. This month they also introduce new mid-tier skin care boutique called Olay Fresh Effects aimed at younger consumers with a collection of cleansers and moisturizers that deep clean and hydrate to keep you looking beautifully fresh and vibrant.</p>
          <p>We've also begun a revitalization of Olay Regenerist with the launch of new Olay Microsculpting Cream. The reformulation includes two new anti-aging ingredients to penetrate quickly and regenerate surface cells to reveal younger looking skin fast. Visible wrinkle reduction starts in just one day and the look of 10 years of wrinkles can be reduced in just four weeks.</p>
          <p>COVERGIRL brand introduced two exciting innovations during the last quarter, the new Clump Crusher Mascara by LashBlast provides 200% more volume with zero clumps. COVERGIRL mascara sales growth has accelerated by nine points since the Clump Crusher launch.</p>
          <p>Also, COVERGIRL has entered the nail segment with the new Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Gloss. This line has 45 shades that provide high gloss color that can last as long as a week without the need for a topcoat. Initial results for COVERGIRL Nails are very strong. At one leading drug customer sales have exceeded market leader Maybelline's after just six weeks in market.</p>
          <p>We're currently launching a hair care innovation bundle that spans the vertical portfolio. We recently launched Pantene Expert Collection which includes two super-premium lines, Age Defy and Advanced+ Keratin Repair, priced 200% to 250% above the base Pantene line. Age Defy leverages a new formula based on our hair biology program yielding hair that acts ten years younger by thickening hair as if it had 6500 new strands. The Pantene Advanced+ Keratin Repair formula leverages a breakthrough in new conditioner technology to repair two years of hair damage in two minutes. We're expanding Pantene Expert Collection to Latin America later this quarter.</p>
          <p>We're also launching Vidal Sassoon Pro Series in the U.S., a complete hair care line offering shampoo, conditioner, styling and permanent color to give consumers salon genius brilliantly priced. Vidal Sassoon Pro Series is priced at a 50% to 75% index to the base Pantene shampoos and conditioners, providing us with a very strong brand in the salon affordable segment with a real salon heritage.</p>
          <p>We're bringing a bundle of Gillette innovations to market across Fusion and Mach3 blades and razors as well as shave preps, which is focused on sensitive skin. 70% of men believe they have sensitive skin and these innovations leverage the fact that our ProGlide products have been recommended by dermatologists in the U.S. as the best shave for sensitive skin.</p>
          <p>Like innovation, productivity also underpins all of our developed and developing market efforts. We're making strong progress against our commitments, but won't stop there. The overhead reduction plan we announced last February called for a reduction in non-manufacturing staffing of 10% or roughly 5,700 roles by the end of this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>As of the end of December, we've reduced 5,500 roles, more than 95% of our target reduction. It is likely that we will reach our initial staffing objectives four to five months ahead of schedule and as we announced at our analyst day meeting in November, we're committed to do more. Our new objective is to further reduce &#x2013; this is what we introduced at analyst day in November, the further reduction of non-manufacturing enrollment by an additional 2% to 4% per year from fiscal year 2014 through 2016. This will roughly double the amount of direct savings we deliver in core SG&amp;A, reducing our reliance on top line growth for leverage driven savings. Any additional enrollment progress we make in fiscal 2013 beyond our initial target will give us a head start on the fiscal 2014 to 2016 enrollment objectives.</p>
          <p>We have solid plans in place to deliver $1.2 billion in savings this fiscal year in cost of goods sold. I have established a stretch target beyond this of $1.4 billion. Our efforts in this area include a 5% net productivity increase across our manufacturing operations, even as we add new manufacturing capacity and enrollment in developing markets. For the first half of the year we are tracking well ahead of target at about 6.5% manufacturing productivity improvement.</p>
          <p>We're achieving efficiencies in marketing spend, particularly on non-media expenditures and are reinvesting these savings in strengthened plans. As we embrace our cost savings work we must and will keep our eye on the overriding objective of shareholder value creation with growth being an important part of this.</p>
          <p>At the end of last fiscal year our core operating profit margin was nearly 19% which compares to a simple average of 15 competitors of about 15.9%. Our operating margin is higher than 12 of the 15. This means we're effectively more leveraged to growth than most of our competitors and that there is significant value creation to be delivered through growth. In our endeavor to cut costs, we will not compromise our growth prospects or capabilities. We're building and executing our strategy with the objective of getting the savings and growth balance right.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn to our updated outlook for fiscal 2013 and the January-March quarter. Starting with the fiscal year, we're increasing organic sales growth guidance to a range of 3% to 4% compared to our prior range of 2% to 4%. The new range is comprised of volume growth of 2% to 3%, pricing contribution of about 2%, and negative mix of around 1%. We now expect all-in sales growth of 1% to 2%, this includes a foreign exchange headwind of about two points based on mid-January spot rates. We're raising our outlook for core earnings per share growth to a range of 3% to 6% from a previous range of down 1% to up 4%.</p>
          <p>This guidance includes earnings per share headwind from items such as higher cost for pensions and employee benefit plans and the impact of mandated price reductions in Venezuela. Combined these headwinds are reducing core earnings per share growth rate by about three percentage points. Adjusting for these our core earnings per share growth would be 6% to 9% for the year.</p>
          <p>The new earnings outlook equates to a core earnings per share range of $3.97 to $4.07, which compares to our previous guidance range of $3.80 to $4.00 per share.</p>
          <p>There are two items we called out as potential risks last quarter, which have largely been resolved with no material impact to earnings. We have managed through the absorbent jelly material supply issue for our diaper business with only minor disruption and added cost. And the U.S. corporate tax extenders that we had assumed in our forecast have now been enacted into law.</p>
          <p>There continue to be two notable earnings risks that are not included in our guidance. Our forecast is based on mid-January foreign exchange spot rates. A large devaluation of an important currency such as the Venezuelan bolivar would likely reduce our earnings outlook. Our guidance also assumes current market growth rates continue for the balance of this fiscal year and are not impacted by the payroll tax increase in the U.S., dynamics associated with the U.S. debt ceiling debate or by worsening conditions in Europe.</p>
          <p>We are increasing the all-in earnings per share range to $4.04 to $4.14, which compares to a prior range of $3.78 to $4.02 per share. The increase is largely due to the improvement in our core earnings per share expectations. In addition the $0.21 non-core holding gain resulting from our purchase of the balance of our baby care and feminine care joint venture in Iberia is roughly $0.04 per share higher than anticipated in our last guidance.</p>
          <p>We've updated our estimates for non-core restructuring investments which we now expect to be approximately $0.15 per share for the fiscal year. This compares to our previous estimate of $0.15 to $0.19 per share. The difference is driven by a timing shift for asset disposals and somewhat lower costs for organizational productivity improvements.</p>
          <p>We continue to expect free cash flow productivity of about 90% of net earnings for the year. We now expect capital spending to be around 5% of sales for the year, down from our prior estimate of 5.5%. This reduction is mainly due to capital efficiency and manufacturing productivity improvements, not a reduction in project scope.</p>
          <p>We expect to continue our 122 year track record of dividend payments and our 56 year track record of debit increases. The exact amount of increase subject to board approval and will be determined by the Board during the April Board Meeting. In addition we will repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion of stock this fiscal year. Based on current cash projections, we expect to be toward the high end of this range. This has improve from the $4 billion to $6 billion outlook we discussed at the analyst meeting November.</p>
          <p>Combined we expect to return $11 billion to $12 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2013. This represents a cash return in the range of 5.8% to 6.3% on our market cap of about $190 billion.</p>
          <p>For the January to March quarter we are estimating organic sales growth in range of 3% to 4%. At low end of 3%, this range represents growth in line with what we delivered for the December quarter. At the high end of 4% this range represents another quarter of sequential improvement.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange is expected to be roughly neutral to sales growth which leads to all-in sales growth guidance equal to the organic range of 3% to 4%. On the bottom line we expect March quarter core earnings per share in range of $0.91 to $0.97 or down 3% to up 3% compared to prior year core earnings per share of $0.94.</p>
          <p>We expect the effective tax rate for the March quarter to be about a point lower than last year, due to the true-up needed to reflect the U.S. corporate tax law changes made in early January. For the fiscal year we now expect the tax rate on core earnings to be around the prior year level of 24.2%.</p>
          <p>On an all-in basis we estimate earnings per share in the range of $0.90 to $0.96; this includes non-core restructuring charges of approximately a penny a share.</p>
          <p>Our back half earnings per share guidance reflects the strong level of innovation activity going into the market, as well as focused reinvestments to maintain positive market share momentum. We expect the majority of these investments to be in marketing spending with the balance focused on trial-building merchandising programs behind our new innovations.</p>
          <p>Comparing our first half core earnings per share growth to the back half, we expect marketing investments to be an eight to nine point headwind and tax to be a two to three point headwind. We are offsetting a portion of this with stronger top line results and higher cost savings, but back half core earnings per share growth will be several points below the first half level.</p>
          <p>In summary, our second quarter results were on track with our plan on the top line and ahead of plan on operating profit, earnings per share and cash. These results are enabling us to raise our sales, earnings and share repurchase outlook for the fiscal year while creating flexibility to further strengthen our plans in the second half.</p>
          <p>We remain confident that our focus areas: maintaining momentum in developing markets, strengthening our core developed market business, building a strong innovation pipeline and aggressively driving cost savings and productivity improvements are the right ones and should generate over time the kind of earnings progress that will put us among the best in our industry. This, combined with strong cash flow and a track record of capital returns to shareholders should enable us to generate superior levels of shareholder return.</p>
          <p>That concludes our prepared remarks. As reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides, which will be posted on our website www.pg.com, following the call.</p>
          <p>Bob, Teri and I will be happy to take your questions and the IR team will be available after the call to provide additional perspective as needed. With that, why don't we turn to questions?</p>

          <p>Hey, thanks, guys. The question is about the sales acceleration, so obviously the sheer number of new products you guys are launching is much higher than what we've seen more recently and that alone is going to drive better sales and market share, but I guess, can you give us a sense for why specifically you think that we are truly seeing the impact of higher quality innovation that might lead to more sustainable sales growth and why it is not just a result of accelerated activity that is not necessarily sustainable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Chris, Tide Pods is a great example of that. We introduced Tide Pods, which is a very discontinuous innovation. It's taken about three quarters of the unit dose category in the United States. When we look at the consumers that it's gaining, it's gaining consumers from up and down the income spectrum, so even though it might be priced as a premium on a per wash basis, you've got consumers who would buy lower priced brands trading up to that innovation. And as Jon said in his remarks, we expect by the end of the year this will be a $0.5 billion business.</p>
          <p>So you take $0.5 billion dollars of new business on one innovation, one discontinuous innovation, one country, one brand and as Jon said, we've already built the plant, we're expanding in Western Europe in April through June quarter. So you can just imagine the sales and earnings potential of just that one discontinuous innovation as we expand it around the world. I think that is probably the best example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You will also remember, Chris, I think at our analyst day discussion and Bruce Brown's presentation on innovation, we talked about an acceleration we are expecting on what we refer to as change innovation, which goes beyond commercial activity to truly change the consumer experience and the dynamics of a category. So we do think we're on a much stronger innovation footing as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course there are new categories we've entered, too. Jon mentioned ZzzQuil in sleep aids, we entered the auto care fragrance category and as we also talked, we've bolstered our new category innovation as well and we fully expect some of those innovations to come to market over the next year or so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So the increase in the low end of the organic sales growth guidance for the full year, can you discuss where you come in better than expected on a geographic basis and what is driving that confidence in general?</p>
          <p>And then it looks like in emerging markets the sales growth has slowed more like the 7% range the last couple quarters versus 10% over the past couple years, is that more of just a category growth issue with macro slowing a bit, or is it a market share issue? And can you talk about if you expect emerging markets to reaccelerate in the back half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Relative to geography, Dara, we are really seeing growth both in developed markets and developing markets.</p>
          <p>Recall our &#x2013; two of our four focus areas are maintaining our momentum in developing markets, and developing markets were up 7% this quarter. They were up 11% in the BRIC countries. And if you look at two major countries like China &#x2013; or like India and Brazil &#x2013; they were up 20%. So we're continuing to grow in developing markets.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to enter new category/country combinations. We'll enter 20 this year. We're continuing to build new factories in developing markets, roughly 20 that are on the drawing board now. So we're growing in developing markets, and a lot of that is the expansion of categories like Jon talked oral care. A lot of that also is growing market share.</p>
          <p>We're also growing in developed markets. We're strengthening our developing-market business. As Jon said, we've held or built share in businesses representing nearly 60% of the sales in the quarter in the U.S., and the interventions that we've put in place &#x2013; like in U.S. laundry, U.S. auto dish, U.S. male blades and razors, U.S. oral care, as Jon covered &#x2013; are helping us get our shares back to the point that we think they should be.</p>
          <p>So it is really broad-based. I think we said in our remarks, every segment of the business grew organic sales at least 2% or more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add one thing, and then I'll answer the next part of your question. If you look at &#x2013; everything that Bob just said is spot-on.</p>
          <p>If you look at versus expectation, what part of the business is exceeding the most, encouragingly that is North America. The reason that is encouraging is, one, that is one of our strategic priorities, and second, it is our most profitable business. So we're very encouraged by that.</p>
          <p>To your &#x2013; to the question of developing-market growth rates for P&amp;G and what we should expect going forward, we're still expecting 8% or higher growth &#x2013; so an acceleration of growth in the back half &#x2013; for the full fiscal year.</p>
          <p>You know, part of the 40, 20, 10 plan, as Bob mentioned, January is the first month when those are all fully in market. And those have a big developing-market component, as well. So our plans will be strengthening in the back half in developing markets, and we expect to accelerate the rate of sales growth even beyond what we've done so far.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on that, I was hoping you guys could comment a little bit on China because I know last quarter, there was a little bit of a surprise to me that that business had slowed, and there has been no mention of China at all on the call so far. So can you just give us an update? I know there was a lot &#x2013; it's sort of not supposed to accelerate for the second half, but I'd just love an update on the progress there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, Lauren. China organic sales grew high-single digits in the quarter and grew double digits last fiscal year. Share is still down a little bit versus last year, but about half of the business is holding or growing share, so about 50%. Share trends are improving on more than two-thirds of the portfolio that we have in China.</p>
          <p>We've got a strong portfolio of innovation launching this fiscal year, particularly here in the back half of the year. And we expect the combination of our interventions that we've already made and our innovation will return us to market-share growth in China.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good morning. You know, as we look at the market-share performance, you know we've obviously seen a ramp up in U.S. performance &#x2013; maybe not gaining share per se, but definitely losing a lot less share.</p>
          <p>Europe seems to be the big outlier there where it doesn't look like your share performance has improved all that much. Can you talk about what is different about that market from a share perspective? I know it's growing more slowly. Are there pricing adjustments you need? Is that an innovation question? So just a little bit of color on the European market shares. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, John, the market in Europe economically is challenged, and we believe that we will strengthen our share position in Europe over the next few months. Remember, Jon talked about introducing Pods on Ariel, which is the largest and leading laundry detergent in most of Europe, in the April through June quarter. And we think the innovations like that will help.</p>
          <p>We also have introduced oral care in Europe in this semester, and so far, all markets are trending above expectation. So new innovations like that will help us regain share growth in Europe.</p>

          <p>Yeah, let me take the second question first, if I may, Nik. Jorge and his team are hard at work. We've identified over 30 new, discontinuous innovations that we can bring to market. We have vetted those throughout the company. We're in the midst of consumer research.</p>
          <p>And we're excited about them. We took all of our leadership through them recently. And we fully expect to be in market with the beginnings of that &#x2013; the fruits of that labor within the next year or so.</p>

          <p>Good morning, I'm going to try to do this in a two-part question, unconnected, obviously. So you used to say that operating margin leverage on 5% top-line growth was 50 to 75 basis points. I was wondering if that still kind of holds?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you look at the growth algorithm, it seems like your weighted category growth is 3% to 4%. If my math is right, it seems like to add one incremental point of top-line growth, it's only about 10 basis points of global market share, assuming your global addressable market is $800 billion.

          <p>Hi, guys. You guys have mentioned a couple times the organizational structure work that I think Jorge is doing, which sounds encouraging. But can you help define how that is different than the work Marc Pritchard did I guess about five years ago or Kirk Perry did a few years ago?</p>
          <p>Because I bet everybody on the phone &#x2013; you guys certainly know what the answer about the org structure will be, as kind of Marc and Kirk I think came up with, which was something around there are too many cooks in the kitchen between the GBU, the MDO, the functions now, and maybe even at the GLC level.</p>
          <p>So given that premise, will you have &#x2013; will he have the power, as he executes some of the potential recommendations &#x2013; so layer reductions I'm thinking of, in some of those structures &#x2013; can it happen quickly? Both to free up cost, but I think importantly &#x2013; this is my point of view for what it's worth &#x2013; importantly also for quickening decision-making in the company.</p>

          <p>Thanks, good morning. I just had a quick question on the profit growth across your segments.</p>
          <p>If you look at organic sales growth, it's been pretty remarkably consistent across the segments, but the profit growth has been somewhat more uneven. And I'm looking at grooming and healthcare in particular. Is that due to the timing of some cost-saving initiatives or innovation, or is there something more structural in those two segments that might cause those profit growth to obviously lag the rest of the business?

And that is one of the reasons that on a year to year basis that index is a little bit lower. We would not expect that to be an ongoing dynamic, and obviously the overall structural attractiveness from a margin standpoint on that business is very high.</p>
          <p>And the healthcare dynamic is really a function of a couple of supply-related issues that we've been working through successfully, but we've had to incur some additional cost to manage those effectively.</p>

          <p>And we've got additional capacity in the U.S. that will ramp up this semester. And the new capacity that we've put in Europe is the ideal line &#x2013; in other words, the first line we used was not ideal. We've improved that line, and that's the capacity we're putting in.</p>
          <p>So you will quickly see unlimited capacity &#x2013; in the semester, you will see relatively unlimited capacity in the U.S., as well as incremental capacity in Europe. And obviously, as we've said, this is, right now, on one brand and one country, and we plan to expand it.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the question. The question comes back again to the U.S. I think that you mentioned that it was ahead of company average, so ahead of 2%. And if we look at retail sales, at least in tracked channels, we get declines of 2%.</p>
          <p>If you can explain whether this is a channel issue, the fact that we don't get club data that can explain the gap of over four points of growth in volume or whether the increased merchandise activity ahead of the product launches in the third quarter in beauty contributed to the strong growth in North America? If you can quantify that, that would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I can square the full equation, I haven't spent a lot of time on that. But the sell-in behind our beauty initiative and some of the other initiatives did have a positive volume impact in the second quarter in North America. But even with that impact stripped out, I would stay with the statement that North American results on a normalized basis from a volume standpoint were better than the company average. So pretty strong underlying and I really can't reconcile that to the other data, I apologize, but we'll work with you on that.</p>
          <p>The very encouraging thing is that while there was some pipeline volume, which was obviously part of our forecast in the second quarter, the January business is very strong. We've seen no dip at all, in fact, we've seen acceleration and so we're pretty comfortable that the volume trends we've seen in the U.S. are sustainable.</p>

As you know, Vidal Sassoon Pro Series, Jon talked about Pantene Expert adding over 6000 &#x2013; like adding over 6000 hairs to your head, I know I can certainly use that.

And then, how do you turn around volume in grooming, I know you have got some innovation coming &#x2013; well, both in beauty and in grooming, but maybe if you could describe how you accelerate volume in the two segments? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Well, first of all, our beauty business has grown organic sales 11 of the last 12 quarters, averaging roughly 3% growth over the past three years and our grooming business 11 out of 12 quarters averaging 4% growth over the last three years.</p>
          <p>In hair care, as I said, we're expanding the portfolio vertically with innovations like Vidal Sassoon Pro Series in the salon affordable segment. And then Pantene Expert series in the super-premium space and then, as Jon pointed out, we've got Wella Illumina and Color Recharge in the professional space.</p>
          <p>In skin care we're investing to ensure sufficiency of our core Olay business and we're bringing new innovation that addresses key segments where we currently have portfolio gaps and it's critical to fill those portfolio gaps. Examples include in the United States new Olay Microsculpting Cream, Total Effects CC Cream, which stands for color correction, and Olay Fresh Effects. In China we've got Olay Naturals, Pro-X Whitening, the launch of a new mid-tier brand in the coming months.</p>
          <p>In blades and razors, the interventions we talked about last fiscal year are working. The share is up nearly two points to 74% and we're launching a bundle of new innovations across Fusion, Mach3 disposables and shave prep that are focused on sensitive skin and every man we've talked to about shaving talks about sensitive skin.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, Jon talked about cosmetics and the two exciting COVERGIRL innovations this quarter, Clump Crusher by LashBlast and Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Gloss. Initial results of all of these are at or above our expectation.</p>

          <p>My questions are follow-up questions, I don't think that you gave us how fast you think your markets grew globally and then in the three geographic regions: U.S., Europe and emerging regions and then on the U.S. alone, do you, according to your numbers, did you overall hold, gain or lose share? Thank you.</p>

          <p>From a market growth standpoint average about 4%, a little over 4% and that breaks down to about high singles in developing markets, obviously, relatively low singles in developed markets.</p>

          <p>As we said, we're growing or holding share in 60% of our business in the U.S. If you look at the overall U.S. number, it's down a little bit, but the trend is getting better and as you would expect with these new innovations that started shipping at the end of December and with the strength that Jon talked about we're seeing in early January, we would expect those share trends to improve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, everybody. Back on beauty, it still seems like you are losing share there in spite of the innovation. I guess going forward, how do you think about balancing innovation with acquisitions, new brands to improve the share trends and then what do you think is a reasonable go-forward expectation for your volume growth in that category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I don't think &#x2013; I think there is a timing sequence difference here. I don't think we're losing share despite the innovations. In fact, in the places where we're innovating and introducing new innovation or for example in the Western Europe, Latin America, where we've introduced Oral Care, we're gaining share. The innovations that we've talked about, particularly those on this call, are really those that will &#x2013; that have shipped in December, are strengthening the business in January, but you'll really see the impact more in the balance of the fiscal year. Certainly that is true with something like, you know, Vidal Sassoon Pro Series or Pantene Expert, which only started shipping a couple weeks ago.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Jon, you spoke earlier about getting the balance between savings and growth right as the business is so leveraged to growth more so than most of your peers. My question is, are you investing enough, is the company investing enough to really drive the top line growth? Because even at the high end of your new organic sales growth guidance basically just implies growth in line with the past few years and still somewhat below some of your global peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a very good question, thank you for that question. Our objective remains to grow our sales ahead of the market and so you are absolutely right that while we're accelerating, we're still on the journey and we do intend to get to growth rates that are above the market level. We're investing significantly to do that, as I said in my remarks, Bob has said, we spend a lot of time working on strengthening plans for the second half of the year with an eye toward doing exactly that, plus strengthening next fiscal year. We'll be making &#x2013; we were already making significant investments in the back half and those will be strengthened based on the over delivery in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So we're pretty confident that results will continue to accelerate and hopefully we'll get to where you rightly think we should be sooner rather than later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I was wondering if you could more specifically quantify these cost savings, the basis point positive effect on both gross margin and SG&amp;A and also the commodities comparison? I would assume it was flattish year over year or maybe even down and is it right to assume the commodity comparison will get even better in the next two quarters?</p>
          <p>And then on the Fabric Care and Home Care, did the Hurricane Sandy positive effect, how much was that on the whole category growth? Was it, for the segment, was it half a point or a point or less than that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all you're absolutely right, commodity impacts were essentially neutral on the quarter. That's about what we're expecting on a go forward basis. There are some that are moving up a little bit, some that are moving down a little bit, but in broad terms it's fairly neutral.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cost savings components within gross and operating margin, there were about 100 basis points of savings that positively impacted gross margin and about 60 basis point of savings that positively impacted the SG&amp;A line so that in total there were about 160 basis points of productivity savings in the quarter. That compares to about 150 basis points in the last quarter. So you are seeing some, as you would expect, increasing contribution from productivity.</p>
          <p>Frankly it would be very hard for us to tease out the Sandy impact on any of our individual businesses. We worked hard with &#x2013; to manage inventories and supply in a way that minimized the impact to consumers, so I would, for all practical purposes, consider that a non-impact.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, could you tell us how you evaluate your decisions to shift more to local manufacturing in the emerging markets? You said it benefits the supply chain, can you talk about how that &#x2013; could you talk about other issues that go into your decision to &#x2013; and how you evaluate that differently now versus maybe five or ten years ago? And finally, is there halo effect on consumption if you are creating more employment in this local manufacturing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've hit on some of the criteria for that decision. Obviously you want to establish a business that is big enough to create a rate of return for the capacity, but you also want to look at some key criteria, location, government support, quality of the work force, these are &#x2013; the risk adjusted rate of capital. These are all things that we look at.</p>
          <p>Relative to the change, it's very interesting. Two things: one, when I joined the Procter &amp; Gamble company in 1980, manufacturing expense was a big element that we worried a lot about and logistics cost was a very small element because the price of diesel was very low. Today manufacturing expense is relatively low because there are very few people in our manufacturing plants. Jon talked about our ability to build 20 new plants, but not add any enrollment or head count to the company because of 6.5% improving productivity in manufacturing roles.</p>
          <p>But the logistics cost has skyrocketed and as a result of that, we worked very hard to distribute our plants globally. We have roughly 150 plants around the world, they have to be near the consumers they serve, we export very little and we have a competitive advantage because we create scale by having all of our global business units around one plant.</p>
          <p>So when we buy land, we buy land for all the business units in the company, planning to take advantage of that scale. That scale then helps us in filling logistics orders because our trucks don't weigh out with something like Gillette blades and they don't cube out with something like Pampers disposable diapers. We are able to get the optimum balance of weight and cube, which gives us a competitive advantage on cost. So we've done relatively well on logistics costs year to year despite the increase in diesel.</p>

          <p>Good morning, having just got back from China, I would like to ask you to dive deeper into the various segments, I think six major segments you have there and what the competitive challenges have been. Is it more from local manufacturers or international competition by your key segments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be a really long answer, maybe Caroline, we can take that offline, because that is a really long discussion, but as you would imagine in some categories, it's a local competitor, in some categories it's the global competitor. There is not an easy answer. We are the largest consumer goods company in China by a large factor. We do have an outstanding distribution network and our expectation is, Jon has said this, to grow 1 to 2 points above the market.</p>
