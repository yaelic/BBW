          <p>Good afternoon. This is Mike M&#xFC;hlbayer speaking. On behalf of Daimler, I would like to welcome you on both the telephone and the Internet to our half year results conference call. We are happy to have people today, the Chairman of the Board of Management and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Dieter Zetsche; our CFO, Bodo Uebber; the Head of Daimler Trucks, Andreas Renschler.</p>
          <p>In order to give you maximum time for your questions, Dieter Zetsche will give a short introduction directly followed by Q&amp;A. Now I would like to hand over to Dr. Dieter Zetsche.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael M&#xFC;hlbayer, and good afternoon from me too.</p>
          <p>We published our second quarter results today that clearly show that Daimler is growing. Given our strong investment in new products and technologies, our earnings were quite respectable as well. Automotive division increased their total unit sales by 8% to more than 570,000 vehicles in the second quarter. Our revenue for the period reached &#x20AC;28.9 billion, 10% more than in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, revenue increased by 4%</p>
          <p>The group's EBIT from ongoing business came to &#x20AC;2.3 billion. We achieved a net profit of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Our earnings were primarily driven by further growth in unit sales in the United States and Asia. There were negative effects on earnings from partially weak markets and above all from the previously announced expenses for new products, technologies and plans. EBIT also includes slightly higher charges from the compounding of non-current provisions. Please note in this respect we had to recognize total charges of &#x20AC;264 million in the first two quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>Our free cash flow in the industrial business developed positively and amounted to &#x20AC;1 billion in the second quarter. The main factors were the good earnings from the industrial business and the cash released from working capital. There were opposing effects from our investment in future growth as well as our capital contributions for our truck joint venture in China.</p>
          <p>Our net liquidity amounted to &#x20AC;8.4 billion as of June 30 this year, &#x20AC;3.5 billion less than at the end of 2011. The decrease mainly reflects the dividend payment to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>So how did our individual divisions perform? Mercedes-Benz Cars once again set a new record for unit sales in the second quarter. With sales of more than 370,000 units, we were 4% above the number for the prior year quarter. We set new sales records, for example in China, Russia, the United Kingdom and Canada. Our new models were especially popular. We sold more than 30,000 units of the new M-class and nearly 37,000 of new B-class. Never before did we sell as many B-class cars in one quarter.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter EBIT amounts of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, which is a good level considering the investments I had mentioned in the future growth and the fact that some of our new models are not yet widely available. Mercedes-Benz cars return on sales for the second quarter was 8.6%.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Trucks, we increased our worldwide unit sales by 34% to approximately 122,000 vehicles. This was primarily due to strong demand in the NAFTA region. Our growth in Asia was even stronger, although this partially reflects the base effect caused by the slump in Japan in the prior-year period.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, we further extended our leading market position. In Brazil, we slightly increased our market share in what is overall a contracting market. Daimler Trucks EBIT of &#x20AC;524 million was 8% higher than in the second quarter of last year. The division's return on sales was 6.4%.  Mercedes-Benz vans unit sales increased compared toward the prior year quarter by 2% to a 69,000 vehicles.</p>
          <p>We achieved particularly strong sales growth in the United States with a plus of 33%. We also recorded a slight increase in our key market of Western Europe, despite the continued weakness of markets in Southern Europe. The division's EBIT remained at the high level of &#x20AC;197 million.</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses sold 8,400 units in the second quarter, 20% fewer than the prior year. EBIT was minus &#x20AC;57 million. On the one hand, this decrease is due to the ongoing weak business with bus chassis in Latin America. On the other hand, it's due to expenses for the ongoing repositioning of our business in Europe and North America.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, Daimler Financial Services. The division's new business increased compared with the prior year quarter by 12% to &#x20AC;9.4 billion. Contract volume reached &#x20AC;76.1 billion at the end of June, which is 6% more than at the end of 2011. EBIT of &#x20AC;338 million was at the prior year level. So much for current developments in the various divisions.</p>
          <p>Next, what do we expect for the second half of the quarter (sic) [year] (07:04)? Economic uncertainty and risks exist in nearly all regions. We therefore remain vigilant in our monitoring of general economic developments so that we can react quickly if required. We can do so more flexibly today than we could in the past.</p>
          <p>In a global scale, we continue to anticipate growth and demand for automobiles of approximately 4% for the full year. The biggest growth impulse is still expected to come from the United States and Asia. We expect a significant market decline in Western Europe, however. At Mercedes-Benz Cars, we plan to further increase our unit sales and to grow faster than the market as a whole in 2012.</p>
          <p>From today's perspective, we assume that unit sales in the remaining quarters of this year will be above the levels of the prior year periods. Numerous new models will contribute to this development. The new generations of the GLK and the G-class have been on the market since June. Three new models will be launched in the fall: the GL, the CLS Shooting Brake and the A-</p>
          <p>Class.  We have already received more than 40,000 orders for the new A-Class. We are therefore investing in the expansion of our production capacity.</p>
          <p>As of October, we will operate the first shift in Rastatt. However, our capacities are still not positioned to satisfy the enormous demand as quickly as we would like so we will have the A-Class additionally assembled by an external partner starting 2013. We have already signed an agreement on this with Valmont, a Finnish automotive supplier. Valmont will produce a total of more than 100,000 A-Class cars for us by the year 2016.</p>
          <p>There's also news from China. Daimler and its joint venture partner, Lei Shing Hong, have agreed that Daimler will increase its stake in the import and wholesale company for Mercedes-Benz cars in China, from currently 51% to 75%. Daimler Lei Shing Hong will continue their partnership with a strong focus on retail. The increased stake is an integral part of our strategy of repositioning our sales activities in China.</p>
          <p>What do we expect from Daimler Trucks? At a global level, the division continues to have good growth prospects. The NAFTA region should once again be the most important driver of demand in the worldwide truck market. Our order backlog there already extends into the fall. In Europe, we will develop better than the overall market with the new Actros and will further extend our market leadership. In Brazil, we assume that we will be able to defend our good market position. As for the overall Brazilian market, we expect a decrease.</p>
          <p>At Mercedes-Benz Vans, we aim to achieve renewed growth in unit sales, even though the overall market for mid-sized and large vans will probably tend to weaken, at least in Europe. But we anticipate a stimulus from the small van segment, and we have exactly the right product for that segment with our new Citan city van. In the United States, we expect further growth in unit sales in an overall market that is developing very positively.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Buses, we assume that sales figures will be lower than last year due to generally weak demand. This applies to Latin America in particular. Recently, however, there have been some positive signals from this market. Our unit sales have risen sharply in the past few weeks, thanks to the implementation of state incentives in Brazil. This effect may persist through the remaining five months of this year.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Financial Services, contract volume and new business should continue to grow this year. What does all this mean for expected earnings in the full year 2012? On the basis of current market expectations and the planning of our divisions, Daimler aims to achieve EBIT from ongoing business in 2012 that is in the magnitude of the prior year. This guidance is based on the assumption of currency exchange rates close to their present levels. For the development of EBIT in our divisions, we can give the following guidance from today's perspective.</p>
          <p>Mercedes-Benz Cars in the magnitude of the prior year; Daimler Trucks at least at the prior year level; Mercedes-Benz Vans in the magnitude of the prior year; Daimler Buses below the prior year level; Daimler Financial Services slightly below the prior year level. There's no doubt achieving these targets is a challenge. In view of our scheduled high expenditure for new products, technologies and production facilities, that was always clear, and consequently we have always said that we <mark type="ph" /> grant (11:42) 2012 as a transition year.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, there are many indications that economic uncertainty and risks could intensify again in the second half of the year. So the challenge of achieving the earnings targets we have set is not getting any smaller.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we maintain our mid-term targets for unit sales and earnings. We continue to pursue those targets based on our growth and efficiency strategies: Mercedes-Benz 2020 for cars; Daimler Trucks Number One for trucks; Mercedes-Benz Vans Goes Global for vans; GLOBE 2013 for buses; and DFS 2020 for Financial Services.</p>
          <p>It's now important to implement these strategies and that's exactly what we are continuing to do. And now we will be happy to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Dieter Zetsche. Ladies and gentlemen, you may ask your questions now. I will identify the questioner by name, but please also introduce yourself and your organization before asking your question. Two practical points. Firstly, please avoid using mobile phones. And secondly, please ask your question in English. Before we start, the operator will explain the procedure.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question comes from Horst Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Horst Schneider from HSBC. I have got three quick questions. First of all, questions on the currency effects. So maybe you can split it up or maybe you can give us some indication what you expect now for the full year in terms of positive currency effects if the dollar or the currency rates stay where they are at the moment?</p>
          <p>And if I get your guidance right, then you can only meet the 2012 guidance if the current U.S. dollar rate remains at the level where it is right now. So maybe you can clarify that. And second, I want to ask what was the precise net price impact in Q2? Your presentation shows only the total effect including volumes and mix as well so maybe you can single out what was pricing in Q2, and I would be particularly interested for the surprising trend going now into H2 in Mercedes Cars?</p>
          <p>Then the last question that I have is related to your China business, and you have said that you have bought here now &#x2013; you have now a 75% stake in the import company. I would like to know if that has got any consolidation impact and what is the long-term impact then from this business? So shall we see then in the future that Daimler catches up to the growth rate of BMW and Audi also then in the future? I mean and so far you're underperforming with the market. I think that was related to some extent to the problems in the import business. Maybe you can also make a statement on that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bodo, you want to start with the FX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Based on the current level, the dollar effect is roughly over the whole year &#x20AC;600 million to &#x20AC;700 million. Of course in the currency walk, there are also other currencies of course which is of course not easy to predict because you have volatilities on the one hand on the others. So on the dollar side, it's &#x20AC;600 million to &#x20AC;700 million.</p>
          <p>Of course why we just have benefits all of this, as we always said, we have our product portfolio &#x2013; our hedging portfolio not as forwards only; we have collars and options, and therefore we have a fluctuation of course in the currency exposure and the effect. Our guidance is always based, as we said, on market assumptions we have given to you. And on the other hand, on the current currency rate, <mark type="audio gap" /> (15:46-15:49)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What Bodo said was exactly right, like always. We have in another column from these collars in their financial evaluation effect, which is to some extent going against that, so the net number is somewhat lower than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is right. There are two effects. There is one &#x2013; sorry, I've forgotten that, but I have a good CEO which reminds me once in a while about the topic. So there is an effect of course when you have receivables, so you have to evaluate of course the value of the receivables each month and each quarter by the effect of the currency. That is one, which is of course negative because we have now a lower value of the dollar. That is one topic, and the other topic is when you have collars and options you have, so to say, timing effects which are fluctuating which are not shown here in this net currency effect which are negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You were asking about incentive levels? We had the objective to reduce the incentives since 2000 &#x2013; we always have this objective of course, but it was part of our plan in 2009 and 2010 and 2011. We are successful in this regard, in this year since the crisis.</p>
          <p>As you know, first quarter this year we had some actions going against that target, mainly in China, which had a negative impact in China. But in our overall incentive level, in 2000 &#x2013; sorry, in the second quarter, we are more or less back to our planned levels. But it's questionable if throughout the year we can offset the negative impact from the first quarter for China in the remaining quarters because then, of course, we would have to run below our planned rate.</p>
          <p>So we are seeing pricing pressure across the board, as has been reported by some of our competitors as well. Of course, with the new products like M-Class or the B-Class, which received very strong demand, we have movement for our average incentive levels coming from that side. But certainly, altogether, there is more tension in the market. We tried to withstand that to the maximum possible, but there is a risk of further deterioration in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do I get it right, sequentially in Q2 versus Q1, the pricing incentives have not deteriorated or not increased?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They have come down, as I said, mainly in China but not exclusively. So, altogether, the second quarter pricing was a positive development versus the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had a third question which was regarding China. Your observation is of course right that in the first two quarters we had considerably less growth than our two main competitors. We should state, I think, in fairness not to us but to our people in China, that for about five years we had a major delay in starting local activities in China, we were in successful catch-up mode. So for five years, we closed a huge gap to our main competitors to, in the case of BMW in 2010, almost zero.</p>
          <p>In 2011, the gap widened a little bit again. But now in 2012, we see significant more growth with the two main competitors. There are a number of issues related to that. Some we knew like when, what we already reported that we would shut down the plant for six weeks and there, obviously, there was a lack of supply.</p>
          <p>We knew that the expansion of the dealer body, for dealer network, on the BMW side would be faster than for us for third- and fourth-tier markets, metropolitan markets. And in the second half we will have accelerated extension of our network. But beyond that, we have some issues as well about the positioning of our vehicles and, as we discussed all the time, about the two sales organizations, which were not working in sync in the past. We established this virtual integrated sales organization, which is a step in the right direction but by far not there.</p>
          <p>Now, having signed the agreement with Lei Shing Hong, we have the first step with one partner to achieve the second step of our legally integrated sales organization together with <mark type="ph" /> bike (20:36). We are in these negotiations but not finalized. We have another issue that the mix of the market in demand has changed quite a bit too much more <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:50) percentages. We were much higher <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:52) than our competitors. We have to adjust somewhat, this takes a little time in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:50) and so on.</p>
          <p>So I could go on and on, this doesn't help you and it's not that interesting to you. We recognize that we are falling short to what our competitors could achieve in the first half. We know this is extremely important to have the performance in China on par with our competition, that's why we are strongly analyzing all reasons, addressing them and fixing them as fast as possible to get back to a strong growth rate in China to the extent the market altogether allows.</p>
          <p>Perhaps just as one little caveat in this regard, I know the world is composed of all countries being on this globe, still if for a second we take out China out of the total situation, then we can state that in the first half that Mercedes has grown faster than BMW or Audi. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So even with a slightly older portfolio, we are competitive on a worldwide basis except for China. And there I come back to my point that obviously China we have to put all our focus on to assure as soon as possible a similar competitiveness there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What have you paid for the stake increase in Lei Shing Hong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:17) which was quite reasonable we will inform you on when we have signed it. But we will inform you during the next disclosure in Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the minority will decline then in payments in the future because you have a higher stake in the import company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will get to 75% coming from 50% and then <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:36).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question we get from Kristina Church.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you for taking the question. My questions are rather following on from Horst's comments on pricing. I was just wondering, you talked about China pricing obviously improving. But could you just comment a little bit about the European pricing environment? Has there been any deterioration there?</p>
          <p>And then also back to the FX comments. Could you just give us an update on how covered you are in terms of hedging for 2013 and when some of that hedging was put in place?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just looking at your EBIT walk down on page 27 in the appendix, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the other cost changes, specifically the four, five, seven million in Mercedes, what those relate to specifically? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So once again about pricing, we were talking about China. You were asking for Europe. Certainly, especially in the volume segments of course, pricing pressure in Europe is high; somewhat less in the premium segment. But clearly as well, we, as I mentioned before, we intend to have ideally a positive pricing development in the second half. That is certainly an ambitious goal given the environment.</p>
          <p>But that's what we try to accomplish, and it's not just blue sky because we know about all the new products, the A-Class, the CLS Shooting Brake, the GLK facelift, the new M-Class, which still is very strong as far as pricing capability is concerned. So all these new products will help us on the pricing side, and that's why we have that perspective.</p>

          <p>Christina, to your questions of how we are hedged in 2013, we are right currently on 65% with the U.S. dollar hedged. Of course, also here roughly two-thirds in forwards and one-third in options and collars, roughly.</p>
          <p>You had a question to the other cost changes. In the cost walk, of course, one topic of course, we do have &#x2013; you see in trucks the number of hundred million that reflect the introduction of the new Actros which we addressed with a couple of hundred million as cost for the total year incremental to 2011. That is one piece of course. You know also there are some R&amp;D spendings more on this side than material cost effects, so that is included here.</p>
          <p>On the Mercedes-Benz car side, we addressed it also in the early beginning of the year. We have a couple of hundred million for the total year for the capacity extensions. So one piece of that as you see here. The other one is the R&amp;D increase, certainly, which we see, but we do not capitalize the R&amp;D costs. We have higher material cost of course. And then two baskets, one is the CO2-related measure, which we addressed also in Kecskem&#xE9;t in the variable cost, and the fourth one included here is the attractiveness of our product portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, reflects this development of course, but also when you have a good guy in the last quarter of last year of course it shows up here as a difference. So there was also a good development in other costs. So, all in all, that is the explanation on the cost side, as we addressed it also in the beginning of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could I just ask a follow-up question going back to pricing? You were talking having some issues in China in the first quarter of the year, and I know you were discounting heavily early on. Can you explain exactly what your strategy, why you decided to discount so heavily? And do you think it's been detrimental for the rest of the year? Is it hard to regain that pricing or are you back on an even keel now in China? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we discussed that in length in the first quarter. We certainly can repeat that. One element, as we discussed at that time, was that in the S-Class we were just before the introduction of a special edition, which allowed us to have higher incentive levels in a moment where we were, as I mentioned before, very short on supply in our major car lines. So to balance that somewhat, the local management decided to go this road.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, as they intended, they were able to bring back the levels to the pre-peak level. So that's a good part of the news, but still not in the first quarter, not today, I would say that this was the best of our decisions to go there. It was as, I've said, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:43) within the local management to offset shortages of supply in the other car lines.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm Breitsprecher from Macquarie. I have a question related to the U.S. truck business. When we look at the sales volumes they are still very strong. You have nice growth there, but the order intake just keeps coming in fairly weak over the last quarters, I think giving you something like a book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter of 0.65. What is behind the order weakness? I mean is it just that people have placed their orders and you're sitting on a huge order backlog? Do we have to brace ourselves for a significant downturn? Then also in sales volumes in 2013, just how do you see really the heavy truck market developing in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try to answer it. I think when you look to the NAFTA region, we see through the economic uncertainty in some areas postponing placing orders that we saw the last couple of months. The positive side, let's talk for a second to our &#x2013; the year 2012. We have a good order backlog in June, the orders specifically for us reached a kind of bottom line so we've seen July the same, a little bit more.</p>
          <p>So like I said, a couple of weeks ago, we are fine in production. We have certain openings in August, end of August and September but in October, November and December we're already full again. So the real question is not the year of 2012 for us, it's the question of 2013. And to give you there a first indication, the big fleets are placing their orders in October and the beginning of November and then we have a much better view how about 2013 could be. There is no really solid indication that it will not go up another couple of percentage next year but there's uncertainty. And, again, because we are delivering to a lot of big fleets, we will see this at the end of October later since the beginning of November and have them really some good indications for 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I'm Fraser Hill from Bank of America. First question is on trucks. Just looking at your mix, it does look like as if you must have a very profitable U.S. truck business in the past. You've indicated that you wanted to get that business into the high single digit percentage margin level. Is it fair to say that you are operating at that level today? Just wondered if you could confirm that and maybe make some comments about how your Asian profitability is progressing in line with your ambition to get up towards a mid single-digit level there.</p>
          <p>Second question would be on Valmont and the A-Class. How should we think about that in terms of the margins for the new A-Class? Obviously it's only a proportion of the product, of the A-Class production that's going to come from that. But how dilutive is that going to be in terms of the margin that you're going to be making on the new A-Class product? If you can just give me some sort of idea how to think about that.</p>
          <p>And then, apologies, I'm not sure if I missed an answer here but in terms of the breakdown of the "others" cost stack in your EBIT breakdown, the &#x20AC;591 million, how should we think about that line or that delta going into Q3 and Q4, what have been the big contributors to that and what should we expect there going forward for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start first with your truck question. If I got it right you are interested to have the margin in the U.S. and in Japan. I can only give you the indication. They are in both countries better than planned, and that shows us very clearly that we're on track for a big milestone to achieve next year, the 8% finally. We have done a lot of restructuring, as you know, but if restructuring is not only cost, it's also a different positioning, specifically in United States. If you see today, the Freightliner products are really totally different positioned with a lot of product advantages. And this, overall, where we put a lot of effort and time in it. So finally they came to this conclusion and result making a detail disclosure here <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:42).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as Valmont is concerned, talking about first, the cost of labor, it's somewhere in between Rastatt and Kecskem&#xE9;t. Structurally, it's I think an important strategic move, because obviously we've discussed it in the past, our objective is to reduce our working integration to shift, if you want, fixed cost into variable cost.</p>
          <p>Therefore, when you just purely ask about margins, it's logical that with the capacity increase where you basically don't pay that capacity, you have lower margins. But this does not say anything about the profitability and says something about a step forward in our objective, once again, to become a leaner company with less fixed costs or less growth or fixed cost relative to the overall growth strategy we are pursuing. And that is especially true when you talk about potentially peak demand, where it's even less smart to put all of that in fixed assets for the wrong one. So I think this is a very, very good move going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fraser, I addressed your question already in questions before, and I broke it down. It's mainly related to the product cost, on the one hand, where we are investing heavily into the R&amp;D cost on the other hand, and also launch costs and capacity increases. If you could go back in the script I have also differentiated between the cost basket. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. To me it appears when I summarize the quarter a little bit that the real underlying fundamental momentum is pretty good and strong in the trucks division. There's a lot of work that's been done in the trucks division and the division is moving forward and you mentioned in the call this morning that the margin should continue to improve moving forward. Whereas in Mercedes, there are a lot of external factors driving the profitability. If I take out the currency effect on the second quarter, the underlying margin was 7%, right? And that's a decline by 370 basis points over last year.</p>
          <p>Now coming back to the other line in the EBIT walk, and when I look at R&amp;D cost depreciation, this didn't really go up materially in the quarter year-over-year. Could you probably talk a bit about material cost? What is impacting your material cost? How sustainable is the increase of material cost? Is that something structurally CO2 related, quality related? Because, I guess, you should also by now have a bit of a tailwind on the raw material cost side. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, it's there, if you want to take out the currency effect. I mentioned before that this is the gross effect and you have to take off of that the other impact which we have mentioned by Bodo.</p>
          <p>Secondly, for instance, as was indicated as well, we had a three-digit special impact in the second quarter last year, which was related to the warranty claims to some of our suppliers which then probably you should take out as well. So when we want to go into these differentiations, it's a longer walk.</p>
          <p>Anyway, as rightfully stated, we have significant increase in material cost, that's something we talked about all the time and, as Bodo mentioned, it's driven on the one hand by CO2. On the other hand by more content to make sure that a Mercedes is a Mercedes, which at some time we were lacking somewhat. And we said as well that this is an issue we have to work on in order to get to the net zero by latest in 2017.</p>
          <p>But this does, of course, not mean that we start in 2016, but we're working on that full-fledged in order to offset as early as much of these increases as possible, and that's exactly what we are addressing with all our forces <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:06). Clearly, in our overall business system it's a negative parameter as far as cost is concerned, it's a positive parameter as far as our strong reduction in CO2 is concerned and the reaction we are getting on the objectivity of our products, so we have to bring that both together and that's what we are working on right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so I understand it then correctly that this is more a structural development for the entire industry from a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:31) as well rather than something that's happening in the quarter and then it's coming down, disappearing over the next couple of quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we are not in sync in all aspects in this regard. When I'm talking, we want to make sure that we at Mercedes &#x2013; sorry, at a level where everybody clearly perceives Mercedes as the brand as far as value appreciation is concerned. Then this is not true for everybody. When I talk about CO2 of course, the challenge is true for everybody. We were not entirely in sync in making our moves and making progress.</p>
          <p>It's true that it's not a quarterly effect, but it's true as well as I said that we have countermeasures which we are reinforcing and strengthening all the time in order to have as fast as possible a counter element to the structural element to offset it. That's again the net zero approach.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Stephen Reitman from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale in London. A couple of questions. First of all on China, I've noticed that production is now picking up again after the shutdown that you mentioned, six-week shutdown, and in May and June we were seeing at least double-digit or in triple-digit rises, year-on-year, in production at the factory. When are those going to translate through, do you think, at the retail level? When will see that in terms of the Mercedes sales in the second half of the year in terms of &#x2013; because obviously the growth rate has been rather poor in &#x2013; particularly in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>Second question, also going back to this issue about the extra costs. And as you refer back to the Kecskem&#xE9;t discussions and the &#x20AC;6 billion of cost headwinds you referred to then compared to 2011, and how we should look upon this? Should we then expect then basically to see that &#x20AC;6 billion roughly playing out as part of that &#x20AC;500 million in extra costs on a quarterly basis or so, or how would that work? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions. As far as the first one is concerned, we're obviously composing our sales out of the DBU business and the parts by parts business being locally produced. We had some discontinuities on the supply side, as we discussed before, which created a necessity of some catch-up after the shutdown as well.</p>
          <p>So overall, the total sales development will be less volatile than the local production which you were referring to. But clearly, we plan for an increase of our sales in the first place in the fourth quarter, driven very much by new product entries as well, and some of the products we introduce in other markets much earlier are coming much later to China, like the M-Class for instance.</p>
          <p>And therefore on the GLK facelift, we are working on the current GLK in China longer than in the rest of the world. So third quarter is not forecasted to have a major lift, but the fourth quarter definitely, not just because of wishful thinking but based on the product launches we are planning for.</p>
          <p>The second part, we tried to explain that in our Kecskem&#xE9;t discussion we have, for a number of years, had cost increases coming from these elements I was mentioning, and there's the facelift and the midyear model year, and all of these things created additional content into the vehicles. On the other hand, we had efficiencies in commercial negotiation with the suppliers. And then, of course, the technical improvement of our basket and, once again, the last element in that relevant was raw materials.</p>
          <p>Now for a number of years the net <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:00) of that was the reduction of our bill of materials. Last year and this year, we see a significant increase in the bill of materials. But we talk about the &#x20AC;6 billion above the line, that means that we would see that as an increase in the first two years fully but we had of course compensation, partial compensation of that as well. But there was a significant remaining increase of the total net increase of the total bill of materials and we are shooting for years where we will again have a net increase of the bill of materials to the extent that we offset the increases of the years before and therefore come to the net zero.</p>
          <p>That might have been a little complicated. I tried to explain it. But it's just turning around a net increase into a net decrease again with enforcement of the reduction elements we're having. And of course new product introductions are helping this regard significantly. For instance, the new C-Class is a major contributor where the modular strategy and our architecture, the modular 2.2, basically, and our platform strategy where the C-Class and D-Class have very high commonality. These elements help a lot to offset these material price increases.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just three quick ones as well, if I may. First of all, on your depreciation and product warranty position that we've seen in the first half, obviously the increase was not following either the tick up in capital spending or the tick up in business volume. When we now look out to the second half, what are your projections? Is this run rate of &#x20AC;2 billion depreciation what we should see for the second half? Or is this now finally coming up, given that by now you're significantly spending more than you currently depreciate?</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regards to pricing again, I, at least from my stance, are currently a bit puzzled about what you are saying. I remember in the first quarter you called pricing still net positive. Now, second quarter you said it is even more net positive but at the same time you're worried about the second half. Can you &#x2013; is that about the correct understandings? Or is by now &#x2013; harsh change in the marketplace that you're observing and that explains a bit cautious message, if you could just allude a little bit on that.</p>
          <p>And then finally, you reiterated the group earnings guidance, but I recall that you also had a cash guidance which at least by now looks a bit more ambitious, more than &#x20AC;2.3 billion of cash flow by now we are a &#x20AC;1 billion negative due to working capital. Can you just share your thoughts, where you stand on that, whether the second half is going to be that strong on cash that you can make up to that claimed number in the past? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I perhaps start with the answer to your second one, because obviously there we had a misunderstanding. What I at least wanted to say was that the first quarter we had an increase of incentive levels, therefore a negative impact from pricing, mainly driven by China.</p>
          <p>And then I said that in the second quarter we had an improvement of the situation again, we were able to take down these high incentive levels, especially in China, again. And that for the rest &#x2013; the remainder of the year, our objective is to further improve our pricing, but we recognized that environment is not helpful in this regard. What is helpful? Our new products to be launched. So, so far, I hope I could clarify our past and future expectation as far as pricing is concerned.</p>
          <p>Do you want to say something about cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll take you up on the first question, the depreciation. You see the trend of course is increasing. By launching new products, of course, the depreciation is higher so it means for the new A-Class with the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:16), GLS and so on and so forth, the number is increasing. On the truck side, I don't see this increase, it's more on the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Has happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...has happened already, yes. On the one hand, I see it more on the car side. The cash flow guidance of course I also do correct you once in a while, but the cash guidance was to be over and above the dividends on the one hand but excluding M&amp;A growth investments and contribution to the pension plan. All of that was roughly &#x20AC;1 billion for the total year. Currently we are at &#x20AC;500 million, &#x20AC;600 million, &#x20AC;600 million for the half year.</p>
          <p>So by excluding that, that would be a net of &#x20AC;1.3 billion and, of course, I wouldn't say that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:05) so we do all what we can to deliver this number. It's mainly depending, of course, on the earnings developments, which gives us certain cash flow, in cash flow, and the other big piece is, besides controlling of our CapEx spending and other spending, is the inventory management, which I do see some opportunities on the truck side. For example, when you look into Brazil obviously there is a &#x2013; there could be a good guy in this direction. On the European side, in the development, there is a good guy on the car side. We are already very disciplined with the approach to inventories <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:40) so we stick to our guidance as we said it before.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry. If I can just follow up, you mentioned inventories. Obviously the &#x20AC;18.5 billion marks a new high point, that's also a function of the business volume. But...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>... is it &#x2013; this &#x20AC;2 billion increase since the start of the year, is this all in trucks? And how do you feel about when you mentioned growing economic uncertainties?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course we will bring it down, it is right. On the other hand, it's only trucks because those elements, as I said before, Brazil is a topic where you can imagine that we have some inventories currently. But anyway, the total numbers would go down.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions, please. The first one on trucks, Andreas. When I look at the seasonality of volumes on the truck business, in 2011 there was virtually no seasonality since volumes were recovering from all-time lows. Now, as we go into 2012 and Q3, would you agree that we're going to be seeing some more seasonal &#x2013; the classical weaker Q3 versus Q2? And then are you still &#x2013; are you planning maybe to see volumes down year-on-year in Q3 and Q4 and what kind of measures could you take to offset this decline in volumes?</p>
          <p>And then second, on autos, sorry to come back to this &#x2013; to the other cost changes and the currency impact but they're proving to be rather volatile categories to forecast. But would you mind maybe providing us full-year guidance for both categories in order to get a clear picture of that? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with your question on trucks. It's very simple, our actual expectations in the market, and also supported through our order intake and order backlog, we see increase in the third quarter and also then more or less in the stable in the fourth quarter. So in the second half, we see higher sales than in first half. There are, of course, volatility in the market so we should not hide them.</p>
          <p>One volatility we have in Brazil, we see early indication that at least the dealers are starting to order something, slightly recovering, but this is of course, our volatility we see there in these figures. I mentioned, we expect still like we said, a Brazilian recovery in the second half year. Besides that, we will see increase in sales.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jose, I ask for your understanding, we are doing EBIT guidance and, of course, there we give clear guidance on the divisional level, so we don't give guidance now on specific cost elements. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but maybe just on currency, I mean we could more or less agree then on a year-on-year basis in Q2 and Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On currency, I've already told the market that I expect for the total year on the U.S. dollar base on current rates &#x20AC;600 million to &#x20AC;700 million for the total year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Plus there are negative effects somewhat in some receivables which you have, of course, where we should evaluate, and other topics which are the net, of course, a little bit offsetting &#x2013; somewhat offsetting the number I have told you. Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay, we take the next question from Stuart Pearson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Stuart Pearson at Morgan Stanley. Just a few questions. I mean, I'm sorry the first one to labor the pricing point. I just wanted to check &#x2013; I understand that we were talking about the same thing here. When you talk about pricing being positive in the second quarter and potentially into second half of the year, I mean clearly you have some new models going on sale that help, and you've mentioned all of those models. But if you think about like-for-like pricing on models that are not being changed, how negative the pricing are we seeing on those models such as the E-Class and the C-Class as well? And when you talk about pricing, are you including elements such as content, low finance rate offers and perhaps more generous residual value assumptions? So perhaps just clarify that we're all talking about the same thing there?</p>
          <p>Then, secondly, just on credit losses, it looks like another very low quarter of credit losses in Q2. Are you seeing any kind of signs or anything that would make you more concerned and start to provision more conservatively for credit losses, particularly in the European market?</p>
          <p>And then finally just going back to I guess the dividend, you talked about the free cash flow aiming to match the dividend. But how should we think about what really drives that dividend at the end of the day? If the guidance of flat EBIT proves, as you say, challenging and earnings are down a little bit year-on-year, given the high payout ratio we saw last year, would you be &#x2013; how keen are you how intent are you on maintaining that dividend at last year's level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to ask for your understanding that I can't give you much more details on pricing car line by car line and country by country. I told you about the sequential developments between the first quarter and the second quarter, and the impact we had in the first quarter and our objective for the third and fourth quarter and that the ambitious goals we are setting ourselves are driven by the new vehicles being launched. That in itself says that there are existing models, of course, within their life cycle, have some degradation in their pricing capability. Then you have facelifts, which has turned the situation around, but I don't think I can go into more details in a quantitative way in this regard. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your question of credit losses, we saw some increase &#x2013; slight increase in this &#x2013; in the second quarter compared to last quarter. We are on the lower level compared to the long-term trends so, therefore, nothing to be concerned about really. We have some higher losses in Brazil, for example, and some European countries. On the other hand, we have also high non-performing loans in some South European countries, which on the other hand, not create really losses currently, which is good news. And we see some, of course, in some countries where we have to restructure for example, dealer net or dealer net nets, some dealers which have problems in some direction. More than this we are not seeing. The level, as I said before, worldwide it is on a very low level.</p>
          <p>Dividend, we have set to ourselves not only a target but also the guidance of 40% payout ratio and we keep on that target. Okay, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next in line is Albrecht Denninghoff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, thank you for taking my questions. And one might address the other cost changes which have increased somewhat from &#x20AC;514 million in the first quarter to &#x20AC;591 million. Could you give us some light about the second half? Is it in Q3 and Q4 staying in this &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;600 million range or is there substantial reduction in Q3 or Q4?</p>
          <p>And second topic, the provisions for guarantees &#x2013; for product guarantees. I noticed in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:47) statement that they actually declined somewhat in the second quarter. Could you give us some color on what is behind this reduction and what is a fair profits level going forward in terms of provisioning for product guarantees going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your last question, so it's a good story of course behind the &#x2013; our goodwill and warranty developments all over. In the last couple of years we could reduce the quality costs, that was true for trucks, vans and also from cars, so it's constantly on a very good trend. And you saw a small decline in the provision in the second quarter, but overall the trend is good.</p>
          <p>And we think also in the future years we can further, go further down with that topic. Your first question for the cost changes so I do expect to on the truck side more or less a constant run rate on the topic compared quarter-over-quarter, and for cars I expect a reduced level compared to the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And for the next question and last question we have from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:59).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. It's <mark type="ph" /> Austin Earl from Marshall Wace (57:03). Actually, can I just clarify on that last question which you just answered about the cost? Is this referring to the &#x2013; when I look at the bridge on slide 27, the other cost changes where you are saying that sort of &#x2013; for trucks, that should be stable quarter-by-quarter going forward but lower for cars. Did I understand that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what I said &#x2013; yes, I couldn't &#x2013; in the vehicle, as I said before, in trucks, we have the launch of the new Actros, so the effects we had in the second quarter, I do expect a stable development in our third and fourth quarter compared to the respective quarter in 2011. And on the car side, some slight decrease of that number which we had in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then, if I could also return to the issue of pricing if you &#x2013; I apologize for coming back to this, but you've been talking sequentially and the bridges that you provide are actually year-on-year. I just wondered if you could talk about pricing on a year-on-year basis, what you saw in the second quarter and what you'd expect in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were talking or I was talking specifically about the China story in the first quarter, and then that's about the development from this first quarter to the second quarter. That's why I referred to a sequential development. Of course in our reporting, we typically show year-over-year, and in this regard, we show it's Q2 2012 versus Q2 2011 as a flat story as far as pricing is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And so for the second half pricing, then, I've understood what you're hoping year-on-year for it to be stable but you're just highlighting that you're a little bit cautious on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I just maybe ask about Valmont and the outsourcing? Is this something that Daimler has done before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a number of examples for that. One is ongoing, that is our G-Class, but we are with Karmann we had for some time, and at least at Daimler Chrysler with Magna which is, if you want <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:24) as well. So we had examples, it's typically with specialty vehicles like the G-Wagon, as I mentioned, or like convertibles, for instance, niche vehicles that we had. One example, a long time ago with Porsche, we had the famous E500, mostly in purple. So, in a relatively small volume but that volume vehicle is taken to another plant, is somewhat new and once again reflects an overall mindset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry, you're saying that this is something that you might be doing more of to reduce the fixed costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said our objective is to use the growth opportunities into the future to address our overall structure to become a leaner company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got you. Okay, thank you very much for your answers.</p>
