        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on today's conference call for the third quarter earnings. Joining me in this conference call, we have Octavio Ornelas, the CFO of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicana; Jorge Pulido, Head of Investor Relations; and other executives of the Company. On today's conference call, I will briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and then the main issues impacting the company's profitability. Then I'll comment on our Mining division's most relevant results, to then pass the call onto Octavio, who will explain the financial results of our Transportation division. I will finally give you an update on your proposal to combine Southern Copper and Asarco operations.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, metal prices improved significantly due to robust demand largely driven by emerging markets, continuously declining inventories and therefore a tight copper market, a weak dollar as well, and excess of liquidity entering into the base metals. Consequently, during the third quarter of this year, we experienced further recovery that had increased volatility in the market.</p>
          <p>According to CRU, for the nine months of 2010 there was a trend to use up copper of nearly 10% compared to 2009, mainly explained by the recovery in usage of levels of copper in Japan, the European Union and the U.S. At the same time, China continued its purchases leading to a decline in inventories, low treatment charges, and a positive arbitrage between LME and Shanghai. This development is clearly evidence and we are moving towards a tight supply/demand balance and robust fundamental for copper. The average copper price for the quarter was $3.29 per pound, 25% above the $2.56 recorded in the same quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>In recent weeks, we've seen important spikes in copper prices, reaching a year-to-date high of $3.87 per pound. This was aided as well by our copper ETFs that were filed by JPMorgan and Briarclub and they are triggered by the return of risk appetite, as corporate results in general had been profit.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum, which as you know is our main byproduct, represented this quarter around 14% of our mining division sales. Moly prices have averaged $14.86 per pound, which is 8% below the average price in the second quarter of 2010, but 3% higher than prices in the third quarter 2009. We see Moly's consumption coming back to the level we had before the 2008 economic crisis. In addition, we hope to see higher prices and we expect to return to a deficit environment as the recovery of the energy, transportation and infrastructure sectors accelerate.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the Grupo M&#xE9;xico financial highlights, we are happy to report that in the third quarter of 2010 our total consolidated revenue was a little north of 2 billion, increasing 42% year-over-year. Sales for the first nine months of the year amounted to 5.8 billion, which represents an increase of 75% year-over-year. This increase was mainly due to higher metal prices and higher copper production volumes, as a result of the initial production of our Cananea Mine, combined with a significant increase of 28% in the revenues generated by our Transportation division.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for the third quarter was 998 million, an increase of 42% on a year-over-year basis. This cost increase of a little south of 300 million is mainly explained by the incorporation of Asarco, which alone accounted for 76% of this increase. It was also affected by higher prices in the several of our key inputs. Even as copper prices improved, the company will continue its efforts to reduce costs, improve productivity and maintain consumption and expense discipline with the goal of strengthening our position as one of the world's lowest copper producers.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the third quarter was 963 million, with an EBITDA margin of 48%. This figure represents an important 39% year-over-year. EBITDA for the first nine months of the year amounted to 2.8 billion, a significant increase of 95% year-over-year of which 545 came from Asarco. Net income in the third quarter was 452 million, an increase of 58% year-on-year. For the first nine months, net income grew 104% compared to the same period.</p>
          <p>Now, talking a little bit about CapEx, in the first nine months our CapEx expenditures amounted 364 million, of which 300 was spent in our Mining Division and 64 in the Transportation Division. In the Transportation Division, investments were made for the continued expansion of signings and the improvement of safety measures. Also as a result of the solid performance so far this year in our Transportation business, an extraordinary CapEx expense was approved of $107 million. This is for 2011.</p>
          <p>As you recall, during the second quarter Southern Copper announced the approval of a five-year CapEx program of $5.6 billion. This is to expand production and improve cost competitiveness. Of the total, 3.8 billion will be spent in Mexico and 1.8 billion in Peru. The program considers a $2.1 billion investment to expand in Cananea annual production. With respect to our T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project, which is the Greenfield project we're currently building in Peru, the companies have provided the Peruvian government additional information of the project, which includes the possibility of using seawater. A decision by the government regarding the environmental impact study of this project is expected for the fourth quarter of this year. This would allow us to commence construction, again, in the first quarter of 2011 and production by mid-2012.</p>
          <p>As of September 30th, the total consolidated debt amounted to 4 billion. With a cash balance of 2.8 billion, the company's net debt stands at 1.2 billion. The company maintains a comfortable long-term debt amortization schedule and an ample financial flexibility going forward. As you might recall, AMC secured a syndicated loan of 1.5 billion last December, which was used for the reorganization of Asarco. As of September 30th, the company had already prepaid a total of 650 million of this loan and has a remaining balance of approximately 850 million. In addition, Asarco fully prepaid its 280 million promissory note that was issued to the asbestos creditors, therefore Asarco has no debt outstanding.</p>
          <p>Our current cash position with our cash generation capability will support all operational needs and CapEx expenditure going forward, and would also allow us to have an ample room to explore additional value generating opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends, on September 10th, we paid a dividend payment of $0.17 pesos	 per share outstanding, which was equivalent to $105 million. For the third quarter, the company's Board approved yesterday a dividend payment of $0.25 pesos per share outstanding. This will be paid in cash on November 12th, and represents a disbursement of approximately 155 million.</p>
          <p>Due to the increased volatility that I mentioned in the basic metals, we contracted swaps and zero-cost collars to both, Southern Copper and Asarco. We entered into these contracts in order to reduce price volatility and protect a portion of our fourth quarter 2010 and 2011 sales volume. Combined, we have hedged around 70% of the expected production in the fourth quarter of this year, and for next year we have hedged around 51% of the estimated production in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now turning to a quick overview of Asarco, which as you know has completed three full quarters consolidating into Grupo M&#xE9;xico again. We are happy to comment that for the first nine months of the year Asarco's sales were 1.2 billion, a significant increase of 55% year-over-year. Cost of sales was 750 million, up 33% from the same period of 2009, although 6% lower than the second quarter 2010. EBITDA was 545 million with an EBITDA margin of 44%. Our net income was 247 million accumulated in the first nine months compared to only 1 million that we had for the same period of 2009.</p>
          <p>Asarco's copper mine production for the first nine months was 166,000 tons, an increase of 12% over the same period 2009. This increase is due primarily to better ore grades at Mission and improved recoveries at Ray. Asarco's cash cost continued to reduce, lowering it $1.19 for the first nine months from $1.65 per pound of copper in 2009. This improvement is a result of greater productivity, better operating efficiency, in addition to better product prices.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure year-to-date amounted only to 12 million. However, as we mentioned in our last conference call, exploration and drilling continues at the company's mines.</p>
          <p>I will now mention the main developments at Southern Copper, but we'll try to keep as brief, as Southern Copper had its conference call earlier this morning.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, Southern Copper's net sales were slightly over $1.2 billion, cost of sales was at 143 million, EBITDA was 676 million with an EBITDA margin of 54% and net income was 365 million for the quarter. In the third quarter, Southern Copper's mine production of copper increased 5.1% year-over-year and 10.3% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, mainly due to the start of production at our SX/EW plant in Cananea, as well we had higher ore grades and recoveries at all of our mines.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum reached a production of 5,000 tons in the quarter, and an aggregate production year to-date of a little north of 15,000 tons, increasing 12% year-over-year. Silver production was 6% lower and gold was up 17% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date cash cost after byproduct credits was 14.5 cents per pound. This cash cost was 22 cents lower than the 36.9 cent per pound of cash cost recorded in 2009, basically due to higher byproduct revenues and continued efficiencies in operating costs.</p>
          <p>With this, I will now pass in the call to Octavio who will disclose the financial highlights of our transportation business.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel, and good afternoon everyone. In the next few minutes I will talk about the main developments and results of our Transportation Division represented by Infraestructura y Transportes Mexico, its principal subsidiaries being Ferromex and Ferrosur</p>
          <p>Regarding Ferromex, load volumes transported during the third quarter of this year measured in net tons-kilometers totaled 11.8 billion compared to 10 billion of the same period of last year, representing an increase of 17%. Cargo in the first nine months of this year measured also in net tons-kilometers amounted to 34.1 billion, an annual increase of 18% and reached a record high in the number of railcars transported and net tons-kilometers.</p>
          <p>In terms of railcars, Ferromex transported 18% more cars than in the first nine months of 2009. The outcome of this sector show a strong return during the first nine months of this year, so the number of tons-kilometers moved were 45 above those in the same period of 2009. As a result of the solid performance so far in the year, we have reviewed our forecast for this year. We expect to move 47 billion net tons-kilometers instead of the initial estimate of 38.7 billion, representing an annual increase of 19.8%. In terms of revenue the annual increase will be around 20%.</p>
          <p>Regarding net sales for the third quarter, were 301 million, representing an annual increase of 28%. Net sales for the first nine months reached $870 million, a 31% increase due to higher load volumes, mainly, as I mentioned, from automotive with 45% and intermodal traffic with 36%.</p>
          <p>Operating cost for the third quarter amounted to 201 million, an annual increase of 28%. This increase is mainly attributable to increased freight volume, a 10% increase in the peso price of diesel, the damages related to Hurricane Alex, along with exchange rate effects, all of which were partially mitigated by better performance of our locomotives.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the third quarter of this year was nearly 93 million, a significant increase of 39% on year-to-date, with an EBITDA margin of 31%. In the nine months of this year EBITDA reached $289 million, a 50.3% annual increase, equivalent to 31% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Regarding capital expenditures, in the first nine months of this year, they amounted to nearly $67 million. The change has been to improve infrastructure throughout the routes, modernize the operating system for greater safety and improve the commercial systems. As a result of a strong growth in 2010, the Board of Directors, as Daniel mentioned, approved in July an extraordinary capital expenditure of 170 million, out of which 100 million are for purchase of 44 new light model locomotives and 70 million to expand eight current sidings and to build another 17 new ones. The locomotives have already been ordered and we will begin to receive them by May of 2011. Also, the expansion and construction of a new siding began in October, taking advantage of the dry season and will be operating in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly discuss the results of Ferrosur, which currently does not consolidate with ITF. Total revenues of Ferrosur in the third quarter were nearly 70 million, which represented year-to-year increase of 20%. Net sales in the first nine months reached $204 million, an annual increase of 24%.</p>
          <p>Load volumes transported during the third quarter of 2010 measured in net tons-kilometers were 1.8 billion, which is an increase of 1.8% against the second quarter of this year and 3.7% yearly basis. EBITDA during the third quarter was $19 million, an increase of 35% against the second quarter with an EBITDA margin of 28%. Accumulated EBITDA in 2010 amounted to 55 million, off 24% on an yearly basis, with a margin of 26.8%. Finally, capital expenditure in the first nine months amounted nearly $12 million, and in July of this year, Ferrosur booked nine light model locomotives to handle the current increasing volumes and that will be received on December of this year.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call to Daniel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Octavio. So I'm going to -- before questions -- give you a bit of an update of the merger or the combination of Southern Copper and Asarco. In August of this year, Southern Copper's Board finally completed the integration of professionals in the planning committee. They've retained financial and legal advisors and we are ready to start working with them in order to move on with the transaction. We believe that this combination of Southern Copper and Asarco will be providing important synergies, including cost reductions in operations, transportation and overhead, and capital expenditure savings, which would benefit all stockholders of the combined entity. As you know, we are proposing to combine those companies under Americas Mining Corporation. We feel that it would solidify our position as one of the leading copper companies in the world and enhance our scale of our operations.</p>
          <p>And with this, I think it's better if we can open up the floor to questions. Operator, can you please open up the floor.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Felipe Hirai with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions. The first one is related to the investments that you have in GAP in your cash position. Could you just please comment what are your intentions in making these investments, if you are going to have to reduce these investments, because as we understand there is a bylaw that a limit be -- that a investor cannot have more than 10% of a stake in a company, or on the other hand if you have any pressures to increase your participation on a company? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Felipe, and thank you for the question. As I mentioned in the last conference call, we've invested in Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico. We currently own a little bit north of 15% of the outstanding share capital. We started investing in the beginning of the 2008 economic crisis. We think it's a great investment. We liked the sector. We've made a an important return on that investment. And the reason we filed the complainer lawsuit that you're referring to, Felipe, is mainly because they have a clause in their bylaws that prohibits us having -- owning more than 10% of the share capital of a company, and when we acquired -- I mean, we went to a board meeting, they suggested that we should sell the additional 5% that we owned. So we just decided to ask a court to see whether that's valid or not.</p>
          <p>But I mean, as you know, we have a good relationship with them. We're participating with them as partners to the airport of the Riviera Maya. They've been the operators. They're own -- the GAP owning the majority of the special-purpose vehicle or consortium that we're putting together to that project, and our investment was mainly &#x2013; mainly we like the sector and we like the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So can you comment any on this intent to increase your participation as a company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment if you have any intentions to increase the stake that you currently own at GAP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Well, as we've seen -- as we've said in the past, when we look at that, that's an value creating opportunity for our treasury. You know that we currently hold a little bit south of $3 billion in our cash position consolidated, and we've done it when we think that the market conditions are optimum to a <mark type="inaudible" />. That's what we've been doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you think -- if I may ask a second question, could you just explain the reason why on the hedging side you have a higher percentage of your production hedged at Asarco than you have at Southern Copper? There any particular reasons for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, absolutely. I mean let me just start by the hedging position. Yes, we've hedged 100% of the production of Asarco mines for 2010, and for 2011, 83% of the production -- for 2011 I meant. The reason we've hedged more in Asarco is because Asarco has a more expensive cost base, if you like. And we believed that it would be prudent to secure those important margins for this quarter and to guarantee prices for the next year. So, as our policy has been in the past, we've hedged in 2006, 2007, 2008. 2009 we did not. Probably Asarco was in Chapter 11 back then. But we've been trying to lock in important margins to be a credit to our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Felipe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Sergio Matsumoto with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel, Octavio. I have a question &#x2013; a couple of questions. One is on the CapEx, and this is in relation to the Transportation Division in Asarco. Octavio, I think you mentioned that the CapEx for this year -- looks like a good chunk of it is going to come from the locomotives that you just ordered and they going to be delivered next year. So my question is, does this CapEx &#x2013; when does it hit the cash flow statement? Is it this year or is it next year? So could you please give us a guidance on what we can expect for CapEx in ITM for this year and next year and --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, Sergio. We have the approval of increasing the CapEx. The CapEx -- the first CapEx that was approved by the board was $140 million, and we almost have spent all that and we are on time. Next, we have the second approval of 170 million. This 170 million, most of the money's going to be spent next year. The locomotives will be delivered -- 30 by the end of May and another 14 by the end of September &#x2013; by the end of September, and that's when we have to pay for them. And the sidings -- we already began building these sidings for this year out of the 70 million. This year we will spend at the most $10 million of those 70 million. So most of the expense will occur next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; okay. That's helpful. And I guess still remaining -- well, in the CapEx in Asarco's side, it seems that CapEx keeps getting smaller each year. I mean, in 2008 it was 96 million; last year it was 53; this year so far you only have 20, right? Why does that keep coming down? Does it have to do with the merger that you're trying to do with Southern Copper side of operation? Can you explain what to expect on the CapEx in Asarco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, absolutely, Sergio. Well, first of all, you have to remember that Asarco was in Chapter 11 for five years. So we took control of the league by the end of last year or really at the beginning of this year. So it has been getting smaller more not because there's no need for CapEx. I mean there's an important exploration program. During these five years Asarco was in Chapter 11, there wasn't a lot of exploration conducted at our mines. So we have begun with our program of exploration in our mines and we meet with very important results. We think the reserves could be increased substantially just with the preliminary work. So there is an important amount that we &#x2013; we are going to invest in exploration CapEx.</p>
          <p>In terms of maintenance, we've already ordered additional trucks, and there is a lot of work to be done in terms of projects. I mean Silverdale, as you know, is one of our most efficient mines in the United States. That's one of the mines that we owned with <mark type="inaudible" /> and there's an important possibility that we can triplicate production there.</p>
          <p>So there is a lot of projects that we are working on. It's just that we've just regained control of the company, as I said, beginning of this year &#x2013; or at the end of last year, December 2009. So we've been spending a lot of time really on planning and in reorganizing the company in order to fit the -- again, their organizational structure and cost containment the way we have in Grupo M&#xE9;xico's companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's helpful. And lastly, going back to the Transportation Division, Octavio, you mentioned in the past, too, that the load volume could grow this year 16% compared to last year. Are you still comfortable with that figure?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I wanted to go back a little bit to the hedges. Can you talk a little bit about the copper price expectation that you have and &#x2013; yeah, basically maybe starting with that -- the copper price expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean for the reasons that I mentioned in the conference call, we feel positive of the copper price. I mean we think that fundamentally there is going to be a lot of supply next year and demand will keep on growing. And that is consistent with CRU, with Brook Hunt, international copper study groups and most of the analysts in the Street. However, there have been an important amount of liquidity in the sidelines, but are being invested in the base metals, including copper. There's then economic circumstances that have happened in the past, like the expectations of continued easing therefore the appreciation of the dollar, etcetera.</p>
          <p>So, we haven't seen in a long time <mark type="inaudible" /> seven months that the copper prices that we saw this past month. So, we really took advantage of that and locked in some of the profits, mostly with collars. I will be happy to give you the breakdown, we had it included in the earnings report. But, for example, this is on copper, we only hedged 11% in swaps, and we think that by hedging we are being responsible and locking in some margins, reducing volatility, and then if copper prices keep on growing and we hope it will do and we expect that the fundamentals further increase &#x2013; additional increases in copper prices, development or production we'll be taking advantage of that. That's really the way -- if that's your question that's really the way we look at hedging in the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Then the second question, if I may, in the press release it does mention that Cananea has restarted production full capacity of 180,000 tons as expected by -- well they just hit the run rate by February 2011. Can you give us a number of what it was in the third quarter and what you are seeing in the first quarter in terms of the run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll pass that on to Raul Jacob. He is the Head of Investor Relations of Southern Copper. He'll be happy to answer that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Yes, for the fourth quarter the estimated production for Cananea is 15,000 tons. We are expecting 20,000 tons in total for the year, five of those are already in the third quarter's results. So 15 more to go to our annual goal for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then just thinking about Cananea kind of on a two-three year view, what is the capacity of that mine, if everything goes -- and I realize I'm not taking that as a guidance or anything. But just for me to understand, what is the potential of that mine, if everything goes the way you want it to go, what can that mine produce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all that's a mine that has approximately 15% of our reserves. As you know, Southern Copper has the largest reserves in the world. That is a great deposit. And we believe that it could be up and running 100% of the capacity from February this year. We think that we can increase 400 -- currently it's 180,000, the production capacity at Cananea. We could increase that to 415 -- 450,000 tons, which is an increase of 150%. To give you an example, that will go from 180 -- I'm sorry &#x2013; close to 70. That will be per 150 somewhat. So that is the potential that we see and that is the project that we're working on currently. And I believe that's going to be drawn through phases another five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, so it's over five years, okay. Okay. And then finally, it's just real quick on the operating costs or cost per pound ignoring the byproduct credits. What is the run rate on operating costs, say, relative to PPI or relative to CPI right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing some cost inflation in our Province. Just keep in mind that that year was a year of very hard recession. So, most of our suppliers reduced their prices significantly to keep their business with us and with some other mining companies. This year we're still bouncing back on that. But if you take operating costs, they just increased 2% between this quarter and the third one of 2009. So, we don't see significant cost inflation at this point. Obviously, if fuel prices go up, we will have &#x2013; that will hit us directly. But that's the kind of causes we're more concerned at this point, power and fuel. Unit costs, it seems to be under control and once we receive the additional production from Cananea, our cash cost before the total credit will go to a lower level, because that production that we will get at a much lower cost and that will average cost for copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one last question, if I may. With respect to your cash operating cost, and this is ignoring Asarco, so this is just looking at Peru and Mexico. What percent of your cash operating cost is in local currency and what percent is either in FX or linked to FX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In both Mexico and Peru about 40% of total costs, it's in local currency. So, you could say 20% in pesos and 20% in Peruvian Nuevo Sol.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. I don't know if you've already answered this question that do we have an estimate regarding the amount of production that we can see next year coming from Cananea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean what we said, Rodrigo, just to recap is that our estimate for the fourth quarter is 50,000 tons. We've already produced 5,000 tons. This comes all of the <mark type="inaudible" /> which is in our SX/EW facilities, and for next year out of the 180,000 tons of capacity, we're going to miss a couple of months. We re expecting a little bit north of 150,000 tons.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. One more, the &#x2013; there is a reason or what is the reason for GMexico not declare any dividend?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you missed that. We did pay dividends, and actually we increased the dividend. So if you've seen in the past our dividend for the last three quarters has been around $0.17 pesos per share outstanding. And then we increased that to $0.25 pesos per share outstanding.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry for the background noise. I was just wondering if you can give me an update on the process -- we're waiting for the risk ruling in terms of the merger of Ferromex and Ferrosur. So, is there anything that you can do to expedite, is there anything that you can &#x2013; is there -- can it just take another six months, can it take another 12 months, is there anything that you can do proactively to speed things up? And then the second question was on the railway side, one, if there is any guidance for 2011 volume growth? And with the locomotives, the initial &#x2013; the additional orders being placed, is that &#x2013; is that really for &#x2013; is it all for growth or is it also about modernizing the locomotive fleet? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your first question regarding the merger of Ferromex-Ferrosur, we should say on the concentration by ITM of Ferrosur, well we &#x2013; as I mentioned before on May 12th of this year the Federal Court of Justice on Tax and Administrative Matters, we sold as a true acquisition of Ferrosur by ITM.</p>
          <p>The notification to the parties was just released in the second week of October and <mark type="inaudible" /> the Antitrust Commission has 15 days to submit a revision reserve if it wants to challenge the ruling. We are right now in that time period, so we might in the next few days want to challenge. They should do it by next week. Okay? And we will be notified whether they appeal. The issue will be decided in another tribunal, which is called the Federal Court, the Circuit Court and that will take, we think, no more than six months. Okay? That's the time span.</p>
          <p>Regarding the margin growth for 2011, in carloads we are budgeting an increase &#x2013; it's very preliminary, of around 6%. Revenue growth is higher than that 6%, of course, because of the pricing &#x2013; the pricing power that we're having right now. And regarding the locomotives, no they are intended to cover the new traffics. The new traffic -- the increase in the traffic that we are having. We already are having that. Right now Ferromex is leasing in the market many locomotives from the third-parties and that which are handling right now all the cargo, the increasing cargo. We are going to replace such leasing locomotives with the new ones.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen; good afternoon. It's actually Claudia Mellina from Ita&#xFA; Asset Management . My question is regarding strategy, please. Now you have clearly stated that you are, of course, interested in going for the construction portion of the Riviera Maya airport. So, the question is regarding the investment in GAP. I mean in the past you had repeatedly said that this was only a treasure investment. Now it no longer appears so. It would all make sense, of course, if you guys &#x2013; well if GAP wants the Riviera Maya airport. What happens if they don't? Would you divest your 15%, would you pursue the legal process to keep accumulating shares? What is the outlook there, please? What will you intend to do with that investment for the long run?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Claudia. Thank you for the question. Well, first of all, the strategy of Grupo is &#x2013; first of all, continue developing organically the growth of its mining division, which as you know, is the most essential part of the business. And that given &#x2013; having the largest resource in the world and by the integration of Asarco and Southern Copper, therefore synergies could be generated. That's on the leg, if you like, of the mining business.</p>
          <p>In Transportation Division, we are continuously growing. To probably just explain what we are doing in terms of CapEx, additional CapEx, and then we've exceeded records, as Felipe pointed out this quarter with Circa as our competitors, et cetera. So, we are going to keep on doing that. In terms of infrastructure, yes we've been involved in the construction business. That has always been very slow compared to the rest of the group. We think that there's opportunity in infrastructure to develop those business and that's what we're going to pursue, and on a project-by-project basis, we'll just probably report in IRRs, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Regarding GAP, we've obtained an important return on our investment that we acquired most of the shares while the economic crisis of 2008, 2009, and we are participating in the Riviera Maya with GAP as a partner, because we think that airports are a good investments as part of our restructured portfolio. Whether we are not awarded with the Riviera Maya project, will we sell our GAP shares, no. I mean this is treasury investment, we have it there. We think it's a good investment and we like the business. We like the dividend policies. They have &#x2013; we like their important EBITDA margins they have, and that's all. I don't know if that answers your questions, Claudia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is also, do you try to keep accumulating or not? I mean, again, at first this was supposed to be a treasure investment, but going to court to retain your 15% is an awful lot of trouble to go through for just the treasure investment. So, do you intend at some point to significantly increase your stake in that company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, again, we've done those very opportunistically an investment. We went to court basically because under their bylaws no shareholder should own more than 10%, and if he does there are some rights, like receiving dividends, voting, what have you that all with the current bylaws. So, you cannot exercise. So we're asking verification in that point. At this point that is what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. And thanks for taking the time on the call. I have a question about kind of the same sort of issues, but really going back to what you said Daniel about the special committee and the potential combination on the Southern Copper side. It sounds like you're still in the early stages. I wanted to know if you had any idea in terms of the timeline of that. I mean is this special committee, do you expect that to move forward this year, is that first quarter next year, second quarter next year? And that was the first question, timeline on that. And then the second question is have you given any -- have you had a chance to give any additional thought to what happens to the Southern Copper bonds in the combination, whether they'll stay outstanding and whether you intend to keep them rated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Sure, Jim. Thank you for your questions. Well, let me start with the timeline issue, and of course <mark type="inaudible" /> quarter for the special committee to assemble and to retain financial and legal advisors. I mean they have -- understand that they have to be very prudent and interview firms and what have you. So that happened already. That took a quarter. We think that the timeline, obviously, dependent on the due diligence -- the amount of due diligence, both financially and legally, the special independent board wants to undertake and we put together a datum, et cetera. You know how these transactions work. So there is no specific date. However, we do think that it's something that could be accomplished by the first half of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bonds will remain outstanding, and at this point I believe they're looking at the transaction. But Southern Copper will remain as an independent and separate entity from Asarco and from Americas Mining Corporation. So we'll just be de-listed, if you like, and being part of a listed greater entity called Americas Mining Company, which will be the NYSE, LIMA and Mexico registered company. But as a bondholder you should pretty much staying the same.</p>

          <p>Your next question is a follow-up question from Taras Shumelda with American Century.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Like to return to the airport strategy and just generally to the, I guess, opportunistic investment strategy. With respect to the airport itself, you already said it's opportunistic. Are there any of the airports &#x2013; and I am not very well familiar with GAP, so forgive me if that's too basic of a question -- are any of the airports that GAP operates of any sort of operational and strategic importance to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean obviously this is a business that is not totally complementary or that creates all the synergies what we currently have, if you look at it from an operations point of view, as opposed to the Riviera Maya where building it makes a lot of sense for our construction company. I mean, GAP has airports; their main airport is Guadalajara and Tijuana, and we do have a very important operations hub in Ferromex in Guadalajara. If that's probably what you're asking, but that's not the rationale for investment there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then &#x2013; thank you -- and then a second question along those lines. You already mentioned GAP was an opportunistic investment. Do you have any sort of internal risk measurement parameters or risk management parameters that would say if you are going to pursue an opportunistic investment, here is either the absolute size of capital that -- maximum -- that you're willing to commit or percent of excess capital? In other words some sort of a metric, a safety valve, a stopgap of sorts, that is quantifiable but we could use for our analysis purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, yes, of course. I mean, here just to put it in perspective. I mean we have nearly $2 billion in cash, we invested 200 million in this shares that we currently own, and that is important to put this into perspective. And really, I mean that's the reason we've done this as part of our reinvestment, and we've obtained more than 65% or our return on our investments and that's the way we look at it now. We like the business and we like the sector, as I pointed out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me play a little bit of a devil's advocate, if I may. You have already mentioned about the five-year plan on Cananea. Why not bring it forward? Why not put more resources at it and reinvest the cash that way, or are you telling &#x2013; or are there any technological constraints, or are you actually seeing GAP being a better opportunity than your core business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, absolutely not. I mean, let me just try to explain it for you. Grupo M&#xE9;xico is the owner of Southern Copper 80%. Southern Copper is having some cash, some debt and some CapEx programs going forward, and importantly in the mining industry you cannot undertake projects and put production out there, as easy as it sounds when we talk about earnings conference calls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Undertaking this kind of project, you can see from the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a, project, I mean that's a $1 billion or $934 million project in the southern part of Peru. We've been &#x2013; we have our funds there. We went to the market. We went with $5 billion at the beginning of the year, in April, and we have not been able to expand and develop that project to start a new life based really on the reality of the mining &#x2013; of the mining industry, and the same thing happened with Cananea. I mean, not that you could invest as much as you want every year just because -- I mean, GAP &#x2013; the $200 million we invested in GAP will not change the development of any project at the sub level which is on the covenant.</p>

The timeframe for the GAP legal filings, do you have any &#x2013; can you quantify that at all in the same way that you've quantified the Independence Committee for the AMC transaction? And secondly, just to clarify on Caridad in terms of the resolution there, were there any concessions at all that were made to the workers, or it was just taken care of by government enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>Sure. Well first of all in GAP, as you know the penal system in Mexico, as in the U.S., which is <mark type="inaudible" /> is very uncertain and we have no specific time line.</p>
          <p>Turning to Cananea, Rene, <mark type="inaudible" /> I apologize. First of all it's important to say that operations are back to normal. This was mainly caused by a very small group of people that weren't happy with the way the decisions have been issued in terms of the full legal environment with the mining union. And second, we were able to sell <mark type="inaudible" /> as I pointed out in the morning in Southern Copper's conference call, that are very important premiums at a very outstanding market conditions. So, no, I mean there is no concessions. It was mainly an illegal road blockage, which happened there.</p>
