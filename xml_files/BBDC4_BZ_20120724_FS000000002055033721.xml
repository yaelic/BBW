      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. First of all, I would like to thank you, all, for taking part in this conference call. Slides two and three show our main period's highlights.</p>
          <p>On the slide two, I would particularly like to mention our first half adjusted net income, which totaled R$ 5.7 billion, 2.7% more than the same period in last year. I also wish to draw your attention to our adjusted net interest income, which grew by 15.4% over the first half of last year. And our total assets which came to R$830 billion, 5.2% up in the quarter and 20.5% more than in June 2011.</p>
          <p>On slide three, especially worth noting our assets under management, which ended the quarter at R$1.131 trillion, a 21% increase over June 2011, and our efficiency ratio which fell by a strong 30 basis points in the last 12 months closing the first half at 42.4%.</p>
          <p>On slide four, we show the reconciliation between our book net income and adjusted net income in the respective periods. This quarter, as in the previous three months, there was only one non-recurring item, the provision for civil contingencies, which totaled R$57 million gross.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for this effect, our book net income increases from R$2.833 billion, generating a normalized return of 20.9% in the quarter. Also in this slide, you can see that our return on average equity came to around 20% in both the book and adjusted net income concepts.</p>
          <p>Slide five, it shows our historical series of our quarterly net income. Income growth in the second quarter and in the first half of the year was mainly due to the higher net income &#x2013; the higher net interest income, the higher fee income and the increased revenue from our insurance group. This upturn was partially impacted by higher provision for loan loss. It is in particular worth noting that our earnings per share for the last 12 months increased by 5.3% from R$2.82 to R$2.97.</p>
          <p>Slide six shows our efficiency ratio. The improvement in the second quarter efficiency ratio over the last 12 months was due to the investments in our organic growth strategy. It should start producing effects with the maturation of the certain investments and our continuous efforts to control expenses, including the actions taken by our efficiency committee. The events that most contributed to this improvement where the upturn in net interest income and the fee income. Thanks to the higher volume of business, the growth of our client base, that's around 5 million new clients, considering the financial and the insurance business, and the 1.6 million new checking accounts.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, I would particularly like to draw your attention to the increase in our shareholders' equity positively impacted by R$4.1 billion and gains from certain insurance group securities, which used to be booked as held to maturity and are now classified as available for sale. And the difference between their marked value and the booked value is taken directly to shareholder's equity net of tax.</p>
          <p>It is also worth mentioning our exceptionally healthy Basel ratio, which closed by quarter at 17%, leading to a big increase in our capitalization margin. The upturn in this ratio was due to the addition of R$7.9 billion in subordinated financial bills ratified by the central bank in the period in addition to the gains from the securities I have just mentioned.</p>
          <p>As we had already seen, total assets came to R$830 billion, R$141 billion or 20.5% margin in June 2011. Return on average asset totaled 1.4%, while the adjusted return on average equity stood at 20.6%.</p>
          <p>Slide eight shows the relative share of our main operations in net income. The quarterly and the six months highlight was increases in the relative share of securities, mainly due to higher trading gains.</p>
          <p>It is also worth noting the upturn in the relative share of our insurance group in the six months comparison to 31% of our net income, thanks to the excellent performance of this segment. The reduction in the share of loans was partially due to a higher delinquency in the period together with lower spreads.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide nine, unrealized gains total a substantial R$21.5 billion basically due to the appreciation of the fixed income securities and some of our investments, especially Cielo's share as well as unrealized gains from loans and leasing operation.</p>
          <p>It is important to emphasize that these figures do not include the potential goodwill from our own purchase in the total amount of R$3 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we show that interest-earning portion increased by 2.9% in the quarter, largely due to the upturn in average business volume as the non-interest-earning portion recorded higher treasury gains in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 11, as I have just mentioned, the interest-earning portion of net interest income increased by 2.9% in the quarter, thanks to the higher volume of the new business while the unrealized net interest margin is slightly due to 7.5%, although this was in line with our expectation. The main sectors behind the 10-basis point decline in the annualized margin were the narrower insurance and disposing margins but partially offset by higher margins on securities including the effects of mainly of our fixed loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 gives a breakdown of the interest-earning portion of net interest income. Securities have recorded most growth in the quarter, including gains from the measurement of our fixed commercial portfolio. The reductions in the funding and the insurance lines were caused by the decline in the interest rate, lower returns from <mark type="ph" /> IPCA index (12:40), securities and our consumer price index ended the 15.7% depreciation of the Ibovespa index in that period. And the comparison between the first half of 2012 with the same period last year, the highlight was the 14.3% increase in the spread margin, mainly due to the upturn in the business volume.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, we can see that the gross credit margin, the grey area, increased by 2.5% this quarter, sustained by a higher business volume but partially offset by the decrease in the average spreads.</p>
          <p>The red area shows the provision for loan loss, which increased partially due to the specific adjustments of the provision levels in line with expectations of loss from operations with a few corporate clients. It's important to emphasize that these adjustments do not indicate any negative provision trend, as they consisted of a particular situation. In the annual comparison, the net margin remains equally flat due to higher delinquency despite due to the increase in business volume.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, our expanded loan portfolio totaled R$365 billion in June 2012, 4% up in the quarter and 14.1% increase when compared with June 2011. These increases were mainly due to the higher loans to large corporates which moved up by 7% in the quarter and 15.9% in the annual comparison. The annual comparison &#x2013; the highlights were mortgage loans, export financing in capital market related operations with credit risk basically comprising debentures and promissory notes. Individual loans resume growth mainly due the measures to stimulate consumption.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 15, this quarter our total delinquency ratio for loans overdue by more than 90 days remains stable in the individual as well as micro, small and medium enterprises segments. The five basis point increase in the overall ratio over the previous quarter was impacted assets on our loan of basis by the increase in delinquency of the large corporate segment, as I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>This change in the large corporate segment does not indicate any negative trend in the delinquency as there were only a few particular issues. We believe this ratio will show a slight decrease in the coming quarter given the effects of the SELIC base rate cuts and the expectations of higher economic activity in the most ahead.</p>
          <p>The slide 16 shows our delinquency ratio for loans overdue by between 61 days and 90 days and as you can see, it has remained relatively stable indicating that delinquency is really under control.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, despite the upturn in the delinquency in the recent quarters, you can see on this slide that we have maintained comfortable provisioning levels. In fact, our provisions exceeded Central Bank's requirements by R$4 billion, assuming the maintenance of the 12 months gross and net loss ratios, that's on June 2011.</p>
          <p>We had booked provision in excess of R$7.8 billion in relation to expected gross loss in the next 12 months. The dotted part of the blue line or even R$11.2 billion in relation to losses net of recoveries, the dotted part of the purple line also for the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 shows the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses in relation to credit over due by more than 90 and 60 days, which remains at comfortable levels and amongst the highest for Brazilian banks. For credit over dues by more than 60 days, the coverage ratio is 144% and for credit over dues by more than 90 days, it is 177%.</p>
          <p>Slide 19. The second quarter fee income totaled R$4.281 million, 4% up on the previous quarter. In the first half, fee income increased by 15.7% year-on-year, mainly due to the expansion of our customer sales portfolio, the net addition of around 1.6 million new account holders, and the expansion of our service network, resulting for our organic growth investments highlights more higher revenues from cards, checking accounting, asset management and underwriting operations.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to slide 20. Operating expenses increased by 3.3% of the previous quarter but huge upturn in personnel expenses was mostly due to the structural portion, which was impacted by higher expense to reduce in concentration of applications, the non-structural portion was impacted by higher expansions, which provision for legal claims, profit sharing and training.</p>
          <p>The half yearly comparison, the increase in these expenses was mainly due to the impact of the 2011 collective bargaining agreement and the net addition of 6,200 employees to the workforce. It's always worth emphasizing that the expansion of our workforce is concentrated in our sales force due to both organic growth and improved segmentation.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, we can see that administrative expenses reported a very slight 1.2% upturn in the quarter, reflecting the result of our intense efforts to control and streamline our administrative expense. The increase over the same period last year was compatible with the extension of the SaaS network and the consequence expansion of business volume.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 shows revenues from our insurance pension plan and capitalization bond activities, which increased by 22.8% in the second quarter led by life insurance and pension plans and capitalization bonds, which grew by 34.5% and 17.9%, respectively. In the annual comparison, the increase came into 20.1% with all segments recording double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Second quarter net income recorded a slight decrease mainly due to the lower financial results in the period, but health net income increased 14.4% year-on-year, mainly due to higher revenues, the reduced claims ratio and the improved financial position.</p>
          <p>Life insurance shows some of the main figures from our insurance activities, the combining ratio came to 85% in the second quarter, six basis points down on the quarter before essentially due to the reduction in the claims ratio and the big upturn in the revenues. Financial assets totaled R$128 billion, 21% up year-on-year, while technical provisions came to R$112 billion, R$98 billion of which relates to our life insurance and pension plan products.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 24, as for our 2012 guidance, we have made a few adjustments considering the behavior of our few portfolios in the first half and also the second half economic growth forecasts. We revised our loan portfolio and vehicle and credit card products flow estimates.</p>
          <p>And now we are revising the estimates for our real estate financing originations, which should register a similar volume to that of 2011 for fee income and insurance premiums, thanks to excellent performance during the period. And we are maintaining our initial estimates for the net interest income and operating expenses.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we believe we had a quarter of healthy results. As you have seen, our results and ratios remain sustainable irrespective of domestic and the international economic challenges we have had to face. Delinquency is under control and tends to show a gradual decrease for the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>We had also maintained a strict control over loan ranking and low portfolio cards mandatory. In this context, it is worth noting that in the last 12 months, new borrowers had accounted for around 70% of portfolio growth, and 95% of this new operations has good quality ratings from AA to C. <mark type="ph" /> And their line it is &#x2013; deposit are (24:55) consistent of our credit evaluation process guarantees and instruments. While during the subject of loans, we are maintaining our forecast in more rapid recovery this half although at a somewhat slower pace than we expect at this beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>We had have recorded consistent revenue growth from the extension of our operations, extension of our customer basis and the maturation of our organic growth investment. Our operating expense having being leveling off, thanks to the continuous monitoring of expenses and it still gains from our consistent investment.</p>
          <p>Once again, I would like to emphasize the positive effects of this performance in our efficiency ratios. We believe the Brazilian economy, we've responded to the stimulus measures and by this, we will therefore continue with this track record for organic growth leveraging its banking and insurance activities in a responsible manner and contributing to the more capitalization of credit and sustainable development.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention, and we are now available to answer any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Ms. Regina Sanchez with Ita&#xFA; BBA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody. I have two questions. The first one is regarding the significant increase in the book value of Bradesco that we know what's related to reclassification of securities from the held to maturity portfolio to available for sale in impact the equity value in the amount of R$4 billion. What I would like to know is that, I mean, what was the motivation, I mean, was a regulation changed or maybe regarding IFRS adoption in the insurance business that most of the securities were related to insurance business?</p>
          <p>And more importantly, I mean, now that it's booked as available for sale, are there any real intention to sell the securities or only eventually in the future? And what are their average maturity to get an idea of how long this gain will take to go through the income statement if you don't sell them before maturity? And then I'll ask my second question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. These adjustments that we did in equities was more for &#x2013; because the adoption of the IFRS for our insurance company, in the banking, we decided to have the semi account classification and now we are using the semi classification in the accounting purpose. And this was the huge motivation for to do this adjustment.</p>
          <p>This securities &#x2013; the maturities, some of them, they have more than 10 years because they are used in our insurance business for support of the provisions. And most of them have more than 10 years of maturity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you intend to sell &#x2013; any intention of selling this before maturity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. As I said, these securities are used in our insurance business for support the provisions normally for our pension plans in the &#x2013; for our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:44) this is why the average maturities is more than 10 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Okay. Thanks for that. And my second question is regarding, I mean, asset quality going forward. We saw that &#x2013; any of your ratios increased 10 basis points in the second quarter. And, I mean, what is the expectation going forward, and if you could give us a breakdown, if you expect I mean corporate NPL ratios also to already decline or more in the individual side in another data that I'm not sure if you have that information, the early NPL ratio, the NPL ratio between 15 days and 90 days, if you have a sense as a leading indicator, how was it in the second quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We had a little increase in our delinquency ratio of 0.1%, considering that the segments that we have individuals doing the last quarter was stable, SMEs in the similar situation. But in the corporate side, we had specific situations that we had a little increase is not same <mark type="ph" /> basically true (31:12) for the future. It was only a specific situation. And we expect for the next quarters that our delinquency ratio, we will start to have a gradual decrease because for the second half this year we expect is that the effects of the accelerating economy and the expectation to have a better growing economy, we understand that we will have &#x2013; start to decrease in the delinquency ratio.</p>
          <p>In the short delinquency ratio, in some province, we can see that we started to have a better situation, more individual is more clear that we start to have a better delinquency ratio in some province.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. And as you mentioned that you expect a gradual decrease, can you give us a range or an idea of how many basis points to expect to see NPL ratio declining by the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, difficult to give you a guide into now. But probably, we will have something similar that we start the year that's something around the 3.9%, 3.8%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thanks a lot, and congratulations on the operating trends that I really like to see number of clients increasing, checking accounts increasing, and the number of employees declining quarter-over-quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Excuse me our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Couple of questions. First, first a clarification to the question on the reclassification from held to maturity to available for sale, I just want to make sure I understand. So the reclassification is related to the adoption of IFRS accounting after insurance subsidiaries, which mandates that you reclassify them and you want to be consistent in your accounting for that at the financial group, is that &#x2013; am I understanding that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are now adjusting the criteria for &#x2013; using the same criteria in the companies because the IFRS is something new in the country in Brazil, and the companies start to migrate and start to adopt the IFRS. The insurance companies, they start to adopt during 2011 and the financial companies, the Brazilian, we are not adopting IFRS totally. We are adopting in parts. We are following the central bank's rules but talking about what it is secured, we are now using the semi classification and then we decide to use in semi phases, this is why we &#x2013; this adjustment this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no, okay, that's helpful. Secondly, want to also follow-up in the corporate NPLs, you seem to be very confident that these are sort of temporary issues related to very small numbers of credit, can you just help us understand a little bit better why you're so confident that these are sort of temporary issues. I know you can't get into a lot of color because of Bank secrecy laws, but are we talking about one credit that's very small number of credits, anything you could say that would help us understand the issue and help us feel comfortable that this is not a &#x2013; that this is a temporary issue and that's it's not going to continue to worsen, would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have a total control of our loan portfolio. We maintain analysis there of the quality, then during this last year &#x2013; I think in the last two years, that our &#x2013; that 80 &#x2013; all in two years it was stable, the corporate delinquency ratio, then &#x2013; this is only a specifically situation that we had.</p>
          <p>And we did not see any other problem and any situation that can represent some risk for us in this segment. Then this is why we say that we are confident that these are specific situations and then for the future, we will not have a problem with this segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this is a specific situation, it's not multiple case. Okay.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions, gentlemen. On asset quality, if you could comment on your coverage ratio which has remained very healthy, both measured on a 60-day basis or 90-day but has been steadily declining since it peaked in September of last year. Is it going to stabilize at current levels, or should we expect it to gradually continue to decline? And what is the level of coverage, whether you want to be filing on a 60 days or 90 days that you would feel comfortable to sustain over time?</p>
          <p>And second on expenses. For the first half of the year, your operating expenses including both personnel and administrative expenses have grown a touch above 12% year-on-year, 12.4%. Your guidance which you reiterated for the year is 8% to 12%. Do you think it's going to be a stretch to reach even the high end of that guidance, or do you expect a moderation in expense of the second half year below this 12.4% that we have seen in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for the question. Talk about the coverage ratio, we had a little decline this quarter because we are maintaining the excess provisions stable R$4 billion, and we are having &#x2013; growing our portfolio. The delinquency ratio will be stable then it is why we had a little decline. We actually said that considering this decline because we maintain a very good coverage compared with other banks, the Brazilian banks with the system.</p>
          <p>We understandably have a very good coverage. For the future, considering that we expected declining in the delinquency ratio could be that this reduction will start to reduce, will start to decline, will be lower in the future and it could subside. We had growing the portfolio &#x2013; considering the expectations for the future with the decline of delinquency ratio and the growth that we expect probably we will have the capitalization in this ratio, the coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>Talk about the expansions. The guidance that we have is 2012. We finished this quarter year-by-year comparison with 12.4%. If you analyze the year 2011, we had strong growth in the second half. Then in the second half 2011, we opened 1,000 new branch then our expansion in the second half 2011 was higher.</p>
          <p>Then considering that the next two quarters that the growth that we are having in our expansions, we had a target for the 2012 growth that the expansion will be around 10% and we expected that &#x2013; we understand that we can reach in these target. We are very committed to reach this number. That is why we maintained the guidance and we understand that the final growth comparing 2012 with 2011 will be, in our targeting, will be 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to make sure I understood you correctly in your second response, Luiz Carlos, you are saying that although the guidance is a range 8% to12%, you're really targeting 10%, and that you feel comfortable you will reach 10% or 10% is the pay that you expect for the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is 10% is the growth that we expect in comparing 2012 which in 2011 is a growth for the year 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's useful. And just to elaborate a bit more on the response to the first question, I was not referring only to a small decline that we saw in this quarter and your coverage ratio. Your coverage ratio has been declining quite steadily for the past several quarters. If I look at slide 18, for much of 2010-11 your coverage ratio measure on the per basis that you mentioned was in the 190% plus level and then it declined to the 180% toward the end of last year, early this year and now is in the 170%. So you think it's going to stabilize somewhere in the 170% or at some point as the NPL ratio starts to decline, this ratio may start to go back up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We understand that with the expectation of the delinquency ratio will start to decrease, go up the stabilization, we will be around the level that we have now probably 144%, 146% is 177% for 90 days, the stabilization will be in the level, the actual level that we expected.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I mean my questions have been asked and answered pretty much, but maybe I could ask a follow-up on the insurance side of the business. I mean you did mention that you're seeing this be impacted, at least returns be impacted by lower rates. I mean if we do see rates continue to go lower which is very possible here, can we &#x2013; do you think you can expect further pressure here on insurance returns? And do you think in 2Q &#x2013; are we just beginning to see the first effects of monetary relaxation? Will we see the full impact do you think in the second half of the year of say a 8% SELIC rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The fact that we had in the second half, one part it gives reduction in the SELIC rates, but another part can from the decline that we had in the Ibovespa because our insurance company they have some shares in their portfolio that will affect the margin. Then in the second quarter, Ibovespa reduces around 15% then this was one of the effects that we had in the insurance business.</p>
          <p>We expect for the next quarter that probably in the second half probably we will have a stabilization and the growth that we're having in the premium side, the good results that we've indeed, the expectation for the insurance business there, the opportunities that we have in the country. We understand that Bradesco's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:36) can maintain the profitability, the ROE for the year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. My question is in regards to your Tier 1 capital ratio on slide seven of your presentation. Your Tier 1 capital ratio has been consistently falling over past six to seven quarters. So the latest numbers in the second quarter was down to 11.8%. Now, a year earlier it was 12.9% and if you go back to six, seven quarters, I believe it was around 13.5%. So the question really is really if you can help us explain why this is happening, what is causing it, and I guess going forward is this trend likely to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a zero decrease in this Tier 1. One cause of the growth of the assets. We had some allusions in the risk part for some new rules and we have some investment that affected the Tier 1 ratio. But we expected more stabilization in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess, are your risk-weighted assets growing very rapidly? Is that why this ratio keeps on coming down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we had an effect of the growth, growing the assets, but here one other effect is in the one adjusted because new rules that we have in this market risk, these are adjustments reduce it to zero in Tier 1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess going forward, I mean, is this going to continue falling or are we seeing things stabilizing now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect that probably &#x2013; we will have more stabilization difference. The growth that we expect to have we probably will have a compensation with the profitability. This specific adjustment that we're having, we understand that the loss will impact in the future, but we expect lower stabilization in the future for this Tier 1 ratio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Let me ask one question. You have reduced your loan growth guidance while you've maintained your net interest income growth guidance unchanged. So I was just trying to hear from you, how do you plan on maintaining your net interest margin stable? Even though SELIC is under pressure, there's significant pressure on the banks in Brazil to reduce credit spreads. If you can provide us some color on that, that will be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We've reduced our growth for loans for the &#x2013; in the beginning of the year when we gave the guidance, we expect our GDP growth for the year was around 4%. Then we started to have some adjustments in these expectations for the GDP growth. Now we have around 2.1% which is our expectation for the year, and considering the growth that we are having in our portfolio, we provide a new guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>But for our net interest margin, we foresee that the guidance that we gave in the beginning of the year was a little conservative, and the fact that we have the components of the margin, the growing the credit and the effect of our prefixed portfolio that impacted our margin. We have to say that we can obtain this guidance for the margin the net interest income.</p>
          <p>This is why we use the sentence that we decide two months ahead the pressure that we're having in the margin, in the spreads we're having in some specific problems, that represents a small portion of the total portfolio. Then there is the effect that we are having in the spreads, we are having compensation with the volume and they grow in the credit portfolio. Then if you compare &#x2013; they grow in the margin of spreads, in the last year it was around at 15%. Then we understand that for this year we can maintain this guidance for the net interest income.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I actually have a couple of questions. The first one is a follow-up on Mario's question on margins. As he was saying, the margins in the quarter for your credit operations, I think they were down around 10 basis points and for insurance they were down more than that. The margin on your fixed income &#x2013; on your securities book, however, was up around 60 basis points and helped stabilize the margin on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>You talked in the past about a fixed income book, fixed rate security book that you have that provides support to your margins as rates go down. What's the maturity of that book? How much longer can we expect that book to support your margins, going forward? Is this something that will last until the end of this year or should we expect it to last until the middle of next year or maybe even further? And I'll wait for the answer for my next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:45) This operation, the prefixed operations are represented for the &#x2013; our own part for auto loans, is more &#x2013; and you see those operations then one part of this portfolio is auto loans operations and we expect that probably the effects we will have this year and for 2013 we will maintain one part of these effects. And the age of maturity was around the 18 months, one year and a half. But we expect that during 2013 we will have some effects of this prefixed portfolio in the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should expect your margins to remain resilient through the end this year and the beginning of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We expect one part of these effects will reflect in 2013.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. Second question, that's great performance on the admin expense side of the expense base. However, I was noticing that the other operating expenses, they were up 4% this quarter, and they're up 20% year-on-year &#x2013; I'm so sorry, year-to-date compared to last year. And I just wanted to see what is the expectation for this line? If you just look at the graph that you have in your MD&amp;A, it does look like it took a step up. Is this related to the branch opening in that throughout the year, last year? What should we expect for this other operating expense line going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the operating expense?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not the administrative expense, not &#x2013; the other operating expense in revenue line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have the guidance only for the total operating expense, the personal and the administrative. The total guidance is 8% to 12%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But would it be reasonable for us to expect that the other operating expense in revenue line to decelerate from the 20% pace that it's treading right now or is it likely to increase the pace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think &#x2013; probably, we'll be &#x2013; we don't have the guidance for this. But probably it would be stable. We'll continue more stable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it will decelerate a little bit, right, not at the same pace of 20% that we're seeing so far?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have two questions. The first one is a follow-up on the capital. I mean, of course, the change in the classification of securities have to do quite a lot on your capital, but are you expecting that the upcoming regulation on the insurance business, I mean, regarding the one that you mentioned before that could have a negative impact of maybe R$7 billion in your card capital, do you think this is about to be release or when should you expect any news on that?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding provisions, I mean, of course there was an increase in provision in the quarter. You mentioned this was related to some corporate loans. Would you expect any extra provisions or some leftover arising from the same corporate to be recognized in the third quarter or everything has been done and that's it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all we kept all the capital, we consider that the insurance business, probably the minimum requirement considering the extra rules in Brazil for the minimum capital is around R$80 billion, where the Basel III rules in Brazil will be implemented until 2017. Then during this period, we will do that adjustments that we understood that it will be necessary in order to maintain the investments in the 100% of the insurance business and obtain the total rules of Basel III ratio.</p>
          <p>Probably, we'll need to do some reorganization in the structure, in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:11) Probably, we will need to do some disburse. We don't have the final rules and probably some new rules we will have in the future. Then we understand how to obtain the implementation of the Basel III regulation, and we maintain the investments and what we need to do is some reorganization in our structure for maintaining all the ratios according the new rules and they've talked about the provisions. We understand that we don't &#x2013; we will have a new extra provisions for the corporate side, there was always something more specific, more something singular than we do not expect extra provision or more provisions, it was something more specific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, thank you. Just a follow-up question on the margin, now the re-classification of securities, from held to maturity to available for sale, does that help you in any way in your margins going forward and I know the securities are very long term, about like 10 years as you mentioned earlier, but does it help you in any shape or form?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reclassification doesn't affect the margin because any revenue was accounted because what we have in the equities is already probably the future gains that we can have with these assets. We understand that when you do the calculation of the ROE, you need to exclude this secured deposit. We don't have any revenue in our results. Then the correct thing is to exclude this number, this portfolio, this number R$4.1 billion or to do the calculation for the ROE because if any revenue we have accounted in the results.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I have a couple of questions. First one is a follow-up on the net interest income and then I have two separate issues. One on the loan side, your NIM, the way that you reported around 10.9% used to be 11.1% in the fourth quarter 2011. Do you still expect this to drop another 30 basis points by the year end? Is that still your expectations?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a decline in the quarter 0.1%. Probably for the future we could have a zero decrease in this number because the project pressure that we're having in the express, but the decline is &#x2013; probably we expect to have a zero decline in the future considering the expectations that we have for the total margin deficit. The 7.6%, we expected probably the number that we've had is &#x2013; considering that the results for the peers that we had the declining was 7.6% in the first quarter is now 7.5%. Probably to the end of the year we will have zero decline.</p>
          <p>One part of this effect will be affecting in the express, in the loan portfolio and the 10.9% that we have had in this quarter. Probably we were affected. We will have our usual declining to the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So another 20 bps, 30 bps, is that a fair assumptions till the end in terms of the credit specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Year-by-year we have the zero but in this quarter we have 0.1% decrease. Probably it will be a very small decrease, but I don't have that guidance for this. But probably we will have a little usual decrease through the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the securities portions and I mean if you look at the evolution, if you look on the page 12, specifically this quarter, I mean basically the variation between first Q and second Q was explained by the securities and others. So, without this effect, basically your NII I mean wouldn't grow at all, actually would decline quarter-over-quarter. So I understand that you have this fixed income book that you're accruing gains, just want to &#x2013; let's say the &#x2013; let's start with the assumption that the curve, the yield curve doesn't change going forward, stay there at the same level that we're now, what should we expect in terms of securities gains in the coming quarters. Is this going to stay at R$1.4 billion per quarter, is it going to decline or is it going continue to increase like R$300 million, R$350 million that we saw in this quarter? And on that &#x2013; and how long this will last? Can you perform this $1.4 billion until the mid next year? Could you give us a little bit more guidance on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One part of this number is the effect of the prefixed portfolio. It's only one part of the total number. Probably this one &#x2013; the effects of this growth that we have in these lines is reflected up because the decline of this decrease. They are now probably for the next two quarters, this number will be a little similar and will be stable 2012. Probably will be next year and for the 2013 probably will start to decrease to zero deposit part portion that came from the fixed portfolio we will try to reduce, but we need to be see that fixed income portfolio is only one part of this number, not the total number okay. This is what you expect for this line.</p>

          <p>I was just wondering how much you came less on this, because this number in the third quarter of 2011 was R$680 million. So now it's more than double. So it's like you have like a R$700 million gain on this specifics or like it's a 100% increase. So, is this &#x2013; and I understand this is coming down 2013, but is this coming down to similar levels in the past or is this going to stay above &#x2013; if you give us, because it's very hard to &#x2013; give us a little bit more guidance or is it going to stay above R$1 billion, 2013? If you could give us a little bit more color on this would be great?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As I said, in this number, only one part came from the prefixed portfolio, the growth that we have here, okay, one part of this growth came from the prefixed portfolio. Then probably during this year, we will maintain at this level and for 2013 probably will be something around R$1 billion. We'll start to decrease but probably we will have stabilization around R$1 billion. We don't have guidance, but probably the same issue that it will be something around that.</p>

          <p>Okay. And just one more question &#x2013; sorry about it. On the insurance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I got it. Thank you for that. And on the insurance portion so, I understood what you have done on the asset side, reclassification, but I'm also concerned about on the liability side, the actuarial. So when you have like this big decrease on the interest rate, how comfortable are you that your liability side on the insurance should or should not be adjusted on fair value basis as well, or how do you handle that on your insurance company, by the way?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Can you repeat the question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering, because on the liability side of your insurance company, you have to meet some actuarial obligation. So I'm just trying to understand how is it on the fair value basis, because of this huge decrease in interest rate, if this should not cause an important increase on your liability side on the insurance company?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have said that we have in our liabilities for the insurance business, the interest rate that we used is one of the most conservative ratio that we have is around 4% interest rate that we have. Then we understand that considering the expectation that we have now is a comfortable number and we understand that is &#x2013; and we're prepared. The problems that we have for the insurance business is compatible with the liability ratios or the interest ratios that we have in the liabilities we're prepared. We'll reduce the problems for this moment. Then considering the expectations for the future, we understand that we are prepared considering the portfolio of promise that we're having and the expectation of the interest rate for the future.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Matt Coffina with Morningstar Equity Research. Excuse me. We got Mr. Matt disconnected. We're now going to go to our next question, Mr. Boris Molina with Santander. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for taking my question. I have question regarding your regulations for the capital required for your insurance operations. You've been saying for a while that your insurance prices could work around R$7 billion and you have around R$17 billion in capital or equity in this operation, are there any regulatory changes that would increase this capital consumption over the next couple of years. We know that this was again has been working a lot on Solvency II and a gradual transition, so I don't know if there is an increase in the R$7 million number that we could already forecast into the next couple of years?</p>
          <p>And the second question is what stops you from distributing this surplus capital from insurance into your banking operations where under Basel II, after doing the application of the insurance deduction, you would be left with a relatively weak Core Tier 1 capital ratio. So we know that most of the capital gains that you have realized around securities that have been gaining with the declining interest rate, but as far as I understand these securities are not of free disposition and you cannot actually sell them to realize this gain.</p>
          <p>So we wonder how much of this R$17 billion is actually available for distribution and not locked into satisfy your asset or liabilities, your insurance business or whether you have to ask for permission to actually sell them and pay a dividend. How would this play out in the future? You're talking about reorganization. What would you &#x2013; what would this mean? So how can we have confidence that the insurance regulator is going to agree to have this distribution of capital from insurance into the bank in a relatively foreseeable future?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Considering the rule that we have now minimal requirement for the insurance business it will be around R$18, but probably if Brazil have implementation of new rules for the insurance business, and we can have an increase in these minimum requirements. But...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know the &#x2013; we don't discuss this with the regulator. They start a discussion but they don't have the final rules or they start the discussion but they don't have the rules. They are only start with the studies. But to do the adjustment in our structure in the future, probably the excess capital or the adjustment that we would need to do, probably we'll do, try to choose the best way for to do this reduction, pay dividends or sometimes doing our capital reduction. But without causing any problems or any limitations for the operations in our insurance company <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:14:35)</p>
          <p>If you look at the total assets that we're having in the insurance business, it's around R$120 billion. This financial assets that we have for the insurance business, these are all the R$128 billion in the provisions that we have for &#x2013; these are all the R$111 billion. Then we can choose some of these financial assets to do the adjustments or to reduce the capital. Then we have to say that we had also to do this, this adjustment if it is necessary, because we have the other ways for to change the Basel III regulations. But we will choose the best moment to do the adjustment, if it will be necessary or not. But we have also doing the reorganization in our part in the structure of the company, without causing any impacting the capacity of the Bradesco insurance will continue to do operations and continue to have a good growth as they are having in their operation.</p>
