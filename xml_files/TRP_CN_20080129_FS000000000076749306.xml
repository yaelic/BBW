          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the TransCanada Corporation 2007 Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. David Moneta, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, Mr. Moneta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon everyone. I'd like to take the opportunity to welcome you today. We are pleased to provide the investment community, the media and other interested parties with an opportunity to discuss our 2007 fourth quarter financial results and other general issues concerning TransCanada.</p>
          <p>With me today are Hal Kvisle, President and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Lohnes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Russ Girling, President of Pipelines; Alex Pourbaix, President of Energy; and our Vice President and Controller, Glenn Menuz. Hal and Greg will begin today with some opening comments on our financial results and other general issues pertaining to TransCanada. Please note that a slide presentation will accompany their remarks. A copy of the presentation is available on our website at transcanada.com. It can be found in the Investor section, under the heading Conference Calls and Presentations.</p>
          <p>Following Hal and Greg's remarks, we will turn the call over to the conference coordinator for your questions. During the question-and-answer period, we will take questions from the investment community first, followed by the media. In order to provide everyone with an equal opportunity to participate, we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue.</p>
          <p>Also, we ask that you focus your questions on our industry, our corporate strategy, recent developments and key elements of our financial performance. If you have got detailed questions relating to some of our smaller operations for your detailed financial models, Myles, Terry and I would be pleased to discuss them with you following the call.</p>
          <p>Before Hal begins, I would like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please see the reports filed by TransCanada with Canadian securities regulators and with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would also like to point out that during this presentation, we will refer to measures such as comparable earnings, comparable earnings per share and funds generated from operations. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and are therefore considered to be non-GAAP measures. As a result, these measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. These measures have been used to provide interested parties with additional information on the Company's operating performance, liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will now turn the call over to Hal.</p>

          <p>Thank you, David. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us again. I would like to take a few minutes to talk about recent developments in our business. I'll then turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lohnes, who will review our fourth quarter results in more detail.</p>
          <p>TransCanada's strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and 2007 is the result of solid contributions from our existing assets and growing earnings and cash flow from newly acquired and newly developed assets. In 2007 we continued to make significant progress towards achieving our objective of being the leading North American energy infrastructure company.</p>
          <p>As outlined in today's new release, TransCanada's net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was C$1.223 billion or C$2.31 per share. Comparable earnings for the year ended December 31 increased to  1.107 billion or  2.09 per share, from 925 million or C$1.90 per share in 2006. Comparable earnings grew approximately 20% in 2007 and our comparable earnings per share grew by 10%.</p>
          <p>Funds generated from operations grew to 2.621 billion in 2007, an increase of 10% over the prior year. This strong underlying cash flow has enabled us to make significant capital investments in our pipeline and energy businesses. In 2007, we invested approximately C$5.9 billion in growth initiatives. That includes the US3.4 billion acquisition of ANR which closed on February 22nd of 2007.</p>
          <p>Our strong 2007 financial performance has enabled our Board of Directors to increase the quarterly dividend on the company's common shares by 6% to C$0.36 per share. On an annualized basis this equates to C$1.44 per share. We are pleased to say, this is the eighth year in a row the Board has raised the dividend.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we made very significant progress to fortify our position as the premier pipeline company in North America. We closed the ANR and Great Lakes transactions, which added approximately 17,000 kilometers of pipeline to our North American gas pipeline system. Today, our natural gas pipeline network extends more than 59,000 kilometers and offers our customers unparalleled connections from traditional and emerging supply basins to growing North American markets.</p>
          <p>The ANR acquisition also added 230 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity to our portfolio. Following the acquisition, we received regulatory approval to proceed with a 14 Bcf natural gas storage expansion project in Michigan. This expansion capacity is fully contracted with an expected in-service date of April 1, 2008. The project is in addition to a natural gas storage enhancement and expansion program that will increase Michigan capacity available for sale by a further 13 Bcf. This program was also fully subscribed, with injections commencing last April, 2007.</p>
          <p>We reached several significant milestones on the Keystone Oil Pipeline project in 2007. A successful open season supported expansion to 595,000 barrels per day, and an extension of the pipeline to Cushing, Oklahoma. We also secured additional long-term contracts to a total of 495,000 barrels per day with an average contract duration of 18 years.</p>
          <p>Last Tuesday, we announced that ConocoPhillips acquired a 50% ownership interest in the Keystone Oil Pipeline. A previously signed Memorandum of Understanding committed ConocoPhillips to ship crude oil on the pipeline and gave ConocoPhillips the right to acquire up to 50% ownership interest. Affiliates of TransCanada will be responsible for constructing and operating the 3,450 kilometer Keystone Pipeline.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory front, progress has been made in both Canada and the United States. Earlier this month TransCanada received the Final Environmental Impact Statement from the U.S. Department of State, which stated that the Keystone Pipeline would result in limited adverse impacts. A decision is expected in February, 2008, regarding Keystone's application for a Presidential Permit authorizing the construction and operation of the facilities at the Canada/U.S. border crossing. From both regulatory and project execution perspectives, Keystone is on track. Receipt and stockpiling of line pipes has begun and construction activities are scheduled to commence in February, 2008.</p>
          <p>On the gas transmission regulatory front, Canada's National Energy Board approved our five-year settlement for the Canadian Mainline for the years 2007, through 2011. This settlement, which we negotiated with key Mainline stakeholders, reflects an increase in the deemed common equity ratio from 36% to 40%.</p>
          <p>On the Alberta System, negotiations with stakeholders are ongoing. The intent is to reach a settlement effective January 1, 2008. By the end of the first quarter of 2008, it is expected that a general rate application or a settlement or some combination of the two, will be filed with the Alberta Utilities Commission. The Alberta System will charge interim rates during 2008, until final rates can be determined.</p>
          <p>In late 2007, TransCanada filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission comprised of an uncontested settlement of all aspects of the GTN 2006 general rate case. On January 7th of this year, the FERC issued an order approving that settlement. The settlement rates are effective retroactive to January 1, 2007.</p>
          <p>In November, 2007, a non-routine application was filed with the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board for the North Central Corridor pipeline expansion of the Alberta System. The North Central Corridor project will provide capacity needed to address increasing gas supply in northwest Alberta, declining gas supply from northeast Alberta, growing intra-Alberta markets, resulting largely from increased oil sands development, and reduced delivery capability in interconnecting pipelines at the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. The estimated cost of this project is approximately C$985 million with construction expected to begin in late 2008, subject to regulatory approval. In addition to that nearly C$1 billion North Central Corridor project, we expect to invest a further 925 million in the Alberta System over the next three years on a whole host of other projects.</p>
          <p>With an eye to our longer term initiatives, TransCanada submitted an application for a license to construct the Alaska Pipeline project under the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act also known as AGIA. On January 4, 2008 the State of Alaska announced that TransCanada had submitted a complete AGIA application and would be advancing to the public comment stage. No other applicant met all the AGIA requirements. If approved by the Administration and the Legislature, TransCanada could be granted the AGIA license later this year.</p>
          <p>While our pipeline business is complex our strategy is simple. Firstly, we will use the tools that we have in place today to maximize the value of our existing pipeline asset base. Secondly, we will grow our footprint through extensions and expansions of our system deeper into the marketplace and deeper into supply zones. We will successfully execute the capacity addition initiatives that we have underway today. And finally, we will continue to build our high quality platform of new opportunities that will benefit both TransCanada and its customers in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to our energy business. 2007 was another year of growth and strong financial performance in our energy business. We remain focused on pursuing quality opportunities in power, natural gas storage and liquefied natural gas. At the Bruce nuclear project, we and our partners have invested approximately C$1.9 billion in the Bruce A Units 1 and 2 restart and refurbishment project. In January, a project milestone was reached, and a very significant milestone, when the 16th and final new steam generator was successfully installed. With the completion of this stage of the project, the authorized funding for Units 1 and 2 has been increased from 2.75 billion to approximately 3 billion.</p>
          <p>Bruce Power is currently preparing a comprehensive estimate of the capital investment required to complete the Unit 1 and 2 restart project. This process is expected to result in a further increase in the total project cost. Project cost increases are subject to the capital cost, risk-reward sharing mechanism under the agreement that we have with the Ontario Power Authority. At this time, we continue to expect that the unlevered after-tax return on total capital invested in the project will fall within the previously announced range of 9.5 to a 13.5%. An update of capital cost estimates and an updated range of unlevered after-tax returns on total capital will be publicly disclosed once the comprehensive review is completed and the revised capital costs are approved.</p>
          <p>Also in energy, the second phase of the Cartier Wind project, the 100 megawatt Anse-&#xE0;-Valleau wind farm, was placed into service in November 2007. In addition, Cartier Wind began construction of its third phase of the project, the 109 megawatt Carleton wind farm. Cartier and the projects comprising Cartier are located in the Gasp&#xE9; region of Qu&#xE9;bec. The 683-megawatt Halton Hills generating station, located near Toronto, completed an environment review and we have now commenced preliminary construction work. Construction is progressing as expected on the 550-megawatt Portland Energy Center, located in the heart of downtown Toronto.</p>
          <p>On the LNG front, our Broadwater project recently achieved another major milestone as the FERC issued its Final Environmental Impact Statement. FERC reaffirmed its conclusion that Broadwater, located in Long Island Sound, New York, is an environmentally responsible way to met the region's natural gas needs in the coming years, with fewer negative impacts than any of the practical alternatives. The New York State Department of State is expected to release a decision on the Coastal Zone Management Act in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our major project initiatives in pipelines and energy will result in capital commitments of approximately C$10 billion. On this slide, you can see the capital cost estimates of many of the projects I discussed and the expected in-service dates for those projects. In addition to the committed capital projects highlighted on the previous slides, we continued to develop a portfolio of longer-term high quality growth opportunities in both pipelines and energy. At no other time in TransCanada's history have we had such a large and attractive portfolio of projects and investment opportunities as we have before us today.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead, we see TransCanada capitalizing on North America's increased demand for cleaner and more efficient energy. We build and operate the kind of clean and efficient infrastructure that North America needs in the years ahead. As we meet that need we will continue to deliver strong and sustainable financial returns to our shareholders. We will continue to maximize our financial strength and our execution capability to enable us to capture large-scale, value creating opportunities and create value for our customers and shareholders through superb execution of the very best of these projects. We created significant shareholder value in 2007 and we look forward to even greater accomplishments in 2008 and thereafter.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lohnes.</p>

          <p>Thanks Hal and good afternoon everyone. As Hal mentioned, earlier today we released our fourth quarter results. Net income from continuing operations, or net earnings for the fourth quarter were C$377 million or C$0.70 per share, compared to C$269 million or C$0.55 per share for the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2007 net earnings included C$56 million of income tax reassessment and adjustments, and a C$14 million gain on the sale of land.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter 2006 net earnings included C$12 million of income tax reassessments and adjustments. Excluding these items net earnings of C$307 million or C$0.57 per share for the fourth quarter 2007, was an increase of C$0.04 per share, or approximately 8% when compared to the fourth quarter 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, TransCanada's net earnings were C$1.223 billion or C$2.31 per share, compared to C$1.051 billion or C$2.15 per share for 2006.</p>
          <p>In addition to the items previously noted, net earnings for 2007 and 2006 included a number of specific non-recurring items. They are highlighted on this slide and additional information on each is included in our fourth quarter news release. Excluding these items, net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 were C$1.107 billion or C$2.09 per share, an increase of C$182 million or C$0.19 per share. This represents a 10% increase on a per share basis, when compared to 2006. The year-over-year increases were due to significantly higher net earnings from both the pipeline and energy segments.</p>
          <p>I will briefly review the fourth quarter results for each of our segments, beginning with pipelines. The pipelines business generated comparable earnings of C$202 million during the fourth quarter, compared to C$126 million for the same period in 2006. A C$79 million quarter-over-quarter increase from wholly-owned pipelines is the primary cause of the increase. The higher contribution from the Canadian Mainline reflects the impact of a five-year toll settlement with stakeholders effective January 1, 2007. The settlement included an increase in the deemed common equity ratio from 36% to 40%.</p>
          <p>A higher contribution from the Alberta System was mainly due to OM&amp;A cost savings. TransCanada completed the acquisition of ANR on February 22nd, 2007 and included net earnings from that date. ANR's net earnings for fourth quarter and the year were in-line with our expectations. GTN's comparable earnings for the fourth quarter and the year increased primarily due to the positive impact of a rate case settlement included in the fourth quarter of 2007. GTN received approval of the rate settlement from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January, 2008.</p>
          <p>Comparable earnings from other pipelines were C$16 million in the fourth quarter 2007, which is C$3 million lower than the same period last year. Increased earnings from TC Pipelines LP were more than offset by higher project development and support costs associated with growing the pipelines business.</p>
          <p>Before I move on to our energy segment, I would like to take a moment to talk about our claims in the Calpine bankruptcy. In December 2007, Portland Natural Gas Transmission System which is 61.7% owned by TransCanada and our wholly-owned subsidiary GTN reached agreement with Calpine Corporation for allowed unsecured claims of US$125 million and US$192.5 million respectively. These claims are expected to be settled in the first quarter 2008, when creditors are expected to receive shares in the reorganized Calpine. Calpine shares will be subject to market price moves as these new shares begin to trade in the market. Claims for Nova Gas Transmission, Ltd. and Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. for C$31.6 million and C$44.4 million, respectively were fully paid in cash, which was received in January 2008 and is for the benefit of the shippers.</p>
          <p>Next some comments on energy. The energy segment includes our power operations as well as our initiatives in natural gas storage and liquefied natural gas. Energy generated net earnings of C$158 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of C$26 million compared to fourth quarter 2006. Excluding C$30 million of positive income tax adjustments and a C$14 million after-tax gain on the sale of land, comparable earnings were C$114 million in the fourth quarter compared to C$132 million for the same period last year. Lower contributions from Bruce Power and Western Operations were partially offset by higher contributions from Eastern Operations and natural gas storage.</p>
          <p>The lower contribution from Bruce Power was primarily due to lower generation volumes at the Bruce A facilities and higher operating costs related to the significant increase in planned outage days at Bruce A. Looking forward, the overall plant availability percentage in 2008 is expected to be in the low 90's for the four Bruce B units and in the low 80's for the two operating Bruce A units. To further reduce its exposure to spot market prices, Bruce B has entered into fixed-price sales contracts to sell forward approximately 10,200 gigawatt hours for 2008.</p>
          <p>The lower contribution from Western Power Operations was primarily due to lower overall realized power prices and lower market heat rates on higher uncontracted volumes of power sold, partially offset by lower power purchase arrangement costs. To reduce our exposure to spot market prices on uncontracted volumes, Western Power Operations has fixed-price power sales contracts to sell approximately 9,200 gigawatt hours for 2008.</p>
          <p>Finally in power, Eastern Power Operations' operating income in the fourth quarter was C$66 million, an increase of C$11 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to payments received under the forward capacity market in New England and increased earnings from higher sales volumes to commercial and industrial customers. These positive impacts to earnings were partially offset by decreased generation from the TC Hydro facilities resulting from reduced water flows. Overall in the fourth quarter approximately 96% of Eastern Power sales volumes were sold under contract. To reduce our exposure to spot market prices, Eastern Power Operations has fixed-price sales contracts to sell approximately 8,200 gigawatt hours for 2008, although certain contracted volumes are dependent on customer usage levels.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the energy segment, natural gas storage operating income of 57 million in the fourth quarter increased C$27 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to incremental income earned in 2007 from the start-up of the Edson facility. Fourth quarter 2007 natural gas storage operating income included a C$15 million net unrealized gain resulting from the changes in fair value of proprietary natural gas inventory, forward purchase contracts and forward sales contracts. Natural gas storage operating income included a C$10 million net unrealized gain for the full year 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning now to corporate, net earnings from corporate was C$17 million compared to net earnings of C$11 million in the fourth quarter 2006. The increase was primarily due to C$26 million of favorable income tax adjustments arising from legislated Canadian federal corporate income tax changes in fourth quarter 2007, compared to C$12 million of income tax refunds and related interest in the same period in 2006. Excluding these favorable income tax adjustments, corporate's comparable expenses are C$9 million and C$1 million in the fourth quarters 2007 and 2006, respectively. The higher comparable expenses are primarily due to higher financial charges resulting from the financing of the ANR and Great Lakes acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Turning to the cash flow statement, funds generated from operations was C$741 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of C$81 million or 12% when compared to the same period in 2006. For the year, funds generated from operations were C$2.621 billion, an increase of C$243 million or 10% over 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher net income from continuing operations.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures of C$595 million in the fourth quarter and C$1.651 billion for the year related primarily to the ongoing development of greenfield projects such as Cartier Wind, the Bruce A restart, Portlands Energy Centre and the Halton Hills generating station as well as growth and maintenance capital associated with the Canadian Mainline, the Alberta System and ANR. Including the ANR acquisition, we invested a total of over C$5.8 billion in our core businesses in 2007.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to 2008, we expect to invest nearly C$3 billion in our wholly-owned natural gas pipelines and other greenfield projects, including the continued construction of Bruce A, Cartier, Portlands and Halton Hills and commencement of construction of the Keystone Oil Pipeline.</p>
          <p>Finally, our balance sheet remained strong. At the end of December, it consisted of 54% senior debt, which includes our proportionate share of joint venture debt; 4% junior subordinated notes, 1% preferred shares and 41% common equity.</p>
          <p>2007 was a particularly active year for us on the corporate finance front. In the first quarter, we raised C$1.725 billion in equity through a public offering. It was the largest fully funded subscription receipts transaction in Canadian history. In addition, we initiated a 2% discount on shares issued from treasury under our dividend reinvestment program, which has been very well received by the investment community. We also sold US$1 billion of 30 year senior notes and issued US$1 billion of junior subordinated notes both at very competitive market rates, reflective of our strong financial position and TransCanada Pipelines Limited's A credit ratings.</p>
          <p>TransCanada has a superior growth profile with its committed portfolio of approximately C$10 billion and an attractive set of longer-term high quality growth prospects. Our track record of success has generated strong returns for our shareholders and we fully expect to continue that track record into the future.</p>
          <p>That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call back to David for the question and answer period.</p>

          <p>Thanks Greg. Just a reminder before I turn the call back to the conference coordinator. We will take questions from the investment community first. Once we've completed that, we will turn it over to the media. Again, a reminder that I would ask that you limit yourself to two questions and then get back in the queue in order to give everybody an equal opportunity.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank You. Just some questions on Bruce Power. The cost-sharing mechanism goes up to 880 million of cost over-runs. What proportion of that is just for Units 1 and 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My recollection Linda, it's Alex, is that that amount related directly to 1 and 2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is 1 and 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I am sorry Linda; it would be...you are right. The 880 million in terms of the cost-sharing mechanism relates to units 1 through 4. The split effectively is 300 million related to Units 1 and 2, and 580 million related to units 3 and 4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you are effectively at the end of that 50-50 split so after that it will be 75-25?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the first 300 million we shared 50-50. Following that, costs would be split 75-25, and obviously the recovery of costs are through the reference price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And while we are on the subject of Bruce Power, in your note on the Bruce Power disclosure there is mention of changes in fair value of held for trading derivatives of 11 million in the quarter and 47 million for the year. Is that all related to Bruce B and can you elaborate a little bit on what sort of trading you are doing there?</p>

I'm trying to understand Eastern Power Operations' fixed-price power sales contracts. 90 days ago you had forecast or said that you had 12,400 gigawatt hours for 2008 and now you have 8,200 gigawatt hours for 2008 as of December 31st.

          <p>Okay. And on the, to be clear on the Calpine settlement, for PNGTS and GTN, when you get that stock, I assume you plan to be selling it at some point into the market and the benefit of that will be a full impact to earnings this year, or cash to the shareholders or what?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>I would say the assumption on selling will address that when we get the stock and if that's right thing to do at the time, irrespective I think of the currency that we receive the payment in. We will book earnings at that point in time, and the earnings will be related to how we settle both of those rate cases. The PNGTS one is still under negotiation and the GTN one is settled, though.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Regarding the expected increase in Bruce restart costs, could you provide any additional details on the ballpark magnitude that you might expect and maybe the reasons for the increase in cost? It's just that, since, like on your Investor Day, it was sort of alluded that everything is going really well and you are going to be at the high end of your unlevered IRR range and so, I was just wondering what has changed since that time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's Alex. In my recollection in November was really what the, I think the exact message we sent, was we expected the project to remain within that range. What we have seen to date was going pretty well, but we are entering into quite a sensitive part of the work on the 1 and 2 units. Really, what we've seen since then, is it's just, it's a very complex project. Most of the fixed-cost contracts have held up very well. We are seeing some problems with the removal of the pressure tubes, just in productivity and a number of what I would call a large number of very repetitive balance-of-plant type issues that are not first-of--a-kind, but that has caused us to a just really be careful about this and we've asked Bruce to undertake this cost review just to make sure we have very good handle on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Akman from Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to follow up on that question around Bruce because I think we are getting mixed messages that on the one hand you are comfortable your are in the range of return, but on the other hand Bruce is preparing a comprehensive cost estimate. So, is Bruce preparing a detailed cost estimate to nail down what you have a pretty good idea about is the range, or are they giving you information that you really don't know about right now and you are very uncertain on what's going to come out of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've been intimately involved in all aspects of this, the cost review that is going on. So, we have been very involved in this. This cost review has been going on probably since around November. So, we are getting data back that is leading us to be comfortable with that range. We just haven't got to the point we are comfortable giving our absolute final view on everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Alex. And I have a follow up on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to confirm, on the additional capital that's spent there, over and above the budget, you still earn a return on that capital; it's just lower than the range for the overall project. Is that a correct way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we have is this cost-sharing mechanism for cost overruns that was referred to earlier, and so as the price increases we continue to get capital contribution at certain levels from the OPA, but I mean we continue to get price for power for all the megawatts were produced. So, I am not sure if that ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think, Matthew, it's Hal. One addendum I could make to that is that the overall unlevered return goes down as the capital cost goes up but in any foreseeable range of capital cost, based on what we know today, we remain within that 9.5 to 13.5% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the mechanism, though, to recover any additional capital is the reference price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, I think this is a question for Alex, and it just relates to Western Power Operations and really your contractual positions and your strategy going into Q4. It really looked like you took a view on the market that it was going to be a very robust market in the quarter, and that didn't really pan out as well as you would have liked. If you could give us color on what you saw on the market in Q4, and what you see in the market today in Q1 and how you are positioning the book. There is some commentary in the MD&amp;A but any further color would be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, over the years we really developed a strategy, we are at least going to keep a relatively significant amount of our power in the West open and that is really just to cover up the risk of operational upsets at other of our assets. So, we're pretty unlikely to go much over 75% contracted in the West, just to protect ourselves from upsets in our assets. But certainly historically, Q4 has been a period where, if we get some very poor weather in Alberta, we have often seen some very significant volatility and high prices in the power market, and it just turned out for those who are on the phone from Calgary they'll understand this. We ended up having quite a mild fourth quarter. There wasn't a lot of cold weather, not a lot of issues and the Alberta Fleet ran better than has been our historical experience. So, I think that's a fair comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you see the book on a go-forward basis as far as your positioning? I do see some really volatile prices on to-date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is the kind of pricing that we often expect in Q4 and we're seeing a fair bit of it in Q1 right now with the cold weather out West. I think it would be fair to say that we remain over the cover to the one, to two, to three-year period, very bullish on the fundamentals in Alberta, assuming normal weather and normal consumption patterns. We've seen a little bit, I think one of the things that probably surprised us a bit was that demand moderated to the extent it did. We were probably expecting to see a little more, we're a little more bullish on the demand side, on the power, but generally overall we see demand growing. We don't see a lot of assets coming on and we see a lot of challenges in the market in the short term. So we're pretty bullish.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You talked about it audit at that time, you did reiterate that at the Investor Day. The numbers that we had discussed back in September, were the 2005 numbers and the question is when are you going to disclose, how big the potential increase is in total budget on the restart? At that time you even talked discreetly about where those cost increases are coming from.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Karen I think we will be in a position. Our view, this process is probably going to take place over the next couple of months. So certainly in Q2, we are going to be out. We anticipate being complete and at that time, we are going to give a fulsome discussion of where the project is, where we see it going and I am sure there will be some disclosure about the areas in which we are seeing the cost pressures.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just where the budgets are going, where the cost overrun is going to be, we know that the price on this thing is going to come through the... what OPA pays you. So the 75-25, are we going to get some indication of how that would affect the pro forma price based on what was announced back in October 2005, and what, we would all have calculated in the model on a pro forma basis going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the facts are this: that we and Bruce announced C$2.75 billion project that could cost more. In the event that it costs more and there is a sliding scale with the OPA under which the power price changes and our rate of return changes. We have announced that in the best case we could end up with an unlevered return of 13.5% and if costs ran up to the high end of the probable and possible range that we looked at, we could end up with a 9.5% unlevered return and with normal debt leverage that would generate pretty good returns on equity anywhere in that range. Now, what we have announced today is that as a result of the first part of our comprehensive cost review, we have determined that it's highly likely that the cost is going to exceed C$3 billion and so we have increased the authorized funding for the project, and this is total share not just our share, 50%. We have increased the authorized funding from 2.75 billion to 3 billion. As to where it goes from there, we are indicating to you, and to the market, that it's likely there will be some further increase beyond 3 billion, but we have also indicated that we remain comfortable that we're within that range that was disclosed at the outset. That's what we know today.</p>

          <p>Okay. And the worst case, or the high end, to use your words, which would get me down to the low end of that range, I'm just trying to put some numerical parameters around high and best case. The high end gives me a capital cost of what?</p>

          <p>Sorry Karen, I'll just add that in the interim, I know Glenn will get you the number in terms of the actual CapEx in 2007 in isolation. I also just highlight, and we can get you the numbers, but the CapEx profile that we showed at our November Investor Day that highlight the capital expenditures for'08, '09 and 2010 was our view of how that, the remainder would be spent of that 2.75 billion. So, I just wanted to highlight that the CapEx profile that you are seeing for those three years were reflective of the best information we had available at that point in time..</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Karen just on, just to update the numbers on that, as we said we spent 2.1 billion, like to date, to the end of this year, or to the end of '07, and 1.1 billion to the end of '06. That billion-dollar spending in 2007 is generally split about 900 million to 1 and 2 and then the remainder to 3 and 4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon everyone. First question here is on Mainline OM&amp;A savings and incentive benefits which you have booked in '07. First of all, I wanted to see if there is, if you can provide me with a quantum of what these were for the year, and also do you believe that they will be recurring under the terms of your new incentive arrangement going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glenn will get you the actual number while of answer the second question is we expect to make some incentive earnings. I think we had very good 2007. There is escalators and those kind of things in those agreements, and there is certain opportunities that arose in 2007 which may not arise in 2008 with respect to selling Great Lakes capacity and those kinds of things. So I would say that we expect to have some incentive earnings in 2008, but unless the circumstance arises again I wouldn't expect to see the same level in 2008 as we did in 2007. Glenn, do you have the number in 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Dan, it was roughly in the range of C$20 million when I bring all of the different programs together, because there are number different programs there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and that's after-tax, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and the other question that I had is, to come back to the Calpine settlement. Now from what you indicated that roughly you expect about 300 million in, or you will have 300 million in U.S. in claims, and which you believe will be settled in the first quarter, I believe. Now what will be your cost basis for the shares that you receive? Is that going to be the actual amount of the claim and therefore there is no tax hit on getting the shares, there is no tax friction there, 300 million is what you'll get and that will drop to the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's, I guess comp cash, which I don't think is treated similar to cash, I would think coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taxable ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then it's taxable income but there is no cost basis to the shares.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So basically 300 million is potentially a pre-tax income number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you will be booking...and would you consider this comparable earnings or is that something you would be excluding when calculating comparable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll get to that in Q2 and when we will run through the numbers. We haven't thought that deep, I would say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would clarify that when you look at those amounts recognized that PNGTS would be 61% our position, and that it is subject to the ongoing negotiations with regard to the rate case around PNGTS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, you mean the rate case could actually claw back a part of the benefit from you to the account of the shippers? Is that what you are saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's potentially; we haven't sorted out all of those issues yet on PNGTS. We are in the middle of a rate negotiation for 2008 and beyond.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. A quick question, when Portland and Halton Hills come on line in the energy section, do you expect them to increase the gross margin in the energy group or will they be approximately the same gross margin that you have been running on already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would have to look at that, Steven, for you. You mean relative to the gross margin in that, in the Eastern Operations of our current portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say this: generally when we look at our energy projects, where we have a locked-in 20-year PPA with a AA or AAA credit, as compared to investing in hydro or in the coal-fired, we would be looking at a slightly lower return versus the locked-in projects. It would be probably a little bit less than some of the more merchant charts of the business, due to the risk profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you also have to consider I think, Steven, that a lot of the costs under that kind of a commercial arrangement are not really for our account, and so it's difficult to compare the margin that we get on the megawatt hour of output at B&#xE9;cancour or Halton Hills or Portland which what we get at New England Hydro or Ocean State, or even Bruce, I think. You kind of got us on a way of looking at things that we don't look at those things that way.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question is from Josh Goldstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. My question surrounds the balance sheet. You mentioned in slide 18 that you strengthened the balance sheet to an A rating. You've done some issuance throughout the year. Given the sizeable amount of capital expenditures and the projects that you have planned, can you talk to me about the mix of financing? How much debt you had planned to issue and more importantly, can you give me some type of credit metrics or range that you would target specifically debt to capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, generally, we're first of all committed to maintaining our A credit rating. So when we did a large acquisition like ANR, we went our and issued equity to strengthen the balance sheet. So, we're generally targeting a 60-40 debt to equity split, consistent with the return on the equity components on the pipeline side and the nature of our energy portfolio. With regard to the C$3 billion, and I think we've talked about over three years C$10 billion. Of that 10, 1 billion was in '07, and there will be a billion that lags. So we've got CapEx in the C$8 billion range. We've got significant cash flow. We have our DRIP program running, which generates about C$200 million, and we then continued to look at other opportunities within our tool box of things that we can do around raising capital. So we feel that we are in a very strong position, we have got quite a bit of room there on that debt side with our additional cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you care to elaborate on, what you are referring to, other tools?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you care to elaborate? You mentioned other methods of raising capital. Is that equity, is that hybrid, is that debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do, as you saw, we've done hybrid issues. We continue to monitor the <mark type="inaudible" /> market for example. We have the opportunity to partner on certain assets; we have a currency with our LP and we look potentially at optimizing our portfolio as we go forward. So we are constantly monitoring our portfolio. So we have a number of different options that we can consider, as we not only look at this C$8 billion worth of CapEx but also look at potential acquisitions over that same timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But then to be clear, you definitely are committed to the A credit rating?</p>

          <p>Thank you [Operator Instruction]. The following question is from Daniel Shteyn from Desjardins Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I have a question with regards to ANR. So we've had 10 months worth of, or more precisely, a little -- a touch over 10 months' worth of earnings from this asset, which is proving to be an excellent asset. Now in terms of seasonality, I believe that there was a mention in the MD&amp;A that one, the winter months are more earnings heavy than other months, and I wanted to confirm that presumably the number that we have is not really the run rate; it's for 2007, it's something a little bit more to take the seasonality into account. And two: I wanted to ask you whether you expected some sort of synergies to come through from this asset in '08 relative to what's been done in '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, I think you can expect there to be seasonality in the number. I think that 2007 was a good year; we hope to be able to continue that performance into 2008. And with respect to synergies, I wouldn't expect to see large amounts of synergies coming from these assets. They were well run by El Paso when we bought them and we've picked up those operations, so I would say from a synergistic standpoint there isn't a lot to be had there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Daniel it's how I doubt, but I agree with Russ' comment on cost synergies. We are constantly looking for revenue synergies and whether there are ways to operate across, say, from ANR to Great Lakes, or perhaps some integrated activity with our Mainline. So there are those opportunities but that stuff takes bit longer to bring home.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you have....okay that's fine. Moving on to something else, just wanted to chat quickly about what happened with Bruce earnings, as opposed to capital costs in the fourth quarter. Now there has been a fairly dramatic decrease in earnings during the fourth quarter and that's, from what I understand, driven by two things actually: first there were more outages during the quarter relative to '06 and second there is something, that's your adjustments, that's PPA, positive PPA amortization, I wanted to understand, why is there a change in amortization of this PPA intangible, and how much do you expect it to be going forward? And two: what do you expect the OpEx profile to be going forward? Do you think that it's going to be staying at current levels, or is it going to change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, it's Glenn here. As far as the adjustments for these forward contracts, as required when we do any acquisition accounting, we do need to fair-value all of the assets and liabilities that we may acquire. At the time of getting into Bruce originally, there were a number of forward sales contracts on, that we had to put to a value to. As a result, what we do is, as over the course of those contracts, we amortize that in. At this point, I believe most of those contracts have rolled off, so as a result what you saw, last year was an amortization of that positive value. And now we just have very little, if any, of that amortization left. As far as the cost structure goes, I will throw that over to Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Daniel, I think the kind of costs that you are seeing coming out of Bruce in 2007, we expect that to remain fairly stable over 2008; not a lot of difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to clarify, this 80 million earnings drag that we saw in 2007, you expect that to go, to more or less go away going forward. And when we talk about cost structure, we are actually talking cost structure on a per megawatt hour basis which is C$41?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that's exactly what I am talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good so that's a Roger on both the points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry on the second point, which is the cost per megawatt hour and I don't have the budget in front of me, the outage days in front of me. But, I mean you are correct, the decrease in earnings was primarily due to increased outage days. And I can't recall maybe, Glenn, I don't know if you recall offhand, what our outage days, '08 versus '07, are.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. As we are into the second hour of this call, just a quick question on ANR, after almost a year. The comment was made when it was initially purchased that ANR had a significant market-serving component, versus something the Canadian Mainline, which is a long haul that delivers gas to others. Could you comment on the ANR market service that you are seeing in particularly Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not sure, exactly where the franchise is; it does have a large market-serving component and it's -- it's mainly grounded in the 230, 40 Bcf of storage capacity that we have in the market, where we combine that service with transportation service and offer a bundled service to meet the uneven load factor of our customers' actual burn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And lot of the heaters buy those kinds of services from us. What we found is, as Hal mentioned, in terms of offering new services across our system whereby we can take gas into ANR, store it, in the Michigan area and then move it out on the Great Lakes System, or even out to the Canadian Mainline is something that's attractive to our customers and we're just getting to those kind of -- if you want to call them synergies -- now between the systems, whereby we can use that market-serving component to serve a larger market region than just that Michigan, Wisconsin area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steven there is, it's Hal, there's one other broad difference between ANR and our Canadian pipe. It's generally true of all the U.S. pipes and our Canadian pipes. Under the Canadian regulated model, they aim to regulate our net income to a fixed number, and if there's increased volume or reduced operating cost, the benefit of that generally flows through to the shipper, whereas under the U.S. model if we can reduce operating costs or significantly increase throughput volumes or come up with some innovative service offerings, such as the one that Russ described, where we package storage, transport and maybe transport on other pipe. We have the opportunity to profit from that and that of course is one of the things that we find interesting and relatively attractive about the significant investments that we made in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what you would be doing is storing gas for a power generator and then selling it to them?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well hello, I was wondering in the portfolio of options the company has, how highly building a nuclear power plant in Alberta ranks and what a potential timeline it might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well David, it's Hal. A nuclear power plant in Alberta would rank quite highly in terms of interesting opportunities, but it wouldn't rank particularly high in terms of probability of going ahead in the next five years. When we look at all the different capital opportunities available to us, many of which were identified in the slides related to this call, you won't see an Alberta nuclear plant there. So it would be more than five years out, and as such I would say that there's a lot of things ranking ahead of it in terms of what we will do to create shareholder value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What sort of work do you do, obviously there are long-term projects, what sort of work do you do on a potential plant in the next five years, in the next two years or the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the key issues, Alex may want to add to this, but we also look at something like Slave River Hydro and we don't get into detailed engineering or foundation design or anything like that. It's more around what kind of commercial structure would apply to it, and there is an awful lot of discussion with parties like the Alberta government and others, as to what kind of commercial structure could be put in place that would actually allow us to go ahead with one of these very long term projects. Dave, I'd point out that a big issue in Alberta is that the power market is so small, relatively few players and not much size and not much liquidity. So we have identified as a priority that the Alberta power market needs to be connected to other, more liquid North American power markets before some of this stuff can go ahead. If we can't make those connections to more liquid markets like the Pacific Northwest, then we're stuck trying to figure out some sort of long-term contracting model and that takes quite a while to figure that out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of that long transmission grid the new Pima into ... Saskatchewan is interested in that; do you see as a more realistic option, maybe build into Saskatchewan with a long transmission line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the trouble is Saskatchewan is not a market for power and it's a government controlled and many ways politically controlled market. And so just integrating our with Alberta with Saskatchewan or for that matter BC on the other side, we end up being the ham in a not very pleasant sandwich sometimes so, we are much more interested connecting into U.S. markets like the Pacific Northwest, where genuine market forces prevail and we can make investments comfortably and the market will dictate the return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last one, if I can have my fourth here, on the Mackenzie pipeline do you see a resolution in the next couple of weeks, the next couple of month or does it extend further and further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know. We would be hopeful that we can make some progress here in the next few months to the point of knowing whether or not we should persist with the project. We think we have come up with some ideas that are pretty good. We know the time line for the regulatory process is about another 12 to 15 months for them to complete everything that the National Energy Board and the joint review panel has to do. So we believe that we need to resolve the commercial issues over that period, but we would sure be interested in seeing some sort of a breakthrough in the next six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I will squeeze one more in... in terms of C$8 billion budgets for the pipeline itself, the Mainline. Do you think that's a realistic price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You mean for the main Mackenzie line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's right the 1,200 kilometer mainline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We think it is reasonable but we never know for sure, the big issue is how much more delay do we experience and if you experience another three years delay and that happens to be during the very inflationary period, that will have a dramatic impact on the costs. But it's -- it's the kind of project that we know how to execute and we are reasonably optimistic that we could do it within that 8 billion amount.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This question for Alex. Have you guys hired an outside consultant for the cost study of Bruce?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you guys hired an outside consultant to analyze the investment cost created by Bruce, or is it all being done internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are quite comfortable between the project manager, and our Bruce staff and TransCanada staff that we are quite competent to assess risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On a going forward basis for the total project cost, which previously was 2.4 billion or 2.5 billion, and now is obviously going to be 5.5,what other issues are going to be pushing up costs, because the productivity should be behind you since all the tubes are removed? Are you expecting the same sorts of problems with Units 3 and 4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our experience on this project has generally been, there has been -- there been a number of first-of--a-kind activities that were really required to do this refurbishment and restart of the 1 and 2 Units. I think our experience has been that typically when we first start these first-of--a-kind activities, productivity often lags. A great example of that is removal and replacement of the steam generators. We had significant challenges on removing and the replacing the eight steam generators of Unit 2 and by the time we got Unit 1, the productivity which just miles ahead and in fact caught up and in fact surpassed our expectations for the entire program. So I mean I do expect as we move on to 3 and 4, we going to see productivity improvements as the various activities become more and more hardwired.</p>
          <p>I think with respect to 3 and 4, one of the other things that is interesting is you will recall, that when we first acquired Bruce, one of the first projects that we inherited was the restart of the 3 and 4 units that were laid-up at the time that we acquired the project and as a part of that, less comprehensive work that was done, probably around 2003, 2004, almost all of the balance of plant activity, that are giving us problems on 1 and 2 were actually taken care-of in that original 3 and 4. So we do not expect on the 3 and 4 to have remotely the level of balance of plant activity that we are having on 1 and 2</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And specifically, are you having any shortage of workers or skill trade that are pinching cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that's actually been I think one of the positives of the project. We are right now at approximately 2200 contractors onsite which I believe makes Bruce the largest energy infrastructural project in North America at this time. To this point we have actually had very good lock with our trades, we didn't have a lot of shortages.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well hey just one question do you anticipate any further cost increases on Keystone or is this pretty well -- that 5.2 pretty well the final cost you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that we were, as you mentioned we locked-in about C$3 billion worth the cost on C$5.2 billion estimate and the balance is net-to-net. I think its been based number of times they were in a very intensively competitive CapEx kind of environment that said, we have learnt a lot over the last two years through this environment and we are pretty comfortable with that estimate but I would say that we were not walking to 5.2 at this point of time by any mean.</p>

          <p>Hey just a quick question on Mackenzie. I wonder if there was -- I wonder what a impact -- any change within the partnership structure, what impact would that have on the regulatory process, would there be any?</p>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>I don't think so Jon, to tell. We are very much in this project together with Imperial, Shell, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobile. We think that any changes in the actual make up of the partnership or the way the producers interact with the Aboriginal Pipeline Group which we are currently funding, can all worked out it's not really material to the regulatory process.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. In terms of Mackenzie have been anymore thought of maybe taking the lead over the projects from the producers group as the something we were talking about a few weeks ago?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said many times, we're not focused on the issue of taking over the lead in the project. We're working very closely with the producers and with the Government of Canada trying to resolve some issues so that we can break the logjam and move ahead with the project. I've said before that TransCanada is willing to contribute in whatever way we can. I would note that the amount of construction, the tonnage of pipe, the miles of pipe that we're installing on the Keystone pipeline project is about twice as big as the Mackenzie. So this is the kind of project that we do. This is what our company does and we have extended the offer that we'd be prepared to do that on the Mackenzie project, but those are not issues that are important to any of us right now, the most important thing to the Aboriginal Pipeline Group to the producers and TransCanada and I believe to the Government of Canada is to figure out an economic model that allows the project to go ahead and to do that, we are really focused on risk reduction and cost management and once we get through those, we'll figure out how we're going to implement.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I bet I will ask one what the heck. Churchill River, you guys were selected in a joint-venture about 18 months ago on -- to go back to call for a transmission project with respect to Churchill River. There has been some activity, we are that getting nearer, we are getting connected with Newfoundland, Labrador to study how to deliver that power, where do you stand Alex with respect to that particular project, is that dormant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that was actually -- that was a call for proposals, preliminary proposals to express interest in actually designing and constructing and operating the actual hydro facility and -- I mean -- at the time we put it in, we see that as a great opportunity, but we weren't going to go very much further, with it unless it was quite clear that we are getting the support of the various provincial governments and the utilities in the area and I think it's fair to say at this time, Newfoundland as you noted they have announced that they are working on the opportunity. So we are not doing any more work on it. We are just monitoring it and we would love to be involved. But we want to make sure there is a role for us before we put any more effort into it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and lastly small question, B&#xE9;cancour -- use the word similar economics, but not identical to operating it, there must be some small differential you are picking up, if you were running B&#xE9;cancour, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our economic, are very close, but I think it would be, from the -- here is a simple way to put it. The economics from my perspective are identical. We have the benefit of not having the wear and tear in our machines and not having to worry about any type of catastrophic incident or any kind or any other kind of incident that could affect operation. So we get the exact saying margin out of the project have we wanted this, by not running.</p>
