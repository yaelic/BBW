      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. This is Ivan Monteiro. Welcome to the First Quarter 2010 Conference Call. Before giving the floor to Geovanne, who will detail you the net income of R$ 2.3 billion and other aspect of the results, I would like to briefly discuss some aspects of the Brazilian economy in early 2010.</p>
          <p>The national consumer price index, IPCA, accumulate in 12 months with the parameter to measure the Brazil inflation achieved 5.2% in March 2010, strongly influenced by the climate problems at the beginning of the year and by the signal effect. The IPCA achieved in March 2010 was 96 basis points above December 2009. In contrast, wages in Brazil continues to grow and in March 2010, has an increase of 25.7% over 2002 numbers, basis 100.</p>
          <p>The cost of evolution as is indicated is a good reference to the economy. <mark type="inaudible" /> directly related to household construction, which influence <mark type="inaudible" /> country. Another interesting point to be highlighted is our economy, was the drop of the unemployment rates in Brazil. We <mark type="inaudible" /> employment rate of 10% at the end of 2006 to a rate 7.8% in March 2010. The behavior of the Brazilian threat indicator concerns the improvement in wage and in unemployment rates in Brazil. The longevity ratio remains at 45%. During December period total volume of strategy on banking industry went from R$ 900 billion to 1.5, 1.4 trillion in March 2010 with the stake of 40 banks being 42.8% from that total.</p>
          <p>Regarding <mark type="inaudible" /> project is falling off the first quarter of 2010. The expectations for the year are good reaching an amount of R$2 trillion in December, an increase of 17.7%, compared to December 2009. And there is a very positive highlight. Even with the growth of spreads in the banking industry at the end of March 2010, indicators of allowance for loan losses and past due operations over 90 days decreased and <mark type="inaudible" /> 6.7%, 20 basis points less than December 2009 and 4%, 40 basis points less than December 2009 respectively.</p>
          <p>About Banco do Brasil, I would like to remind you of some success movements from 2010. In April the Federal Reserve granted to Banco do Brasil the status of financial holding company, allowing BB to enter the site banking activity in the U.S. territory, under the same conditions of the local institution. Also in April, we signed a <mark type="inaudible" /> agreement for the acquisition of control interest in Banco Puertogarda. To reorganize our insurance area, we took the following steps. Signed a MOU with <mark type="inaudible" /> to create a success partnership for the development and making <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Sorry for the problem in the conference call.</p>
          <p>Geovanne?</p>

          <p>I think the directors are having some problems trying to connect in the line and I think they have some problems. Sorry for that.</p>

      <speaker id="1">

          <p>Okay. Renew our partnership with Principal Financial Group to active development and marketing of private pension fund products in Brazil <mark type="inaudible" /> signed an agreement with <mark type="inaudible" /> segment. The partnership will create the second largest insurance company of Brazil. Another movement of the deal was the signing off a memorandum of understanding with Bradescu to elaborate a new business model in the area of debit, credit and pre-paid card. From this partnership as operated by regulators we be borrowing a new Brazilian card, Elo.</p>
          <p>Finally, we find that an application was filed with Associa&#xE7;&#xE3;o Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiros e de Capitais or ANBIMA for a preliminary review of a registration statement for a Primary and Secondary Public Offering of common shares, <mark type="inaudible" /> as published on material effect on May 6, 2010.</p>
          <p>Well, we'll pass the floor to Geovanne. I'll be available in the Q&amp;A session. Thank you. Geovanne, please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ivan.</p>
          <p>Let's start the presentation, remind you that from Q1 2010 on, we started to recognize gains and losses related to the Defined Benefit Plan, Plan number I from Previ, the pension fund trend for Banco do Brasil's employees. And this recognition is being considered as recurrent according to Paragraph 55 of Deliberation 371 from the Brazilian SEC, CVM.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to slide number 3 where we can see Banco do Brasil's net income and return on equity. In the first quarter of 2010, the net income amounted to R$ 2.351 billion, corresponding to a return on equity of 28%. Without the one-off, the recurring net income totaled R$ 1.9 billion and the return on equity achieved 23.1%, already considering the actuarial recognition of Previ's <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>On slide 4, we have a breakdown of the one-off items in the first quarter of 2010. Those one-off items added in the quarter R$384 million net of taxes and profit sharing and it was strongly affected by the reversal of labor liabilities, which amounted to R$568 million.</p>
          <p>On slide 5 we have some of Banco do Brasil's market share. I would like to highlight the size of our demand deposit space, which represent almost a third of the whole banking industry with a 32.8% market share in demand deposits. Banco do Brasil also presents a market share above 30% and 2 modes of foreign trade, advanced contract and export with 35.9 and 30.9% market share respectively.</p>
          <p>With regard to credit granting, we had a reduction of 30 basis points in the market share of Banco do Brasil in total credit. However, it is still relevant and we are the leaders in terms of credit granting with 19.8% market share.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 6, we see that Banco do Brasil's total assets grew 2.3% in the quarter, achieving a R$725 billion. I would like to remind you that the numbers from Nossa Caixa and a 50% stake that Banco do Brasil had in Banco Votorantim are already been consolidated in these numbers. And the highlight in this slide is definitely that we have tripled the total &#x2013; the volume of assets in Banco do Brasil for the past 7 years.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide number 7, I would like to talk now about the financial results, and we can observe the evolution of our net interest income, which grew 34.3% when compared to the same period last year and 1.1% when compared to the previous quarter. And this growth was led by a strong increase in revenues from loan operations, a 38.9% increase in one year. Once again, the expansion of our loan operations revenue was granted by the increase in average volumes of credit transactions that compensated the behavior of spread in the meantime.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 8, we see the expansion on Banco do Brasil's &#x2013; that the expansion on Banco do Brasil's net income was afforded by the evolution of Banco do Brasil's funding. As can be seen in this slide, total funding as well as total deposits, savings and time deposits, they all grew in the quarter with an increase in the cost of funding in all forms as well.</p>
          <p>Our total funding increased by 0.4% in the quarter, reaching an amount of R$0.5 trillion. And in the quarter with the cost around 79% of the benchmark rate, an increase of 140 basis points in the same period. Savings deposits had a quarterly growth of 3.9% and deposits 2.3%, and total deposits grew 1.5% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide number 9, we can see the behavior of Banco do Brasil's global spreads and also the spread for each project with a comparison with the accumulated Selic rate, the benchmark rate. The focus on consumer finance has granted more resilience to Banco do Brasil's spread in relation to the Selic rate downward trend. On the left hand side of the slide, we can observe that the behavior of spreads for each portfolio was distinct. While in the agribusiness portfolio, we saw a slight decrease in the spread when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, in the business and in the digi-portfolios, we saw a drop in the spread. With the spread in the individual book and in the quarter at 18.2%, and in the business book at 6.7% respectively.</p>
          <p>The compression for those spreads is mainly due to a mix effect with a concentration in those launched with less risk and therefore with small margins, but also as a consequence of a separate competition, especially in the business portfolio.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side of the slide, we can see the behavior of Banco do Brasil's global spread, calculated by the net interest income over earning assets. This spread has stayed stable at 6.5% in the quarter, only 20 basis point drop when compared to the previous quarter. Another way to analyze the global spread is to compare it with the accumulated Selic rate for the period. By doing that we can see that Banco do Brasil is increasing its financial intermediation results despite the increase in the Selic rate.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter of 2009, the annualized Selic rate was 12.1%, the ratio of global spread over accumulated Selic was 54.5%. In the first quarter of 2010 this ratio went up to 77.6%, with an annualized Selic rate at the range of 8.4%. Once again it is important to remind you that Banco do Brasil is being quite successful in compensating the Selic drop with credit growth in its margin.</p>
          <p>On slide number 10, we have Banco do Brasil's loan portfolio. I would like to highlight here that loan to individuals surpassed R$95 billion. And the balance of the portfolio, the total portfolio reached almost R$306 billion, we're presenting a 26.3% growth, 12 month and 1.6% growth in the quarter. It's important to highlight here the expansion in individuals, which increased its share from 25.3% of the total book back in March 2009 to 31.1% of the total book in March 2010.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we have the breakdown of our Consumer Finance operation which grew 55.6% in 12 month and 3.6% in the quarter, allowing Banco do Brasil to increase its market share in the Consumer Finance segment from 14.8% to 22.6%. This performance has been boosted by the expectation on payroll loans and auto loans, which posted a very strong growth in the period. For the past 12 month, Banco do Brasil increased its payroll portfolio by 55%. In the quarter, it was a 5.5% increase.</p>
          <p>On to slide 12, we bring you the breakdown of our business portfolio that reached R$128 billion. I would like to call your attention here to the mid-size and large-size company's performance. That posted an increase of 28.7% in one year and 3.1% in the quarter. Growth to SMEs also increased by 20% for the past 12 month and 0.7% in the quarter. We must say that Banco do Brasil took advantage of its relationship with business clients in order to supply their credit needs during the crisis. And this strategy is going to start growth in volume and improvement in the profitability with those clients.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 13, we have here the balance of our foreign trade operation. The total portfolio reached R$24.7 billion at the end of March 2010. A slight decrease when compared to the previous quarter, due mainly to the appreciation of the reais against dollar.</p>
          <p>On slide 14 we would like to reaffirm here our presence in the agribusiness portfolio, as the biggest, biggest partner of the Brazilian agribusiness. We are by far, the largest lender to that segment, and we entered the quarter with a balance of R$64.9 billion of loans to the agribusiness segment. We're presenting approximately 60% of the entire financial system credit to that segment.</p>
          <p>Compared to December 2009, the agribusiness portfolio showed a decrease of 2.3%, explained mainly by the settlement of transactions with agri- industries, as well as a very large concentration of reduction or cost operations in that quarter. And it's important to remember that we are in between 2 processes.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, we bring some information that allows us to be very confident about the quality of our agri book. On the left hand side of the slide, we disclose here the amount of working capital line that was contracted with agri insurance. For the 2009/2010 crop, out of the R$12.8 billion rented to working capital needs in the agribusiness sector, 63% of that was fully insured. Again, 62% in the 2008/2009 crop, and 50% in the 2007/2008 crop.</p>
          <p>It is important to remember here that 90% of this amount is being reinsured by international conference. And you can see the breakdown of the insured &#x2013; reinsurance operation in the pie chart, at the left side of this slide. On the right hand side of this slide, we have a geographic distribution of the rural insurance in Brazil. You can see here that the Midwest, Southern Brazil and Northeastern Brazil, they are the regions that concentrate the highest percentile of insured cost.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, we can see on the top graph that provision expenses grew by 2.6% when compared to the previous quarter. In contrast, the ratio between provision charges for the past 12 months, over average portfolio decreased, reaching 4.5%. Past due loans over 90 days shown in the yellow lines at the bottom of the graph came from 3.3% to 3.1%, showing an improvement in the delinquency in the first part of the year when compared to the previous quarter. The trend of the curve is definitely confirming that delinquency has peaked in Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>The dark blue line in the same graph shows us the ratio, additional and required for provision over the total portfolio, and it is important to highlight here that the volume of provision coverage has been consistently strong in Banco do Brasil, achieving a ratio of 6% at the end of March 2010.</p>
          <p>Now, on slide 17, we would like to make a comparison here between the delinquency seen in Banco do Brasil and the delinquency for the banking industry. On the top left-hand side of the slide, you will realize that delinquency for all banks is dropping in Brazil, however, for Banco do Brasil, the delinquency levels are by far much better than the industry. You see that delinquency dropped from 5.9% in March 2009 to 4.4% in March 2010 while delinquency for the industry in the individual book was 7%.</p>
          <p>On the top right-hand side of the slide, we make the comparison for delinquencies in both business loan book. You will realize that delinquency in Banco do Brasil peaked in June 2009 and since then it has been decreasing consistently, achieving by the end of March 2010, 2.6% delinquency ratio. And when compared to the industry, we can realize as well that delinquency in the business book in Banco do Brasil is much better than the industry.</p>
          <p>And we brought you here also some information about the delinquency in Banco Votorantim's loan book. It is at 3.4% below the average industry, confirming the quality of the loans that have been granted in Banco Votorantim.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to slide 18, we would like to make an analysis for the vintage of our loans to individuals. And we exclude here overdraft accounts, credit cards and car loan. Definitely the change in the mix of our individual book concentrating higher volumes in payroll loans helps reduce delinquency to all time. However, I would like to highlight here that the delinquency for the 2009 vintage was tremendously, tremendously below the average delinquency seen in the previous vintages, showing the conservativeness of Banco do Brasil in its credit risk methodology and assessment.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 19, we bring you some numbers about the performance of our administrative expenses that was completely in line with the business growth and with the acquisition we've seen. I cannot forget to highlight here the control on cost that the management is promoting, other administrative expenses reduced from 2.6 to R$2.4 billion and while personal expenses practically remained flat. In total, the drop in total administrative expenses in the quarter was at 3%.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 20, we can see that non-interest bearing businesses or fee-based business here have added a very significant revenue to the results of Banco do Brasil. Fee income totaled R$3.6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 24% when compared to the same period of 2009. Also on this slide, if you look to the right-bottom part of the slide, you will see the performance of our Insurance business. The added value of insurance to Banco do Brasil's net income increased by 24.2% in the quarter and the share of our insurance revenue &#x2013; insurance results in the net profit increased to 15% at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, I would like to inform you that on May 5 we released 2 material facts disclosing to the market that Banco do Brasil acquired a stake of Sul Am&#xE9;rica in Brasilve&#xED;culos and we also share a strategic partnership with MAPFRE Insurance Group. These 2 movement is completely in line with the strategy that Banco do Brasil is putting in place to increase the share of the Insurance business in the net profit of Banco do Brasil. And we will create through this partnership the second largest insurance company in Brasil.</p>
          <p>On slide 22, Banco do Brasil did a very interesting movement in the card business, which signed a memorandum of understanding with Bradesco to create a new business model in the area of debit, credit and prepaid cards. As can be seen on slide 22, this partnership, when authorized by regulators, will create a new Brazilian card grant called Elo. And giving support to Elo's card, we will create a holding company, which will be responsible for managing all common business between Banco do Brasil and Bradesco in the credit, debit and prepaid card.</p>
          <p>On slide 23 we bring you some information about our BIS ratio. It remained flat in the quarter at 13.7%. With this level of BIS ratio, we have an excess of equity around R$12 million that entitles Banco do Brasil to produce it's own book by more than R$100 billion considering the 100% weighted assets.</p>
          <p>On slide 24 we would like to make a comparison between the multiples of Banco do Brasil and the main Brazilian banks. We can see that the appreciation of Banco do Brasil share in 12 months surpassed 76% and it was higher than the appreciation in the Bovespa and our peers. This appreciation, if adjusted for the proceeds we paid to our shareholders would average 88%. In addition, I cannot forget to mention that we have already issued almost 5 million ADR, over-the-counter ADR in the United States that are effectively active.</p>
          <p>On slide 25 we would like to summarize the performance of Banco do Brasil with regard to the guidance outlines we provided to investors when we disclosed the results of 2010. You can see here we have reached almost all the guidances we announced, except for the performance in our domestic loan book. And the reason for missing the guidance here is that mainly explained by the performance in the Agribusiness book that I have already mentioned that was not in line with the guidance, and a slower growth in Business portfolio caused mainly by the impact of depreciation of our currency over dollar for the foreign trade transaction. If it wasn't for that, the growth in our domestic loan book would have been above 18%, completely in line with the guidance.</p>
          <p>And with regard to the total deposits, we missed the guidance due to the excess liquidity profitables that you have. And I cannot forget to mention that the base of comparison that was March 2009 during that time the volume of deposits that was flowing into Banco do Brasil was extremely high and due to the crisis and due to the so-called price volatility movement.</p>
          <p>On page 26 and also on page 27 we bring you the main guidelines that helped us &#x2013; the main assumptions that helped us to set those guidances and I would recommend that all investors read those assumptions in order to understand what could make that guidance not being reached by Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Well, these are the main information I would like to share with you with regard to our first quarter 2010 results. We can now open the floor to the Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> You have a question from the line of Marcelo Telles of Credit Suisse.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello, everyone. I have one question, I mean, in the quarter, you reduced your additional provisions by roughly 150, R$160 million versus the fourth quarter. But there you mentioned that this was really not the release of provisions that related to the Nossa Caixa portfolio, but went to the criteria of Banco do Brasil in terms of local diversification provisionary requirements.</p>
          <p>My question is, I mean, how much &#x2013; what is the rate of migration of the Nossa Caixa portfolio each Banco do Brasil criteria and how much you would expect in terms of potential reduction with those additional provisions as a result of the extra migration from Nossa Caixa portfolio to Banco do Brasil? Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me try to summarize what he has told ancestor in Portuguese. When we bought Nossa Caixa, the first thing the credit department did was to increase the volume of provisions for Nossa Caixa's loan &#x2013; existing loan book according to Banco do Brasil's credit risk methodology. And at that time, that provision that was reinforced was considered excess provision.</p>
          <p>When we consolidated and we brought those operations to Banco do Brasil's system and we started doing that at the beginning of this first quarter of 2010, we had to make a balance again. And there were many loans that were ranked at lower risk levels. And when we brought into Banco do Brasil's system, the risk level of that loan that was being added was higher than we had to adjust those provisions upward. And we did that by taking a part from the excess provision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what we saw definitely happen in the first quarter was an increasing in the volume of required provisions due to these loans, especially consumer loans that is the highest bulk of loans that we have in Nossa Caixa, due to a higher risk level. And we did that by using the excess provision that we had already accounted previously when we first balanced Nossa Caixa's book to Banco do Brasil's credit risk methodology.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we do not expect higher volumes of provision increase, because the amount of loans that will be added to Banco do Brasil's portfolio from Nossa Caixa is much smaller now. And 100%, I have here the manager of Banco do Brasil's <mark type="inaudible" />, all the entire...</p>

          <p>85% of the consumer loan book in Nossa Caixa has already been transferred to Banco do Brasil's system.

          <p>Excellent. Thanks very much. If you allow me, just to add one more question. I mean, it seems that the Banco Votorantim, we had a &#x2013; got bigger contribution in the quarter and there was apparently non-improvement in the net interest income line. I remember in one occasion you mentioned that there were some like numerous acquisitions that were actually undermining the margins at Banco Votorantim. And is this &#x2013; are these derivative positions already closed in &#x2013; were they closed in the first quarter, should we expect even better results coming from Banco Votorantim going forward? And also, how do you see, like, the provision evolution within Banco Votorantim? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Geovanne. To follow-up on the overall provisioning discussion, if I look at, as you stated in page 25, your provision this quarter 4.5% of average loans, which was in line with the guidance of 4.4 to 4.8, that was a very mild decline from prior quarters with your provision in 4.6, 4.7. We still had managed a much sharper decline in provisions than some of your competitors and even the decline in the NPL ratio in both individual and business loans that you showed in slide 17, can we see further declines in the provisioning ratio while there's <mark type="inaudible" /> future quarters, is that the case, on top of that, wouldn't you agree that this guidance of 4.4 to 4.8 is looking a little too conservative.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, he mentioned that the average risk for the portfolio is improving. And because of that he believes that the trend for this ratio is a downward trend, we should expect as a percentage of the lower volumes of provision.</p>
          <p>He's explained that the reasons why our provisioning ratio was higher was because many strategies raised June prices was granted at a separate environment. And for that purpose, the creditness of dollar had increased the risk of those loans and has required higher provision. And since the environment is improving and the average risk on these loans are reducing and we are increasing faster those loans with lower risk gets trended a slightly average risk and therefore a smaller provision charge ratio looking forward.</p>
          <p>However, we will maintain the guidance at least for another quarter to be sure that this trend will be confirmed. So definitely you are right. The guidance we are giving is very conservative, but we do maintain this guidance at the level it is right now and before the second quarter. And we have to assess, again, that issue when we disclose the second quarter again.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Carlos Macedo of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Geovanne, Ivan. Thank you. Just one question on the Previ claw back, we saw it increase from &#x2013; the funds that comes from Previ, the pension fund increased from 300 million to around 715 million this quarter. I understand there's around R$2 billion this year. If you could go through a little bit of the mechanics to calculate this claw back and what we can expect coming from this line as we go through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Carlos, thank you very much. It is important to bear in mind that our pension fund plan is created not to post profit, but losses. So that's why a pension plan must be balanced. So a surplus or a deficit means that the actuarial assessment if that is being done is either too conservative or too literal, okay?</p>
          <p>In the case of Brazil, it was very conservative. So as of March 2010, we had the fair value of the assets, the backup, the plan 1 of Previ allowed R$140 billion, okay, while the present value of the liabilities of that plan was around R$80 billion. So the surplus would be roughly R$60 billion, the difference between the asset and the liabilities, okay? Since the rule in Brazil allows the company to recognize a part of the surplus that belongs to it, our accountant has started to account that on a recovered basis, okay? And the mathematics that is behind that is the following. Given this size of surplus, we believe that at least when you apply the actuarial rate for both liability and asset, you will have a part of the surplus to be recognized on a recurrent basis.</p>
          <p>Of course then according to the rule, you must hire every year minimum and especially an actuarial to assess the fair value of the asset and the present value of the liability and adjust the size of the surplus. Okay? In order to reduce the volatility that is recovered with recognition would bring to Banco do Brasil's results. We decided to make these actuarial assessments every 6 months to make these adjustments and to reduce the gap between what we are projecting due to the actuarial rate and what effectively will happen with the fair value of these assets and the present value of the liability to all time. Okay?</p>
          <p>So roughly, how much Banco do Brasil is entitled to recognize? We have a surplus of R$60 billion. According to the rule, after applying all the actuarial requirement, you are entitled to recognize a part that belongs to you after reducing or after building up a cushion. This cushion must be 10% of the fair value of the assets or the present value of the liability, okay? The highest one.</p>
          <p>So the highest one is the fair value of the asset. That is R$140 billion. So it must create a cushion of R$14 billion, 10% of that, okay? So you must pick up from the R$60 billion. Half of this belongs to Banco do Brasil. So Banco do Brasil is entitled to 30 billion, okay? Can recognize 30 billion. However, first must be dealt with cushion. The cushion is R$14 billion. So how much is left? 16 billion to be recognized. How much we have in the book? 13 billion.</p>
          <p>So according to the math, we have 3 billion that we mentioned to be recognized on a quarterly basis. Of course that the value of the asset and liability do vary throughout time and these actuarial assessments will be very important and we'll view that in the second quarter in June to see if the estimates we are taking into consideration to recognize this amount is accurate or should be increased or reduced, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect, Geovanne. Just one follow-up question. If &#x2013; when &#x2013; so if you're going to do this assessment again in June, it means that your second-quarter number might be different or it means that your third-quarter number might be different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second quarter might be different. Hold on a second. [Foreign Language] . It will be adjusted in the second quarter. As a matter of fact, we will publish the balance sheet for the first semester. So it will give the first semester numbers, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then &#x2013; we can assume that, since you are going to do it every 6 months, that the third quarter is going to be similar to the first quarter &#x2013; to the second quarter, I mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the third quarter, we will estimate the GAAP according &#x2013; we'll estimate the actuarial rate to close the gap between assets and liabilities.</p>

          <p>Hi, yes. Geovanne, just on continuing with the asset quality questions that we had earlier, just looking at BV, the credit quality deteriorating slightly there in the first quarter, which kind of goes against the grain of what's happening elsewhere in the industry and in the group. Was this due to some worsening in &#x2013; also credits or can you give us any more color there on what's going on there? Is that &#x2013; do you see that as a one-off or do you see that as kind of &#x2013; is there something similar to what happened before with Nossa Caixa and the reclassification of some loans there? Can you give us a bit of color there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As far as we know Victor, there was a slight deterioration, but nothing that worried us, because it is normal as you can see, historically, and we have shown that on slide 17. Before the slides, the level of delinquency was at 2.2. It increased by 100 bps fortunately in line with what we were expecting. And we don't expect a further decrease in that delinquency. The trend is to start improving, but it will do it at a slower pace.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe if I could ask a follow-up on agribusiness asset quality, we saw that that although the charge offs are coming down quarter-on-quarter that overall, the NPL formation remains quite high. Do you expect to see this improve? And if so, when? Would you expect it to be a second half of 2010 event or would we start to see some improvement in asset quality and NPL formation there in the second quarter, do you think?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And it's that &#x2013; it's not that the quality of the book is deteriorating, it was just a mixed effect, because we had repayment, loss of repayment in the first quarter from the agri, the industrial loan book, okay? And these loans to agri-industry, they have a lower spread, because &#x2013; a smaller spread, because they have also a smaller, a lower risk. And because of this repayment, we increased the share of agri-loans to farmers, to individuals, which brings higher risk, but also higher spreads. And that's the reason why the spread in the agri-book increased in Q1.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a couple of questions. The first one, on legal risk, on legal claims, and labor losses. The amount there in the quarter was R$450 million, which is up very sharply from the last quarter, but also I think up from a kind of normalized run rate somewhere around 200 million or even lower. Is that sort of an anomaly this quarter? Did anything happen that means it's hard, and usual? Are we really moving to a slightly higher level of cost there for any given reason?</p>
          <p>And secondly, with the change in the capitalization rule and the surplus loan loss provision, as <mark type="inaudible" /> not be able to be added back to Tier 1 capital. Is there any intention to reverse out further surplus provisions in the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ian. This is Geovanne, thank you very much for your question. Hold on one second, please.</p>
          <p>Well, thank you, Ian. For the first question with regard to legal risk, what happened this quarter was that we are merging all the operations from Nossa Caixa to Banco do Brasil's system. It happened with credit and it also happens with the legal &#x2013; with the legal suit &#x2013; with the suits, okay, with the labor suits and civil suits as well.</p>
          <p>And yes, we did. We adjusted the methodology of Nossa Caixa to Banco do Brasil's methodology. And because of that we had a positive impact from Nossa Caixa. We reduced the volume of provisions for labels too and we call that one-off and we had to adjust that. So when you compare the first quarter to the fourth quarter, you will see that the volume in the first quarter recurring was higher, definitely. Especially when compared Q4, because on Q4 this new methodology for Banco do Brasil and helped us &#x2013; allowed us to write back provisions that were being created for labor suit.</p>
          <p>Now what we are getting is a statistic model to try to forecast how much effective do you believe, you will be the last for these labors choose to industry , okay?</p>
          <p>Looking forward, in the meantime, yes we are at the middle of this new methodologies giving up high for Banco do Brasil and to all suits that are being added to our difference from Nossa Caixa. It's too soon to try to predict what will be a recurrent volume of risk or little risk provisions, okay? But I think you should &#x2013; at least something around 200, I don't know, to be honest with you, we got to wait till second quarter to see how this line is going to perform to try to picture out what will be the recurrent, okay? But the main explanation for this higher volumes has to do with that.</p>
          <p>And your final question with regard to the excess reserves we have, Banco do Brasil does not have the intention to write that &#x2013; those excess provision for the meantime, okay? From Q2 on, definitely we will not be allowed to add to our Tier 1, the volume of excess provisions. We expect a negative impact in our BIS ratio around 0.6 &#x2013; 0.66. So it will bring our BIS ratio down close to the 13% average, okay? But then we have the capital rate to offset that. But in the meantime, Banco do Brasil will maintain the excess reserves in this book, okay?</p>
