          <p>Hello, and welcome to this Teleconference in connection with our Annual Report for 2008.  We sent it out earlier today, 11:30 Danish Time.  My name is Nils Andersen, and I am the Group CEO of the A.P. M&#xF8;ller &#x2013; M&#xE6;rsk Group.  And with me today as usual is also our Group CFO, S&#xF8;ren Thorup S&#xF8;rensen.</p>
          <p>We'll start as usual with a presentation and then we'll open up for question-and-answers afterwards.  The presentation as well as the report that was released is on our homepage, maersk.com, for those of you who don't have it at the moment.  But before we start as usual please read the waiver on slide two.  And while you do it, this is the forward-looking statement, while you do that just let me mention that that we're satisfied with the underlying operational performance for the individual business segments in 2008.  2008 was a very turbulent year, but we managed to get through it in a good manner with increasing profits from operations in almost all business units.</p>
          <p>The net profit for the year ended at 3.5 billion.  And that was in line with our latest announcement on February 5, and but somewhat below the range we expected at the beginning of the year. And we'll explain of course what has changed since then.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, there is no doubt that 2009 will be a very challenging year.  We are deeply affected to the global economic crisis due to our dependence on global trade, the container business, and of course also the low oil prices impact our own oil business as well as, mid-term at least, also the activity in our oil services activities.</p>
          <p>But assuming you read the forward-looking statement, let's just skip the agenda and go directly to slide four.  And here we start with the highlights.  And as I said before, improved operational result in most of the Group business units.  We had, if we start by the container business on your left, we had an improvement of approximately US$100 million in net profit compared to last year.  We'll come back to that a little bit later. Also improvement in APM Terminals.  Tankers and Offshore declined in net profit, but that was not due to the operational performance.  It was due to less gains and the impact of H&#xF6;egh Autoliners.</p>
          <p>Very good improvement in the oil and gas business driven by high oil prices. The Retail segment declined in the result, and I'll come back to that in a minute as well, more driven by financial losses than by operational developments. And the last segment, Shipyard and the Danske Bank, of course following the problems in the financial service, a serious decline.</p>
          <p>Looking at the total net profit for the year, in spite of a number of or less gains and a number of one-off like items, we managed to keep the earnings on the same level as last year, and that is, I think, we'll see during the presentation, but actually not too bad in our own opinion.</p>
          <p>But, if you go to slide five, then S&#xF8;ren will guide you through the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And as mentioned in previous presentation, reporting and commenting on the numbers in dollars is most relevant since about 75% of our business is in U.S. dollars.  But for those of you who prefer Danish kroner, we have included the results in Danish kroner in the appendix to the presentation.</p>
          <p>If we first look at the revenue, it increased by 20% to $61 billion.  And the increase is mainly due to higher oil prices and the increase in the Group's share of oil and gas production, as well as higher freight rates in the container business due to recovery of bunker price increases.  EBITDA increased by 38% to $16.5 billion, mainly driven by the increased contribution from our oil and gas activities, and as you saw from the previous slide, also positive contribution from the majority of the other businesses.</p>
          <p>Depreciation, amortization and impairment increased to $5.1 billion, hereof about $0.5 billion before tax related to impairment of assets, which next slide will explain in a little more detail.  Sales gain came in below last year.  And the contribution from associated companies was negative with $0.4 billion, mainly due to a write-down of goodwill related to our holding in Danske Bank, combined with a significantly lower result in Danske Bank, a write-down on the investment in H&#xF6;egh Autoliners, which I'll come back to.  Financial items were negatively impacted by currency adjustments and losses on securities.  Net profit remained therefore nearly unchanged at $3.5 billion, however impacted by a number of non-recurring items.  And I propose that you turn to the next slide, where these have been highlighted.</p>
          <p>On this slide to better understand some of the result developments, we have picked up some of the selected significant special items.  And as you could see, sales gains were $914 million against 1.1 billion the year before.  And you need to bear in mind that the year before it was impacted by the sale of three big E-rigs, and in 2008 we had a gain on the H&#xF6;egh Autoliner transaction of 206.</p>
          <p>If we look at the some of the more negative special items like cost and write-downs, the total amount is around $1.2 billion, and if we take them by one-by-one, the first one was in container business.  We have incurred restructuring costs of $245 million related to the streamLINE initiatives.  As required, we have performed an impairment calculation at the end of the year and due to the significantly lower oil price at the end of 2008, we have made a write-down of $197 million after tax on our oil concession rights and production facilities in U.K.</p>
          <p>Also in the terminal activities, we have made an impairment write-down of $50 million on terminal concession rights due to lower volume expectations.  And as mentioned earlier, $222 million was written down on goodwill related to Danske Bank.  If we look at H&#xF6;egh Autoliners, due to the challenging outlook for the car carrier activities, we made a write-down at the end of the year of $124 million.  And in addition to this our share of the operating loss was $89 million, but against that there was the sales gains of $206 million. So, all-in-all net nearly not impacting the profit and loss account.  The Group's holding of security had negative value adjustments of $0.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Please go to slide seven.  Here you can see that our operational cash flow increased by 17% to $8.5 billion, mainly due to higher earnings before depreciation, but also we saw an improvement of working capital by nearly $0.5 billion or around $0.5 billion during the second half of 2008.  It was helped by the lower oil price at the end of the year, but also tight control of receivables in the Group.  Investment cash flow remained at a high level of 10.3 billion, and the equity ratio increased from 44.7% to 46.2%, net interest bearing debt increased to $16 billion.</p>
          <p>Please now turn to slide eight, where Nils will go through the development in the container shipping activities.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So, coming back to the figures for the individual business units, starting with the container business, which includes Safmarine, as well as the inland depots and Maersk Logistics, and we see an improvement from 2008 of &#x2013; 2007 to 2008 of approximately US$100 million.  And if we take that figure and reduce the streamLINE cost and add the sales gains, actually the result was approximately US$100 million &#x2013; 104, which is an improvement of approximately 300 million compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Maersk Line and Safmarine combined growth was 2%.  So, we reached a total volume of 7 million forty-foot containers and/or units.  We had a very nice &#x2013; or an increase on paper, very nice increase of 8% in the average rate, transportation rate per FFE, but that was entirely due to better collection or you can say higher bunker prices, which was to approximately 60% recovered from the customers.  If we take the bunker cost and the BAF and net that out, it's more or less in line with &#x2013; there is more or less full coverage about US$16 difference negatively in the bunker cost increase and the rate increase.  So we &#x2013; the net &#x2013; say when you exclude the bunker cost net of BAF, we lost approximately $16 per FFE.</p>
          <p>We had done a very &#x2013; there's been done a very good job on reducing bunker consumption. It's done by slow steaming, by better planning, by making sure that we arrive in the harbors more or less on time, and that has led to a saving of a reduction in bunker consumption of 4% with a slight increase in volume that is quite a good achievement.  We also are pleased with progress in terms of service.  We noticed a clear improvement in the quality of our invoices and less mistakes done in our IT systems and systems in general, and due to that and higher schedule reliability we noted a clear improvement in the customer satisfaction. And if I'm not mistaken, it's the highest level of customer satisfaction we've measured since we started measuring, so that was very positive.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; on a positive note we also ended the year with the positive result in the fourth quarter and that has of course something to do with the BAF collection being somewhat behind the actual decrease in bunker prices. So we had a positive effect on that, where we've had a negative effect in times of increasing bunker prices. So that is what you can read directly from the slide, you can also see where &#x2013; whether we have what developments on the lower part of the slide, a decline of 2% in our important Asia Europe business, and general declines across the board except in Africa and Safmarine, which is also exposed to Africa.  If we go &#x2013; if we talk about the last quarter, we had a serious decline in volumes of approximately 9% in the fourth quarter and this tendency or trend has continued into 2009, January was very negative with a drop of approximately 20% compared to the year before, which does of course indicate that 2009 will be challenging in the container business.</p>
          <p>If we go to slide nine, APM Terminals, the figures are here more &#x2013; percentage wise at least more positive.  We had an increase in turnover by 24% compared with 2007.  If we look at the activity measured by the number of crane lifts and weighted by ownership share, then we had an increase of 8% which compares well to a global market growth, which we estimate to be 4%.  The average rates were driven by the U.S. dollar exchange rates, tariff increases, and also geographical mix changes.  We had a sales gain in 2008 of 67 million, which were almost all came from disposal of our 20% share in Port Qasim.  We also had a negative effect from a write-down of a terminal of US$50 million, so there are little positives and negatives here.  But the net profit increased by approximately 50% from 106 to $161 million.  And perhaps more interesting in this sense is the development in the operating cash flow, which grew from 260 to US$500 million, which indicates the fact that APM Terminals is maturing as a business.</p>
          <p>The strategy of focusing on third-party customers is also paying off.  We've had a 25% increase in volumes from other customers than Maersk Line, which now accounts for 38% of total volume, which is up from 34% in 2007.  We just noted here the concession period, which is around 20 years.  The development also &#x2013; here it's relevant to talk about the development in the fourth quarter, just to indicate the speed of the market.  And we indicate that the global &#x2013; or expect that the global market in fourth quarter contracted with approximately 6%.  We maintained a growth of 2%, but of course it indicates that 2009 also here will be challenging.  There are some trends which means that the terminals business would be slightly less challenged than the global or inter-continental carriers, such as growth into Asia and short-sea, but in general &#x2013; generally speaking of course the terminals business will follow more or less the development in the global container shipping.</p>
          <p>So with that we'll close this presentation on APM Terminals, and I'll give you &#x2013; give the word back to S&#xF8;ren.  Please go to slide 10.</p>

          <p>And on slide 10, you can see the segment called Tankers, Offshore and Other Shipping that contains Maersk Tankers, Maersk Drilling, Maersk FPSO, SVITZER and Supply.  If we look at the results and we adjust them for sales gains and write-downs, they were slightly above 2007, and in the back of the presentation we have added detailed income statement for each of the main businesses.  There was generally a high activity level in the offshore market and a satisfactory rate level for our crude and our large product tankers.  Our sales gain came in below 2007 where we sold amongst other the three drilling rigs.  When we sold our car carriers to H&#xF6;egh Autoliners in the beginning of 2008, it created an accounting gain of $206 million.  But again, as mentioned before, due to the weak outlook for the car carrier business, the investment was written down by $124 million at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We will first focus on Maersk Tankers, tankers was positively impacted by favorable rate level and higher oil production in OPEC countries and the net profit excluding sales gains was $197 million, that was higher than the year before.  Here in January, we have finalized the acquisition of Brostr&#xF6;m, which have added 62 vessels to the fleet, and now Maersk Tankers will operate more than 170 vessels.  Maersk Drilling, Maersk FPSO, and Maersk Supply Services also had a good year with high activity levels in the offshore markets and generally attractive rate levels.  For the first &#x2013; if we just look to also how we've seen the beginning of 2009 then actually the declining oil price we have seen that that started to have a little bit negative effect on the tanker markets and has put some pressure on the rates.  But if we then look towards the offshore markets, we see a declining demand for some of our activities, but on the other hand we have to outline that the Group generally has good contract coverage for our drilling rigs, our semi-submersible rigs, floating production units and our supply vessels.  If we just look to SVITZER, then SVITZER had a profit excluding sales gains of $58 million and Maersk Drilling and Maersk FPSO had a profit of $171 million excluding sales gains and Maersk Supply Services had a very good year with $254 million excluding sales gains.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide where we look at the oil and gas activities. The Group's share of oil and gas production was 8% above that for 2007. It was positively impacted by higher production in Qatar that was up 38% and negatively impacted by lower production in Great Britain, which was down 25% and Algeria down 9%.  The oil production in Denmark was also down, but that was offset by higher gas sales.  The oil price on average &#x2013; Brent oil price on average for the year was $97 per barrel.  That was 35% above the price level for 2007, but it declined significantly during the second half of 2008 ending at $37 per barrel.  In third quarter, OPEC announced oil production cuts and these cuts will also affect our production in Qatar and Algeria.  If you look at the big development plan we have in Qatar, the project is on track time-wise and cost-wise, but in 2009 the Qatar production is subject to limitations by the authorities, and discussions with Qatar Petroleum on the future long-term production level are ongoing.</p>
          <p>If we look at the overall result for the oil and gas activities, that was significantly above 2007, primarily due to considerably higher oil prices and higher share of oil and gas production.  The taxes were also significantly higher as a consequence of the improved result and the net profit is negatively impacted by the impairment losses that I spoke about before of $197 million after tax, that relates to our U.K. concession rights and production facilities.  And during the year, we also had losses on hedge contracts of $0.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Regarding exploration, we have continued our extensive exploration program with a significant increase in exploration costs, and the number of drill exploration wells reached 17.  Lately, we have announced drilling results from the Buckskin Field in the Gulf of Mexico and from the Calzean and Hobby discoveries in the U.K.  We should please note that additional work will be needed to determine the extent and the commercial viability of these discoveries.  If we look to 2009, we expect a more or less unchanged production level compared with 2007, when we look at the A.P. M&#xF8;ller &#x2013; M&#xE6;rsk share thereof.  Please turn to next slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next slide, which is slide 12 shows the retail activities, I'll give you some data on the retail activities and which is of course Netto, F&#xF8;tex and Bilka; the latter two operating in Denmark and Netto operating in a number of countries around Denmark.  And if you look at the revenue, revenue is up by 3%, compared to 2007, considering we have opened 99 stores that is not a real underlying growth so to speak even if the stores we opened of course are smaller than average since we opened mainly Netto stores, and of course the Bilkas and F&#xF8;tex have more turnover per store, but a stagnating sales situation on a like-for-like basis.  The EBITDA for that reason and as a consequence of mix is &#x2013; I &#x2013; well, we actually know of course from our container business what we ship around the world, and as the decline in sales in retail today is to a high degree, things like electronics and textiles and home improvement items, the margin in general in retailing is lower, so our EBITDA is down 4% compared to last year.  And EBIT is down 90%.</p>
          <p>What really hits us in 2008 apart from this deterioration, which I believe compared to the market is quite normal is that we are hit on the financial items. We, Dansk Supermarked Group, which is owned together with Herman Salling foundations, two of them, have some investments in financial assets, which have lost significant value during the year, following the financial crisis.  So, the net profit is down 23% or approximately DKK450 million, after tax.</p>
          <p>The operating cash flow is also down in line with this.  And the investment cash flow is up, because we have &#x2013; we do invest in a new central warehouse as well as IT installations.  I think that covers more or less on the retail side, the business is &#x2013; relatively to the market, they are still doing well.  And Netto is the leading discount chain in Denmark, and is of course benefiting from say the more cost conscious behavior among consumers today.</p>
          <p>Going to the slide &#x2013; or slide 13, covering Shipyards and Danske Bank.  Here we see a significant decline in the net profit.  We &#x2013; looking at the &#x2013; Danske Bank is not included in the revenue by the way here.  This is making the shipyard.  But the net profit is down from DKK2.5 billion last year to 1.1 billion negative this year, and that is driven by lower profit from Danske Bank as well as an impairment of where we've written down the goodwill on our shareholding in Danske Bank.  The shipyard is doing slightly better than last year, but still negative, and there is no positive developments in sight for the shipyard.  The total result, the result of this segment is helped by gains of sell &#x2013; of sales of homes, or houses and buildings mainly in Munkebo, which is where the shipyard is located giving us a gain of approximately DKK300 million.</p>
          <p>And looking into 2009, also in this segment, we are of course not insiders into Danske Bank, but we have followed what they have been communicating and we do see that &#x2013; or do hope for an improvement in the results during this year.  What we know however is that following the packages that has been given to the Danish banking system that no dividends will be payable in 2009 and 2010, so cash flow wise the Danske Bank investment will not contribute during the coming year.</p>
          <p>So, please turn to the next slide, which covers our expectations, and what you see here on the slide is of course a direct printing of what we've said in our release and I'm not to going to elaborate on it.  But just going to just remind you and give you that we are a business, which is exposed to the global market environment to a very high degree.  If there is no global trade or global trade is declining, we are impacted directly.  And the present low oil prices or these lower oil prices are of course also impacting our bottom line directly.  So, we do expect a result, which is below last year.  We also find it difficult to envisage any big activity or significant activity on the buying and selling of assets this year.  We mainly sell assets when we don't need them for operations anymore.  But of course, we would need to find buyers willing to pay a fair price and that will we assume be difficult in the year to come.</p>
          <p>I am sure that there would be a general disappointment that we don't give a clearer guidance, and I apologize for that.  It's not due to lack of willingness, but we &#x2013; since we believe that with the uncertainties that we see in today's market, we simply do not feel that it's responsible for us to give a guess on that, which is more specific than the one we have given on the 2009 result.</p>
          <p>So, S&#xF8;ren will now give you some explanations to the sensitivities on page or slide 15.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, in line with previous years just to show what are the impact of some of the underlying factors that impact our profitability, we have shown our oil price sensitivity and outlined here that a $10 increase in the price for one barrel of crude oil is estimated to, everything else being equal, have a positive effect of around $370 million of our oil and gas activities, and that is without hedge effect.  And of course if the oil price goes the other way, it will have the opposite effect, again without hedge effects.</p>
          <p>Due to the current trading conditions in container shipping, we don't find it meaningful to provide an estimated effect from changes in bunker prices, and therefore also not changes in the crack.  And it has to do with the fact that the competitive environment in the container business is such that one cannot assume that the changes are automatically transferred to the costumers on the same percentages as we saw last year or the year before.</p>
          <p>The container shipping activities are highly sensitive to changes in average freight rates and volumes, and a 5% change in freight rates will have any effect of around $700 million, where as a 5% change in volume will have an effect of around 300 million based on current earnings table, and again everything else being equal.  That was the sensitivities, and I'll now hand over to Nils, who will present some of the focus areas for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as we usually do here at the beginning of the year, I would like to just give you a brief to what the most important areas of activity would be next year, or our focus areas will be, and just &#x2013; and I think it's fair to say that we closed 2008 with satisfaction.  We have progressed on the focus areas, we had last year. Qatar Oil continues to be well on schedule.  We have managed to establish APMT as an independent business, and we feel that we progressed well on that.</p>
          <p>One of the things that was &#x2013; other thing that was on top of the agenda last year is also on top of the agenda this year, and that is restoring Maersk Line competitiveness. For those who remember last year's statement, it was profitability, but competitiveness of course is more vague in the sense that we don't feel convinced that we can actually deliver profit in 2009.  What we'll focus on is making sure that we give outstanding service to our customers, trying to gain quality market share and making sure that we in terms of profitability perform better or upper quartile in &#x2013; compared to our competition.</p>
          <p>In terms of weathering the storm, that is that we're all facing at the moment, we have strong focus on reducing cost across the business.  Here we are not talking about panic reactions in relation to cutting a number of employees, but it's simply focusing on all cost items across the board, and we do see a significant potential here.  And on top of that, on parallel with that, we're working on preserving cash, which is very, very important.  We have announced earlier reductions in investments, but of course going forward we'll take a number of measures to make sure that we follow-up on this and continue to preserve our strong cash position.</p>
          <p>It's about driving performance, also not new compared to last year, and we feel we have progressed and we feel there is still room for improvement.  We'll also continue our focus on safety and environmental performance.  Last year, we started publishing our environmental report, and this year we'll join the UN Global Compact initiative, so we'll also here make sure that we don't take our eyes off that ball even in times of global trouble in terms of profitability.</p>
          <p>So that concludes our presentations.  Thank you for listening and we'll now handover back to the operator for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> While we're waiting for the first question. Let me remind you that the PowerPoint presentation is available for download on Maersk.com.  Lars Heindorff with ABG is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello.  Question regarding Qatar, if you can add some details about how the OPEC closes is going to impact production volumes.  I think you had an aim to reach a production volume of 525,000 by 2011.  And also perhaps a little bit on how the lower production volumes there apparently, if that's going to affect your CapEx and ramp-up in the Al Shaheen fields, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't expect the OPEC regulation or product cuts to directly impact our CapEx.  We'll continue with the CapEx program that has been agreed.  But it may impact of course the production we get from the field. If Qatar has a certain quota or quota reduction, that means that our field production could very well be impacted.  But we are in conversation with Qatar Petroleum on that and we'll see what comes out of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then secondly regarding your container operations, obviously you have had some restructuring costs on the streamLINE.  I don't know if you can quantify perhaps a little bit on what sort of impact, if any, streamLINE have had in 2008 and maybe sort of spillover impact going into 2009, assuming that the streamLINE program is now completed due to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the streamLINE program, which was actually a number of measures, but if you refer to the organizational change, we've spent approximately US$250 million on the restructuring activity.  And as a consequence of that and other improvement activities in Maersk Line, we've cut the number of employees by approximately 4,500 people.  That's happened during the year and of course it will have an impact into 2009 as well.  The big, we had a relatively big drop towards the end of the year, which was closing of the service center in China, which in terms of head count was very significant, of course in terms of cost, less so.  So the major part of reductions actually took place in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the last one, also regarding the container business.  You've early on stated that you wanted to focus more on yield rather than volumes.  It has been my impression, maybe wrong or right I don't know, that as of lately that maybe you have tilted to what's more volume rather than just focusing on the yield.  I don't know if you could add some sort of some details on how you view the market.  I mean, are you preferring one over the other or how are you going to look at the market in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our objective is to make sure we have a profitable business.  That means strengthening customer relationship, giving good services and getting a rate which is in line with the market.  We don't at the moment prioritize volume over yield, but we of course had to meet, which we may not always have done in the past, but we'll have to meet competition in terms of the rate we offer to the market.  We don't intend to be priced out by competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Finn Petersen with Nordea is now online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  Just one question to the oil price sensitivity.  Is that only for the oil production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That means there is no negative effect from Maersk Line in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and that's what I tried to explain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, then probably not clear enough about it.  What we have done this year, last year we gave sensitivity on the oil and gas production and then we gave separate sensitivity on Maersk Line sensitivity to changes in bunker prices.  What we have done this year is that we've actually given the sensitivity on our oil business, but due to the fact that the markets are so competitive for Maersk Line, we don't find it meaningful that we provide the net exposure, because we will probably be fooling everybody about how that effect will work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure if I got it more clear by that.  So, does that mean that the plus 570 is the cost on Maersk Line, no effect on BAF, and then the income from oil production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I am trying to say is that the sensitivity that is provided in the annual report is purely on the oil production.  The information we gave last year about sensitivity in Maersk Line, we have excluded this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you probably remember a couple of times over the year what we have said is that bunker adjustment factor, or BAF, was a very significant part of the whole rate structure.  And now coming into 2009, we are in a situation whereby the competitiveness in that market made it so complicated to actually split what you get in bunker adjustment and what you get in base rates.  But it's not that we are going away from the fact that we have bunker adjustment factors in our agreements with our customers, that is not changed.  But to do it for the business as a whole is not meaningful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Last question.  Qatar, as I understand there is roughly U.S. $1.5 billion left in investments, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had announced that we have invested around 4.4 billion until the end of 2008.  The investment plan runs well into 2010 and the investments are around $6 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we have to expect that these will come back in payment from Qatar through higher share production in '09 and '10, or sorry in '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not higher than we have today.  But it's very difficult based on a few facts to calculate what we get out of the Qatar agreement, so.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen.  I have three, if I take them one by one.  In page 83 or on page 83 of the annual report, you talk about the capital commitments of 64 billion or 66 if we included terminal obligations.  Can you give us some indication of the phasing of that 64 billion?  I understand the total is 4 to 5 years, but how much falls in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  The CapEx here is actually going over the next as we say four to five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, of course in a way that, you can say that the higher part of it is going to be in '09 and then declining over the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said in the introduction to the annual report, there is also going to be significant investments in 2009, but one must anticipate that they are going to be somewhat below 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.  And on page 45, annual report, you talk about, obviously the risk factors and you talk about liquidity in particular and that you like to retain a little liquidity for your future commitments.  Can you talk a bit, a little bit about your unutilized loan facilities because there is not very much detail in the actual note on the bank debt, what kind of facilities you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as we have outlined in our annual report, the way that we manage our liquidity, the combination of liquid funds, undrawn facilities and then the committed funding for the delivery of the different types of equipment we are getting over the coming years.  Then of course also our operating cash flow is going to be part of our future liquid part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And can you touch some numbers to how much of the 64 billion you already have committed facilities for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not disclosed that in the report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to make it clear, our commitment &#x2013; investment commitments are of course, our planned investments are of course over the period more than DKK64 billion that we are disclosing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And on the container side, how is the company managing capacity versus demand, demand is pretty volatile.  How do you take a view on that and what kind of utilization ratios are you currently operating at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a good question because the container industry has so far managed capacity assuming that demand would grow each year.  On average it's growing with 10%, so for the first time, for a long time we are in a situation where demand is actually falling, and we see quite a lot of additional capacity coming into the market.  That will give us a challenge as an industry over the coming years and we must live with the fact that there will be significant overcapacity at least for the coming, first coming years.</p>
          <p>And we are fortunately not directly impacted by this in '09 and '10.  We do have an order program for '11 and '12 of a number of ships, we've to get a few ships delivered.  But we have some flexibility on the time charter side.  So, we expect to be able to adjust the number of ships we use to our needs in a smooth fashion over the coming years.  That doesn't, however, eliminate the problem that there will be excess capacity in the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you can say for our own needs, the ships we need to service our customers and run our global network, that capacity, we feel we have very well under control, but of course pricing and competition may be difficult.  If you would ask about this very moment, we have a few ships laid up, and we also have too low utilization ratio.  I think that's normal when you had a couple of months with 20% drops in volumes.  And we'll have to see how we adjust to that, but we do of course expect markets to come back somewhat better than the 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clear, and the final one, and forgive me for playing devil's advocate.  If you look at the net debt at year-end, it's quite high, a lot of CapEx requirements very, very weak container market.  Why did the Company decide, or the Board decide as you say to pay 650 per share dividend.  We've seen a lot of companies cutting their dividend even though they've less debt than Maersk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've discussed that of course, but we had a good 2008 with very strong cash flows and we do not feel that the dividend we're paying and had been paying over the last years seen in relation to the value of the company has been excessive.  And we feel that given our cash flow situation, we can also sustain the dividend we're paying now.  So, we decided not to cut it.  Or to be correct the Board of Directors decided not to cut it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very clear. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Henrik Lund with Carnegie is online with the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all a question on the committed CapEx for 2009, is the seven to 8 billion a realistic target and have you done anything to postpone or cancel orders for vessels or port expansions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not commenting on the specific figure, but we did announce in the fall that we took a number of reductions in our investment plans, which included postponement or cancellations of ships as well as port expansions or new port projects.  And what we're looking at now is basically of course to implement the investments that we have committed to, as well as possible get them out in the market and making sure they make money.  Whether it will be necessary to work on postponing further vessel orders remains to be seen, but as I said to the question we've got from Morgan Stanley, that actually our own network we feel that the flow of ships we get is very balanced with the forecasted demand that we have.  So in isolation we don't see a lot of benefit in canceling or postponing ships.  We're of course enjoying that we don't get too much in 2009 and '10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A further question regarding Maersk Line's unit cost, we have seen a significant staff cut, we're also seeing other cost cutting measures.  We see that the fleet in the recent two months has been reduced by 11 vessels.  How big is your reduction in your unit cost going to be for this year.  Can you give us some color on that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's difficult or at least wrong to give an exact figure, but if you go through some of the different items, then it's clear that for instance bunker cost will go down and the way the world looks, there are also a number of other cost items that we will be looking at to see how they can be reduced.  But it's fair to say that with the drop in volumes, there is a risk that the lower utilization of vessels will have an opposite impact on unit costs.  So, I think it has to be split in two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we did reduce the manpower, the land based manpower in Maersk Line by approximately 13% last year, and that's of course giving a positive impact for us, depending on where the volume will end out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For now that's over Handelsbanken, could you may be explain a bit about the dynamics in the oil and gas production you are seeing for 2009.  Where you expect more or less freight volumes compared to 2008.  Where do you see production go up and where do you see production go down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do see an increase in Qatar, and we do see a reduction in the other mature fields.  So basically that will be the balance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we have disclosed before then the fields in Denmark are generally on a declining mode due to the maturity of the fields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then further in the oil and gas part, exploration cost, do you see them in 2009 at more or less the same level as in 2008 or how do you view that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect a reduction in exploration cost in 2009 in line with normal cost savings plus of course that now we'd be seeing lower prices for rigs and lower cost in the oil sector.  And also with the present oil prices, some projects will not be carried out.  But I can't quantify it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But as stated in the introduction to the annual report we will still have significant exploration activities in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, on the container side, you're seeing that some of your competitors laying up ship, laying ships idle.  Are you in the process of doing that now as well and how &#x2013; if so how much effect does it have of your total &#x2013; on your total capacity offering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do have some ships laid off already.  It's not a big part of our fleet; much less than some of our competitors, and we have seen a serious drop in volumes over the last months and if this continues then we will lay off additional ships.  We don't &#x2013; we do that unemotionally.  It's about having the optimal network to operate cost effective and fulfill the desires and/or needs of our customers.  So that's something that we will decide to do as we go along and it may change from one week to the next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then also on the container side, have you seen any reaction so far from clients on the rate restoration program you have introduced.  I mean with the scenario, with volumes coming down quite dramatically, and you are out saying you want higher rates.  Everybody can of course see your results, but looking in the past the situation, but has too much capacity in the market, the industry has never had much success in such a move.  Have you so far seen any client reactions to your ambitions on rate restoration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at our &#x2013; as such reaction from our customers side, I can't give you any sort of detailed feedback, but the picture is of course that customers want to have reliable long-term sustainable carriers.  But they also want low prices and that balance that we will have to take in and they will have to take, so it's surely going to be a tough negotiation to improve rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess the only measure you can take if clients do not oblige or are willing, so to say is to &#x2013; for you to adjust your capacity either through laying ship idle or returning time charter vessels, is that the way you view it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you're saying it as an industry that's the way you have to do, if you can't sustain your network or the service levels because you don't make any money then that's what you have to do, yes.  But I think it's not a place to speculate on things like that based on a few facts, this is of course very complicated thing to discuss.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, gentleman the majority of my question has already been answered, but nevertheless congratulation with a decent result in, anyway for 2008.  But in terms of A.P. M&#xF8;ller Terminals, last year you spoke about, in 2007 you spoke about startup cost affecting the terminals negative.  Was that amount larger or at same level in 2008?  And what should we expect in'09 and '10 since you are probably postponing capacity increases on some of your terminals around the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you the details here off hand, but the situation is that we have of course a number of terminals that are in operation.  They generate usually results, hopefully results we expected when we did them.  And then the number of new terminals, which as you can say start-ups usually during the construction phase of course and also normally during the run-in phase, will be loss making.  So as you say it will depend on the speed of the number of new terminals you have in the pipeline, how big that effect is.  I think it's realistic to assume that in percentage of the business that will be less and less as we have a growing number of hopefully very profitable terminals already in operation.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you.  And my final question and we spoke a lot about Qatar, but in terms of Algeria, there was something, there was an issue regarding a windfall tax in Algeria at some point in time.  Have you made provisions for that?  Because since the oil price has come down, I could suspect if you have made a provision.  Maybe you're going to make a referral in 2009 because oil prices are so low?</p>

          <p>Well, we simply pay the profit or the windfall profit tax, so we have no provision.  But we are in discussions with Sonatrach on how to understand the contract together with Anadarko, so we will see what comes out of that.  But there shouldn't be any negative effects from any sort of settlement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The Algerians basically withhold the oil that relates to the profit tax?</p>

          <p>Peter Testa with One Investment is online with the question.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you could help us better understand the dynamics of the discussion on Qatar in relation to the quota.  Particularly in relation to also understanding how with new investments coming on stream, how those would might be effected in terms of the timing of their start-up by the overall Qatari need to comply with OPEC requirements.  And then secondly related to that, if you are bringing on field, there is obviously a sort of cost associated with that, if volume doesn't come up to that, it would be a sensitivity on the profit side.  I was wondering if you might be able to help us understand the sensitivity of production volume within the oil and gas business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at Qatar first, you can say that as we have disclosed before, the agreement with the Qataris and on how the oil is split between them and us is confidential.  But it is basically measured in a way as I think is more or less publicly known that when you invest a lot you also get a higher share of the oil production.  But of course when OPEC is making cuts and restrictions, those cuts and restrictions are related to the production as such and not sort of the allocation between the different parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I understand that.  But you described your situation, it said it's still under discussion and I guess, I'm trying to understand the two factors. One is how big a variance is still under discussion?  Give us some sort of comments to understand this picture.  And the other is you have costs which may be say independent of the production, the cost that's coming up as fields come on.  And how significant an issue that might be depending on how volume, the volume out turn is finally decided?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just to cut a long story short, the pricing formula and the agreement between us and Qatar is confidential.  But the investment program as such will run its course.  And maybe a few holes will not drill, but basically we'll spend the cost that was assumed.  These are big offshore installations that are coming on stream, and they will be installed during 2009.  So, there is no way we plan to stop up or do things slower on the investment side.  Will a lower production impact us negatively in terms of profit?  Yes, but I can't give you any detail.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Can you give us any sort of understanding as to how &#x2013; when you talk about the ongoing discussions on the long-term production level, so how this translates to potential changes or variances in volume or how fixed your situation is known for 2009 or how much is still up in the air?</p>

          <p>Okay.  I think that covers all questions, at least we've no further in the queue.  So, thank you very much for calling in.  Thank you for very good questions and a good discussion.  And we look forward to seeing you after the first quarter where we sincerely hope that we can give you a more qualified forecast on what the year will bring.  At the moment, it all looks little bit unclear to us and probably to most business people at this stage of the year.  Wish you a good day.  Thank you.</p>
