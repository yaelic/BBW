          <p>Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Honeywell's Q4 2007 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question per caller. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Murray Grainger, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote, and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson.</p>
          <p>This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website, www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change. So we would ask that you interpret them in that light.</p>
          <p>This morning, we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year for 2007 as well as our expectations for the first quarter of 2008 and, of course, allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Murray, and good morning everyone. Well, it's another very nice day to be an investor or employee of Honeywell. We have had another quarter of strong results, closing out what's been just a terrific year of performance for us.</p>
          <p>And our results in 2007 reinforce three or four important themes for us as a company. The great positions that we have in good industries, the progress we're making on process improvement through our five initiatives, the talent and depth of our management team, and the power of "One Honeywell."</p>
          <p>Dave will take us through the details of the quarter in a moment. But let me say the momentum we're carrying into 2008 with our fourth quarter sales growth of 12%, earnings per share growth of 26% and free cash flow generation of $1.1 billion gives us great confidence in our outlook for the first quarter and the year despite an expected tougher economic environment.</p>
          <p>Our well diversified and balanced portfolio is really helping to drive the overall strong performance and for the full year 2007, we increased sales by 10% to 34.6 billion, increased EPS by 25% to 3.16, and we grew free cash flow by almost $700 million to 3.1 billion. And that was converting net income at an impressive rate of 129%.</p>
          <p>During the year, we also completed a total of 12 acquisitions for $1.2 billion further building our growth platform. And we closed two acquisitions in the fourth quarter, Hand Held Products and Maxon, both of which are great additions to our ACS portfolio and both integrations are well underway. Our acquisitions process really works incredibly well, it's disciplined, we don't overpay, and we integrate them very well.</p>
          <p>We also repurchased over 74 million shares for $4 billion and increased our dividend for the fourth consecutive year by 10%.</p>
          <p>Our key initiatives are gaining traction in our businesses and functions every day, and we have a lot of room here for even further improvement adding further upside. The Honeywell Operating System has now been initiated in 50% of our manufacturing cost base. And I want to point out that's initiated, not completed.</p>
          <p>We've really taken this slowly because, done right, it's a 20-year competitive advantage, and we want it done right. The immediate benefits in quality, delivery, safety, cost and inventory are certainly nice and we certainly want them. But the really big benefit here is a sustainable, repeatable platform for improvement.</p>
          <p>Functional Transformation is basically HOS for administrative functions. It's the same concepts, standard work, and a robust process designed to deliver better service at lower costs. We're only a third of the way through this, and that means more upside in FT.</p>
          <p>And finally, I just spent two days with our top 300 leaders, where we concentrated almost exclusively on our new products and services process. It's very clear that Velocity Product Development is playing a big role in our ability to deliver more and better products and services even faster.</p>
          <p>What we have done to date pales next to what is coming down the pipe, and I'm very excited about the contribution that new products will make to Honeywell's growth in the future.</p>
          <p>So in summary, great results for our 2007 and the momentum we're building on our key initiatives makes me feel very confident in our outlook for 2008, despite the signs of some slowing in the economy. And you can imagine given that we're looking very forward to keeping you updated through the year on our progress.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me now turn the call over to Dave to go through the financials in detail for the quarter. Dave?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks, Dave. And welcome to our call. We appreciate your engagement this morning. Let's go to slide number four, entitled "2007 Financial Summary." And as Dave mentioned, we had obviously just terrific results in the fourth quarter: sales up 12%, EPS growth of 26%, free cash flow was up 20%, which was just really good. 164% conversion, you can see, of net income in the quarter for cash flow.</p>
          <p>We saw growth across all of our regions, 60% of the growth in the quarter coming from outside the Americas. It really speaks to the balance of the portfolio and the balance of the geographic positioning that we've built.</p>
          <p>We closed in line with our guidance for below-the-line items, and we also took the opportunity to execute. We had $41 million of repositioning actions in the fourth quarter, bringing our total repositioning for the year to almost $200 million, 191 million in total and obviously, that's something we're really proud of because that just gives us more strength, more momentum for future periods.</p>
          <p>As Dave said, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares in the quarter, essentially keeping our share count flat, for the year, $4 billion to shareholders repurchasing 74.2 million shares.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for the quarter: 26.5%. Now, that was above last year's rate of 25.1 but in line with our expectations and for the year, by the way, the ETR of 26.4% compares to 25.8 last year and again, that 26.4 roughly in line with our target and our ongoing ETR guidance.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, a terrific year for Honeywell; another addition to the track record of performance that we've been building over the last five years.</p>
          <p>With that overview, let's go now to each of the segments starting with Aerospace on slide number five. Aerospace: strong finish, revenues up 11% in the fourth quarter; 2 points of benefit from acquisitions -- that would be the Dimensions International acquisition, so 9% organic; segment profit up 14%; and margins up 60 basis points to an impressive 18.8% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, commercial sales in Aero were up 12% in the quarter, again, with strong demand on both the OE and the aftermarket side. Commercial OE up 15%, driven by continuing strong demand, particularly in the business jet segment, which saw OE sales grow 31% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Commercial aftermarket sales were up 10%, with ATR up 8, roughly in line with higher global flying hours, which were up approximately 6%. And as you know, it's a pretty good proxy. You see some variation quarter to quarter, but that's a reasonable proxy for us in terms of the ATR aftermarket. BGA aftermarket sales were up a robust 15% in the quarter, driven by increased service and also spare parts revenues.</p>
          <p>Turning to Defense and Space. Sales were up 9%, driven by strength in surface, which would be primarily the TIGER program, where we're really continuing to benefit and see expansion as well as the contribution, as I mentioned earlier, from Dimensions International acquisition. By the way, we feel very good about that and off to a terrific start with that transaction.</p>
          <p>On the margin side, volume growth, price and productivity more than offset the inflation in the quarter and drove the 60 basis points of margin expansion for Aero. So in summary, another great quarter for Aero, capping a great year where sales grew 10% to 12.2 billion. Margin expanded 100 basis points to 18%.</p>
          <p>And in 2007, of course, we also saw the business solidify its leadership position in the industry, the win notably on the A350 extra-wide-body aircraft. We also saw just the continued pace of new technology and technology introductions; a prominent example being Synthetic Vision, which is gaining acceptance in the BGA marketplace, as you know, in the Gulfstream family of business jets.</p>
          <p>And we're going to continue to benefit from our focus and Rob's leadership team's focus on customer service. We've got that $1 billion plus aftermarket wins, and we're seeing the benefit of that in both Commercial and our Defense businesses, so again, another great year for Aero and continued momentum in Aero into 2008.</p>
          <p>ACS, on slide 6, sales were up an impressive 13% in the quarter, with positive growth across all regions and, by the way, it represents the 11th consecutive quarter for double-digit growth for ACS. Their products businesses continue to perform well. They were up 9% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We saw strength in ECC, the Environmental and Combustion Controls business. Security had a strong quarter, Life Safety had a strong quarter. These, of course, are driven by new products, strong execution, and the expansion into new markets, including emerging regions.</p>
          <p>Now, the Solutions business continued to experience very good growth. They were up 20% in the fourth quarter combined. They're benefiting from strong demand in emerging regions and obviously continued robust trends in the process industries, including the refining end market. Our order book in Solutions was up 30% in the fourth quarter, which gives us confidence in the continued strength and the outlook for this business through 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to margins. ACS segment profit was up 10%, which translated into a 20-basis-point decrease in margin to 12.4%. But to shed some light on that, some visibility on that, for the quarter, it really boils down to the margin headwinds related to mix. We had about 30 basis points impact as a result of mix in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Also, we had higher ERP spend in the quarter as a result of just some year-over-year increases in comparisons, and that also represented about 30 basis points impact on margin for the quarter. So, in total, about 60 basis points of margin impact. If you look at that and then what you see is really a conversion rate that's very much in line with what we'd expect given that revenue growth in ACS.</p>
          <p>So, for the year, ACS grew an impressive 13% to reach 12.5 billion. Margins increased 20 basis points to 11.3%, which is in line with our expectations. And innovation at ACS is really alive and well and really gaining traction. Dave spoke to that a little bit in terms of the recent forum, our recent senior leadership forum.</p>
          <p>To illustrate that in ACS, we had over 300 new products introduced in 2007. Our increased penetration -- that together with increased penetration in emerging regions, such as Asia and the Middle East, are driving growth across all our ACS businesses. And we continue to focus on successfully integrating recent acquisitions as well as looking for further accretive acquisition opportunities in this segment.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to slide seven, Transportation Systems. As you can see there, overall sales for the quarter for TS were up 11%, driven by a 17% increase at Turbo and a 3% increase at CPG. Now, the PV business of Turbo continues to perform particularly well with robust demand in Europe and Asia Pacific and also benefiting from increased diesel penetration. Diesel penetration, by the way, in Europe was 54% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our commercial turbo business continues to be down year-over-year, as anticipated. However, we're going to start seeing positive comparisons, as we've shared with you in our guidance call in December, we're going to start seeing positive comparison in that business, starting actually in the first quarter, this quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>Now, while sales for CPG were up 3% on a reported basis, the underlying volume was down in the quarter due to softness in the automotive market -- automotive component aftermarket. Segment profit for TS, up 6%, translating to a margin reduction of 60 basis points to 11%. And as you know, we continue to invest in new Turbo platform launches. That's foundation for us. Those are going to provide significant benefits to us and the business in the future.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, for TS in total, productivity and pricing gains were offset by these new product investments as well as material inflation and some of the continued challenges we've had within the CPG Business. Now, we expect sequential improvement in CPG in the first half of this year, and we expect positive comparisons to last year for CPG in the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>For the full year, TS sales were 5 billion, an increase of 9%. Segment margins were 11.6%, down 90 basis points from prior year, really the same themes that we had talked about previously.</p>
          <p>So while we had mixed results for Transportation Systems in 2007, we continue to see very attractive future growth for this business, with increased penetration of turbos worldwide and our significant win rate on new platforms, which, of course, reflects the technology and cost advantage position that we have in the marketplace. And of course, we'll continue to remain focused on improving the CPG performance over the course of 2008.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to slide number eight, Specialty Materials. Sales for SM in the quarter were up 14%. Segment profit increased an impressive 70%, driving a 350-basis-point improvement in segment margins to 10.8%. Clearly, UOP continues to experience strong demand for its proprietary technologies and refining and the petrochemical market conditions, those all remain favorable.</p>
          <p>The other SM businesses also grew in the quarter, lead by Resins and Chemicals, which was up 10%, driven by pricing and also continued strong demand globally for caprolactam. And as I mentioned, segment margins, the 350-basis-point improvement driven by favorable UOP volumes as well as productivity and price actions across the SM portfolio.</p>
          <p>For the year, Specialty Materials sales were up 5% to 4.9 billion. Margins increased 120 basis points to 13.5%. The business continues to benefit from strength, as you know, in refining and petrochemical cycles and again the tight supply demand relationship in key materials such as caprolactam where we're one of the world's, as you know, leading suppliers. We'll also, of course, continue to focus in SM on price and productivity initiatives across all the businesses.</p>
          <p>So with that review of the four business segments, let's go to slide nine and just revisit and update you in terms of our financial guidance for 2008. Now, as we communicated to you in December, we expect '08 to be another year of overachievement and outperformance for Honeywell.</p>
          <p>We're maintaining the guidance that we communicated previously. You can see the numbers on the page for revenues, segment profit, net income, EPS and free cash flow, all of which are consistent with what we've shared with you previously. Small change in the revenue percent change year-over-year, just given the stronger than anticipated finish to 2007.</p>
          <p>Now, looking below on the bottom part of the slide, obviously, these are the variables that we discussed with you that could influence plus or minus in terms of within that range that we've given you for 2008. However, on a net basis, the guidance, again, remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Let's -- it's worthwhile, though, to talk just quickly about these assumptions on the bottom of the page. Now, we anticipate economic growth could be at the lower end of the assumed range. We've previously communicated 1 to 2% for both the US and Europe. Now, as Dave said, particularly more in the headlines than anything we're really seeing in terms of our actual business performance, but we would expect that economic growth to be on the lower end of the range.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, while we're still finalizing the review of our foreign pension plans, the initial review of the pension assumptions for 2008 indicate we're going to be favorable in terms of the expense range we gave you earlier. We now expect pension expense for the year to be in the range of 30 to 50 million due to favorability in our US plans driven by the 2007 plan returns and also slightly higher discount rate than we had expected at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>With respect to the euro to dollar, we're obviously seeing the euro to dollar hover in that 1.45 range, as we communicated, we're using 1.4 as our base planning assumption and clearly if we sustain at the current levels that would represent upside &#x2013; top line upside and some bottom line upside to us in 2008.</p>
          <p>Regarding mix, we see no difference in the mix of our businesses today versus what we communicated to you in December and it's consistent again with the outlook and the guidance we've provided, and I would say the same for the assumptions around inflation and productivity that those assumptions remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, we feel we have a balanced plan for 08. We continue to demonstrate favorable growth. We're confident in our ability to execute this plan and to build on the track record that we're demonstrating.</p>
          <p>Let's talk now about the first quarter. Let's go to slide number 10, we expect total sales in the first quarter of about 8.7 billion, up around 8% versus 2007 and we expect EPS in the range of $0.80 to $0.83. That would be up 21 to 26% compared to the first quarter of 2007, and you can see the highlights for each of the businesses; Aero, we expect revenues up about -- to be around 3 billion, up about 6%, again, consistent with the themes that we've talked about and the performance that we've seen in '07 for Aero.</p>
          <p>ACS, we expect revenues of about 3.1 billion that represents an 11% increase over the same period for 2007. Now keeping in mind that we would expect the Solutions businesses to grow back faster than the Products businesses, given the order rate and the backlog that we have there.</p>
          <p>In TS, we anticipate revenues in the first quarter of about 1.3 billion, up about 8%. Similar really with the trends that we saw in the second half of 2007, and finally at Specialty Materials, anticipating revenues of about 1.3 billion, up 8% driven by growth across all our businesses with the anticipation that we're going to have a particularly strong quarter again in the first quarter in UOP.</p>
          <p>So with that summary of the quarter, let's now summarize before we go to Q&amp;A. Obviously, as Dave communicated, and as I took you through the details, we couldn't be more pleased with 2007, and particularly the finish that we had and the continued momentum that we see in the business, again against the backdrop, the acknowledged backdrop of a more difficult economic environment in '08.</p>
          <p>Again, we expect a strong start in the first quarter with revenues up 8%, EPS growth in the 21 to 26% range. We're committed, hopefully that comes through, to maintaining the performance track record we built over the last five years. We're confident in our ability to execute in 2008. We're planning again for a softening global economy and we expect spillover of that weakness in US residential credit markets, but we see our ability to continue to offset that by good execution and continued expansion both with innovation as well as our strength in our emerging regions.</p>
          <p>Now inflationary pressures, we expect to persist, but productivity and pricing initiatives across all of our businesses will continue we believe in '08 to offset that. We believe we've got achievable top line growth, and by the way, with the strong finish for 2007, if anything, that revenue growth in terms of expectation to guidance has moderated from what we've previously provided. We're going to be aggressively as always managing costs. We've got contingency plans in place that give us flexibility, should economic conditions prove to be either more positive or more negative so we have the ability to flex relative to achieving our goals.</p>
          <p>As Dave said, the HOS and FT initiatives are gaining traction. We're targeting more than 100 sites in HOS, more than 70% of our manufacturing costs to be undergoing HOS implementation by yearend '08. We also expect continued progress in functional costs. We expect those to be down another 30 to 40 basis points year-over-year at around 5.5% of sales in 2008, and by the way, just to put that in perspective that compares to 8% for that same group of costs, FT costs in 2004. We've focused on executing flawlessly in ERP in both the ACS and Aerospace and this is foundation for the future. This is investment for the future and we're going to maintain that through 2008.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we're very confident in our plans to deliver high teens EPS growth and 100% plus free cash flow conversion, despite potentially tougher conditions. So as a reminder, finally just to -- before turning it over to Murray and to you for Q&amp;A, we'll be hosting our Annual Investor Day in New York City on Monday, February 25, and we look forward to seeing all of you there and sharing more details about our business, our strategies, and our outlook for 2008.</p>
          <p>So with that, Murray, over to you for Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I want to start with Aerospace.  Are there just as you guys look at the world right now, are there going to be some financial implications from the 787 delay and if so is that factored into the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>John, not even, a, "Gee, nice quarter"?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You know the compliance rules but you said it for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter]. I don't know about the compliance rules, I thought it was just you, John.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 787 is not going to have much of an impact on us one way or the other whether it gets pushed out or pulled in we're in pretty good shape there.  So there is some spending that still needs to be done to complete everything because on some of the work we do, we can't get ours done until others do.  We can't work on it independently as you know.  But there's no impact to us really one way or the other. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  I would say, John, just as what we've discussed before, we've included to Dave's point we've included the spend, in our '08 outlook and our guidance for Aerospace and we can manage the plus and minus that we would reasonably anticipate within that budget level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But Dave, does the push out give you any kind of incremental mix benefit this year that helps the margins or not really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  Not really.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>It's really kind of interesting in Aerospace.  If they've got $830 million set aside for engineering, you will spend $830 million.  It may not be the same programs that you started off with but they will spend $830 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  I just wanted to touch on Dave Cote, your comments on the softening economy and obviously, we all know sort of what your mix of business looks like today.  The one thing that maybe stuck me was business jet and I think the OEs have been pretty positive on their outlook.  That said, I mean, it's been a very significant source of contribution to your Aerospace results.  Are you in any way thinking about that business perhaps any differently, if we go into a recession that perhaps you need to modify some of your cost structure in business jet or maybe just a little color on sort of how you're thinking about the outlook there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  First, we probably ought to be clear on the whole question of recession.  And I say question because so far, all we do is read about the possibility of it.  We don't really see it yet and you could argue that our businesses are not leading indicators so that we wouldn't see it right away, but I mean, we've been really reading about subprime and everything, all of the problems that was going to cause for about seven or eight months now.  And we've never really seen it.</p>
          <p>All that being said, you read enough about something and these things can be psychologically self-fulfilling, that it causes you to say, well, let's plan conservatively.  Let's plan our sales conservatively, let's plan our costs conservatively, whatever spending we were going to do, let's hold back until we're sure the sales are there.  You could argue that enough of us doing that ends up creating a recession but at the end of day, it's the prudent thing for a company to do.  So that's what we're doing.  Even though we don't see the signs yet, we prefer to just be prepared.</p>
          <p>In the event that it does unfold the way certainly the stuff you read says it's going to, biz jets are still going to do fine.  And one of the things that the biz jet manufacturers did a very good job of this time is when they saw a doubling in orders they didn't double capacity and instead they just stretched out the fulfillment time far out into the future.  Now you have to expect that if things got tough there would be some cancellations and I fully expect that there would be.  But at the end of the day, there the two fundamentals that still make this a very good industry for us.</p>
          <p>The first is that what used to be about a 65% US market five years ago is now more about 40% US market, 60% outside.  And all the guys who have placed orders for those jets still have a need for them and a desire for them.  The second big change and you saw what happened in our after market numbers in the quarter is that we've gone from an installed base five years ago of 5,000 to an install base today of 10,000.  That portends a very good after market future in biz jets.</p>
          <p>So I don't really see anything that would need to change there.  I'd say that probably would stand a chance of being less cyclical at this point given the changes in the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you guys are proportionally on the larger platforms, am I correct in that that would prospectively be less susceptible versus the smaller companies flying smaller planes that might be more inclined to cancel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  That's correct.  I mean, the people who have money to buy a $40 million jet when times are good generally still have money when &#x2013; have that same money when times get tougher, not all of them but most of them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave Anderson, could we explore a little bit again just kind of all the puts and takes that are going on in ACS?  Obviously, you've laid out your guidance for '08 there.  But just as we jump off of this Q4 into Q1, can you kind of baseline us on the ERP puts and takes and mix and you've got some acquisition integration going on and really what we should think about in the margins there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Well, we're going to continue as I said, Jeff, we saw in the quarter as I mentioned about 30 basis points impact of the roughly 2x revenue in Solutions growth rate, in Solutions, 20% up in Solutions, 9% up in Products, and that mix impact translated in terms of margin rate was about a 30 basis point headwind for ACS in the fourth quarter.  Now, we saw very robust orders as I mentioned for the Solutions business, both Solutions businesses, the Process and Building Solutions businesses in the fourth quarter, in the mid 20% on average.  And that's going to, coupled with the order rate over the course of 2007 is going to translate to headwind, margin headwind for the foreseeable future.  That's just going to be part of what we're going to see.</p>
          <p>We had a little bit of an anomaly on the ERP side in the fourth quarter where we had about a $10 million increase in spend versus prior year.  Run rate is essentially on track in terms of the ERP spend for ACS but there was an increase year-over-year and that impact is about 30 basis points as well.  So again, adjusted for that as I said in my comments, you really are looking at a pretty sort of normal conversion rate in terms of what we would expect in terms of margin expansion for ACS given the, if you will, the FX adjustment because we convert foreign currency at a lower rate, revenue to operating income than we do constant currency revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you didn't call that out, Dave, but how much did the currency effect hurt margins in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that I've got the percent points on that but you saw that currency reflected a significant part of the growth of ACS in the quarter.  We had FX impact in terms of revenues Jeff, of 6% of growth was related to foreign currency.  So if you think about converting at around 10% on a variable basis versus more like 20% for the rest of the business, you can see the dilutive, you can anticipate and do the math in terms of the dilutive impact of that.</p>
          <p>For 2008, just to kind of finalize then for 2008, we wouldn't anticipate that ERP is going to be significant in terms of year-over-year impact relative to 2007.  So and by the way, as Dave said and I think I pointed out in my comments, we've seen very effective acquisition integration.  The Enraf  acquisition, for example, this fourth quarter provided very, very nice results despite the acquisition accounting impacts.  So we look forward to a strong 2008 from ACS on all fronts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I just wonder, maybe Dave Cote, nice cash flow, I'll give you that for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, we got to take it easy here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter]. Well, is your lawyer sitting next to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure he's on the line. -- Obviously, it looks like you've got some real structural improvement in the cash generating capability of the company and I just wonder about your thoughts to build on it from here. What would be the most likely source of improvement? Would it be, is it in the factories, Dave, or is it further margin improvement that's going to give you profitability fall through off revenues, working capital? What are you most focused on from here to continue to drive cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's kind of a comprehensive answer because there's three things we really drive to make sure that the cash is there and as I've said many times both Dave and I have a high appreciation for cash and the freedom that that gives you and we like a good conversion rate. There's three things that the we look at, the first is high quality earnings because if you have high quality earnings, you tend to have high quality cash, and it's probably the biggest element. High quality earnings do a lot to generate good cash flow.</p>
          <p>The second item is controlling CapEx. Not controlling it to a point where you disinvest in your businesses, but I call it lining up for the CapEx buffet, which is what businesses seem to want to do and they will come up with an incredible amount of money that they would like to spend and interestingly, they will say, "The number that we're showing you, we've cut back," and then we cut it back further and then they don't even spend that much. So there's a real difference between what's really needed and needed to support growth versus what the overall desires are, and we try to maintain a reinvestment rate on depreciation of somewhere in that 1.05 to 11 -- 1.15 range.</p>
          <p>Third area, working capital and we really do drive the hell out of that one and it's in our  bonus plan, the incentive compensation plan as one of the metrics because not only is it a source of cash -- which makes a big difference. It could be a 200 or $300 million positive versus negative swing in the course of a year which is a big deal, but if you're going to reduce working capital and still do a great job with Customer Service, it means that the only way you make that happen is to do a much better job on your operating routines, and we spend a lot of time on whether it's just basic how do you make sure there are no customer disputes, how do you resolve customer disputes, how do you have a much better integration of the sales inventory and supplier chain.  All these things end up collectively making a big difference when it comes to cash so we'll keep pushing on all three, Jeff. There's no magic to it. It's really just a matter of really paying attention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if I could just sneak another quick one in for Dave Anderson. Dave, anything else on the below the line items relative to what you laid out in the guidance call, you gave us attention (38;15)? Anything else move around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really, Jeff. I think, the thing as I mentioned is really more of an '07 reference than '08, is we were particularly pleased to be able to deliver the kind of earnings growth that we did and to be able to fund, in a sense pre-fund the repositioning that we did for fourth quarter of this year and for full year this year. The numbers that we're looking at for next year in terms of repositioning as well as pension are all pretty much consistent with what we've given you. There is the opportunity given the favorability that we have in pension to also continue to look at, if things unfold as per plan to look at also repositioning opportunities in 2008 ahead of or above the $100 million kind of holding number that we have in there, placeholder that we have in there for repositioning for '08. So I wouldn't be surprised if we in fact fund more than $100 million in '08 of repositioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, it's one of the nice things about having high quality earnings and a strong cash flow, is it gives us that flexibility to be able to do that, because if you have the earnings, you can do it. If you don't, you can't.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Instead of saying good quarter, maybe we'll do it all in code and say lousy quarter, horrible year, poor performance. And today is opposite day or something. I don't know what to do, but lawyers have taken the fun out of the job.</p>
          <p>I've got a couple of follow on questions. When I look at TS and you think in terms of revenues being up 417 million, profits up just 9 million for the year and I know a big part of that revenue jump is currency, but how do you really -- I would call that somewhat disappointing. I mean, do you think in terms of how much of this is mix issue where you've gone from big turbo to smaller turbos for cars, how much is just investments you've had to make for new platforms, how much of it is just that things like Bendix is still broken, I mean, and how do you fix it? I mean, how do we look into 2008 and feel on a comfort level that you are not going to have a similar margin decline with revenues up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Scott, first of all, maybe the best way to say it is I think it's one of the advantages of having a strong multi-industry like Honeywell is that when a business has a lot of opportunity but is going to have to invest in order to do it. We're able to support that. So that's actually I think a good sign for us overall.</p>
          <p>When we look at what the cause was for '07 and why it gets better in '08 and beyond, there's two big drivers. The first is that we -- over the last two years, we won a lot of platforms. In fact, we won 2/3 of all worldwide orders for turbos, large, small, gas, diesel, 2/3 of everything worldwide. When you win all that, it's kind of like the dog who catches, finally catches the bus he's been chasing, that's what happened to us. So we've had to really spend the money to make sure that we have perfect launches here. We want to do a great job for our customers and we said that's a hit that we're willing to take, because as you get into the second half of '08 on into '09, '10, '11, '12, it looks marvelous. I mean, really good. That's the advantage of having a multi-industry is we're -- that's performing well on a number of fronts, is it gave us the flexibility and the money to be able to do that. That's the first one and that's all good.</p>
          <p>The second one is I'd have to say, we just didn't do a good job in CPG. We did not execute well. Fortunately, it's only about 3 or 4% of our total sales on a total company basis, but quite honestly, we just didn't do as good a job. It's a tougher market, that's true, but we didn't execute as well as we could. We've got new leadership in there. They're looking at things differently and as Dave pointed out we're pretty confident that you'll start to see improvements there in '08, so it's not going to go down. It's going to go up. So the big driver is that we're investing for the future and you'll start to see that future materialize the second half of this year and then the second one is -- the second issue is really one that's within our bailiwick to control. Dave, anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that covers it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and when you think about ACS and as you've mentioned certainly we've seen some weaker macro indicators, but you haven't seen it in your numbers and then you see your orders up 30%, it's really quite an amazing number. I mean, we've seen strength from other companies like Tyco in security and other firms who sell into environmental controls and these verticals. I mean, is there a sense out there amongst your sales force or leadership team that some of these energy efficiency themes and security themes that are out there are really having a huge impact and buffering the decline that we're seeing not only in resi but maybe some of the data in commercial is a little mixed too. How do you tangibly put your hands on that so you can plan for -- I mean if you're planning for a weaker environment yet maybe these businesses actually remain reasonably strong in 2008 so you need to plan for capacity as such? How does your Management team think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's interesting; those macro trends that you mentioned, first of all, have been there from the beginning and I think it does help. Although I wouldn't say that we're seeing in '08 something that's different than '07, in terms of the hype in that macro trend. I would say though that when you &#x2013; Roger Fradin is actually meeting with each of his business's sales forces this week. So they have their annual kick-off. They bring the entire worldwide sales force together, and I talked to him yesterday afternoon and I asked, what was the mood out there? What were the sales guys seeing? And to a person, they're all pretty bullish about what they see out there. They don't see any diminution in demand. They don't see all the stuff we're reading about in the papers. So far, they don't feel it, at least with the products and services we sell. Whether that's driven by those macro trends, the continued share gain, just good overall demand, I'm not sure, but certainly things feel -- things still feel fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly, on the currency, huge tailwind and I know you folks don't hedge and so it's an even better tailwind on the translation. Is there another impact that you're seeing with currency that your -- it's helping you get price out there or gain share above and beyond just the translation effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not so much. I mean, we could say, I'd have to take a look at how much our &#x2013; the export benefit might be but it's not that big a deal generally because we tend to manufacture and sell in the same location. So our costs and sales tend to be in the same currency and I'd say what you're seeing is really more of the translation benefit. Dave, anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe some net benefits to Aero, Dave. It's starting to impact, and we're seeing that in terms of just the pick up of interest activity, bid proposal activity outside the US. So, I think that is probably a net benefit for our Aero Business.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple questions on the comments you made around the initiatives. Dave, you made this point of a difference between initiating HOS and actually getting some progress on it. Can you talk about, where that is and when did this really start to stick and how early on are we in that process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we're in the second inning of a nine-inning Game. Scott (sic) [Shannon], when it comes to, how far we've gone and how much upside there still is available when you get to HOS, because HOS is not something that gets implemented and then you're done. Once you've got it implemented, that's really the beginning. The thing I really like about it and that a company like Toyota has done marvelously with, Shannon, is the idea of, you have it in, when you make an improvement, the improvement is permanent and too often in plants -- it's really interesting. You go around the world and you find people fixing the same thing that they fixed two or three years ago because of management change.</p>
          <p>So, the thing I like about HOS is when we, where we have implemented it, you don't see 2 and 3% improvements. You see 10, 15, 20% improvements, like a step change and that step change becomes permanent and that's very nice and you see that in the 50% of operations that we have put it into. But this is all upside for us for a long time to come and it's one of the things that I'm particularly encouraged about with HOS. Does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I mean, I guess it would seem that even in the 50%, you've rolled that out I mean, typically these things are to get it really optimized is a long, sort of never ending process, so it would seem that even in those 50, there's a lot more to do, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There absolutely is because like whenever you're trying to do something new, it's easy to do the announcements. It's much tougher to actually get the headset and cultural change that you need to sustain something like this. And we've paid a lot of attention to making sure that we get that right that we had a template that worked. We piloted this thing. I'd say we had three different waves of piloting, as we further refined and made sure how we understood how it worked. And I think, we've really got something here and it's going to last and the nice thing about it is the improvements will be -- we'll see those step change improvements coming in over the next three, four, five years, and then you've got that sustainable platform which just looks great for a long time. So, I'm really quite enthused about this one and what it can do for us.</p>

          <p>And Shannon, that 50% is just implementation phase. They aren't completed with HOS, so there's only a handful that are actually out of the process of implementation. So, there's a lot of room there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great and then one just Velocity Product Development, not something we've really talked a lot about. Can you -- you mentioned that all the launches of new products in ACS. Can you talk about how you're seeing that impact the businesses across the portfolio, and are you seeing it show up in share gain or a difference in your reputation with customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually, you see it on all the things you just talked about and in all the businesses. It's interesting that when -- from the point that you announce that you're going to have a new product and service focus to the point where you actually start to see it in sales, I would say is in the three to five year range and if you're talking about Aero, you could be 10 years before you see it, but that being said, you have to do it. It's an important thing to get going.</p>
          <p>We had a pretty empty pipeline, if you go back five or six years ago. And we've spent the time and the money to make sure we understood our markets and then had a very focused plan in every business to make it go forward and I would say ACS, I think it has done it particularly well, but each of the businesses has had this focus and has got something to show for it, and you do end up seeing it in the organic growth. That's one of the big drivers of organic growth over time, and if, once you get the pipeline going, it's easier to keep it sustained, because it's exciting for people to do. They are no longer victims, they are no longer bemoaning that they don't have the product to go to market, really becomes success breeds &#x2013; it's an area where success breeds success.</p>
          <p>So, you see it in every business and you see it not just in share gain, but you'll find them starting to come up with products that there really wasn't a market for before. And these guys are coming up with things that just didn't exist before. Nobody even realized they had a need. Once you develop it, they realize they do and you end up creating markets and of course then you have a 100% of that market. It's really quite clever and actually we're looking forward to talking about some of this on the 25th and going through some of it because it really is quite good.</p>

          <p>Your next question will be from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And just a couple things. A first a follow on the VPD development issues there's a couple of big Aerospace awards in the pipeline more on the A350 XWB and then Cessna with either avionics or engines on the new wide body they're coming up with. How do you think you'll stand on some of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have to get back to you on that one, Howard. The last thing I would ever do is forecast where we would come out on a bid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter]. And my guess is our customers wouldn't care for us doing that either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or can you kind of give us a sense of some of the additional Aerospace opportunities in a broader sense, Dave, of what you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'd say you'll probably more likely to see opportunity on the biz jet side. There's still a number of platforms that are being considered and thought about. And I'd say less so on the commercial side, the big commercial side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair, and then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I like you Howard, but I can't answer all of these questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, you set standards that are high and every year you want your businesses to improve. So I figured a little bit of pushback, isn't all bad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a sense of the split between process and the buildings solutions mix and what do you see in terms of the refinery demand going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think first, I don't think we disclose that split, but when it comes to refinery demand, we're still seeing that pretty strong for and I'd say very strong for a couple of reasons. The first is capacity utilization around the world is still pretty high, so there's still a need for overall refining capacity. The other reason is that there's a shift towards, it's not a huge shift but it's starting in small shifts make a big difference here, towards processing heavier crude. And not all refineries have the same capability there and they would all like it. So I'd say those two things -- and probably a third one, you might argue is the as there is a shift to more dieselization in economies like China, India and Europe. So you're starting to see the need for more diesel as opposed to gasoline. So, all of those things kind of push the demand for more and better refineries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last, in terms of markets outside the United States. I mean granted this seems to be a lot more focused. The concerns seem to be a lot more US focused. Could you touch on a little bit some of the emerging markets and what the feedback is there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Same thing. It's the same thing as I was saying before is that everybody reads the press and wonders, "Gee, is it going to get here?" but so far, if you look at what we define as our big emerging markets, India, China, and the Middle East and I know Middle East you might not think of that way but there's a lot of money there and a lot of construction. Everything still looks pretty fine. I can't say we've seen any slacking there, Dave, if you -- anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I would just say to that point when you look at the fourth quarter, it really continued that trend of what we've seen previously which is sort of the mid single-digits on the Americas and on a reported basis, obviously because of currency, stronger in EMEA but on a -- even on a currency adjusted basis, stronger than the Americas, and then very good growth in Asia-Pac. So Dave, to your point with Asia-Pac really for us, from a reporting standpoint, includes both China and India. So we continue to see very robust revenue growth in those markets.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Our last question will be from Nigel Coe, Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking me in there, that's great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. So Dave, I just want to pick up on your comments on repositioning. It sounds like the model is going to be upside from pension or FX or whatever else, first it goes on repositioning before raising EPS guidance. Is that a fair characterization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, this is Dave Anderson. I don't think so. I think when we think about our ability to fund acquisitions, if that's the question if I'm hearing you correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, repositioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's repositioning, I'm sorry, the ability to fund repositioning. It's really going to be dependent upon really two things. One is obviously the -- what we see in terms of the earnings performance as we actually get results and begin the year, our expectation is that we're looking at, as I mentioned earlier, a very strong first quarter of the year and we think that's going to give us the capacity to fund, continue to fund repositioning for 2008. And obviously the benefit of getting it out early means the sooner we can execute and accrue and get the actions underway, the earlier we get the benefit, the operating income benefit.</p>
          <p>So we'll just continue to operate under that mode and as I mentioned earlier the pension improvement does provide some capacity for some potential increase against previous guidance that we've given you in repositioning. But that's really subject to our actual business performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then when you look repositioning opportunities, where do you see the bulk of the opportunities? It looks like ACS has taken the bulk of the -- majority of the spend in 2007. Is that -- will that continue in 2008 within ACS? And what kind of payback do you see right now from the spend because I think we're seeing spending about $200 million in total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's about 200 million in total; you're right in terms of 2007, that there was a significant portion of that was ACS related. I think we'll see &#x2013; it's very much business specific and opportunity specific. So I would -- I think it's difficult to predict the mix that we might have in terms of repositioning for 2008.</p>
          <p>Payback as you know, the real focus for us is on managing our global census. A high percentage of what you see in terms of what we take for repositioning is related to census or census reduction. Therefore, there's pretty fast payback, very, very quick in the US, little longer obviously in Europe just given the nature of laws and regulations and work standards in Europe. But in general when you think about it in terms of being people anywhere between a year and a year and a half on average, is pretty reasonable in terms of what we're looking at in terms of operating income benefit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just one final quick one. It looks like UOP is going to have another strong quarter in 1Q '08. The US refiners are under a bit of margin pressure right now. I know the bulk of UOP is global rather than US, but are you seeing any change in behavior from the refiners? Are they differing in large projects? Are they bringing forward maintenance spend? Any break in behavior there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not the so far. They all still have that. They go back to the dynamics we've talked about earlier. Those are all still true, true for them also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nigel. Dave, any final comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We know the world is watching us this year to see if this performance that we've demonstrated for the last five years really is sustainable when times get tougher. In other words, is it for real? We've already committed to outperform our peers this year, with that 16 to 21% EPS growth rate in the guidance that we've already given. We will outperform and we're confident of our guidance and we're hopeful that that kind of outperformance in an economically more difficult year will finally convince everyone that we are for real. We have a great company and we're going to do well and we look forward to telling you about it all year. Thanks.</p>
