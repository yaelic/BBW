          <p>Well, good morning, everyone and welcome to Westpac's First Half 2012 Results. My name is Andrew Bowden and I'm Head of Investor Relations. Joining me to present the results today, of course, is Gail Kelly, our CEO; and Phil Coffey, our CFO.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, I'd like to pass it off to Gail, and we'll begin proceedings. Thanks, Gail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Andrew. And good morning, everyone. Very nice to have you here at our first half results. And I can see a few weary looking people; I know it's a very very busy time. So thank you all for being here with us today.</p>
          <p>Let me start out by just talking about the results as a whole and say that we would call these results sound results. Clearly, as we all know, it's been a very volatile period over the course of the past six months, a low growth arena over the course of the past six months, and also high competitive intensity particularly in retail deposits. So against that backdrop, we see these results as sound.</p>
          <p>Let me just go straight through to the results themselves. Cash earnings up 2% to just on $3.2 billion. And as you know, this is a story of two quarters. The first quarter was a softer quarter of $1.5 billion on the back of tougher markets-related income; and the second quarter stronger, closer to $1.7 billion. The line item that we do pay attention to, as you know, is that of core earnings, and we were very pleased to see that being up 4% over the half with revenue up 3% and our cost growth being up 1%.</p>
          <p>On impairment charges, there's a high impairment charge for the period, as you would have seen. But important to note that's against the backdrop of reducing stressed assets, so stressed assets about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:45) basis points over the period. So continuing stronger profile for our overall book. I mean, the biggest single factor is that we haven't had the same level of write-backs in this half that we had in the half &#x2013; at the full year and, of course, the first half last year. And you see that in the WIB results. I'll say a bit more about that later.</p>
          <p>On capital, our Tier 1 continues to increase, now up to 9.81% and it's absorbing the impacts of implementing the Basel 2.5 regime, which came into play on the 1 of January of this year. Of course, continuing to grow your capital has an impact on ROE and ROE is modestly down at 15.1%.</p>
          <p>Expense to income is an overall good story for us. On the back of really at least 18 months of very solid effort and focus on productivity and particularly over the last six months we've really put our shoulder to the wheel on productivity. Our dividend, up $0.02 on the $0.80 dividend that was declared at the full-year result, and I think really what that shows is the confidence that we have in the overall strength of our capital position.</p>
          <p>You'll remember that in November when I presented our full-year results I outlined a number of key priorities for the group and a number of metrics that we will be tracking both internally and externally as a way for you and for us to assess our progress. Now I'm pleased to say we've made really steady progress on all those metrics, some of course faster than others, and there's very complete and full disclosure in our investor discussion text on that.</p>
          <p>But this next slide picks up the more important of those metrics and actually is an important slide for us overall because it speaks to the inter-linkage between these elements of growth and return and productivity and strength, and really talks to how we've sought as a management team to manage and balance these elements, because clearly there's some trade-offs, as you well know, between these different elements. You can grow your strength by increasing your capital, of course it does have an impact on your ROE as you grow your capital base so there's a higher capital base on which to drive your return. So it has a balancing factor there.</p>
          <p>Another example would be, as you know, the group has systematically set about reducing our overall exposure to commercial properties, that has the effect of strengthening our balance sheet that we're really happy with. But, of course, it also has the effect of lower level of lending growth and, in the shorter run, lower level of returns. And then we all know that you can actually grow your retail deposits or grow your mortgages through aggressive pricing and it doesn't necessarily translate into sustainable returns. So there's a balancing act with those four elements. And my summary comment would be that I think the group has actually managed that balancing act reasonably well over the course of the past six months.</p>
          <p>So let me just say a few words about each one of those quadrants. On the growth side, we're really pleased that we've grown our deposits ahead of system, which is what we set out to do. Lending growth a little behind system, stronger for the full past 12 months, if you want to look at it from prior corresponding period to today, our deposit growth is up 11% and lending growth up 5%. The last half has been a bit softer, deposit growth up 3% and lending growth up 2%. But that's a classic example actually, particularly in mortgages, of actually standing back in the second quarter of this last half and not competing when there was a very high level of aggressive pricing and discounting that was actually taking place in the mortgage market.</p>
          <p>On Bank of Melbourne, we're very much on plan. It is still early days, of course. We're eight months into the new Bank of Melbourne launch, but on plan in terms of growth of new customer numbers. Our net new customer numbers are up 16,000 over that period. Very strong deposit growth, 16% deposit growth over the six months so far, and that's really effectively 4 times system in that area with a strong focus on main bank relationships, which is at the heart of what we're seeking to do there.</p>
          <p>On wealth, as you know, strategically such an important element of our overall business, we are number one in the platform space and we've grown market share there. We've grown market share by 1% from 20% to 21%, and captured a disproportionate share of the new flows on to platforms, so not only grown our net new flows, but actually others have had their flows fall away.</p>
          <p>And on the Institutional Bank, I mean, it's been a very important half for us, and pleased to see strong revenue growth there. We've had 11% revenue growth in the half and a lot of that is revenue growth in products or segments that require low level of balance sheet intensity. So it's great from an ROE point of view.</p>
          <p>On the return side, well, as we all know, the funding elements have been challenging over the course of the past half with the first quarter difficult to markets in Europe in particular, and wholesale markets either very expensive or difficult to access. And so we've seen increased pressure on funding costs. And against that backdrop, we really feel that we've managed the margin in quite a disciplined way. It's 6 basis points lower over the half, 5 basis points lower if you exclude the effects of treasury and markets income. As you'll see and Phil will point to a little later in his presentation, there's more of a marked impact on margin as we exit the half. So our exit margin is lower than the average margin for the half.</p>
          <p>The one of the new metrics we introduced when we reported at the end of the full year was this customer return of credit risk weighted assets, and we'll continue to report on that, that's up 5 basis points over the half to 4.12%. That's a good measure for us because it's capturing revenue out of our customer activity or across the entire group of our credit risk weighted assets, so we're looking at the efficiency of use of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>On productivity, as you know, a big focus for us within the Westpac Group, 41.1% cost-to-income ratio, it's 400 basis points lower than the average of our other three peers in this marketplace. Our revenue per average FTE or average employee, that's increased. That's a function of both the revenue uplift, but also that we've been managing our overall employee base. And that's on an average FTE down by 762 over the course of the past six months.</p>
          <p>SIPs, we're 60% of the way through. We've got very nice stable core banking systems now within Westpac and St.George. The focus over the past period has been more on the front-end systems. So implementing a teller system into the Westpac Group, the contact center systems, big focus on payments, and on online and mobile, which over time will translate into sales effectiveness, but also translate into simplified processes and a better customer experience.</p>
          <p>Strength, I think that's been a hallmark of the Westpac Group for some period of time and continues to be a hallmark and we've continued to focus on strengthening our position this half. I've spoken to capital being up, our funding profiles improved as well, but we know we've got more work to do there. So our deposits to loans, up to 63.2%. We're pleased that we funded all of our loan growth with deposits this half, but we're really in the midst of the cultural shift and change that's involved across our group in terms of driving a deposits culture.</p>
          <p>Having a look at each one of our business units and let me start with WIB, and really I'm very pleased with the WIB performance over the course of the past six months. I mean, we do have the lead institutional bank in Australia and I think that is something we're very proud of. Core earnings growth of 16% on the second half and, as I mentioned, that involves revenue growth being 11% up.</p>
          <p>If you look at the cash earnings, you can see it's pretty well flat second half to first half of 2012. And the major reason for that is we've had a more normal impairments half with a charge of $65 million this half whereas we had a credit in the half before and, indeed, the half before that as we had write-backs coming through in our institutional business. So a more normal position I think from a Institutional Bank point of view. Overall, of course as you know, stressed assets continued to improve and overall we have a book that is in excellent shape in the Institutional Bank.</p>
          <p>From a return point of view, all of the four major business units within our Institutional Bank have produced very well. So revenue up in all of them, be it debt markets, be it transactional banking, foreign exchange, and our Hastings Group, and particularly strong performance and focus in agri, natural resources, trade, particularly areas that we're focusing on. And many of those are balance sheet light too, which is good.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our biggest single division part of our AFS world, Westpac Retail and Business Bank, and this is an all-around sound performance. If you look at cash earnings, it's up 6% on the second half, the core earnings up 3%. If you take the full 12 months, cash earnings is up 14% and core earnings is up 8%. And really the key here has been the implementation of Westpac Local over the course of the past several years, quite material investment that we've actually put into this business.</p>
          <p>And so you can look at any one of the metrics, and you'll find it fully disclosed, that measures health of the franchise and you'll see that we're on an improving trajectory. And customers with four or more products, one of the things we track for depth of relationship is now up to 30%. One in five of our customers have our own wealth products, and that's a leading metric in the industry as a whole. Customer retention remains excellent. Affluent segment, for example, one of our key segments, we have a 99% customer retention in that segment. And we've grown our overall customer numbers and Westpac Retail and Business Bank by 65,000 over the course of the past six months.</p>
          <p>On productivity, really pleased to see there that revenues per FTE is up and we've &#x2013; number of initiatives within the branch network to drive simplified processes, and take paper out and free people up to have more face time with customers. And that's resulted in a lesser number of employees in that environment. And strength, it's a very strong balance sheet in that business and stressed assets improving.</p>
          <p>St.George, basically a softer half over this period. And so let me talk about the things that I'm happy with St.George and then the things that I'm not happy with and the things that we really need to focus on over the next period.</p>
          <p>In terms of what I'm happy with, we've had continued growth in customer numbers. In fact, all the way through from the beginning of the merger to today, our customer numbers have continued to grow and I think in this half they're up 45,000. So pleased with that.</p>
          <p>Very pleased with deposit growth in this franchise, 5% deposit growth in the last half and 12% deposit growth over the course of the past 12 months. Pleased with the wealth penetration. That's always been a difficult one within St.George and so it comes with a smaller base, but it's rapidly accelerating there and that's a real positive for us for the longer run in terms of depth of relationship.</p>
          <p>So lending growth is the area that I'm not pleased with. Lending growth is soft. It's only been 1% lending growth in the last six months and it's been 3% lending growth over the last 12 months. Now some reasons for that are because we've structurally repositioned the business and some reasons that we really haven't got the sales intensity and the sales processes and sales focus right in that business yet.</p>
          <p>In terms of the restructure, as you know, quite big impact to lending growth and revenue because we pulled the levers on reducing percentage of flow through brokers quite heavily some while ago. Two years ago it was about 50%-50%, broker to first party. It's now closer to 70% first party and 30% broker. That does have an impact on lending growth.</p>
          <p>And similarly on commercial property, as the group as a whole has got its exposure to a level that we're happy with, it's had a disproportionate impact on St.George because it's had a higher percentage of commercial property as a proportion of its business book, and that too in the short run has an impact on lending, on balances, and indeed in revenue. I'm pleased to say those repositionings I think are largely done and it's a great time for George to be stepping into our St.George business, because he'll bring the sales intensity and sales focus and credit skills capability that is brought into the St.George into the New Zealand business that I'll refer to in a moment.</p>
          <p>On strengths, maybe before &#x2013; I'll talk on strengths. On strengths in terms of impairments, impairments are up in St.George, but it's not something that's troubling us because it's largely driven by model change, a provisioning model change in our consumer book, it's a sector change effectively. Overall stressed assets continue to improve. Bank of Melbourne, I think I've touched on, happy to take any questions on that further in.</p>
          <p>BT, now this is the most difficult story to tell actually in this particular results. And when I was chatting to Brad &#x2013; where are you Brad? When I was chatting to Brad about these results, Brad said to me, he said, I'm not happy with this result, but I can't say that I'm unhappy either. And perhaps that's a good sort of summary. I mean, we're not happy because our cash earnings is down 14% on prior corresponding period, which is the best way to think about BT because of the seasonality in our BT business, seasonality and insurance and floods and so on and seasonality in terms of fund flows. So 14% down on cash earnings in terms of that.</p>
          <p>So reasons for that, well, markets are softer as you know that accounted for $40 million. Equities, our revenue performance is softer in equities as our margin lending balances have come down materially. They're down to something like $2.7 billion now from their peak at over $8 billion. So it just tells you something about deleveraging and risk aversion in our marketplace. We've de-risked our LMI a little more, Phil will talk to that perhaps, but we know three years ago we took the decision not to take on-board ourselves the risk profile of mortgages with an LVR greater than 90% in our own underwriting, and so we passed that on to reinsurers. And we had some one-offs last year that just haven't been repeated this year. So that's why cash earnings is down, but perhaps it's more down than you would have expected in your models.</p>
          <p>Why are we happy though that the underlying momentum is just excellent? I've touched on the funds flows in our platform business, so market share gain of 1% and indeed margin 1 basis point up in our platforms business. Our productivity per advisor is actually industry sector leading and we've grown our number of advisors by 8% over the period. Our Super for Life has now got to $2 billion. We've got 300,000 customers in Super for Life. And the cross-sell activities that I've referenced are really going from strength to strength. So really happy with the underlying performance. We've grown in market share in insurance as well, our general insurance.</p>
          <p>Westpac New Zealand, I won't dwell on this too much, I mean it is an all-round strong performance. If you look at our performance, on second half cash earnings is up, I think it's 14%; and if you look at the full year, the 12 months, is up 24%. We achieved at or above system growth in all of the key categories, although of course system growth was very, very modest. We've grown our margin or improved our margin within New Zealand. I mean, George's strategy has been a Westpac Local-light, if I can call it that, in New Zealand focusing very much on main bank relationships in retail. And so you'll see in our disclosures, his customers with four or more products is actually up to 49%, which suggests you've got a way to go.</p>
          <p>In the commercial side, he's actually focused very heavily on the credit skill side and the relationship sales side, relationship management side, and also getting the asset quality to have the healthy position that it is now. So three years, a real turnaround in our New Zealand business and Peter Clare's there now and he's really stepped into the chair and full steam ahead.</p>
          <p>On balance sheet or strength overall, I've mentioned capital, the effects of Basel 2.5 of 37 basis points, that's really effectively carrying more capital for market risk in our portfolio. If you look at it on a Basel III harmonized basis, we're actually sector leading at 10.3%. So we're really happy with that overall position.</p>
          <p>Liquid assets, strong composition and at the right level, pretty consistent with end of the year, A$101 billion. Stressed assets, as I've indicated, steadily coming down. And customer deposits to loans, I mean this is of the biggest work in progress, increasing pleasingly to 63.2%. We know we've got more work to do there and it is a major area of focus for us.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me stop and hand over to Phil, who is in his wheelchair here as some of you may have noticed. Phil had an unfortunate slip or fall. Maybe Phil will give you more detail later.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me. So I'll hand over to Phil and I'll come back and just talk a little bit about the outlook and how are we positioned for that. Thanks, Phil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Gail. And good morning, everyone, and apologies for sitting down on the job. I have quite a bit of a bum knee. Look, as always, there are a number of components that are worth expanding on, and I'd like to start with core earnings, I know Gail's mentioned it, but we have been saying for a while when people asked us questions about what's your strategy on jaws or your target for jaws, we said, look our target is actually to grow core earnings.</p>
          <p>And so when I look at what we've achieved in terms of 5% growth in core earnings over 12 months and 4% in particular over the last half, that's a good outcome and is particularly a good outcome when you think that we're dealing with a low credit growth environment, a period of really high volatility and a very competitive environment.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, we've been absorbing additional costs that come with repositioning the firm for the new regulatory environment and effectively new risk management requirements that the company and the industry is carrying. So quite frankly, 4% growth in core earnings over six months is an outcome I'd take most days of the week.</p>
          <p>Growth in the half and you can see that from what Gail said in the chart that's on your slide, was supported by both revenue expansion and cost containment. And it was a good quality result with markets and treasury only contributing 1% to the revenue growth in the half and they were little changed from one year earlier. You can see from the bottom section of the slide the composition of that core earnings growth and how it reflected the portfolio of businesses that make up the group, and Gail's called out that not everywhere <mark type="ph" /> fine (20:33) as we would have liked, but the total overall was good.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet growth in the half reflected both the modest loan growth environment that we're operating in in terms of the system, but also the strategies of the group. Housing lending in Australia continue to be the fastest growing segment, and that was mirrored in our book. We had 2% growth in Australian mortgages in the half and 5% over the 12 months. We continued to emphasize our first-party distribution, which grew strongly in the half.</p>
          <p>And you can see the differential between our proprietary sales growth in our &#x2013; versus our broking sales growth on the slide. The Bank of Melbourne and RAMS brands in particular had really strong growth rates, and that's because of the focus that they've got on the first-party sales. We will, I think, expect to see that mixture continue in terms of stronger first-party sales with broker originated lending somewhat slower.</p>
          <p>Business lending remained relatively subdued for us, although we are seeing quite a distinct switch with customers increasingly using WIB's debt underwriting and distribution to access capital markets, while we are seeing customers right across our broad spectrum increasing the demand for trade finance, especially for trans-Asia flows. The major callout on deposits has been our focus on customer term deposits, and this had an impact on margins and I'll talk about that later. But the quality of the growth has been very good.</p>
          <p>Lastly, let me just make a comment and draw your attention to the creation of the AFS division. It's allowing us to become even more targeted in our approach by segments and regions and with specific brand strategies. So increasingly the success of those strategies need to be assessed in terms of the aggregate growth margin outcome in AFS rather than the outcomes that you might see in individual brands.</p>
          <p>The funding quality of the balance sheet improved over the half. Growth in the stable sources of customer deposits and new long-term issuance funded new lending, it funded the maturities of term debt and a reduction in short-term wholesale borrowings. Overseas short-term borrowings were down A$6 billion in the half.</p>
          <p>The half was also notable for the inaugural issue of covered bonds from Westpac in both Australia and New Zealand. And these securities performed as we had expected. They captured investor interest at a time of severe risk aversion and when unsecured paper could not be issued. And that was one of the key criteria that we emphasized as to why there's such a valuable instrument to have in our armory. And the diversity of the investor base, I think was highlighted by the fact that we did issues into Australia, into the U.S., into euro markets, into Switzerland and into Norway.</p>
          <p>The covered bonds will tend to be issued at a lower cost than other term borrowings, but our future issuance will also be governed by local <mark type="ph" /> TEPs (23:53) as we have a goal to maintain capacity for future potential stress scenarios both for our Australian and our New Zealand programs. We have surplus capacity of around A$30 billion across the group.</p>
          <p>The half also saw a reversal of the FX impacts that were seen in the previous half. As the A-dollar recovered, collateral balances shrank and some of our shortest term liquid assets declined. But despite these shifts, liquid assets were maintained at over A$100 billion.</p>
          <p>A key theme for the reporting season has been the pressure on margins, and Gail touched on that. For Westpac, excluding Markets and Treasury, margins declined 5 basis points in the half. And the source of that pressure can be traced back to three elements: the composition of the balance sheet, the competitive intensity that we saw especially for deposits, and the improved quality of the balance sheet. The biggest pressure for us came from our deposit book where the cost of new deposit funding and the mix impact of holding more term deposits pushed margins 9 basis points lower in the half. Asset repricing offset much of that.</p>
          <p>The cost of the new wholesale borrowing that we did in the half has had little impact on margins because most of that borrowing was sourced later in the half in February and March. And so we will see those costs more as we move into the second half.</p>
          <p>What we did experience in the half was the impact of holding higher levels of funded liquid assets. We obviously build a stronger funding base from doing that, but it came at a cost of 3 basis points on margins. Most of the higher liquid assets were purchased toward the latter months of the last financial year or the previous financial year. And so the margin impact emerged fully in the half that's just gone. We're seeing growing cost of funds pressures throughout the period. And the underlying margin at the end of the period was another 5 basis points lower than the average that you saw in the half.</p>
          <p>We saw some pretty extreme market volatility between August 2011 and late January 2012, and that clearly impacted the short-term results in WIB Markets and in Treasury. And as as aside, it highlights the downside of quarterly reporting. As the dust settled in February and March, what became clear was the strength of our franchise with customer revenue in markets 13% higher over the prior half and 16% up on a year earlier. And the overall Markets result was also significantly higher, notwithstanding a sizable drag from CVA valuations, which we expect to reverse over time. And the slide shows you what the CVA has been over the last three halves.</p>
          <p>Our Treasury performance was particularly impacted by market volatility through the period, especially on the revaluation of our managed liquid asset holdings, and we talked about that at the quarterly update. I'm pleased with the way our team was not distracted by those short-term valuation issues and, in fact, over the half we continued to generate very valuable revenue and a very valuable return from the management of the liquids portfolio.</p>
          <p>The other area of the P&amp;L which experienced some short-term volatility was the expense line, and that's because the timing of restructuring expenses and project expenses tend to give unhelpful quarterly noise. When looked at over the half and the full year, I think the underlying trends are more apparent. And you can see that expense growth in the latest half was up 1% and expenses are up 4% on a year earlier.</p>
          <p>You can see that for the half that the focus on productivity over recent periods is delivering benefits with just over $100 million in savings, almost fully offsetting the uplift in normal expense increases that we see particularly from wage and salary increases that take place in January. We continued to invest in additional capabilities, and you can see that in the Bank of Melbourne expenses and in J O Hambro, which were two areas that continued to see that over the last six months.</p>
          <p>Project expenses and associated amortization were actually a little lower over the half and that mainly reflected the completion of a number of projects early in the half. Higher project expenses, including SIPs amortization, will be more pronounced in the second half and in 2013.</p>
          <p>A feature &#x2013; and you can see that also in terms of the impact on expenses from projects, a feature of the project expenses has been the pick-up in compliance costs and we seem to have had an ever increasing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:03) agenda. What we've been looking to do is to build capacity to efficiently deal with what's a really large analytical and data and reporting requirement, and to do that in a way where we can leverage one compliance project and what we're doing there with what we have to report under another. The net impact of these changes has been a further improvement in the cost to income ratio, which Gail called out, to 41.1%, which remains a considerable margin better than our peers.</p>
          <p>Looking at our productivity program, I think the key points to take away from this are that the major progress we have achieved over the half and that there are significant efficiency gains in the pipeline. The slide gives you a bit more detail about our productivity focus. And in particular, I want to call out that it's focused around reorienting our resources given that we are seeing lower growth in some of our more traditional banking markets and making the group more dynamic and responsive to future opportunities.</p>
          <p>One consequence of that focus has been a moderately smaller workforce, and over the half our employee numbers reduced by 762. There was a further 543 reduction from reclassifying contractors that are actually employed by a supplier, but happen to have been working for Westpac.</p>
          <p>Over the half, we also made good progress in designing and beginning to change the processes by which some of our IT and operations activities will be delivered by external supplies. And we indicated in our first quarter update that the establishment costs of that program would total up to A$200 million, and in the first half A$133 million was expensed. As previously indicated, this item is treated as a cash earnings adjustment.</p>
          <p>When we look at where the productivity savings have originated this half, most of it comes from programs that we commenced 12 months ago. I think that highlights that if you're going to get sustainable efficiency improvements, they do take some time to plan and execute. Many of those changes, and the more recent ones around our new operating structure, were only implemented in the early months of this calendar year. And so the impact on productivity has been modest in the half. And as a result, you should expect further gains to flow through into the second half and into 2013 where the benefit of our supplier program also kicks in.</p>
          <p>Impairment charges for the half at A$608 million were equivalent to 24 basis points of gross loans, and that's up from a low point of 19 basis points that we saw a year earlier. The increase over the past six months can be traced to two key items. The first half of 2012 recorded a smaller benefit from collective provisions no longer required because the improvement in the overall health of the portfolio was slower, and this added A$220 million to the charge. And secondly, the benefit of write-backs and recoveries was A$40 million &#x2013; was also A$40 million lower. Offsetting that, we required a smaller amount of new individual provisions and we had fewer direct write-offs.</p>
          <p>So compared with the first half of 2011, of course, there was also another item which was that in the first half of 2011 we had a A$106 million release of the economic overlay and that wasn't repeated in the half just gone.</p>
          <p>The key point I want to highlight, and we will talk about it in a sec, is that while asset quality improved over the half, the rate of improvement has slowed, and that was the key contributor to the higher charge in the half. And the change is probably most dramatically seen in the Institutional Bank, where the swing between the halves was A$143 million.</p>
          <p>The group maintained conservative provision coverage, with individual provisions at 38% of impaired assets and collective provisions at 1.22% of credit risk weighted assets. And those levels are little changed over the half and the impaired provision's up a little bit, collective is down a little bit. Overall, there's very little change, and those ratios remain at the top of the sector.</p>
          <p>And you can see the pace of credit improvement in this slide, this one we've been using for a while, where the ratio of stressed assets to total committed exposures reduced in the half. It's down to 2.26%. So it was down 22 basis points in the half, but have followed improvements of 37 and 35 basis points in each of the two previous halves.</p>
          <p>Much of the recent improvement was in the watchlist and substandard categories, and more customers are returning to adequate financial health and there were some that slipped into impaired assets. But the gross level of impaired assets was also lower. And importantly, new and increased impaired assets were down, down 21% in the half.</p>
          <p>In terms of specific industry stress, the areas showing deterioration are those closest to that cautious consumer that we're seeing and those negatively impacted by the high Australian dollar. And you can see that at the top of the slide where the wholesale and retail trade and services sectors are the areas where we had seen some modest deterioration.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding some deterioration in South East Queensland property, our overall commercial property exposure showed reduced financial stress, with total property stress down to 9.7% of TCE, and that's down from a peak of 15.5% at the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>We have 11% of our commercial property book exposed to Queensland. And while that has been the region experiencing more stress, we've been on top of that portfolio for some time and it's not throwing up any major surprises.</p>
          <p>A real feature of the current environment has been the cautious consumer and their desire, as Gail said, to reduce gearing, increase their cash resources, and to reduce risk. And we can see that in many elements of their behavior from repayments to deposit growth and in the flows of new money on to wealth platforms.</p>
          <p>Mortgage offset growth is one example, and it's been particularly high for the last 18 months. The management of credit card balances is another good indicator, and we're seeing the average payment to balance ratio back to the levels that we saw at the height of the <mark type="ph" /> JHC (35:57).</p>
          <p>Now these trends are not all bad because they're helping the quality of their consumer books, and you can see this in mortgage delinquencies with greater than 90-day delinquencies in Australia at 54 basis points, up only 1 basis point in the half. And we're particularly pleased with that result given seasonally we would expect some pick-up in delinquencies following the Christmas period and summer months, and also given the flow of new business is very low compared to the much stronger vintages of 2007, 2008 and 2009 where delinquencies are tracking high through time, but to an expected pattern.</p>
          <p>We've highlighted the strength of our balance sheet and this slide highlights two of the aspects of our capital ratios that highlight the strength of the capital base. If you look at the left-hand side of the slide, over the half we absorbed the impact of the introduction of the Basel 2.5 measures, which very materially increased the risk weighting measure for our market risk and reduced our common equity and Tier 1 ratios by 37 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now we, also in the half, rolled out higher operational risk factors, and that impacted the operational risk weighted asset and that reduced capital ratios by a further 13 basis points. Notwithstanding those sort of the measurement changes and, if you like, methodology changes, the reality is our core equity ratio remained close to 8%. We also issued in the half $1.2 billion of new hybrid securities and that helped lift the Tier 1 ratio by 39 basis points and we ended the half at 9.81%.</p>
          <p>The second lens is our effective capital ratio under a full Basel III framework and that will be in operation from January 2013. As at the end of the first half, our reported common equity ratio under an APRA Basel III methodology would have been 7.7%, and that's clearly comfortably above the minimum, including the capital conservation buffer, which will only come into operation a few years down the track.</p>
          <p>APRA have confirmed that they will proceed with a number of more conservative calculations. And if we used a fully aligned Basel III methodology, our common equity ratio would have been 10.3%, and that's materially higher than our local peers and a very strong position by global standards. And so it's that strong capital position and the growth in the business that supported the $0.02 uplift in the cash dividend to $0.82. And that continued the steady increase in dividends per share that we've been targeting for many years now.</p>
          <p>Before summing up, I think it's clear from these half year results that there are really inadequacies in quarterly reporting, short term and more volatile elements risk being more misleading than helpful, and as a result we have no plans to conduct a third quarter financial update. We will, of course, continue to focus on keeping the market fully informed of our business.</p>
          <p>Looking forward over the next six to 12 months, our financial results are likely to reflect a number of recurring themes. Balance sheet growth is likely to see lending growth reflect the targeting of select segments and distribution channels, and our deposit growth will at least fund new lending.</p>
          <p>The margin impact will likely, once again, reflect the trade-off between higher funding costs and asset repricing. And over the next half, we have got wholesale borrowing costs rising because of what we've already done. And we will be dealing with what the deposit impacts are and I think that will often &#x2013; that will really be dependent on what the competitive environment is, which at this point shows no sign in letting up.</p>
          <p>With a number of unusual items behind them, I would certainly hope that our BT results show a good rebound, although the health of equity markets in particular will influence the extent of that improvement. And with Markets and Treasury, we'll also need to continue to navigate the challenges and the opportunities that come to them every half as a consequence of what happens in market.</p>
          <p>I've previously mentioned the &#x2013; some of the drivers for the upcoming expense growth where our productivity agenda is designed to offset the costs of investment, including the rising amortization expenses. So core earnings will continue to be our focus and core earnings growth in particular.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet's strength is a highlight and a key focus for the group, whether it'd be funding mix, liquid assets, credit health, and provisioning cover or capital base, and you should expect that focus to continue. The last half reflects a disciplined performance that has broadly played out as we had previously indicated to you. In the second half, you can be sure that we will maintain that discipline.</p>
          <p>On that note, let me hand back to Gail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil. And what I'll do is just two quick slides. First, really have a look at the operating environments, and then a second slide that really looks at how we are dealing through that and how we're positioning ourselves for that.</p>
          <p>So no surprises with regard to the operating environment; we fully expect it to remain challenging and remain volatile. I think our central point is we are dealing with structural change here; structural change globally, structural change within Australia, structural change within the banking sectors, and from our point of view absolutely critical that as an organization we deal very hard and fast to that structural change.</p>
          <p>A couple of the elements on global. Well, with Europe, we'd certainly expect to be looking to the next decade to have the sorts of volatilities and challenges and lower growth environment to continue. But one of the big elements of structural change in the global economy, which has been accelerated and accentuated through the global financial crisis, has been the shift in economic weight and power from developed economies to developing economies, and obviously in particular Asia being key there.</p>
          <p>Now this is, of course, good for Australia because of our geographic links to Asia, our trade links to Asia. And overall, our domestic economy does remain sound, the economic fundamentals are strong; low unemployment, low government debt, and controlled inflation. Having said that that sort of an overall level, we all know that we're dealing with a very much a multi-speed economy and structural change that's underway here with a high Australian dollar, and consumers that are deleveraging and consumers that are cautious and confidence that is being particularly low. And so that really is requiring businesses and organizations to think about how to deal to the structural change.</p>
          <p>And financial services is one of those sectors that's dealing with structural change. Regulatory change, high capital, high level of liquidity, high level of funding, more term funding, more balancing, the maturity profile of our funding with the lending that we do, high levels of focus on regulatory, oversights and compliance, all of those are big changes that we have to deal to, a lower growth environment we expect for some period to come as customers in our view will continue to want to deleverage.</p>
          <p>There's no doubt that different sectors in the world have different deleveraging issues, and there's certain economies where governments are having to deleverage very fast. There are economies where banks are having to deleverage very fast. In our economy, it's household consumers that are needing to deleverage, having really geared themselves up prior to the global financial crisis at a very high level of household debt relative to GDP.</p>
          <p>So this is an orderly restructure, so that's the good news, but customers have been busy over the last few years seeking to repay debt, get their own balance sheets in order and preferring to save. And I think that trend still has a way to go through. So for financial services, we expect a lower growth environment; and competitive intensity, especially for deposits, because we all are working towards a scenario where we improve and strengthen the profile of funding in our businesses.</p>
          <p>So how are we dealing to that? Well, first and foremost, of course, you think about the inherent strengths that you have, the inherent position that you have, and I think we do have a very strong profile and position going into this set of changes.</p>
          <p>Top of the list there, we are the lead institutional bank in Australia. We are rated number one within Australia; have outstanding depth of relationships with corporate and institutional customers within Australia and have really helped them deal with the structural changes they are going through and the volatilities in their own businesses that they have had to contend with, and increasingly, as they're doing more business in Asia, able to support them there as well.</p>
          <p>Deep relationships, if there's one thing I'd mention about Westpac, if you ask me to just describe Westpac in one word, the word would probably be relationship. It's very much part of our DNA. We're a relationship bank. Being here coming up to 200 years and hopefully we'll be here for the next 200 as well. And relationship's at the core of what we do, which is why we focus on those core relationships and working with customers through the cycles.</p>
          <p>I think our multi-brand capability is a growing strength and differentiation for us. It gives us in a low growth environment an opportunity to win more customers, to grow more deposits with more customers, and to compete in an effective and smart way in those sectors that we prioritized against our competitors and we're getting better and better thinking about how to do that and I think our Bank of Melbourne example is a good one.</p>
          <p>Wealth, I've mentioned before the strategic element of how critical that is for us. If you think about structural changes going on in Australia as we move towards an Asian population and the baby boomers work their way through to pre-retiree and retirement savings, the compulsory super contribution world that we have here, currently $1.3 billion &#x2013; $1.3 trillion in superannuation growing to $4 trillion by 2025, and we think we're very well placed to participate in and be part of that growth sector.</p>
          <p>Risk management is a hallmark strength of ours and certainly something that we think is a competitive advantage. And similarly, efficiency is a competitive advantage for us and one that we are going to push very very hard on, and hence the focus on absolutely structurally adjusting our business from a productivity point of view to be effective and successful in a lower growth world.</p>
          <p>So how are we doing that? Well, firstly, we continue to invest in the higher growth and return activities. And so retail deposits, we've called out, we doing that because we need to improve the profile of our funding, but also because it actually drives deep relationships with customers. So you can expect us to continue to grow above system growth in retail deposits and you can expect us to focus increasingly on the transactional banking elements of that and household savings elements of that.</p>
          <p>SME lending and deposits, you can expect us to seek to grow above system growth in those areas. In the next six months, you'll see that particularly in Westpac RBB, where we've got a very sound model through Westpac Local with our small business bankers in place. If you look at an 18-month timeframe, you're going to that pick up in St.George as well as we implement a Westpac Local equivalent in St.George with business bankers in the branches.</p>
          <p>Agri, natural resources, trade finance, transactional banking, these are core segments that we focused on. You can see some uplift in the half that's just gone past. We're investing more in that, and it's great from an ROE point of view for the most part because it's balance sheet light from an intensity point of view.</p>
          <p>I think I've spoken about super and wealth; we're certainly investing in a new platform in our platform space. We call that Next Generation. And we're investing in more and more distribution both in our proprietary distribution networks and by bringing additional advisors on board through our Magnitude Dealer Group.</p>
          <p>Bank of Melbourne, lots of further opportunity there. We started out with approximately 4% market share in Victoria through the St.George positioning. And as you know in the business case, we called out that that we can see ourselves doubling this market share over the period of years ahead, while growing the overall position for Westpac Group within Victoria. The first six months shows we've grown overall footings for the Westpac Group as a whole in both lending and deposits.</p>
          <p>And mobile and online is an area of focus for us. Again, the digitalization of our economies is a structural shift going on around the world, and we want to be very well placed to be able to meet customer needs in this mobile world.</p>
          <p>Productivity, we are driving very hard for process redesign, process simplification, product redesign, product simplification. Our supplier program is early days and there's a lot further benefit to flow through from that. It is an absolute structural change to the way we're running our business that will lead to higher level of quality, better risk management approach, and lower cost.</p>
          <p>The SIPs benefits, clearly they've got a run rate yet to go, but now that we're over the hump we'll start to see those benefits actually feeding through in both revenue uplift and cost avoidance in future years.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, not negotiable for us. And then people and culture, absolutely fundamental to thrive and succeed in this changed world. And so we're working with our people in terms of driving innovation, thinking again about digitalization and mobile, and our customers are changing the way they engage and what they expect and how they interact with an organization. I mean, it's fascinating to see the rapid growth of mobile. In St.George, for example, the amount of transactions we do on our mobile apps in St.George is the same number of transactions as we do in two-thirds of our branches, financial transactions, and that's up from a third of our branches a year ago.</p>
          <p>So, extraordinary growth and a resilience and a capacity to change drive for performance, but critical too is the one team approach, making sure we focus first on group and secondly make sure we focus on the customer. So, look, I'm really proud of how the group is responding to that. I recognize there's lots of change in the company at the moment, but really, really proud of how the group is responding to that and the attitude and will and the firepower that's in the group.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me stop and say thank you for listening and let's take some questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, Gail. It's Rich Wiles from Morgan Stanley. You made the comment on deposits you're going to continue to grow above share or grow share above system. ANZ and NAB have both said that they are committed to increasing the quality of their deposit franchise. CBA says it wants to protect share as the market leader. You stated the risk that in a falling rate environment the deposit rates come down at a slower rate than the standard variable rates and deposit spread compression accelerates and that falling rate environment is actually bad for margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, you're spot on. There's no doubt that we can expect in this super-intensity of competition around deposits that the price intensity might well drive deposit rates not coming down at the same rate as mortgage rates come down. We saw that in November/December last year. As you know, mortgage rates came down 50 basis points and deposit rates on average came down 25 basis points. So that's been the biggest impact on margin without doubt, and I don't see that actually letting up, I don't see that letting up.</p>
          <p>But having said that, I think the overall reduction of the cash rate will be a good thing for the economy and it will stimulate some confidence and will certainly help customers again get their de-gearing going further and feel themselves to be in better position. But this is the competitive warzone that we're in is around customer deposits.</p>
          <p>For us, we recognize that we're coming from a culture, particularly in the Westpac brand, where we've had more of a lending culture than a deposit culture. We've seen quite good improvement just by tilting the focus of our bankers in the field, changing what we measure, changing what we reward and making sure that it's deposits first, with every single customer, it's deposits first.</p>
          <p>We've got a lot of our own customers, and, Jason, you may want to say something here; we've got a lot of our own customers who &#x2013; actually customers that have other business with us that we don't have their deposit business with us. So that's a first priority for us and we'd like to grow in that basic transaction side of things and savings side of things. Jason, you may want to add some comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gail. You summed it up well. The heart of relationship banking strategy is the main bank relationship and the transactional relationships. To put a bit of context to the Westpac RBB result, we had deposit growth of over 5% for the first half and lending growth of 2%. So we've certainly seen a shift that way, but in our own margins we've seen lending margins go up about 5 basis points and on the deposit side go down about 8 basis points. So that's part of the contraction on the net interest margin that Phil has already covered.</p>
          <p>For me, it starts with the transactional side, and you'll see a lot of focus on that because we know that customers will consider their main bank for future needs. And at the heart of a relationship strategy is how deep you can grow products per customer. We know where customers have their transactional banking business with us, they're on average 2.5 times higher in revenue than someone who doesn't, and we also know they're 3 times more likely to consider buying a mortgage or their wealth insurance, superannuation business with us. So it's a pretty compelling argument to say it starts with transactional, after that the rest of the business, they'll generally give your main bank a shot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Craig Williams from Citi. I have to ask this question, given I asked a question of NAB earlier along these lines. But when SIPs was announced in 2010, you declared that costs and benefits would be captured above the line in cash earnings. In last year's REM Report, the group changed your long-term incentives programs to be weighted away from 100% I think TSR on LTI towards a mix of cash earnings and TSR.</p>
          <p>So in light of your election to take the supplier change costs today below the line this half, I wonder whether we as analysts are witnessing a shift towards a new standard called comp-based earnings rather than cash-based earnings. Certainly the optics on jaws and EPS would look less flattering without that adjustment. So can you walk us through the justification for electing to take these costs below the line today? And how do you delineate between what's in and out of cash earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I can answer that question. Look, we called out in the ASX the principles that we use to decide whether or not there'll be a cash earnings adjustment or not, and you're most welcome to see them. We've been very consistent in terms of applying them. As you called out, SIPs has been taken above the line. And in fact, we've taken it over $150 million of restructuring charge above the line in the last three halves.</p>
          <p>In this instance, there are some one-off establishment costs. And consistent with the principle that we used around &#x2013; that we would back them out of cash earnings if they were not recurring if they were significant and one-off and because they were not going to feed into the board's deliberations around dividend, then that justifies taking it as a cash earnings adjustment.</p>
          <p>I'd also call out that if you looked at our statutory results and cash earnings results over the last two or three years, they're almost identical. So this has not been kind of a one-way exercise where cash earnings is always above statutory results. Some periods they're above and some periods they're below. So I think all we can do is try to be consistent, to be transparent, Craig, and I'm sure that the board sees that and has to be comfortable with that and makes that decision on that basis.</p>

          <p>John Mott from UBS. I've got a question on &#x2013; it's a comment within the St.George division, but it's probably got wider ramifications across the group, where the business impairment charges and you then say the impaired assets had high charges against them following more conservative reassessment of security recovery values.</p>
          <p>Now, when you look at what you're seeing in some of the regional banks, some of the mortgage insurers, it's becoming a bit more of a theme where the banks are going well, we can't really sell that asset for what we thought, house prices still keep going down. How sensitive is this and is this something that we should start be thinking about if asset process continue to track down, impairment charges could come under pressure going forward?</p>

          <p>No, I think our approach to valuations all the way through the crisis is we've continued to turn the handle on it, and it's freshly assessed regularly, the valuation. So it's not as though over a long period of time we then revisit revaluations and say, gosh, they've come down. And there's a range of benchmarks, there's actual properties that are sold that's a benchmark value themselves. They've become very very conservative, and we sort of turn the handle on the portfolio as a whole. I don't know, Phil, if you want to add anything to that, but...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's exactly is right. I mean, the reason is probably more apparent in St.George than others is because it does go to commercial property, is probably one of the assets where you're seeing that revaluation requirement for security valuation and then provisioning on the back of that. As Gail said, we really try to keep our valuations very current and we'll talk about provisions where they're required.</p>
          <p>I think the thing to not lose sight of is that the overall book value is still improving, notwithstanding some of that valuation impact. And you can see that in the business stressed to TCE in St.George along with the group right across the group, overall business has improved.</p>

          <p>Ben Zucker from CBA Equities. Gail, just picking up on your comments about deposits as a warzone and clearly a big focus area, I guess I'd just be interested in a bit more of your thoughts about how you're balancing margin management and volume maybe outside the target areas? Because you've talked a bit about target areas where you want to be above system, but how do you balance that off the other side and how do you think about the risk to margin compression and the parameters around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think we've done a reasonable job over the course of the past six months of managing debt. So managing the amount of lending we do and making sure that we're doing more deposit raising than lending and trying to get it in a category and in a way where we're not competing at the top end from a pricing point of view.</p>
          <p>So as you see, our margins were only down 6 basis points for the half and 5 basis points if you exclude treasury and markets-related. So I think that was a managing the scenarios. Working to get more in the way of transactional banking, working to get more in particular segments, such as migrant banking, such as social sectors, so the particular sectors that are deposit richer that we go after.</p>
          <p>And not all deposits are price sensitive. We've done quite a lot of work to really better understand which segments are particularly price sensitive. There will always be that 25% that will shop around and they'll move to the best loan rate. Well, there will always be that, but we've got a lot of customers that actually are not that price sensitive. They want a good price, they want an appropriate price, but they like their relationship with the bank and they like the history with the bank. And for those ones making sure that we target that properly, too, particularly as you do rollovers of TDs and so on. So it's a &#x2013; we've become a lot more smart and thoughtful and focused from a product management point of view and a distribution point of view in managing this side of the balance sheet, but it is a balancing act.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...additional comment to that, which is you also need to look at the kind of asset mix as well as another driver. There's lots of drivers in our margins clearly, but asset mix for us has been actually a headwind on margin for about the last two or three years. Gail has talked about how we've wound back commercial property exposures, you've seen our credit card balances have been very subdued in terms of the growth. So there probably two of the assets which actually have the highest underlying margin before impairments and that's had a margin drag on us.</p>
          <p>Now, we've got our concentration on commercial property back. So we're in a position where we can start to grow again and grow in the places that we want to grow, and you saw that for the first time in the last half where we just started to have an uptick in commercial property balances. And similarly, in cards, as we work through the rundown of the old Virgin companion card, so that's &#x2013; well, not companion card, but card, that's sort of worked its way through as well.</p>
          <p>So I think you'll see &#x2013; and some of the target areas that Gail's talked about will actually give us an improvement in asset mix, which is one of the things that will help to offset some of these other drags that you've been talking about.</p>

          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Just in relation to your key metrics on slide five, if I was to pick out a range of days you've got deposits ahead of system, expense to income ratio down, revenue productivity up, dare I mention it again, but deep customer return up 5 basis points, all of those would lead me to believe that your return on equity should be rising as well. Yet, I know you said it was a modest decline, but it was a 50 basis point decline over the half. Could you first of all give us more color around what's driven that change and then give us a view on where you think that that could actually move to? Can you arrest that decline going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start, and I know, Phil, you'll add to this. I mean, the biggest impact, and it's not just the last half, you have to think about several halves actually, but the biggest impact is the way we've grown our capital. And so you just have to look at the size of the equity base first half last year, second half last year and first half this year and how that has grown. And if you allowed for that back of the envelope, our ROE would be about 16.5%. So if you kept the size of the capital constant, the base constant, and you'd allowed for that, the ROE would be high. So that's one major impact.</p>
          <p>Another major impact, again, not just this half but over several halves, has been the fact that we've strengthened our funding profile. There's liquid assets way up, longer term funding. So that's had a drag and an impact on ROE because it costs more to actually do that. So those are two factors.</p>
          <p>Again, I think we're some ways through this restructuring. On the capital side, we're just about there. I mean, we feel very comfortable with where we're placed on capital relative to the start date of 1 January next year and have degrees of comfort and certainty about where we're placed. And so at some point we can stop with this ever increasing capital base. So, certainly, we are expecting and targeting an ROE that's higher than it is today.</p>
          <p>Now, there'll be leads and lags in this, but we would be looking for an ROE that's in the sort of 15% to 18%, 15% to 19% range over time. But, certainly, that's what we'd be doing and it's about targeting those right segments, getting the revenue growth in those right segments, managing this balance of those four quadrants, as I discussed, and getting to steady state on funding and getting to steady state on capital. Phil?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I'd point to is actually that average ordinary equity was up 5% in the half, 10% from 12 months earlier. So, clearly, that is the drag that Gail has referred to. And that capital has been deployed to boost capital ratios as opposed to take on an risk. Now, as Gail mentioned, as you get to the point where you feel more comfortable about your capital ratio, there's less need to do that and there's more chance to actually then either get a better return on the capital that you've got or only raise capital when you're going to be deploying in the business. And that's really the major driver about why we're looking for a better ROE.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. Thanks for a great presentation pack, too, by the way. Lots of good stuff in there. Just one thing I don't understand, Phil, you said if we were to go back to the first half result last year, we would tell that rising software amortization would create a 2% increment in the cost base in 2012 and 2% in 2013. When we got to the FY 2011 result, the 2012 was still up 2%, 2013 had come back to 1%. In today's presentation, it's up 2% in 2012 and there's no comment about 2013. If we have a look at basically the amortization charge in this half, it's actually declined to about A$120 million, A$140 million, which would imply for it to create a 2% headwind it's got to gap up to about A$250 million in the second half. Does that imply that the 1% that we used to hear about in 2013 is actually a higher number? Like should we be looking at the half-on-half run rate in that rising software amortization with this half being the aberration or should we be looking at it on a full year basis? Because it starts to really eat in to all the productivity savings that we've been hearing about.</p>
          <p>And just one further question, if I may, is that if you have a look at Westpac, Westpac structurally has got the highest gap between core retail deposits and APRA loans of any of the banks. In this environment, we always hear a lot of talk about deposit pricing. But I'd be interested is there a scenario where actually the quantum access of deposits actually means that Westpac has to limit its asset growth and actually grow well below system for an extended period of time?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...and I'll tackle the first one. So, I mean, I think you're right. We tried to call out what's happening. The amortization charge actually has been slower than we expected when we commenced the SIPs at the end of 2010. Turns out that very big technology projects don't always deliver exactly as you'd expect. I don't think that surprises anybody, but the quantum of the spend and, therefore, the quantum of the impact on our expenses is at actually what we expect. We will see an uplift in our amortization expense in the second half, both the SIPs and other projects. So I think you need to think about it as a total project spend and we've shared that in the ASX document, and you should expect that that increment in 2013 will be 2%. So it's not 1% &#x2013; hope I didn't say 1%, you...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I don't think I intended to say 1%. Certainly I've always thought it would cost us 2% to our expense growth rate in 2012 and 2013. That 2012 has been delayed a bit, but overall you should be expecting that that's the kind of expense growth impact that we expected from that set of investment projects and that we are looking to ensure that our productivity initiatives across the company are set up to ensure that that doesn't give an unacceptable level of expense growth. And I think we've been pretty consistent about that and we're looking to deliver to that. In terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we don't see any scenario at the moment that says we actually have to constrain artificially or below system our lending growth. We're actually in a low system lending growth arena right now, which is helping us all in terms of the deposit side of things. And I expect it to remain a relatively low system growth period for a while. I think those days of very high system growth that we had in the early 2000s and the late 1990s, I mean, those days are behind us. So we expect continued low overall credit growth. So that's point number one.</p>
          <p>Point number two is it is a balancing act, and I think we've shown that we're doing that. Even this last half, we stood away from some of the more expensive pricing that we run in mortgages in the &#x2013; in that first quarter and said actually we won't compete. We're not going to offer those kinds of discounts and we won't compete. So we were happy in that scenario trading off growth with return to actually stand away from that. And then we put up this particular focus on changing the culture around deposits going after our own customers for their deposits, tilting to segments that are more deposit rich.</p>
          <p>So it's a balancing act, but I don't think that we're going to be landing up saying, gosh, we've got to dial down growth. We're getting the growth where we need it. And then we become a lot smarter of saying let's go after those segments that actually are less balance sheet intensive. So well, superannuation, insurance, transactional banking, foreign exchange, all those areas of focus for us are very rich, too.</p>

          <p>Victor German from Nomura. In a way just following on from that previous question, if I look at your multi-brand strategy, just interested to hear, I have some metrics and observation in terms of your expense growth in St.George actually was quite well contained and, in fact, declined. Are you investing enough in that multi-brand? Do you think you need do a little bit more?</p>
          <p>If you maybe can give us an investment profile in building up Bank of Melbourne? And also as I said sort of going back to your previous comments around growth, at what point do you think you'd be able achieve superior earnings growth delivered by that multi-brand strategy and can you actually afford that given your somewhat underweight position in deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a lot of points in there. Let me sort of start off with a comment about Bank of Melbourne. Was that the first one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Expense growth in St.George I think was the first...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, look, I mean, I think our expense growth in St.George is excellent. The investment that we put into St.George has actually been in Bank of Melbourne. Now I think we've done that in a very managed way and we're leveraging, as you can see. In fact, I'm always a bit bemused when people go on about that multi-brand is a high-cost model. You can't see that in the numbers. I mean, the numbers show that we're managing that in a very managed way. We're leveraging the core systems, the core operations, the core products, all of that of St.George, the St.George Group in Bank of Melbourne. So it's not a high-cost model at all; we're getting the revenue relative to that cost. So that's where the investment has been in St.George over the last while.</p>
          <p>I think you're right to call out insufficient investment into St.George, the brand. So what we did is we made a call about investing in Westpac RBB and we did that. And you can see the benefit actually coming through last year and this year, and we expect that to flow through into the balance of this year and next year as well. So we made that call. We then made a call that we'd invest in Bank of Melbourne and we've done that and beginning to see the uplift and you'll see more of that. You're right to call out what we've done with St.George was actually some restructuring around lease mortgages through brokers and leased commercial property, but we haven't put enough investment in.</p>
          <p>Now I don't want George Frazis to get too excited by my comments here, he's smiling in front of me. But we do need to put a bit more investment into St.George the brand itself over the next period. I suspect it'll be a &#x2013; the local model and alike fashion, so more business bankers into our branches, a little bit more focus on sales intensity and training and so on, and in the business banking side in St.George, too. So there will be some more investment, but it'll be of a much more modest size to the investment that we put into Westpac.</p>
          <p>Overall, this is a portfolio of brands. You're always going to find that some are doing a little better than others. Really happy with Westpac the brand. St.George, we've discussed fully, there's some elements of it that are strong, but it needs to pick up, particularly in the lending side and particularly in the top line. Bank of Melbourne, very happy with it, off to a good start. And look, <mark type="ph" /> bankers say just a steady it (01:12:15) as you go kind of brand. It's very stable in its environment. It's got absolutely unbelievable impairments, I mean, something like a A$16 million impairment charge this half again, it just has a rock solid credit quality. But it's not going to sort of shoot the lights out from a revenue point of view. It's in a stable brand and stable economy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you expect that strategy to deliver you superior earnings growth relative to your peers over medium term and at what point should we start to see that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what it does for us, we focused on, you've heard me say, on mortgages, we want to retain our share. We've got one in four mortgages within Australia. We want to optimize that portfolio, continue to improve the return out of that portfolio, which is what we've been doing, but very happy with one in four in mortgages.</p>
          <p>Deposits, we want to grow our share. We've got about 23% market share in deposits, but we'd like to get more in some of the high value deposits. So we'd like to grow it and have a better mix of deposit business over time.</p>
          <p>SME, we've got about 20% of the market within Australia in both lending and deposits, and we think all of our brands play to SME, all of them. So there's a great opportunity for us as we put some investment in as we've done in Westpac Local to grow our SME.</p>
          <p>What does multi-brand do for us? It gives us the opportunity to go and win more customers. That's what it does, because there are a range of customers as we know that choose St.George over Westpac. If we didn't have a St.George, they wouldn't choose a Westpac. So it gives us an opportunity to win more customers and then make sure that we actually are getting the uplift that we want.</p>
          <p>And then in our Institutional Bank with our capabilities in foreign exchange, our capabilities in financial markets and so on, they have got all of those brands that they can deploy those products and services to just as our Wealth business has, all of those brands, Bank of Melbourne, BankSA, St.George, and so on. But increasingly we think we're going to be a bit smarter in saying, right, let's talk about Western Australia, let's talk about Melbourne, let's talk about Queensland, how do we best deploy this family of brands we've got against the competitors to best get the revenue outcomes that we're looking for and the growth that we're looking for. And that's part of the benefit of an AFS construct.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can I just add one comment, Victor? Absolutely superior and sustainable earnings growth, outperformance is our target. But multi-brand is just one element of our strategy. So it's wrong to say all that's &#x2013; all we are pursuing is a multi-brand strategy and that's the only element to achieve that goal. And I think Gail's endeavored to show you quite a lot of other elements that need to be delivered to be successful in our strategy. Do we think it's an important component? Yes. But is it the only means to that goal? The answer is no.</p>

          <p>Mike Wiblin from Macquarie. My question is just on page 70, just looking at LMI, quite topical given the Genworth presentation out overnight. Question really, got three parts, given sort of the commentary there, do you expect the cash earnings to continue to compress from here as we roll through and can you talk a little bit about the loss experience? Also wanted to know on the retained business whether you've got any reinsurance on that or that's sort of sitting on Westpac's books and are there any plans to sort of further de-risk from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I'll have a go and, Brad, if you want to top-up. So the biggest impact on the LMI return in this half was in fact decision we made in the middle of 2009 to no longer take on board in the banks underwriting risk, LMI insurance for loans where the loan devaluation was 90% or above. And we made that decision because effectively we said, look, there are certain risks that we want to keep as a company and others that we're happy to see someone else take on board.</p>
          <p>The way that revenue is recognized in that book basically is accounted for to match the expected claims profile. And lo and behold, the first half of 2011 you actually see revenue take quite a distinct dip from what you've been accounting for up to now. That's the reason that we're seeing a lower return in our LMI book. Claims are a little high, but really not the reason for what you're seeing in terms of earnings. If you look at the profile of revenue recognition, the largest part of that decline has already taken place. So it took place in the half. It continues to decline a bit, but at a much reduced gradient, if you like, than what we have already recorded in the half.</p>
          <p>In terms of reinsurance, actually there's quite a detailed description of that in the IDP, so can I point you to that? It actually highlights the way we think about managing the risks in the LMI book. We're quite comfortable with managing some of them on our balance sheet, on our sheet. And in part that's because we're really comfortable about the origination risk that we have in mortgages that the bank originates. But it's good risk practice to share some of that risk gap and you can see that in the deck, and there's no intention to do any changes to that and we're very happy with the reinsurance model that we've got <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:36).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think as Phil said, the above <mark type="ph" /> 92% (1:18:03) we've already pushed over to Genworth, so that's off ours. On the under 90%, we risk-shared that with four different re-insurers. So we have 20% with Genworth, 20% with QBE, and the rest split with another two. I think what Genworth have been calling out in their numbers is exposure to Queensland in our less than 90%. We've only got about a 21% exposure into Queensland, and of that 12% is in Brisbane, about 6.5% across the East Coast, and a small amount of that on the Gold Coast. So we don't have the same sort of concentration risk in the under 90% into the Queensland area.</p>
          <p>When you look at the loss rates, it's important to think about the amount of the premium that we've pushed out. So the loss rates is actually the losses as a percentage of the outstanding premium, and what you've had period-on-period is losses have gone from $10 million to $12 million, but the premium base, because we've pushed our premiums out to Genworth have gone from A$50-odd million down to $35 million. So the biggest increase in the ratio is actually the lower premiums because more business is now being written by Genworth rather than an increase in the claims.</p>

          <p>Just &#x2013; Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just a question on institutional business and also just maybe a little bit further downsized to business bank. Can you just talk about the margin trends? And institutional margins, seemed like they were down this half and there seems to be funding has been caught out in addition to accounting impact. So I just wanted to get a sense of what the outlook is for that, if you just continue to see competitive effects or if it's largely stabilized in terms of the underlying trends. And then if you could just give a comment on just a little bit small business size of the SME segment if we're seeing much competition or compression in that segment as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a great question for you, Rob. Why don't you pick up the Institutional Bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over to you, Rob.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, thanks very much for the question. In terms of the margins in the Institutional Bank, clearly they were down on the half and that is reflective of the increased liquidity that we've seen coming out of since the European money was contributed by the Central Bank and really has changed the profile again. The Europeans had pulled out quite considerably from this market and that did allow the margins to stabilize over the previous half.</p>
          <p>With the liquidity back in the market now and, more importantly, the capital markets reopening has meant that the &#x2013; our customers have a couple of opportunities to go for their financing needs. Those will then come through the Institutional Bank and us as a facilitator and as an intermediary to take them into the capital markets, and that has driven the pricing down between the two markets. Those are pretty close to in balance at the moment. So that means, I would say, that the margin compression that we've seen has stabilized for the moment, though the competitive landscape is likely to stay intense. The Europeans pulling out made the first wave of difference. We saw the Asians come in for a little bit and now we've got a more balanced market again. Thank you.</p>

          <p>And on the smaller end, and it's really much the same story as we had the whole of last year and where the volume growth is and where the opportunities are really relying on those sectors that are connected to mining and commodities, engineering. So the faster growing sectors of the economy is where the most opportunity is. Health is another one that's got good opportunity. Some areas in agri have got good opportunity as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gail. James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I just wanted to ask about the customer deposit to loan ratio that you've increased quite substantially. What is the target number at which you'll start backing off on deposits? And is it growth at all costs or are you prepared to be the bank that'll actually put some pricing discipline back into the deposit market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's definitely not growth at all costs. I really hope that this is sort of part of the point of saying it's a balancing act and we look at all of those aligned whether it's strengths, growth, return, and we seek to manage those in a tight coherent way and that's certainly what we've tried to do over the course of this past six months. So it's definitely not growth at all costs, but it's going for those segments and those customer bases that are perhaps less competitively focused on price and making sure we win our own transactions out of our own customers, all those sorts of things.</p>
          <p>We haven't actually externally put out a particular ratio. We'd like to increase it from where it is. And so you can expect to see a steady improvement. But again there could be some leads and lags. There could be some periods where it's &#x2013; plateaus a little and some periods where it steps up a bit. But in this environment where credit growth is low, where system credit growth is low, this is an environment where we would expect to get more structural shift. So this is an environment where I'm putting the asset on the teams out there and say go and actually make sure you shift this culture to deposits and grow this deposit base because we've got a very sizable customer base across our various brands, let's go and get them.</p>
          <p>Bank of Melbourne is a great example. They started out with their business case being more lending focused, in a traditional way of a sort of startup and we said, sorry, wrong, get the deposits. So they've grown their deposits by 16% in six months and are four times market share. So that's the shift that we're trying to bring about, but it will be managed, it will be disciplined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I appreciate that, but I mean it's also an environment where deposits are being ridiculously bid for by all four banks, and I think Richard made that point. Is now the right time to be &#x2013; I mean, you're saying leads and lags. Is now the right time to be actually focused on increasing it when you're paying 5.8% for a term deposit at the moment versus a lending housing loan at almost 5.9%? I mean, the math on this does not make a lot of sense and you're saying it comes through the margins at the moment. I'm just curious as to what point...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is the right time to focus on it because we're in a scenario of lower credit growth, where system credit growth is lower, where we're going through the cycle of customers de-gearing, deleveraging, more caution, I think it is the right time. Phil, I mean, you may want to talk a bit more about the overall funding task and approach that we're taking here. But it is &#x2013; it's managed is the best way I can say. We really, as a team, Phil and I, Curt, the whole Group Executive, it is a huge area of every week focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, you've highlighted an issue for the industry and it's how well you can actually achieve growth and at what margin impact. And I think we're trying to make sure that we manage that trade-off. It's &#x2013; the trade-off is actually no different from lots of periods in the past, but it is pretty acute. And I think you're seeing in the results how some banks have addressed that trade-off. I think our result is not a bad one in terms of getting that balance right.</p>
          <p>In terms of other funding sources, I think one of the things that we have got strength, obviously what we've been doing in the term markets and we have a very large pool of potential in that covered bond market. Now we're not going to go off and issue all of our covered bond capacity on day one and we've been quite I think disciplined about that in the last six months. But that is an opportunity for us to actually raise, what will turn out to be, quite cheap money compared to even term deposits. And so we'll be looking to astutely use that over the coming period as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've done a reasonable job as well in the last &#x2013; when I say the industry has done a reasonable job in the last six months or so of better explaining the dynamic nature of how we fund ourselves and the costs of those various funding elements and that there's not this nexus between a cash rate move and how pricing flows through on the lending side. So I think we've done a reasonable job. We need to do more of that because ultimately the balancing act also includes repricing on the mortgage side and repricing on the business banking side, on the lending side, and that's part of what actually gets you into the balance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Gail, you've given the deposit performance a big kick today, but I guess if we go back to slide 14 we can say that the at call deposits have fallen by $8 billion, and both yourself and Jason have talked about the need to win that transactional banking side of the business. So I'm just interested if there's any specific reasons you can call out for that performance on at call deposits this period, and whether it does reflect any slippage in the business transactional banking space where I think one of your peers is making a lot of noise about their technology advantage in that space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we've had a very deliberate focus on growing our TDs and there are regulatory reasons for that. That's about term funding and stability of funding and better matching the profile of our funding with our lending. So &#x2013; and as you move forward into the new stable funding ratio scenario that we all know is coming and yes, there's lot more detail that we've yet to ascertain with regard to that, but we absolutely know that term funding is more valued. So that's been a deliberate shift, it's more valuable for us. With regard to &#x2013; on the call, that does include online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's everything. I mean, online is a very hot and not sticky element or potentially not sticky element. And so we're cautious about online. We certainly want to make sure that we don't actually, that goes to your earlier point James, we don't want to make sure that we're pricing at any cost on online. So we're being much more thoughtful and cautious about the &#x2013; competing at that really hot end of online. We've been focused on TDs, focused on basic transactional savings side, and as Jason knows and the team knows more to do on that everyday transactional banking piece.</p>
          <p>Similarly, in Rob's business, there are &#x2013; transactional banking piece is a strong component of what we do and our business deposits have been very strong. So that's an area where we're doing well. That's an area where we think we can do better.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't say I'm claiming &#x2013; your opening remark there was that I'm saying we've done well in deposits. I'm not really. I'm saying we've done an okay job of growing our deposits ahead of system and we've done an okay job of funding our lending growth with deposits, and we're doing an okay job of shifting the culture of our organization more towards deposits. I've been talking about this and the &#x2013; all of the four years that I've been here. It does take time; culture change like this takes time, and we are getting there steadily but surely, but the level of focus, resource, and attention we have on this has stepped up enormously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the online, if we strip that out, would you say you're still holding share on the transactional side or is &#x2013; would you acknowledge any slippage there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Phil, do you want help on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'd absolutely expect that we've actually grown share in particularly business and institutional transactional. Some of that business at call is actually a switch from at call, some of it's actually <mark type="ph" /> out of 11am (1:29:11) as well into term deposits. And so that differential actually kind of exaggerates how much is going on. And when you get a chance to read through the ASX, in the divisional commentary we talk about the switch that's taken place between at call and term deposits.</p>
          <p>But I think Gail's last comment around rational pricing, if we think 5.6%, 5.8% term deposits for six months is irrational, what about 6% at call? So that is one where we've absolutely said, look, we'd rather see if we can get some more normality in the yield curve even at these elevated pricing. And so we have definitely been comfortable shying away from some of the most price-sensitive online at call offers.</p>
