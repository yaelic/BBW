      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I'm Nicandro Durante, Chief Executive of British American Tobacco, and as usual, I'm joined by finance Director, Ben Stevens. Also, in the front row, there are a number of my colleagues, including Richard Burrows, Chairman; and John Daly, Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>And welcome to those of you who may be listening on this conference call or watching via the webcast. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity for those of you in the audience to ask questions. If you are on the conference call or watching the webcast, please contact the Investors Relations team later if you have questions.</p>
          <p>The strength of our brands are consumer centric, innovative products, and the quality of our people have delivered another year of very good earnings growth. These are not easy times by any means and 2011 was not a one-off year. We have consistently delivered good earnings growth over the last decades, demonstrating that our proven strategy continues to deliver.</p>
          <p>The strategy and the consistent earnings growth it delivers translate into superior returns to our shareholders. In 2011, the share price appreciated by 24% and shareholders received dividends of 119 pence per share. In addition, we commenced our share buyback program and returned a further &#xA3;750 million. Rewarding our shareholders with superior returns is at the heart of our strategy.</p>
          <p>Once more, we have met or exceeded each of our strategic targets. Most notably, compared to recent years, volume has stabilized. In the first half of the year, organic volume was down around 1%, but was slightly up in the second half.</p>
          <p>Our geographic diversity has meant that you are less exposed to developed markets. The natural volume declines have been exacerbated by the continued economic pressures and high levels of unemployment.</p>
          <p>Global Drive Brands have continued to grow and we have grown market share by 0.4 percentage points across our top 40 markets.</p>
          <p>A feature of 2011 has been the absence of major currency movements on the translational results at average exchange rates. Revenue and profit were not materially affected by currency although sterling strengthened against many of our key currencies in the fourth quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>The organic revenue growth of almost 7% at constant rates of exchange reflects continued good pricing momentum. Adjusted profit was 10% higher and the excellent work to address our cost base has resulted in a 230 basis points improvement in operating margin to 35.8%. Organically, the improvement was 140 basis points.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings per share rose 11% to &#xA3;194.6 pence and the Board's dividends policy of distributing at least 65% of adjusted earnings means that the proposed dividends rise 11% to 126.5 pence per share.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the brands. The Global Drive Brands continue to perform well, growing 9% in 2011 and now account for almost one-third of Group volume. It's our innovations strategy that continues to drive GDB growth. Dunhill performed well despite the share loss in South Korea following the price increase we led last April. Dunhill's volumes increased slightly as there were strong performances in Brazil, Romania and the GCC.</p>
          <p>Excluding South Korea, Dunhill's volume was 8% higher the level of growth we had seen in recent years. The Reloc re-sealable pack now represents half of Dunhill's volume and capsules has been introduced into several Dunhill markets.</p>
          <p>Kent continued its strong performance, up 10% to 67 billion. This result reflects the strong performances in Japan, Romania and Russia and Ukraine. We also saw good performances in the Middle East and Turkey. Innovations now account for almost 70% of Kent's volume.</p>
          <p>Lucky Strike's momentum continued with volume up 14% to 30 billion sticks. This was due to good performances in its key markets of Spain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Chile, Brazil and Argentina. Lucky was successfully launched in Turkey and South Korea, and innovations now account for 12% of its volume.</p>
          <p>Our largest GDB, Pall Mall, recorded another good performance at 11% to 81 billion. The brand saw share growth globally with Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, Germany and the UK offsetting declines in Mexico and Spain. Our total international brand volume rose 4% and international brands now represent more than half of Group volume.</p>
          <p>Our premium volume was down just 0.1% and our below-premium volume was down just 0.5% for the year compared to an overall industry decline of around 2%. Our premium share grew by 0.6 percentage points, well ahead of our corporate share growth of 0.4 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Moving to the regional performances, Americas was the only region that saw organic volume decline. And this was mainly due to the industry declines in Mexico, Brazil and Canada. Good pricing momentum meant that all regions contributed to the Group's 7% organic revenue growth in constant currency. All regions achieved organic profit growth at constant rates of exchange, contributing to 10% growth at Group level.</p>
          <p>While we frequently point to our bias towards emerging markets, which accounts for around three-quarters of volume and approximately 60% of profit, I must point out that Western Europe recorded another excellent performance with flat volumes and a 10% growth in organic profit.</p>
          <p>Looking at the regions individually, Asia Pacific's profits were 16% higher at &#xA3;1.54 billion as a result of strong performances in Japan, Bangladesh and Taiwan and favorable exchange rates in Australia, Japan and New Zealand. At constant rates, profits rose 11%. Volumes were 2% higher with increases in Japan, Pakistan and Indonesia partially offsetting South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
          <p>In Malaysia, good performances by Peter Stuyvesant and Dunhill led to higher overall share. However, industry volume declined following the excise-led price increases in 2010. Industry volumes were lower in Australia, following the excise shock in 2010. Profits rose as a result of cost-saving initiatives, favorable exchange, and higher pricing, partly offset by the costs of the plain packaging campaign.</p>
          <p>In South Korea, profits, volume and share were impacted by price-based competition, following our price increase.</p>
          <p>In Japan, the Group delivered an exceptionally-strong growth in profits and volumes, following the disruption of the domestic supply chain after the earthquake and tsunami. Japan's 2011 exit share was 12.3%, up 150 basis points.</p>
          <p>In the Americas region, strong performances in Brazil and Mexico, together with an improved product mix across the region, helped increase profits 4%, to &#xA3;1.44 billion, both at constant and current rates. Volume was worth 4% lower at 143 billion.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, profits improved, driven by higher pricing and improved product mix. The growth of illicit trade, however, impacted volume and share. Solid performances from Dunhill and Lucky Strike helped the Group increase its share of the premium segment.</p>
          <p>Industry volumes were lower in Canada, as rising illicit trade and aggressive price competition in the low-priced segment fueled down trading. This impacted volume share and profits.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, industry volumes were impacted by excise-led price increases at the beginning of 2011, as trade loading occurred during December 2010 in anticipation of the increase. However, profit was up due to higher prices and lower operating expense.</p>
          <p>We completed the acquisition in Colombia of Protobaco in October, and integration is on track.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, strong performances in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France and Romania, partially offset by declines in Spain and Greece, resulted in excellent profit growth up 11% to &#xA3;1.23 billion. If we strip out the impact of the Lyfra disposal and the termination of the Gauloises agreement, organic revenue was 3% up. Reported volumes in the region were marginally lower due to declines in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Greece and Spain, partially offset by increase in Romania.</p>
          <p>In Germany, the higher organic market share was driven by excellent performance of Lucky Strike and Pall Mall, although volumes decreased. Market share rose in many of the region's key markets, with good performances from Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.</p>
          <p>A highlight of the excellent performance in Romania as the industry benefited from the significant reduction in the level of illicit trade. Following the strong action taken by the government, market share grew, led by Kent, Dunhill and Vogue.</p>
          <p>Profit in the EEMEA region grew 12% to &#xA3;1.31 billion, mainly due to stable volumes and good pricing, partly offset by the adverse impact of exchange. At constant rates, profit increased 17%.</p>
          <p>Russia reported higher profits and improved market share, driven mainly by Kent's performance in the premium segment.</p>
          <p>Turkey continues to suffer from higher levels of illicit trade following the 2010 excise increase, another sizable excise increase in October 2011, and competitor pricing. Profit was lower, despite the improved product mix and significant cost savings.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, market share is strengthened due to the good performance of our portfolio. However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of illicit trades and some down-trading to the low price segment. Profit was in line with last year as the deterioration in the product mix offset price increases and cost savings.</p>
          <p>Despite the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, the Group's performance in the region was strong, due mainly to excellent performance from Dunhill in its key markets.</p>
          <p>Ben now will take you through the financial statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nicandro, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the operating margin. We have a five-year target to raise the Group's operating margin to 35% by the end of 2012. And I'm sure it will come as no surprise to anyone that we've achieved that target one year early. In fact, we've delivered an operating margin of 35.8% for the year, some 230 basis points ahead of 2010's margin. All four regions contributed to this growth.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this chart, we're making excellent progress on margin growth, notwithstanding that this chart is flattered by the positive impact of disposals in both 2010 and 2011. If we strip out Lyfra, phone cards and other inorganic items, the operating margin grew by 140 basis points. That's higher than our target to grow operating margin by between 50 to 100 basis points a year, on average.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the income statement, adjusted profit from operations grew 11% to &#xA3;5.5 billion. Restructuring costs were lower than 2010 at &#xA3;193 million and mainly related to factory closures in a number of markets including Denmark, Germany, Poland, Italy, and Turkey and other downsizing activities.</p>
          <p>The difficult trading conditions following the excise shocks in Turkey have resulted in an impairment write-down of the remaining balance of goodwill in respect to the Tekel acquisition in 2008. We've also made a provision of &#xA3;274 million for a potential claim relating to the acquisition of a paper business in the United States by a Group subsidiary in the 1970's. This claim is respect to the cleanup operations of sediment in the Lower Fox River in Wisconsin. The Group subsidiary concerned is taking active steps to protect its interests.</p>
          <p>Unadjusted profit from operations grew 9% to &#xA3;4.7 billion. Net finance costs were &#xA3;20 million lower at &#xA3;460 million, reflecting the strong cash generation of the business. Associates were 22% higher at &#xA3;670 million. For the purposes of the adjusted earnings per share calculation, the adjusted contribution from associates is &#xA3;37 million, or 6% higher, at &#xA3;659 million.</p>
          <p>The adjusted contribution from Reynolds American was 5% higher at &#xA3;429 million. At constant rate, the increase was 9%. ITC continues to perform well with its adjusted contribution increasing by 7%, to &#xA3;218 million. At constant rate, the growth was 13%.</p>
          <p>Profit before tax was 12% higher at &#xA3;4.9 billion. The underlying tax rate based on adjusted profit was 31.2% against 30.2% last year, in line with guidance. This year's higher rate was due to a change in the mix and profit. Our guidance for the current year is a similar rate of around 31%.</p>
          <p>The non-controlling interest charge rose 7% to &#xA3;280 million, and profit for the period rose 7% to &#xA3;3.4 billion. The share buyback program reduced the average number of shares from 1,994 million to 1,982 million and the adjusted earnings per share is 194.6 pence, an increase of 11%.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share growth of 11% is primarily driven by the increase in the profit from subsidiaries. The good performance from associates, lower net finance costs and the share buyback program were largely offset by the increase in the effective tax rate and then the increase in the profit attributable to non-controlling interest.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow rose &#xA3;286 million to &#xA3;5.2 billion, reflecting the growth in the underlying operating performance, partly offset by working capital movements and higher capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>The Group's free cash flow was 3% higher at &#xA3;3.3 billion. This takes into account outflows relating to taxation, which were &#xA3;269 million higher than last year due to higher taxable profit and higher dividends from minorities, offset by higher dividends from associates due to the RAI share buyback.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow was 94% of operating profit, and free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted earnings was 86%, in line with our target of the mid 80%.</p>
          <p>Dividends paid to shareholders rose 13% to &#xA3;2.4 billion. Under the share buyback program, 28 million shares were repurchased at a cost of &#xA3;755 million, including transaction cost. The main item in net investment activities was the Colombia acquisition for &#xA3;295 million. There was a net cash also of &#xA3;191 million for the year.</p>
          <p>And finally, net debt, which is only marginally increased from &#xA3;7.8 billion at the start of the year to &#xA3;7.9 billion despite the share buyback program and the Colombia acquisition. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we've announced this morning that we will reopen our share buyback program to a value of &#xA3;1.25 billion for 2012.</p>
          <p>That's the end of the presentation and I'll hand back to Nicandro for the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ben.</p>
          <p>To summarize, in 2011, we have exceeded or met each of our strategic targets. An excellent performance by the business and has generated an 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share, and our policy of distributing 65% of earnings means that the proposed dividends per share are also 11% higher. In addition, we are raising this year's share buyback by &#xA3;0.5 billion to &#xA3;1.25 billion.</p>
          <p>The business is in good shape to face 2012 with good momentum in pricing, share growth, and margin growth.</p>
          <p>We now open the meeting for questions but for the purpose of this webcast, please remember to state your name and the firm you represent. So, we'd like to kick off.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Chris Wickham from Oriel Securities, I just wanted &#x2013; if you could put a bit more flesh on what you think will be the outlook in 2012 for excise taxes in your key emerging markets? I don't know whether it's right to infer that perhaps you're less optimistic about &#x2013; than some of your competitors about the excise tax outlook in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I said last year when we were having the same &#x2013; we had the same question I think that excise environment today is better than it was four years ago and two years ago. We can &#x2013; I think the biggest issue of excise is when we have an excise shock- not a normal excise increase because it disrupted the market. And usually, the disruption brings an increase in illicit trade as it is the case in most of the geographies.</p>
          <p>But if you look at 2012, we haven't had any. 2011, we had three but you go back 2008 and 2009, we have &#xA3; 7 billion or &#xA3;8 billion, so it's getting better. I think that the outlook is better. We &#x2013; it has been announced already that you have an excise increase in Brazil, the one that we know around May. That's going to be sizable, it's going to be bigger &#x2013; higher than the inflation rate of the county. But I have to say that I'm more optimistic now than I was one year ago considering that we haven't had any at this time of the year, and last year, I remember quite well, we had two in January. Yes, Dave?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>David Hayes from Nomura. Just picking up on your &#x2013; the interview that you gave, you talked about organic growth of 7% this year and no reason that that momentum has changed. Is that affected by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:24) certain issue that we should talk about? And if not, I guess one of the moving parts in terms of I guess Japan <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:29) but is it something that you think offset that we should take note of? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was not meant to be a guidance in terms of organic revenue growth of 7% for 2012 because it's too early to make this call. Usually, half of the year is always a good moment to give that kind of a guidance because six months has gone through and you know what's going to &#x2013; what's happening in the market. What I try to say is that so far, so good. We have taken already two thirds of the pricing that you estimated for 2012, but it is going to translate in 6%, 5% &#x2013; 6%, 7^, it's too early to call. So, we'll have to wait a little bit. But I have to say so far, so good.</p>
          <p>We haven't seen many issues around the world in terms of prices so far, so we have to wait a little bit and see. I will give another four to five months. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon Leinster, UBS. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:34) probably at the back.</p>
          <p>First, on the P&amp;L, there seems to be quite a significant decline sort of cost of the raw materials and consumables. Is that highlighting a decline in &#x2013; or greater efficiency or declining in some of the basic costs? And can you give maybe an outlook on some of those raw material costs <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:52) costs for 2012?</p>
          <p>Secondly, historically, you've sort of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:56) interest cover target of six to eight times, is that still the target, or are we now moving a bit above that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, we have some increase in costs last year in terms of leaf coming through, I think leaf price increases were up by 9% last year. This year, they are up just under 5% across-the-board, so that's the main difference in terms of cost increases.</p>
          <p>Other than that, we anticipate cost growing roughly in line with inflation, so there's no particular news on the cost base. We have suffered quite significant clove price increases in Indonesia, but those prices are coming back down again. So, in terms of cost prices for 2012, I think the assumption of being roughly in line with inflation is the best assumption.</p>
          <p>On interest cover, we never really gave guidance on interest cover. The only interest cover covenant we've got is 4.5 times for one of our pieces of borrowing. Interest cover is high, as you'd expect, but it's not really one of the measures we use in terms of balance sheet management. Jon?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. I have a question on Turkey. I'm wondering to what extent the writedown you've done there is an accounting thing that you have to do, and how much of it really reflects a step down in the ongoing profitability of the business relative to your expectations. If you look at the return on investment <mark type="ph" /> as you wish to put it, (27:27) is it where you would have expected it to be, now, when you first made the investment, or was it materially lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you are saying that, are we pleased we're in Turkey? Absolutely, yes. It's the seventh market in the world. We were in Turkey before we made the Tekel acquisition.</p>
          <p>Has Turkey panned out as we hoped post-acquisition? Well, no it hasn't. We weren't anticipating the huge number of excise increases we faced. It's been quite a difficult market in terms of pricing competition.</p>
          <p>And, of course, the government had announced another round of excise increases for the end of this year. So they're taking excise up to 69%. So we have to take that into account when we do the cash flow forecast for justifying the goodwill in Turkey. And, obviously, with that level of excise increases, I don't think we could sustain the amount goodwill on our balance sheet. I don't think any of the other competitors could as well either. Unfortunately, they didn't have goodwill on their balance sheet because they grew organically. So, that's the reason for the write-off on Turkey. Is it doing as well as we hoped when we did the forecast of the acquisition? Well, obviously not because pricing has been much more difficult and excise has been much more difficult there.</p>
          <p>However, you remember when we bought Turkey, we did say that we wanted to &#x2013; well, first of all, we weren't expecting to suddenly turn around 30 years of share decline and grow. It was there to provide a distribution platform for our Global Drive Brands. And that's exactly what it has done. We've launched Kent in Turkey, we've launched Lucky Strike in Turkey, both of them are growing, they're still quite small at the moment, but they're showing very good results. So, overall, we're quite pleased, but, obviously, it's been a fairly bumpy ride on the way. Yes?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Adam Spielman from Citi. Can I ask two questions, please? The first one concerns, I guess, Canada and Australia. And I'm trying to get a feeling for whether &#x2013; we mostly have big tax increases there &#x2013; and I'm trying to get a feeling about the sort of run rate of profit growth in those two markets. So, in Australia, with profit up in the second half, I mean, I know it wasn't the first half, what's the outlook considering pricing is so high I guess for both Canada and Australia?</p>
          <p>And my second question refers to those markets that you have previously invested a lot of marketing in, so Mexico, Italy, Argentina, they've all seemed to have lost share in those markets, and I'm just wondering what we should think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of Canada &#x2013; let me start with Canada. In local currency, the profit was stable in 2011 as compared to 2010, and the main reason for that is that we had a drop in volume in Canada, let's not forget, industry volume in Canada was down 3%, and we saw some down trading still happening. We have little price in Canada in 2011 as well. We are very happy with the investment that we have been putting through Canada in the last couple of years, because we have now the leadership in all the price segments in the market, and we are moving quite well in each segment.</p>
          <p>The biggest issue in Canada for some lost share in 2011 is because illicit trade went up, so there was some move from licit market to illicit market, so when I'm giving you these numbers, it's about the licit market, consumption point of view, probably you will see different number, and also because our share in the high-priced segment is much higher in the mid and low despite having the leadership in all the price segments, you have an overall share loss, but I think that we are making very good in-roads in the place.</p>
          <p>In the case of Australia, as I mentioned, we have much higher spending in Australia because of the plain package campaign and the legal challenge. And this was the main driver for profits not going up in local currency as well substantially. It was slightly up last year, we cannot precise with the numbers, Adam. We can talk about this later, but it was slightly up. But if you don't consider these one-off costs, the profit would have been higher according to the plan. That's your first question.</p>
          <p>The second question about the investments in markets such as Mexico and Italy. Well, let me start with Mexico. I think that we have done extremely well in Mexico. We halted the rate of decline substantially and do not forget that at the beginning of last year, we were growing before the &#x2013; we were growing market share before the huge excise increase that we faced there. And the reason is that in Mexico nowadays, if my numbers are right, and I will try to collect them here somewhere, but anyway, illicit trade has gone up substantially in Mexico.</p>
          <p>And this is the main illicit trading now is around 9% in Mexico from 0%. And this has taken some volume from the legitimate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:46), that's the reason why the government has decided not to go for another excise increase this year, we have a much more stable markets. The rate of loss in terms of market share was minimal last year, but we were growing before that. So, I think that we have an outstanding portfolio now having strong brands in all the segments. We have implemented our pipeline of innovation with capsules, with Reloc behind Dunhill. And I'm very optimistic about Mexico going forward. So, we are in a very good shape there. I just came from a trip there and I came back very confident.</p>
          <p>In the case of Italy, we have a slightly declining market share, we usually come here to disclose a 1%, 1.5% share decline. The share decline last year was 0.1%, so almost stable. And the same case in Mexico, we are implementing innovations, and I think that we have plans in place to start growing again, but we came from a market that were declining, because the portfolio was not strong because of the acquisitions, but we've proven in the last two years, there was a turnaround in the performance that I've been talking to you guys every time that I stand here, and the results are just showing that. So, I'm optimistic that we will turn around those markets.</p>

          <p>And what about the momentum in Russia, is that, can we look forward to as much gains again in 2012 as you have in 2011? It seems that competitive environment may have got a little tougher there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Russia, we had an outstanding year, as you are aware. We grew market share. The overall market was declining, industry was declining, our volume was not declining, our share was up around 0.7%, 0.8%, which is fantastic in Russia. And, more importantly, we are growing in Russia. Why do we want to grow? Our share of the premium segment is above 42%. We are the leader in premium by far. And if you look at three years ago, our share in the premium was 32%. So, it's a huge growth.</p>
          <p>Don't forget that the margins in the premium segment and Russia &#x2013; usually markets in which you have huge price gaps, and the current system, the current excise system that we have over there allow that the margin in the premium are much higher than the low price. So, we are growing where we want to grow, that's why we have so much strong performance from the profit point of view as well because the mix was much better. So, we are growing in Russia and growing where we want to be.</p>
          <p>Regarding 2012, oh well, we are doing everything we can to repeat this performance. Let's talk again when you have time. But we have a very strong pipeline, we are bringing new stuff to Russia as well as we speak, and we are very confident. Kent keep going. Yava is doing well and we have some good stuff to come up still in 2012. Yes?</p>

          <p>Three questions, please. One on Australia, one on Fox River.</p>
          <p>On Australia, just <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:57) would that change anything in terms of the political climate that you think.</p>
          <p>Just on Fox River, Ben, I understand it's a contingent liability and you're providing for it, but were it to materialize as a cash flow, what's the sort of time horizon on that happening? That's the second question.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. The situation in Australia is that there &#x2013; it's at a procedural stage, a constitutional challenge to the plain packaging legislation. There was directions there earlier in today, there'll be another one early next week. And it's on track for a trial, 17th to 19th of April, I think the dates are. So, it's very much in the procedural phase, but it's moving along. And as far as Fox River is concerned, we're not expecting a demand in the near future, possibly, 12, 18 months if that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Politics change in Australia <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:15) you say, you might move away from it? Is that at all a possibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think not, because given the fact that the politics may change, the law is still the law in it's received broader sense. So unless another government came in and reversed it, we've got a problem there, is that it's due to go live December this year. Where it maybe different is in terms of the way that the matter gets litigated, given the fact that the government has published their defense in the way in which they want to try that case, but we just have to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How long do you think the Australian case will &#x2013; I mean, you've requested two days, but are we going to get an answer within two days, or is it going to be years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not going to be years. If it goes on this particular procedural path, the answer we hope should come relatively quickly, and we've made it perfectly clear to the court that, in fact, what the industry needs is certainty, one way or the other, given the fact that the implementation date is December 2012, so that's the purpose of taking the procedural steps that we've taken, and other members of the industry have also taken. And currently, the cases will be consolidated here together, so the intent is to get this matter heard in April to get a relatively quick resolution, of course the court is aware of the commercial implications of what's been put in place by this government, and that's the intent, Adam.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a little on Fox River, and we hope to get our money back, so the situation is that if you're going to book a liability, it has to be more likely than not to book the liability. You're going to book a contingent asset, it has to be virtually certain, so we're more likely than not that we would end up paying some money on Fox River, but we are not virtually certain we will get the money back from the people who gave us the indemnity, so that's the situation on Fox River.</p>

          <p>Yes, it's Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. They were up there. Can you give us a bit of an update on the transaction in Qu&#xE9;bec, and remind us of how long that trial might take? Does it involve non-Canadian BAT subsidiaries and in the extent of you losing, would you have to post some kind of bond to appeal or is that not an issue in this instance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the question concerns the Qu&#xE9;bec class actions. That case is due to start on the 12th of March. BAT &#x2013; non-Canadian BAT companies are not defendants although one subsidiary will have an involvement because the case also involves allocations of supporting documents, and that's the intent for the plaintiffs to lead on that issue and as the press always have their presence in the first few days, it's likely to get a lost of noise. The case itself is more likely to last anywhere between two and four years. What you may or may not know is that the judge ruled a week or two ago that the Canadian government is in that case, unlike BC. So, the Canadian government are joined into that case. And I'm not aware that there are any requirements to post bonds in Qu&#xE9;bec to appeal. I'll check it for you, Jon. But I'm not aware that there are any in Qu&#xE9;bec.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're pretty comfortable with the 65% dividend policy. We're returning essentially all of our free cash to our shareholders with the dividend and the buyback together. Consolidation isn't always &#x2013; you know, it is in its final stage in the industry, so rather than push up the payout ratio and then have to trim it back again, I think it's much more sensible to stick with the 65% payout ratio, which is absolutely standard, I think, for the industry. And to the extent we have spare cash then we'll give it back to shareholders or a buyback.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's not a bad assumption. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on innovation, you described it as an exciting pipeline. Can you tell us what you can about that exciting pipeline? And, historically, you just kind of speeded your major innovations in one or two key markets for awhile before rolling them out. Going forward, will there be a faster speed to market on innovation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a very good question. For obvious reasons, I cannot talk &#x2013; I cannot explain how we are going to roll out innovation in the future and I cannot talk about the innovation. What I can tell you is what's happened in 2011. And I think that I had questions about if the strategy was changing when I came aboard &#x2013; when we came aboard. And what I said was always that we have an outstanding strategy, but we have to improve the quality of the execution of this strategy.</p>
          <p>And if we look at 2011, for example, and if we look at innovation for an example, we have &#x2013; BAT has done an outstanding job. We roll out innovations in 23 countries, and the growth of the volume from innovations, while the overall market was down, industry 2%, was 25% up, the volume that came from innovation.</p>
          <p>And the other information that what we have in the pipeline is very exciting. It is for the coming years. We cannot forget that we still have to roll out what we have today. Innovation accounts for 12% of BAT's volume. Just 35% of the GDB's volume If you look at the global, the international brands, which together with the Global Drive Brands, are already 55% of our volume, is around 17%, 18%.</p>
          <p>So there are a long way to go in terms of driving innovations that you already know, in a much more efficient way, and increase their speed to market. On top of it, we still have a lot of things to come, and we planned this for five years in advance. So it's very exciting, but that's what I can tell you.</p>
          <p>Yes, Dave?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of follow-ups. When you took over as CEO, I think the one thing you said that may be more of a focus was other tobacco products. Just wondered whether you've got any statistics about how much of your sale is now OTP and what the growth was in 2011.</p>
          <p>And then, maybe with your CIO hat on, just in terms of the SAP rollout, I just wonder whether that's going to plan? Whether that will be fully implemented by the beginning of 2013, as you said in the past? Or whether we should expect any kind of impact or volatility through 2012 as that's put through the Group? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm very glad to say that one year ago, I was talking about that we have to improve the execution of the strategy. And you guys asked me some examples. And I said one is how we can roll out innovation faster, and I think that I gave some statistics about that.</p>
          <p>The second one I said, we have to improve the quality of our cost base. We have to reduce the cost base. And I think the number shows that we did a good job.</p>
          <p>And in the case of OTP, if you look at overall OTP volume was up in 2011, 6.6%. And our volume was up 11.7%. So we grew overall market share in 1.1 point. It was an outstanding performance. We put a lot of focus on that.</p>
          <p>OTP is quite sizable in BAT, but as compared to cigarettes, it's not that sizable. So we usually don't report OTP's successes as we should. But it's very profitable segment in some markets, and we are doing very well &#x2013; are growing share big time, volume big time. We put the focus that was needed and expect to keep growing for the coming years.</p>

          <p>Just on SAP, the 2013 date was for actually putting SAP into Malaysia, the first market. It wasn't for roll out around the Group. If I could put it out around the Group by 2013, I'd be a very happy CIO.</p>
          <p>What we're doing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:48). We've tested it in Malaysia with very good results. Very pleased with the way that's gone. We're now putting it into Malaysia starting this year, so it'll be in Malaysia by the end of this year. And then we'll start rolling it out region by region, so Asia-Pacific will be the first region.</p>
          <p>We'll have it all zipped up and finished, hopefully, by 2017. So it's quite a big program, this. But it will produce cost savings going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in Korea, we took the lead in terms of price increases in April last year. Remember quite well. And that was the right decision, if there is a follow-up question. That was the right decision.</p>
          <p>I think that the industry was not having pricing for six to seven years. Costs were going up. And we had to take the leadership on that. And I think that was the right call.</p>
          <p>The same thing that happened in Russia 2.5 years ago, in which the competition followed nine months later, as it is the case. And we have regained the market share in the right segments through innovation. So Russia is a good example of that.</p>
          <p>And in Korea, last year, we took the leadership. We lost four to five points market share in the first two to three weeks. The share has been stable. We have implemented in the second half of last year a lot of innovations there. We have the new <mark type="ph" /> panel (48:21) pack behind Dunhill. We have capsules behind Dunhill. We have launched Lucky Strike. We have launched the Reloc in the whole portfolio.</p>
          <p>And we are very confident now that we have a level playing field over the last months' moves. All international players are with the same price range. I'm very confident about the future in Korea. But it was the right movement.</p>
          <p>Yes, Rogerio, <mark type="ph" /> just &#x2013; (48:57)</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>The question is about Lucky Strike and the rollout of innovation. Lucky Strike <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:02) basically &#x2013; have you basically covered most of the markets in 2011, in terms of the key market products in terms of capsules?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you really compared...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't. I think that we mentioned in my presentation that the volume from Lucky Strike that comes from innovations is around, if I remember well, 12%. 12%? Yes, good memory. 12%. So there is a long way to go. Long way to go.</p>
          <p>Lucky is performing extremely well. You remember very well, up to 2009, it was a brand that was declining in our portfolio. In 2010, we had a very good performance. In 2011, it was even better, with 14% growth.</p>
          <p>And the brand is just fine. It's driving growth in places like Spain, like France, Brazil and Argentina, and so on and so forth. In places like Spain, just to have an idea, we are the leaders in Spain with Lucky Strike, in ASU 30 share, by far.</p>
          <p>So the brand is very strong, It's very well positioned. And all the growth in Spain that we had in 2011, that was quite a sizeable growth &#x2013; and I have this figure somewhere. We grew in Spain 1.5 share points. Most of the growth was behind Lucky Strike. We keep talking about Pall Mall during Spain's presentation, but most of the growth was behind Lucky, which has a very, very good margin and is growing through innovation, so the brand is very healthy.</p>
          <p>But it's a long way to go to introduce what we have in the pipeline. But we still have many things to come on top of it. So as I said, we plan those things four to five years forward. We don't plan &#x2013; we are not rolling out what we have today. And <mark type="ph" /> I'll let you (51:07) discover what we're going to do later. So we have a plan &#x2013; solid plan for the next four to five years, Rogerio.</p>

          <p>This is Fulvio from Goldman Sachs. I was wondering if you can give us a bit of color on Japan. Obviously, we had some special circumstances in the year. And listening to some of your competitors in that market, it seems that there's going to be a lot of focus on market shares in 2012, i.e., Japan Tobacco regaining some. Philip Morris wanting to protect that as much as possible.</p>
          <p>What's your innovation pipeline in this market? Is it stronger than what you've had in the past? How are you going to react to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Japan, we had three events in Japan. We always talk about the fulfilling of the pipeline because of the tragic events that happened. But we have three events Japan in 2011 that we have to consider.</p>
          <p>The first was an excise shock at the end of 2010 that created some disruption in the market. The second one was the &#x2013; as I said, the earthquake. And the third one, you have to consider that before the other things that happened in Japan in second half of 2010, we were in the second half of 2010, growing market share.</p>
          <p>So it's very difficult to say that we grew market share because of this or that. But the reality is if you December that I would call a clean month, much later after Japan Tobacco is back to the market, we had grown market share, December against December, 1.5 share points.</p>
          <p>So it's very solid, and I'm very optimistic about Japan. Our brands are growing. Kool in the premium segment and Kent as a sub-premium, both brands are performing very well. And we have put in place &#x2013; if you remember, we were the first one to implement capsules. We're expanding this to the whole portfolio, and we are bringing a lot of new stuff in 2012.</p>
          <p>So I'm very optimistic that we can keep growing market share in Japan. Because we were growing market share in Japan, even before the issues that we had there. And it's just showing. The brands are very healthy, so I'm very confident about the market.</p>
          <p>Of course, everybody is going to fight in order to gain market share, but if you look at the last 18 months in Japan, we are in a growing trend and a good momentum. And I see no reason for stopping it.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Ben, firstly yourselves, (53:42) the share buyback, as I understand, is fairly tax inefficient because you can't offset that in the UK against tax because your <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:48) business. Could you maybe give us more color, with the share buyback increasing, how we should view the cost of the share buyback? And how you could potentially make it more tax efficient?</p>
          <p>And then, Nicandro, for yourselves, could maybe give us how you see the market in Brazil playing &#x2013; you started talking about the downside. But how Brazil plays out, the excise increase? What manufacturer price increase could we expect? And illicit trade and what the government is doing? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Well, yes, you've got to look at the tax position holistically in a sense. So we borrow money and push it out around the world to make it as tax efficient as possible. <mark type="ph" /> So I think you can look at (54:28) the share buyback on its own on that.</p>
          <p>You're right to say if we just raise capital in the UK, then we don't get a tax exemption on it, because we don't earn enough profit in the UK. The answer to that is to earn more profit in the UK, of course, which we're working on. That's pretty much all I can say on that, I think.</p>

          <p>Regarding Brazil, Brazil has changed the excise system, reducing the number of tiers. Nowadays, it's a mixed system, ad valorem and specific. This is going to be kept for the time being. But it's going to reduce the number of tiers.</p>
          <p>So different brands and different price segments, you call different price increases. But I believe that the pricing that we need to take in order to pass on excise without talking real price increases around 15%, 20%, 21% in Brazil. But more importantly, the legislation is implementing something that you have been lobbying for, because we think that's very important for the Brazilian market, that's the minimum price.</p>
          <p>Don't forget that in Brazil, illicit is around 22% to 25%. And if the minimum price is implemented and considering that the illegal products, they go through the formal trades, so it's very easy to spot the ones that are not following the minimum price, I think that we can have an upside in this area.</p>
          <p>So we have a downside of the size of the price increase that's needed, which I cannot talk specifically about Brazil &#x2013; what's going to be the price increase there. Of course, I'm just giving some numbers of the magnitude of the excise increase, but the translation of this to price is a matter for the Brazilian company to decide.</p>
          <p>But in terms of minimum price is very exciting because if the government decides to enforce it &#x2013; and I think that the government is being very, very clear, saying that they are going to enforce the minimum price &#x2013; so we have the downside in one side, the upside in the other side. So we have to wait until May and see, because the implementation is in May.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>For a pack of 20s, local currency. I think that the minimum price now is R$3. It's between R$3 and R$3.25. I can go back to you and give you this data, because we start discussing R$3.25, then went to R$3. But I think that's R$3. So they have to almost double their price.</p>
          <p>And I have to say that is a gap of R$0.50 against R$0.75. And I think there is a possibility of reducing the size of this trade is phenomenal. Because I don't think that they have <mark type="ph" /> equity in any event (57:46) to compete to us with a low margin. Nowadays, they compete because they charge half price.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Toby McCullagh, Morgan Stanley. On Japan &#x2013; I take your point about where the market share was in December last year through to December of &#x2013; December 2010 through December 2011. If we take that progression was what you were going to achieve underlying and in an organic manner anyway, can you help us just sort of quantify what the excess perhaps contribution to revenue and operating profit from the disruption there have been through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the initially the market share question. I think that &#x2013; I will say that it will be difficult to have grown 1.5% share points if you didn't have the disruption. A lot of people try moving to our brands because of the lack of the competitors' at that time in some states. So, what will be the natural progression in share out of this 1.5%. What you have gained without the disruption is very difficult to quantify, so there is a mix of both. That's what I can tell you.</p>
          <p>The second question about Japan was the impact of the earthquake. Because we have this three phenomena happen in Japan, it's very difficult to predict, but the number that I can share with you is the volume is around 2.7 billion sticks and profit-wise it's around &#xA3;30 million to &#xA3;35 million. It's a little bit lower than the number that I raised &#x2013; I mentioned in July's presentation because most of the air freight cost to fulfill the pipeline came in the second half. So, profit wise, the Japan numbers were impacted by around &#xA3;30 million to &#xA3;35 million, and the volume around 2.7 billion sticks.</p>
