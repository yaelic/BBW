          <p>Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the ANZ First Half 2009 Financial Results Presentation. We're presenting today from Melbourne. We also have an audience at our mountain place headquarters in Sydney, so welcome to you, and of course, anybody joining us on the phone and via the Internet.</p>
          <p>Format will be completely and utterly familiar to all of you. We'll present for about 35 minutes and then go to questions. I'll bore you with the housekeeping data on how we do that when we get to that point. I have with me here today our CEO Mark Smith, and our CFO Peter Marriott.</p>
          <p>I'll hand over to Mike.</p>

          <p>Well, many thanks, Jill, and good morning to everybody and welcome. Thanks for joining us here either in person or on the phone or on the web. As well as Peter and I here in Melbourne, we have members of the ANZ management board with us, including Brian Hartzer and David Hisco in Sydney and other members of the team joining us by phone, who will be very happy to respond to questions when you have them.</p>
          <p>I'm going to open with a brief comments on the result. Then I'm going to talk about our progress against strategy, which I laid out nearly 18 months ago now. I'll then hand over to Peter, who will take you through the detail of the numbers, before coming back to make some closing remarks about the economy and how we see the outlook.</p>
          <p>All of you will have seen the half-year results release this morning, and the essential points of these are as follows. Our underlying profit of just over 1.9 billion was up 20% on the last half and was up 4% on the same period last year. Given the global economic environment and the problems facing the financial system around the world, that's a very credible result. It demonstrates ANZ's strength and the fact that the Australian banks are still making reasonable money and is one of the reasons our economy is better placed than most in relation to other OECD economies.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have been realistic and pragmatic on two fronts. One, facing up to the legacy issues in the business, which were more significant than originally anticipated. And two preparing the balance sheet for the global recession and the weakening credit environment that came with it.</p>
          <p>In this situation, you can see that we've continued to focus on balance sheet strength. The collective provision coverage sits at over 1% of risk-weighted assets. Total provision coverage is 1.6% of risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital is currently 8.2% or 10% under the FSA guidelines.</p>
          <p>Our term funding program is well advanced. We are almost 86% of the way through this year's program, and liquidity levels remain very strong with something like $60 billion of liquid assets. We've also reduced our reliance on wholesale funding, by growing deposits and lengthening the maturity of our term debt.</p>
          <p>Provisions, restructuring costs and other one-off items were a significant drag on the half, and that left us with reported earnings of just over 1.4 billion, which was 4% up on the last half but 28% down if you look back at the first half of the last year.</p>
          <p>In this results presentation, I want to be upfront with you that we've brought a different focus to talking about our business performance. We're now at the stage of the cycle, where shareholders want to better understand the underlying trends in the core businesses and judge our ability on how to maintain a strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The answer on both fronts is positive. Looking through provisions and restructuring, you can see we have a diversified set of businesses that are continuing to perform very well, with strong revenue growth and high levels of customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Put simply, Australia delivered a good result, with underlying earnings up slightly. Asia Pacific was outstanding, doubling profit. Our Institutional business is making very good progress, with the turnaround, and its core businesses are all performing well. And New Zealand has worked hard to deliver a reasonable outcome, given the very difficult economic conditions that they find themselves with.</p>
          <p>What's critical here to understand is that while we need to deliver adequate returns in the short term, banking is fundamentally a long-term game. The results of decisions, both positive and negative are often not really clear for many years and we have clearly seen the effects of this on a number of banks and other jurisdictions. So what is pleasing to me is the meaningful progress that we are now making against our long-term aspiration to become a super regional bank.</p>
          <p>Profit provisions for Asia Pacific was 15% of group earnings during the first half, well on the way to our 20% target. Our focus on Asia is driven by two factors. The first is the reality that over the next two decades economic growth in many parts of Asia, particularly China and India will outpace the rest of the world by a factor of three or four.</p>
          <p>The second is the deep trade and investment links between Australia, New Zealand and Asia. Asia's growing appetite for soft and hard commodities is now blindingly obvious and we all understand very clearly how the Australian economy is benefiting from this.</p>
          <p>The increasing corporate, government and private Asian investment into Australia, into New Zealand and the rest of the Pacific is not as well understood. The aspirations we set however, is not simply about Asia. It's also about building and investing our presence in Australia and maintaining our leading position in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>Here, in Australia, because of our investment in branches, our investment in ATMs, our investment in our staff, customers rank ANZ as the number one bank in customer satisfaction, amongst the Big Four banks. As a result, Australians are voting with their feet and their wallets and ANZ is continuing to grow customer numbers. So against the objectives we set out for you in December 2007 for the first two years, we are on track with our score card. We are turning around Institutional restoring it to system performance and setting up a foundation for our performance in the future.</p>
          <p>Across the Group, we have established a strategic approach to cost management with revenue increasing faster than cost at the underlying level whilst still selectively investing in growth. It's delivering real change, for example, we have introduced a more cohesive, simpler, warmer ANZ business model, which has resulted in far fewer management levels.</p>
          <p>We're investing in organic growth in Asia, and delivering a substantial increase in profit, which as I say now accounts to 15% of group earnings.</p>
          <p>And finally, we are capturing existing opportunities by maintaining our high quality domestic franchises in Australia and in New Zealand. At the same time, we've taken a realistic view of the impact of both the economic slowdown and the global financial crisis on the Bank. The actions we took last year to significantly increase provision coverage was clearly the right one. And we're dealing pragmatically with the effect of continued volatility in global markets on the credit risk required for the credit intermediation trades.</p>
          <p>Before I pass to Peter to take you through the numbers, let me make two key points. I don't think there are many companies today who have delivered on promises that they made 18 months ago. This is a tough period but we've done it. And secondly, and in line with that, 18 months ago we had a presence in Asia. Now we have a real business.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to pass over to Peter to go through the numbers in more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mike and welcome to everyone again this morning. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our focus particularly in the analysis of the result this time around is very much on underlying basis. That's a result of feedback we've had from shareholders, on wanting to understand what was happening with the business, recognizing there are a number of one-offs and we'll talk about those in a minute. But when you strip those away, what's happening with the results.</p>
          <p>And overall, statutory profit is actually up 4% half-on-half. But there's been effect of some of those one-offs which we'll talk about, leading to an underlying profit that was actually up 20%. And when you look at that waterfall chart there you can see clearly the highlight is just how strong that income growth has been, with 11% income growth half-on-half. And that's being driven particularly by very strong markets earnings. But as we'll see as we go through these slides there's actually been income growth across most of the businesses.</p>
          <p>That income growth is probably about 1% ahead of what was the market consensus and then correspondingly I think PBP is probably about 1% ahead of market consensus. Cost of growth of about 7% we'll look at, again very heavily skewed towards the Asian business and some within Institutional, with the Australian and New Zealand businesses being more modest in their growth.</p>
          <p>The provisions number, up 5% half-on-half, you'll recall that we quite significantly boosted the collective provision charge last year to start to recognize the problems that were inherent in the portfolio. And so that's meant there's been a more steady transition from one half to the next because we had already recognized many of the potential issues within the portfolio and we'll talk about that in a moment.</p>
          <p>It's a bit higher I think than what the market was expecting, and there was a bit of a blip in small to medium business type credit losses during the month of March. I think particularly coming out of the downturn in February retail sales, you would've seen coming in after Christmas. And that caused a few companies to have some additional stress, but it's a trend though which hasn't continued into April. Again we'll talk a little bit more about that as we go through.</p>
          <p>The overall result then as you can see is 20%, which I think is quite credible in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at those one-offs, obviously, when it comes to talking about things like underlying profit and cash profit, there is a high element of judgment involvement in what you adjust for. We've tried to go out of way in this pack to give you as much detail as possible around what adjustments have been made, what their impacts are, you'll find a variety of schedules, both within the results announcement document and within the slides that fully reconcile that so you can form your own view as to what you should be adding or subtracting. These are the items that we believe are non-core in nature either because they represent the outcomes of businesses that we've now decided to get out of and are non-continuing. Or that they are purely mark-to-market type outcomes such as timing differences or unusual one-off type items.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the numbers here are dominated by two the credit intermediation trades at the bottom, that number is a bit higher than I think that people were expecting and that reflected what happened to credit spreads during the month of March and again we'll pick up on that later on.</p>
          <p>And then the other item which is larger than probably people were expecting was the economic hedging. Now let's recognize that there is a degree of correlation between these two numbers, they are both mark-to-market numbers and they're both influenced by the movements in credit spreads and other spreads within the financial markets. So it's not surprising to find both of them being quite large. And they tend to move reasonably closely together.</p>
          <p>So let's look at the drivers and performances of our underlying businesses. The key thing to me I think, is to note on this half-on-half basis all of our divisions had positive PBP growth. Clearly the standouts were the Asia Pacific and the Institutional businesses and they are particularly helped by the markets results which we'll talk about. But even within the Asia Pacific business, there was very strong growth in the partnerships coming through and in the Institutional businesses there generally good performance across the Board. So it wasn't just the case of markets, it's been a good base performance.</p>
          <p>Australia was solid and continues to have solid revenue growth and maintain a good control over its costs. But as you'd expect at this point in the cycle, its credit provisions are starting to move up, principally out of commercial rather than consumer. And that there was a 50% increase in provisions meant that overall profit was down.</p>
          <p>New Zealand a tougher environment over there, income growth is slow and further provisions. If you look on a geographic basis actually, you bring in the New Zealand Institutional business, you find that profit was actually up over 20% for the half. So good income performance in Asia Pacific and Institutionals, solid outcomes in Australia and leading to overall a strong growth in our underlying profit.</p>
          <p>Obviously, net interest margin and what's happening on the balance sheet is a key area of focus. If you look at the underlying profit and loss, you would have seen there was around 18% growth in net interest income. There's a bit of accounting noise in there again caused by the effects of derivatives and whether the derivative income is appearing in net interest income or appearing in trading income? If you back that out you'd find that the underlying interest income growth was closer to 10% and that was broadly 8% growth in average interest earning assets and then some improvement in the margin. And interestingly enough as you'd see from the chart in the top right hand corner, actual end of period lending growth has slowed right down and so a lot of that 8% growth half-on-half was a flow through into the averages of the growth in the last period.</p>
          <p>Looking at the margin, I think the most important thing is the shaded area there, where you see what's been the fundamental things that have happened with our margin across the half. And not surprisingly there has been a big impact from lower margins and higher costs and deposits. And also increasingly higher proportion of our book at the higher wholesale borrowing rates. And so that's pushed up the deposit and wholesale section there.</p>
          <p>Also in a falling rate environment the earnings we have on free funds from capital and from low rate deposits has gone down and that was about nine basis points of impact. But we've been able to offset that by the various &#x2013; repricing initiatives across both consumer and business and out of cycle rating increases. So net-net across the half, there was an increase of about 5 basis points in the margin. In large part recovering some of the contraction in margin that we have had over the past 18 months to two years from the credit cycle.</p>
          <p>If you look at the volume growth as I mentioned, relatively modest growth in lending assets skewed very heavily towards mortgages. But one the deposit side, very strong deposit growth. So in fact, in dollar terms, our customer deposits exceeded the growth in our lending. So reducing our dependence upon wholesale borrowing and significantly improving the overall liquidity and structure of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Looking at income growth overall, as I said before, 11% growth half-on-half. This chart then breaks that down into how much came from markets and how much came from the rest of the group. And you can see there was a 66% growth in income from markets half-on-half, but it still meant that the rest of the group had 6%, so still running at double-digit growth in income for the half on annualized basis. When you look at what drove that growth in markets income, you could see it was both sales income and trading income. We've had unprecedented levels of volatility over this period of time, which has been good from a trading income point of view; it's also been good from a sales point of view as customers are looking to manage their risks.</p>
          <p>The other pleasing aspect of that growth in the trading income is that, is 41% of it actually came out of Asia. So the sales in trading income growth 41% coming out of the Asian business reflecting the value of the franchise that we are growing out there.</p>
          <p>From the chart on the bottom right hand corner, you can see that clearly first half '09 was unusual. Very, very strong outcome in the month of March, in the month of April the results have not been as strong as this. They are still running at above average levels but clearly the first half was unusual and it would be adventurous to assume that sort of level would be repeated, but nonetheless it was a very strong outcome.</p>
          <p>When we look at other income excluding markets, not surprisingly fee income has been flat reflecting a slowdown in the rate of growth and lending and generally a slowdown in economic conditions.</p>
          <p>The other, other income is worth focusing on because in there you can see that there has been very strong growth in the contribution from the Asian partnerships, you will see when you read in the results announcement, there were a number of one-offs but actually the pluses and the minuses offset themselves to leave what was in fact a core growth in that business. And that growth offset the reduction in earnings from wealth businesses both within, in Australia in ING Australia and in ING in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>On to costs, our half-on-half growth in costs was 7% but recognizing the strength in the U.S. dollar versus the Australian dollar in particular, when you adjust for exchange rates, our growth in costs was about 3.6% and you can see from the bar chart on the left hand side here that half of that growth was from Asia recognizing the investment that we are building &#x2013; in building the franchise out there and obviously the Jaws for that business were very, very strong more and more justifying the additional spending we had within that business.</p>
          <p>Also a reasonable level of spending in Institutional outside of Asia Pacific, still addressing some of the remediation issues and also fixing some of the things like technology investments that are required etcetera as well. But again a very strong positive Jaws.</p>
          <p>When you look at our domestic businesses within, in Australia and New Zealand, the cost growth has been much more modest. In the half Australia's cost were up about 2% and New Zealand's cost were actually down, recognizing the weaker income growth within New Zealand.</p>
          <p>That then brings us on to the credit provision charge for the half. Overall, and in total dollars collective and individual we're up about 5% half-on-half. Very much larger individual provision and you'd see within these results, we've unwound some of the extra collective provision we took up in the second half of last year recognizing that some of the risk that we believe were inherent in the portfolio have crystallized and that's why there has been that release.</p>
          <p>We'll talk a little bit more about that in the next chart but when you look at the individual provisions themselves, you can see that Institutional continues to be a large driver. It's been 64% of the individual provisions for the half and around about 70% of the growth half-on-half. Dominated still by a small number of larger provisions and you can see the breakdown there in the pie chart in the bottom right hand corner.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the other businesses, as Mike mentioned, we're now moving perhaps into phase II of the credit cycle. And so we're seeing some increase in provisions coming through in the small to medium size enterprise space, particularly if you look within the Australian business there's probably about $59 million growth in that sector coming out of Esanda and small business and business banking. About 46 million coming out of New Zealand in the same sorts of sectors, so about 80% growth. So relatively modest numbers but clearly there is an increase there.</p>
          <p>The consumer side of the book &#x2013; Australia consumer for example is only up $18 million with credit card loss rate still only around about the 3% territory.</p>
          <p>Looking now in more detail at that collective provision. I think last half we recognized the likely way that losses were going to play out and significantly bolster the collective provision. By definition now the collective provision has to reverse. It's not a reserve. It's an estimate of the level of losses inherent in the portfolio that you can't specifically identify. So as some of those potential risks that we could see inherent in the portfolio at 30 September have crystallized, we've released amounts of both the concentration risk provision and the economic cycle provision.</p>
          <p>Also recognizing the level of downgrades that took place during the first half. There was probably around about $140 million of collective provision that was released because those accounts have now moved into impaired loan status and we've taken up an individual provision.</p>
          <p>So that means, whilst there's a headline credit of 96 million in the background we've still taken up an additional around $350 million of collective provision and being offset by the releases that I mentioned and the downgrades of other accounts. So the 350 million is actually in terms of underlying credit is continuing the similar momentum that we've had in the past.</p>
          <p>Our collective provision cover ratio stands at 1.06% of credit risk-weighted assets, still very high by international standards and a little lower than what it was at the end of September last year, but of course at the end of September last year were a little higher because we said, hey, there are risks inherent in the portfolio here that should be reflected in the collective provision.</p>
          <p>In terms of our impaired loans, obviously the Institutional portfolio has caused a reasonable increase here. Again, Institutional is around about 75% of the growth in our impaired loans. And the growth here, of course, includes one item that last year we identified as being restructured. Skewed very much towards some property exposures and finance, as you can see from the chart in the top right hand corner.</p>
          <p>In terms of ratios, the ratio of gross impaired loans to lending is now about 2.7% in Institutional, compared to the Group's overall average of one. And is 0.32% within the Australian domestic business, and 0.66% in New Zealand, obviously higher in New Zealand reflecting the greater stress within New Zealand.</p>
          <p>General consumer portfolio arrears are trending upwards, but it's really still only relatively modest growth within that end of the sector.</p>
          <p>Looking at the credit intermediation charge, let's first of all remember that this is principally a mark-to-market charge. It is very volatile. It is driven by the volatility of the CDS spreads, which you can see on the bottom right hand corner here, and moves quite significantly on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>I think since we last spoke, this charge is much higher than was then the case. And that recognized that there was a significant increase in the spreads during the month of March. And there was also some tax adjustments that we needed to make. So that led to a significant increase in this charge.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the grey bar there on the chart, it gives some further indication of volatility that since the end of March, it's come back by about $200 million after tax because credit spreads have come down. So it is highly volatile. But at the same time, some of those mark-to-market gains on a hedging portfolio that we had as one of the adjustments in underlying earnings would have also contracted recognizing the change in spreads.</p>
          <p>A reminder that these trades have substantial levels of subordination, clearly with the extremely stressful credit environment, there has been some reduction in that level of subordination. But it's only been a small reduction in the level of subordination. So we continue to believe that the actual cash losses that would emerge from this portfolio will be substantially less than the mark-to-market. So the mark-to-market is indeed arguably a very, very conservative provision, which is much higher than the cash losses that we would actually expect to incur.</p>
          <p>Looking at capital. The capital ratio overall, as Mike said before, close on 8.2% Tier 1 ratio and 10% on the &#x2013; and FSA basis. But there is a rich story in some of the drivers behind this capital ratio that we've set out here. Notably that overall recognizing that there was only 2% lending growth end of period, the cost to the capital ratio of risk-weighted asset growth was modest, only about seven basis points.</p>
          <p>The next bar there though, the 28 basis points is what is often described as the pro-cyclicality effect. It's the combination of risk-weighted asset growth due to credit portfolio deterioration, plus the change in the Basel expected loss versus eligible provision, all expressed together to say what's been the impact on our Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>So that's about 3.5% reduction in our Tier 1 ratio in a half, so running at around about, say, 7% per annum growth, if you like, in your risk-weighted assets just simply from deterioration. But in times of economic stress, the number of other components of your capital calculations that are also impacted. You see there amongst those other deductions, if you look at the detail in the pack, you will see there is things like additional deduction for &#x2013; to fund benefit pension schemes, deductions for the growth in the any debit balance you have on your available for sale reserve. And some of those, mark-to-market hedging gains and own-name gains that we took up and backed out of underlying earnings get reversed out of the capital calculation and they are all amongst that minus 24.</p>
          <p>You will also notice over there deferred tax is a large deduction from capital, and this again is something you should expect at the downturn as you have more and more credit provisions building up, and indeed the credit intermediation trade CVA itself, which are not currently deductible and then potentially you build up your future income tax benefit and you typically have a higher deferred tax deduction.</p>
          <p>Then in there, there is a 17 basis point benefit which really reflects the learning experience on working with Basel II. As we progressively improve the way in which we structure business we do with our customers, as we optimize the way in which we provide them with the credit facilities and also some learnings in how best to use the Basel II rules. And for the half that was a 17 basis point improvement.</p>
          <p>So overall, a strong Tier 1 ratio with 8.2%. We of course though keep a close eye on those pro-cyclicality factors and some of those other issues as we work forward on thinking about our capital planning.</p>
          <p>So strong capital ratio and so with that I'll pass across to Mike.</p>

          <p>Peter, thank you. The Reserve Bank Governor, Glenn Stevens, said earlier this month that I think the reasonable person looking at all the information available would come to the conclusion that the Australian economy is in recession. Now, as you know, I have been a reasonable person for some time. But the financial crisis and economic slowdown in Australia and in New Zealand is playing out as we expected for over a year now. The bloodbath in financial services globally is now beginning to abate with some continuing positive signs that the system is at last beginning to stabilize. In the real economy, however, despite the rally in global equity markets over the last few weeks, there is no evidence that the world economy is yet bottoming.</p>
          <p>We have to be very realistic about this. The slow grind of rising provisions is well underway. And what's clear is that in this cycle, provisions are somewhat more front-ended than what we have been used to. And my rationale for this is that it's because of low interest rates which have not strained corporate cash flows as was the case in the early 90s. And therefore we are not getting the early warning signs of cash flow strain that we saw in the last cycle. We therefore have companies that moved from investment grade to basket case overnight.</p>
          <p>The outlook for provisions in the second half is therefore likely to be somewhat higher than the first half and we expect that trend actually to continue in the first half of 2010 and I would say this is a systemic issue.</p>
          <p>I said before that the prospects for the world economy in 2009 are, in a word, bleak. We have a global recession combined with a global financial crisis and the people &#x2013; those very reasonable people at the IMF have rightly pointed out that these double-barreled recessions are typically twice as long and twice as deep as normal ones, brilliant.</p>
          <p>I am actually not as gloomy as the IMF about Australia. The one thing that experience teaches you is that economic forecasts tend to overestimate growth as the economy begins to slow and they tend to underestimate it when it begins to recover. I don't expect the recession in Australia to be as deep or as protracted as other OECD economies and of course Asia, our region, remains the best performing part of the world economy.</p>
          <p>We expect GDP in Australia to contract by 1% this year with modest growth of close to 1% in 2010.</p>
          <p>In East Asia, excluding Japan, growth is expected to be around 3.5% this year and about 6.5% in 2010. This compares to an overall projected contraction of 3% in 2009 in the G7 countries.</p>
          <p>In this environment &#x2013; let me just reiterate another comment that Glenn Stevens made in his speech in Adelaide. He said, the government does not own, nor has had to give direct financial support to the banking system. Australia will be free of the difficult governance and exit strategy issues that such support is raising in a number of countries. And it's quite clear that the general public still don't fully understand this.</p>
          <p>The government has not put one cent of taxpayer money into the banking system. In fact, it is receiving substantial amounts of income for its wholesale guarantee program. Like all banks around the world, Australian banks are, however, operating in a very sensitive and difficult market. Part of this is the volatility in financial markets which is continuing to impact on the availability and the cost of funding. But as you can see from our underlying results, and from our customer satisfaction levels, and from the initiatives that we have announced to help customers in difficulty, we remain very focused on our customers engaging with the communities we serve and providing sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Many thanks for listening to us today. And we'll now be very happy to open it up for questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Craig Williams from Citi. Again today early in your presentation, you pointed out the importance of China and India to your super regional growth strategy. India in particular has been a notoriously difficult market to grow organically in the event that the RBI says it's required by another party how do you achieve your growth ambitions in the Indian market for your business?</p>

          <p>We are actually quite close we feel to actually getting our license approved in India. So that is quite positive. Obviously, India is in the throes of its election cycle at the moment.

          <p>Thanks. It's Matthew Davison from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. My question was just reconciling the bad debt guidance and the movement in the collective provision this period. Obviously, you've released the concentration related provisions and still added risk profile elsewhere. I'm just trying to interpret it going forward. Does that mean that you really see the problem stemming more from the middle market, the smaller business lines going forward and you don't expect to see such repeat of the single names you've had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good summary actually. The cycle comes in three stages. The first is always the, what I'll call the big ticket, it's only the top end of town and it normally picks on business models that don't necessarily work anymore or which has stressed with high leverage, but they are normally high profile names. The second phase is into the more middle market, corporate commercial names. And the third phase is really the SME and consumer side, which is driven very much by unemployment, which happens as a result of the first two stages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just on that point, you have had some fairly substantial single names already. With you not calling them to repeat, you must be looking at a very large number of potential watch list and problem loans elsewhere to be giving the guidance that you are regarding the bad debt charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's possibly conservative. I think that it's very hard to judge this. It's not a precise science. I just feel that with after 15 years of good times there has got to be an element of poor quality, there has to be. In 15 years badly run businesses can make money; right now they can't. And it's &#x2013; we're beginning to see that normalization happened, whereas good companies will still make good money and will still do well; poor companies will, as I say, hit the wall. And in the competitive environment that existed for the last 10 years, with all banks in Australia you've got to say that the credit quality was perhaps not as good as it maybe should have been, because the environment allowed that to happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mike and then Ron, you've got a question, just a little bit further down the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike McKerrow, Guild Insurance. Just to follow-up to Matt's question. It seems to me that your risk-weighted assets are a guide to bad debts. The bad debt quantum should rise as risk-weighted assets go up. At the moment with this charge and the charge in the second half of last year, it's sitting at about 1%. Your collective provision is also about 1% of risk-weighted assets. Are you satisfied that that's a sort of ratio that you'd expect over the next few years or are you suggesting to us that that ratio is still rising overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, well, in fact, you've really got to look at the overall provision coverage. So you got to look at collective plus IP, and that's about 1.6% of risk-weighted assets at the moment. Is that the right number? I think, it's roughly right, yeah. I feel comfortable with that number. You've got &#x2013; this is a juggling act a little bit and of course we have to be aware of the pro-cyclicality which means that we do have to keep a little bit more than perhaps we would have done in the past. I think that when you're looking at the growth in risk-weighted assets at the moment, almost half is coming from a deterioration in the book rather than in new business and you know that's something to bear in mind. And indeed the &#x2013; managing the capital in this situation is an art and indeed making sure that your risk-weighted assets do not rise too quickly is important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Turn to back. Just beside you I think Ron.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Johan Vanderlugt from Daiwa Securities. A question on the capital adequacy topic. People these days are pretty much worried about the Tier 1 capital, but I'd like to ask a question about your total capital ratio especially the composition of it. As a result of much higher investments in the JVs in &#x2013; with ING in Australia, New Zealand and also higher investments in the ADIs, your Tier 2 ratio drops from 3.4% to 2.8% half-on-half. My question is can we expect the same sort of dynamics to occur in second half, putting pressure on your Tier 1 ratio making a possible DRP underwriting necessary? And what's your take on the DRP underwriting in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the second part of the question first. As you know we have used the DRP underwriting successfully three times. I feel that that one's probably run its course a little bit. And I think that there are many ways of managing capital and there are many options open to us. We are operating a range or a target range of 7.5 to 8% Tier 1. And we have to look at ways of managing that. We are slightly over that right now, which is in this environment I think it is acceptable. I don't know for how long that will be, I think people are going to start to question whether or not we are holding &#x2013; or banks are holding too much capital. There will come a time when people will change their minds.</p>
          <p>But in terms of the Tier 2, obviously the investor appetite for Tier 2 capital is the issue there. I suspect that that market will open again much like the market for un-guaranteed longer-term debt is opening. I was quite encouraged to see that StanChart deal get away earlier this week, un-guaranteed euro deal, which previously very little had been out there. So obviously, investor appetite is beginning to re-emerge and is beginning to become a little bit more adventurous again. I wouldn't say our Tier 2 is adventurous, by the way. It's a very good product. So I think there will be more opportunity this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just pick up on one technical point in your question? The real reason for the drop in that Tier 2 ratio from 3.4% to 2.8% was a change in APRA's treatment of our investments overseas rather than the growth in them. Because they have gone from being where the goodwill on the investment was a &#x2013; certainly the goodwill was a 100% deduction from capital, the Tier 1 capitals are now being able to be a 50% deduction from Tier 1 and 50% from Tier 2. So you may have seen on the waterfall chart when we did the capital ratio we showed that the overall Tier 1 ratio went up by 39 basis points. And the flipside of that was a reduction in the Tier 2 ratio as it went from being a 100% Tier 1 deduction to now being a 50-50. So that's the real reason why it came down rather than a drag from our Asian investments per say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It looks like right now we don't have any more from the floor in Melbourne. So I hand over to Sydney. Here they are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Royal Bank of Scotland. I'll take a leaf out of Brian Johnson's book and ask a triple-barrel question here. First of all, just on the release of the collective provision. If you hadn't released that would you have been able to pay the $0.46 per share dividend?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I find it curious that you released the provision, but you're flagging further stress in the second half. And wouldn't it be better to actually keep an additional provision in that? And that's I suppose linked to the first question.</p>
          <p>And then finally just on your bad debt guidance. You are effectively flagging that bad debts for this year will be at least $2.8 billion, looking at where the first half number of 1.4 is, if not higher than that, and then substantially above $3 billion in FY '10 if I read your comments correctly, Michael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, to answer your first question, I mean it's &#x2013; the adjustment of provision is in accordance with the accounting rules and we have to be governed by what is a fair and accurate reflection of the risk. As to how much is in IP and how much is in CP is a judgment call. But you can't raise IP and then raise an awful lot of CP against the same risk. So there was an issue there. And I think that sort of answers question two as well, but you may want to say something on that Peter. Question three was &#x2013; what was that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bad debt guidance <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, bad debt guidance, I mean, certainly I feel that the second year is going to be &#x2013; the charge is going to be similar or higher than the first half. And I think that the first half of 2010 is going to have a similar number too. That's not to say the second half of 2010 is going to be higher. I suspect it won't be. I suspect it will start to come down. But giving guidance two years out as you would imagine in this environment is a fool's game. So you will hear more from me nearer the time, hopefully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just going back to your questions on the stress in the portfolio, and so forth. Remember that the collective provision can only provide for losses that are inherent in your portfolio today. So by definition it has to be reversing. And we looked to that portfolio at the end of 30 September and said, hey, look, there is a number of chunky accounts out there. We don't know which ones are going to be the ones that are going to be the problems. But some of them are going to be and we need to have the concentration provision for it. We think that situation has now clarified itself and so hence there has been a release.</p>
          <p>We also think that our own rating profiles have now caught up. And so you don't need the same level of economic cycle adjustment. This is a natural working of the process. The overall test, though, comes back to the collective provision cover ratio at 1.06% of credit risk-weighted assets. Remember, going came back to Mike McKerrow's question, the credit risk-weighted assets of course grow with risk, so the ratio by definition effectively taking out more each year simply because the credit risk-weighted assets is growing that 1.06 is still high by peer standards. And this current half included $350 million of extra collective provision for recognizing and allowance for new risks in the portfolio. So we're continuing to put aside collective provision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CSLA. Peter, I've got to say that seems to be exactly the inverse of the explanation that was given when you actually put away the oil stock provision. But that being said, I was wondering if we could flashback to slide number 40, if my eyes are correct, which is the improvement in the capital position. Peter if you look at it, the inverse of the collective provision write back is the expected loss deduction, which is not an arbitrary figure, and if you have a look there you will see that the increment to that was actually quite massive, and that is basically on the capital adequacy, which starts on page 110.</p>
          <p>If we're to have a look at that slide and we're to think that all the organic things on slide 40 stop at the minus 24 for the risk-weighted asset and expected loss risk everything before that is organic, then your capital position was flat after the dividend. And the only thing that actually made it look bigger was all these inorganic things, which you actually haven't got going forward. My point is didn't we really say this result not reflect your true ability to pay the dividend?</p>
          <p>Peter, to cut it another way, if you're to take the cash earnings result you've declared, take out the credit intermediation provisioning, take out the non-continuing business which sadly were there they during the period, take out the expected loss movement, the dividend, the real cash distributable earnings would have been about $0.35, but you paid out a dividend significantly higher. Could we get some reconciliation of what that means going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian very complex question there. But I don't think that you can look at the Basel II expected loss number and view it like a P&amp;L number. Remember the Basel II expected loss number is a capital measurement, not an expected loss measurement. Remember that why it's calculated is based on stressed events and not what you currently expect. So it's not something that you can then bring across and put into your P&amp;L calculation.</p>
          <p>Our divided for the half is $993 million, which is comfortably above the statutory profit. The Tier 1 ratio has been maintained across the half. Indeed, it's actually grown, but if you adjust for the change in APRA methodology, it's within 10 basis points from where it was at the beginning of the half. So I don't see a problem. Our level of organic profit growth was sufficient to fund the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter that was only by virtue of all those other factors. For example the prudential change on the goodwill, you wouldn't say that's something you'd expect to see that increment every period. It's the optimization of the risk-weighted assets. These are all things that you would not see going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, obviously the change in APRA's methodology, but remember, that took us from being 7.7 last year, which was a perfectly respectable ratio. Clearly, the change in the methodology really mean they changed the unit of measure. Didn't mean that the old 7.7 was inadequate, it just means there is now a new unit of measure being listed by that change in APRA methodology. Then in terms of &#x2013; sorry, what was the second part of your question then, Brian? I forgot the second part of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, when it all comes down to Peter the fact is that if we didn't have the change in methodology, we didn't have the risk optimization, your capital ratio would have gone down, not up, which would suggest that going forward to maintain these levels of dividend you're flagging increasing loan losses. You've got to be flagging capital raisings going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Brian, when you think about the optimization, optimization is just common sense. Optimization is sitting back and saying you've got to be thinking about how you're running your business, your restructuring, your credit portfolios to make sure that you're managing your capital efficiency. You would be expecting us to do that. And we will continue to do that. In fact you would think poorly of us to not do that. So that's all part of managing your capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian could I come in there as well? And so nice to have you back by the way. There are a couple of comments that I'd like to make on that. One is that when Basel II was introduced the banks had to introduce it in a hurry. And I think what had happened was that the actual compliance with Basel II was the end game. And the &#x2013; when people actually then looked at the business they were writing and balance sheets they were constructing, they weren't necessarily optimizing the efficiency of what Basel II actually created. And it's going to take some years I think for banks to work that one through. The good thing that we have is that that optimization process will actually release risk-weighted assets or reduce risk-weighted assets rather than increase them.</p>
          <p>To come back to your point on divided. Look, we will always pay what we can pay. But as we move forward what I would like to see is moving to a payout ratio which is rather than a specific number. I don't think that the market is probably quite ready for that but it is something that we do need to move forward to. And that ratio needs to be something that which will enable us to maintain sufficient capital to move our business forward without having to tap the market so regularly. So your point is correct.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I was just hoping I could get a little bit of comment on the revenue momentum moving into 2010. Obviously had some very poor loan growth particularly in Institutional business. The margins there had a bit of a benefit from the reclassification from &#x2013; in the insta business again from non-interest income through to the NIM. So I just want to get a clarification as to what you see for revenue momentum.</p>
          <p>And Peter, if you could actually just give us an idea as to how much that insta reclassification contributed to the Group margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your comment of poor loan growth in Institutional, if you think that this is a good time to grow Institutional assets then I would disagree with you. I think what is important is that we get a proper return for what we are actually &#x2013; for the balance sheet that we have out. And that's what we've been doing. We've been repricing our Institutional assets very aggressively. And that will continue. In terms of the other question Peter....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, James, the impact of the derivatives cash flows on the Group interest margin was 15 basis points. And that's, you see that's included within the document. And if you looked on page 48 of our results announcement you'll see we also gave the impact that that has on Institutional interest margins. And even backing out that accounting noise they had a 13-basis point improvement in their margin. So there is real underlying improvement in the margins going on within the Institutional business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to suggest then that the revenue growth moving into 2010 will be driven by the margin &#x2013; the margin expansion or further margin expansion for the Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's correct. I think what we are seeing &#x2013; and if you look at the overall net interest margin we are back to 2007 levels. Basically we got squeezed at the beginning of the credit crunch really with the cost of funding as markets exploded. And we are back to where we were in 2007. Now is 2007 the optimum time? No, I don't think it is. I think we now have to reflect the cost of credit and we have to cover those provisioning levels with increased margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Plus &#x2013; and James, of course, you don't reprice your entire book overnight. It takes time. You wait for facilities to come up to renewal so Institutional's probably only about 20, 25% through the program of repricing. So there is still scope which will emerge over the years ahead as spreads in business lending return to economically sensible levels.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jon Mott from UBS. I got a question about the bad and doubtful debt charge and really the deterioration over the last two months. If you look at the cash day-to-day number 1373 and you compare it to the 800 that you announced at the trading update for the October to January period. It means that those last two months, February and March, you saw a material blowout where it went to 573 million for those two months. And on top of that you had the release of the economic overlay which you can argue whether or not, you could &#x2013; should have utilized. If you didn't, it would actually mean those last two months would have gone out well over 800. My question really comes down what really happened in those last two months in the months of February and March that led to the material deterioration and why wasn't this foreseen going into the period at the end of February?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. I tried to address this James in my presentation. Because clearly these provisions are probably about $150 million higher than I think what was in the consensus. And that was essentially what happened to us in March. The individual provisions that came through in March were that order of magnitude higher than what we were forecasting. And it seemed to be a case that there was all of the effect of the government grants that were given prior to Christmas, reasonable Christmas retail sales and then February was very flat. And that pushed a number of the companies to the wall and we had a little blip in small to medium size type companies with higher credit losses. Now we thought, hang on, it's just a new trend that was emerging. And again, as I mentioned before, it's not continuing into April. That was the reason for the difference between the view that we had at the time of the trading update and what finally emerged for the half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not continuing to &#x2013; into the last month. I'm just looking at the trends on your &#x2013; the 30 to 59 day bucket on your page 92 and it looks like that bucket's continuing to expand. So you saw that bucket go from $1500 to almost $2 billion. So would have thought that it looks like that is continuing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, remember I was talking about companies that actually default, obviously as your rears go up there is a larger proportion of accounts that could default. But in terms of companies that actually got to the point where we say we didn't believe they were going to be able to pay their debts. That was the blip that occurred in March and has not continued into April. But Mike has said, we expect the provisions in the second half to be above what they were in the first half, so implicit in that with all of the inaccuracies associated with trying to forecast bad debts is some expectation that there will be some higher provisions emerging from our commercial segment. But it is very hard to forecast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs JBWere. Two questions. Firstly, just a quick point of clarification on slide 29 of the presentation. With the other non-core businesses can you just elaborate on why the other income is negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the other non-core businesses, this includes our private equity and alternate asset businesses and when &#x2013; if you are writing down the asset, whether it be private equity amount that you invested or some of the alternate asset investment that we have, such write-down of those assets is a negative income item. And to the extent that you've lent money to those companies that would come through as a bad debt. So that's why there is a negative income item. And indeed that negative income item was something we flagged at the time of the trading update. We said there was going to be a writedown of just over $100 million on the value of our alternate assets and private equity business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just another point on just the income. Just following from James' previous question, in terms of the revenue outlook, can you give us a feel for how you see trading income and global markets income holding up over the next few periods? Is this just a one-off blip or is it just due to increased market share? I mean, you talked about Asia, how you are growing your business out there. Can you just give us a feel for how that's going to trend in future periods and your expectations given the increased market share or wider margins whatever that may be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's going to be a combination of all of those things. I mean, will we have the sort of same trading income that we had in the first half? It is unlikely. I mean, every bank in the world was positioned for falling interest rates. You didn't need a genius to work that out. So I think that any bank that hasn't made a profit in markets in the first half has not been on the ball.</p>
          <p>But interest rates now don't really have that much further to go, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Certainly there is a little bit of room for movement here and in New Zealand. Perhaps we will not likely see that opportunity or the magnitude of that opportunity repeat itself. What is encouraging though is the amount of customer flow business and that has grown enormously. And that is frankly the type of business that we want in markets. It's got to be off the back of real customer business. And it is very encouraging to see that the growth, particularly in Asia, of that customer flow business has been substantial. So I would hope to see that increase significantly. And indeed that will offset and will be at a more sustainable and frankly a better quality of earning than purely trading.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. I'm just wondering what's the dollar value of watch and control list loans on slide 57 that are not yet classified as impaired assets. And how has that dollar value moved in the last six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, we've never disclosed the dollars associated with this because the trouble is that there is no standard for how you measure this. We tend to be very conservative when we take an account into watch and control. In fact, we have some high-quality investment grade names nonetheless on the watch-list just simply because we are wanting to keep a close eye on them. So that's &#x2013; the dollar is not something that we've disclosed. You can see that from the trend on chart 57 that they've grown and they also have stabilized over the last couple of months. So....</p>
          <p>Yeah, and when you look on the chart on the right hand side of that same page, you can see it is broadly distributed. Once we've got through these small number of larger names, there is no real single area of concentration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, can you give a sort of broad indication of the percentage of the portfolio, has it gone from say 50 basis points to 1.5%, that sort of order of magnitude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps the better thing to do Richard is actually to turn back to page 56, where we give you the overall risk grade profile of the Group's lending assets and also of Institutional's lending assets. And you can look at that part of the portfolio down there that is BB- or below. You can see that that's been creeping up from 5% at the end of March to now 7%. And in the case of the Institutional business is doubled over the last 12 months. And that's I think the rating profiles are probably the more meaningful things and the watch and control lists which are as much management devices for our overall credit management rather than the specific statement, particularly on the watch lists that we're actually worried about that account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's James Ellis from Credit Suisse. Just a question on your Tier 1 ratio and how you think about it relative to your peers? Acknowledging that you are comfortable with Tier 1 relative to where it's come from, relative to your targets, relative to APRA's requirements. But on the basis that &#x2013; on a pro forma, the peers are sitting may be 20 or 30 basis points higher on Tier 1, how do you think about your level of Tier 1 vis-&#xE0;-vis your peers opposed to other benchmarks on Tier 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important thing here is to manage within your own benchmarks. And I'm not really particularly fussed what the others are doing. We actually started to increase our capital ahead of anyone else. And indeed they've played catch-up with us. Maybe they'll start to move back down with us. I don't know. We'll see what happens. But I'm not too concerned what the others are doing. I think it's much more important that we are comfortable with where we sit, that the range is the correct one and indeed that we have various options with which to manage our overall capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Two questions, if I may. Firstly on provisioning, just interested to get your feel on how you assess the rate of deterioration in the book in terms of, typically we've had provisions on gross loans. Now, we are starting to talk about coverage on risk-weighted assets. If you are worried about drawdowns of cash flow, do you think it will ultimately get down to a provisioning as a function of exposure at default, what's out there? Just thought I'd get your thoughts on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope not. You want to answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. I think you would...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. I think this is an art not a science. There is a huge amount of intuitive behavior in it. I think that we can't just rely on ratings, particularly external ratings. You've really got to measure this by your own standards. And I think what we have at the moment seems to work. I mean, I think the real issue that we've got to contend with is the pro-cyclicality that we &#x2013; that in a falling or in a worsening economic environment we get the triple whammy of having to increase capital, having to find IP and also having CP increasing automatically. That can't be very healthy, frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second one just managing the Tier 1 ratio. As your risk-weighted asset base grows and you are confident that you are trying to maintain a Tier 1 ratio as opposed to a core Tier 1 ratio, just your thoughts on actually requiring to issue ordinary equity into that risk-weighted asset growth, if there aren't hybrids available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I mean, I think it's an interesting question. In terms of the hybrid market has obviously been open-closed, open-closed, open-closed. And again, as I &#x2013; we seem to be seeing a little bit more interest in that side of the market at the moment, but that core Tier 1 or real equity is actually quite an important ratio to manage anyway. And I actually think that that's one that people tend to miss at times and I think that that is frankly the most important part of that Tier 1 ratio, the core Tier 1 ratio. And again, you have to really judge the market or judge the opportunity as to when and if you need to raise capital and what the purpose of it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, it's William from Credit Suisse. I just wanted to gauge your experience on &#x2013; you've highlighted that to some extent or Peter has highlighted that to some extent cash flows in the middle market are proving a little less reliable on forecasting or giving lead indicators of potential doubtful debts emerging out of that. What indicators are you guys looking at or as you are going through, what are you using to try to get a forward gauge of how bad the credit situation could get?</p>
          <p>But then more optimistically on the other side, you also flagged that the IMF and most economists tend to overshoot on both the upside and the downside. What's the probability that you are being perhaps as some have said a bit pessimistic about the world and that maybe the recovery comes a bit sooner, but more importantly what are the metrics you are looking for that says, things are getting better not worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer the first question. I mean, what has happened, if you think back to the early 90s, the interest rates at the time were incredibly high and so you were able to see the stress on cash flow, because actually most of it was paying or a good part of it was actually having to pay interest and you could begin to see where the problems came quite a long way in advance.</p>
          <p>What is happening now is that the interest payment is very low and of course gearing is actually much lower than it was in the early 90s. So you are having to look for other signs and for example, stock levels, I think is still a good one. How far are average receivables out there? Has the cycle moved? Which it seems to have done from sort of 30 days to 90 days or longer in terms of receivables. Turnover, customer, concentration and indeed what is the tangible worth of the company? We've had a couple of instances where really we've been lending to a company that has one product to one customer, and you've got to say, well, that is never going to be a very sensible risk. So I think, it's coming back to Banking 101, William, frankly, it's getting back to some of those fundamental things that we all learned back in normal times.</p>
          <p>And I think that the relationship aspect is critical here. It's &#x2013; you don't find out if somebody is going wrong by sitting at your desk. What happens is that by &#x2013; well, you might read it in the paper by which time it's too late. You've got to go out and kick the tires and I think that's what we're encouraging our people to do.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second part of your question, I can't remember what it was, sorry.</p>
          <p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the indicators on the economic recovery. We're talking globally here. I'm still looking at where the U.S. housing market is going. I still think that that's a very key indicator. And it's really in the housing &#x2013; the percentage of the population who have housing. I mean, when that's gotten nearer to about 65%, I think we can see that things are going to stabilize. And I reckon at the moment, we are still seeing &#x2013; we're seeing some signs of improvement in California, some signs of improvement in Miami and Florida, but they were areas that have been pretty hard hit anyway. But I still think that that's a key one.</p>
          <p>In terms of here, I think, we just have to wait and see how the third phase of the economy hits the consumer side and that really is going to depend very much on the unemployment level. So I think that that's going to be the key thing to watch. And all companies, all the governments and everybody is looking at ways of actually making sure that we maintain employment. I don't have any magic answer, though, I'm afraid.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Brett Le Mesurier from Wilson HTM. Question on the provisioning, the regulatory expected loss has increased at twice the rate as the provisions in the last six months. In your slide pack, you say that the differential generally widens in a downturn due to stressed LGDs using the regulatory expected loss. My question is really why aren't you using stressed LGDs for your provisioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's two answers in there, Brett. First of all, remember that your regulatory expected loss is the aggregate of your actual individual provisions plus the regulatory expected loss calculation. So of course, the number has gone up because our level of individual provisions has more than doubled. So that's driving part of that increase to 441180.</p>
          <p>Do you use the stressed LGD? No. You should be using what you actually expect to lose. And remember the stressed LGD is context in the overall Basel II framework is effectively something that happens in a one in a thousand event. Now, it's all done around the same rules of how bank capital adequacy is worked out. So it's talking about events that are more extreme than what we are currently seeing. Whereas the collective provision and the individual provisions are based upon what we currently expect to lose in the event of default as oppose to what would happen in an extreme one in a thousand stress. Any other questions in Sydney?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CSLA again. Peter, this is a very quick question. If you have a look at the impaired assets disclosures, which are all pretty good, you used to disclose the dollar value of the new impaired assets that emerged during the period which is not simply the net of the movements, there is presumably write-offs. Could we get some commitment that we'll get that figure in '09?</p>

I think in the results announcement &#x2013; on page 26 of the results announcement document, the big fat one, we've got the new and increased impaired loans up there. So there is the gross. And likewise, we give you the new and increased provisions gross on page 23. So I think you'll find...</p>

          <p>Mike McKerrow again. Just on retail customer satisfaction, I might as well get Brian Hartzer involved, why are you improving in an environment where most people are feeling the pain? Why would the satisfaction level be improving? I know that it's not for some of the peers. But also one of your peers seems to be doing remarkably well. I assume that's because it's one of their key deliverables. Makes it very confusing when you just call them peer one, two and three.</p>
