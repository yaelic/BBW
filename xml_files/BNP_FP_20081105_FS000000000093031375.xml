          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the presentation of BNP Paribas 2008 Third Quarter Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded. Slides of the presentation are available on BNP Paribas Investor Relations website www.invest.bnpparibas.com. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Philippe Bordenave, Senior Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody. Thank you for attending this telephone conference. Well, we are facing the, say, the results of a period which has been impacted by an unprecedented crisis. Clearly, the impact of the financial crisis this quarter is indeed much higher than in previous quarters for BNP Paribas, but what has happened this quarter is of a completely different nature than in the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>In fact, if you look at the kind of normal crisis regime, I would say BNP Paribas continues to be less affected by markdowns on toxic exposures than most peers. The impact of markdown this quarter is around 400 million out of the 1.6 billion total impact, and those 400 million are very, is a very moderate figure compared to peers. And please remember that we have not been avoiding markdowns by reclassifying assets from the trading books to the banking book, unlike other banks.</p>
          <p>On the same mode, I would say that the monoline have been provided for at the level of 460 million, so it's again, the cost of monoline this quarter, it comes in the cost of risk, because the monolines inflations are doubtful. So, this is also something, which we are used to see, well, it is a pity, I hope it's not going to last too long. But it's something, which is kind of usual level and again it compares favorably with our competitors. But in addition to these now "usual" markdowns, what has happened this quarter is that the crisis of liquidity and of confidence and of all markets has peaked into what we could call a kind of a systemic risk events, putting the weakest financial institutions into survival mode. Some of these weakened situations have been rescued by the way, including the GSCs but with negative impact on the per shares as you've seen. And others have left, has been left into default, such as Lehman Brothers and such as also on a smaller scale, the Icelandic banks. And especially the Lehman failure has been the biggest default in the financial system in the recent years and clearly the defaults have had the direct impact on all banks and financial institutions working with them, including us.</p>
          <p>And this additional cost of the crisis, linked to the one-time default of financial institutions, adds up to around 800 million, so half of the total impact of the financial crisis for us. We believe that following the vigorous interventions of government in Europe and in the States, this systemic risk is now addressed and so we should not suffer these types of losses in the future. We need &#x2013; of course, we need to remain vigilant and to handle each situation with extreme care, but it shouldn't, I mean, be replicated in the future to such a level.</p>
          <p>And you should remember that even with this increased toll paid to the financial crisis and to the systemic risks having materialized, BNP Paribas is generating a net profit of close to 1 billion &#x2013; 900 million this quarter and this confirms the relative resilience of our diversified and prudent business model, I think. So this is a way to look at our overperformance, I would say, the impact of an unprecedented crisis on our results. I think that we can have a kind of summary of this by looking at slides on the slide of the return on equity, which is &#x2013; slide 13, where you see normally, it's going to come on your screen, where you can see that even in such an environment, the retail banking of BNP Paribas generated 1 billion for the quarter and for the whole of the year, well, for nine months of 2008, pre-tax return equity of 29%. Asset management and services were 134 million and 32% over the nine full months &#x2013; first months.</p>
          <p>And even CIB, which is breaking even &#x2013; just breaking even this quarter generated 12% as the return equity, pre-tax over the nine first months, which is I would say quite decent for such a year. And at the level of the group, we generated the first tax return on equity of a little bit more than 13%, with 4.4 billion net income after tax, which is I think, well, the evidence that BNP Paribas is able to generate revenues and earnings even in the more stressed situations.</p>
          <p>Now another way to look at it &#x2013; at our overperformance, I think is to look at the underlying trend. And clearly, if you look beyond the impact of the crisis at the underlying trend of the businesses, it's clear that our organic growth is well, it keeps growing and is even kind of reinforced by the crisis, ironically, due to the increase in attractivity of our bank, in comparison with this number of their competitors. And I would like to lead you through a few slides, only if you want &#x2013; don't worry. First, about CIB on slide 24, to show that the clients' revenues in the market activities and the financing activities as well of course, are high and keeps being high quarter after quarter during this crisis, and so are relatively stable, which is a kind of a reassuring message beyond the ups and downs of the trading results.</p>
          <p>And clearly, and it's said on slide 25, we have seen a high commercial business volume in &#x2013; across the board in CIB, especially this quarter in the, I mean the third quarter at the moment of the collapse of Lehman, there has been the kind of even additional volume due to the replacement of clients transactions formally with Lehman. But they came &#x2013; I think they came to us rather than coming to somebody else, maybe, well more because of our enhanced attractiveness. We are also seeing the good conditions and improving conditions in the financing businesses, with wider margins, shorter maturities and stricter covenants and so on, which shows that, I would say, beyond the market crisis, the underlying trend in CIB is positive.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management &amp; Services on page 23, I would like to stress the very strong performance in terms of inflows. I think we are among the very small number of big banks having a positive net asset inflows into third quarter of &#x20AC;7.4 billion, which is quite striking, and it comes from all the businesses in Asset Management &amp; Services, and especially, I would like to stress the very good performance of the private banking with 3.3 billion positive net inflows, while so many banks are seeing outflows. And the very good performance of the Asset Management business as well with 3.5 billion positive net inflows and primarily in money market funds, which shows that we are seen, to some extent, as a safe haven, and we are benefiting from the flight of quality. And so the assets and the management at 542 billion are almost stable, in the third quarter, which is really a very good performance.</p>
          <p>And now if I come to the retail activity, starting with French retail on page 16, I would like to stress that we opened 50,000 new accounts in net figures, net from the closing, the closed accounts and it's an amount which is quite high. I remind you that given the demographics in France and our market share, and we need something like 80,000 new accounts per year to keep our market share, so at the nine months we are almost twice that level, meaning that really, we are increasing our market share in retail in France. And I will like also to stress the very good development of the business, with corporate clients, with both a sharp growth in outstanding loans and very good cross-selling results, and also, very good trends in side deposits.</p>
          <p>And so, we have a growth in outstandings in France of both loans and deposits of around 10%, which is quite good. And well, which shows that the <mark type="inaudible" /> business is doing well. In Italy, as well, on page 18, we have a strong growth in outstanding loans and deposits, around 10%, again depending on the products for loans and mortgages, plus 7.6%; consumer lending, 11.7%; corporate, even more, 18%; and deposits, 4% in the context where to the Italian households have a kind of a trend towards bonds at the moment. But &#x2013; so 4% is a good achievement in the Italian context and definitely the loan growth is also beating the market. So we are gaining market share clearly in Italy. To a certain extent as far as corporate clients are concerned, we are regaining market share after say, some <mark type="inaudible" /> of years where BNL had seen its position eroded among Italy and corporate. So since BNL is part of BNP Paribas Group, the trend has been reversed and we are gaining market share.</p>
          <p>The same is also valid for BancWest on the next page, page 19 and we're beyond the revenues figures, which are say, handicapped by the one-off loss on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, because it's, it comes on revenues here because it's about shares. And beyond the negative dollar effect, I mean the revenues, at a constant exchange rate and excluding the one-off loss, are growing by 13.4%, which is extremely strong in the U.S. environment and clearly is indicating a market share gain. And you can see that the deposits are growing by 7.7%, the loans by 13%. So clearly, the volumes are very healthy and growing faster than the average of the market.</p>
          <p>And as far as the emerging markets are concerned on the next page, page 20, yes, we are developing in a certain number of countries throughout the Mediterranean region and Turkey and Ukraine at a very fast pace and we are very pleased both to increase the number of customers, we have now 4.5 million customers and to increase the volumes of deposits plus 28% over one year. In those countries, we care, it's very important to grow the deposits and the loans in parallel in order to avoid any liquidity, any local liquidity issue. And so this is what we are doing.</p>
          <p>So overall, all those figures, I think, are showing that we are enjoying a strong organic growth, which is, well, somewhat different from what some of our competitors are experiencing at the moment. And on top of this organic growth, I would like briefly, we could set the peak of the day, but I would just like to remind you with a cushion of 40, which is bringing a real expansion of our European footprint, which is really creating for BNP Paribas a unique positioning in Europe, with Eurozone is number one from a deposit base. And which is really the kind of transforming deal increasing very significantly the size and the scope, the size of BNP Paribas and of the capital of BNP Paribas, which is going to bring something like 16 billion Tier 1 capital and the scope of BNP Paribas. And so by looking at those underlying trends, I would say, it becomes clear that BNP Paribas is going to come out of the crisis, when the price is going to come down, there will be, I would say, two types of players.</p>
          <p>We are going to be among the players, with a stronger position, a wider scope. So we'll be wider scope, stronger position and a reinforced capital base without any dilution because this increase in capital will have been done in parallel with enlargement of this group. And it's going to be very different from the number of competitors who are going to come out of the crisis with a kind of smaller scope, or, they will have shrunk their activities because of the crisis on the defensive mode.</p>
          <p>And they will have to utilize their shareholders by issuing a different type of Tier 1 products, expensive Tier 1 products. And so, they will have probably, at the most, less revenues and more capital to compensate at the same time, so it's &#x2013; which is the definition of the dilution. And so, I think that this is what I wanted to say as kind of a introductory remark.</p>
          <p>And I'm now ready to answer to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will take our first question today from Kian Abouhossein from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the CIB negative revenue comment for October. I assume it's in the equity derivative business post dislocation. And if you could give us a little bit more color, if this is related to single option or index option flow business and also in the structuring business, kind of an indication of in what area?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to slide, page 75 on your commercial real estate exposure. I was wondering if you could give me an idea, what the other division actually is in terms of growth exposure and why that exposure has increased relative to the second quarter. And the third question I have is on the consumer finance provisions, which are running roughly at 200 basis points. If you could give any &#x2013; if you could discuss, maybe how this should progress going forward in your view. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Kian. So, let's answer to your question one after the other. On CIB, yes we have slightly negative revenues in October. Well, I think CIB revenues are roughly made of three parts, as we are showing them regularly. The kind of stable part is coming from the financing businesses and they are relatively stable around the 200 plus millions in and it's financing activities, revenues are relatively stable. So this is &#x2013; this is not changed in October. And then so the &#x2013; I would say the negative revenues, the losses came from the market, and in fact October markets were characterized by a situation, which was not only as hectic as in September, but even more, I would say and it has been, well, a period of extreme turbulence.</p>
          <p>And I would like to say that especially well, on the fixed-income side, I would say it's not brilliant, it has been difficult like I would say, since the beginning of the year, maybe a little bit more in these extremely stress periods. But it's close to zero, but slightly positive. And so the losses we incurred, and which are bringing back to zero minus, I would say the total revenues of the business line are coming from equity derivatives, in the context of equity markets, which are &#x2013; I mean which were extremely, I mean, in an well, hectic and an unprecedented way. And I would like to, as I was sure you would ask the question, Kian. I have prepared a slide for you and will &#x2013; it's a slide of the VIX index, the index of the volatility in the equity markets.</p>
          <p>And so, I think it's going to be put on your screens now, and if &#x2013; well this VIX index has already captured to the attention of analysts and investors in July 2007, because at the beginning of the crisis we had seen a peak at the level of 30. And at that time, people &#x2013; old people like myself had reminded everybody that in the past we had seen worst levels than 30, in fact in 98 or 2002 this index had been up to 40. And since in the slide, which is posted on your screens, normally it's very clear that since July 2007, there are several peaks and it's a very hectic evolution of this index between 20 and 30, several peaks at 30, and in September it went up to 40 and came back to very high levels, already seen in crisis times like '98 or 2002. But October, I mean it, was another story, I mean, it doubled from 40 to 80.</p>
          <p>And with several ups and downs between 70 and 50 in a few days or in one day in certain case. So it has been a real unprecedented period in terms of managing derivatives, equity derivatives books because the delta hedging becomes almost impossible because the management of the Greeks is something which is extremely, extremely difficult or even impossible in certain cases. And so we were in a situation where clearly the equity derivatives teams were facing a situation where &#x2013; well that was extremely difficult for them to cope with that. So the result is that they had losses and well clearly the revenues of equity are negative in October and so this is the story I would say.</p>
          <p>In equity derivatives, to answer even more precisely to your question because your question is very precise, it's a little bit across the board. It's not especially a certain category of team, it's definitely not the Volkswagen situation people saw at the same time, which was part of the hurricane I would say. But it's not that, it happens that we were not involved especially in that stock. But it's more across &#x2013; well a lot of difficult situations handled &#x2013; difficulty are handled across the board in equity.</p>
          <p>Now coming to your second question about the page 75, we &#x2013; well, you are referring to the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The 4.8 in the Other. First of all I was wondering what that is? And secondly, why it's increasing so materially from the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; yeah it's a 4.8 billion. Okay? It is that in U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is coming from 2.9 billion in June, this is your question? Well it's not an increase in actual position in fact. It's an enlargement of the definition since June. It's non-owner occupied commercial or industrial loans with collateral. And it's not a direct real estate risk in fact. Even if it's classified in &#x2013; it's classified in residential &#x2013; in commercial real estate because we're taking the good as collateral, the property as collateral. But it's more &#x2013; it was re-cost on the client on the corporate sales. So it's pretty much more commercial loan, and the increase is just due to a reclassification, a change of definition, enlargement of the definition.</p>
          <p>Now your next question is about consumer finance and the 200 basis points. And even, I would say, the 230 basis points in the third quarter, 200 is the average for the first nine months, for the third quarter, we have seen 230 basis points. Well, consumer finance is traditionally an early indicator of the cost of risk when an economy is slowing down. I think that's what's happening is that, and just that. We are clearly seeing the beginning of a recession in Europe. We have seen a negative evolution of the gross, the product in several countries in the third quarter &#x2013; in the second quarter, sorry, compared to the first quarter and we're already seeing the first signs of again a negative evolution in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And so this recession, beginning of a recession in Europe is taking its toll on the consumer finance activities. This is very clear and I think it's an evolution of all banks &#x2013; for all banks involved in consumer finance business. We &#x2013; what is the characteristics as far as we are concerned is that, we are among the countries most affected by this evolution I think, which are U.K., Ireland and Spain. And we are only active in significant way in Spain. We are not active in the U.K. or in Ireland. But in Spain, we do have some activity and on top of that, we 're seeing also the beginning of a significant deterioration of the credit quality also in Eastern Europe, in the first belt, I would say, of Eastern Europe countries, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and so on where our exposure is smaller.</p>
          <p>And so that I would say that most of the explanation of this increase in the cost of risk in consumer finance is coming from Spain and Eastern Europe. And well, we are taking action, of course. We are taking a number of actions in order to curb this evolution, this trend. But that kind of action requires some time before being translated into the figures. We are, well given the fact that the economy in Europe is probably going to remain relatively sluggish for the next few quarters in 2009, we are not expecting a strong improvement of these figures to become <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; clearly we were enjoying a low level of cost of risk in this business, with something like 100 basis points one year ago or something like that, one and half years ago. We are &#x2013; well, we're now at 200 something &#x2013; 200, 250, I think it's a level which is &#x2013; well, which remains &#x2013; well, which is high &#x2013; which is higher, but remains such as allowing significant profitability of the businesses in question, because the margins are adjusted and are relatively wide in that business. And we are of course adapting to the situation by, I would say, slowing down the production of new loans in the countries, where we are &#x2013; where we see the most of the problem, especially in Spain, where we have capped the production by 40% this quarter. And we &#x2013; the same in Eastern Europe and at the same time, we keep growing and well developing the business in the rest of Europe, where we see, I would say, a limited deterioration, only a limited deterioration of the credit quality. So I think that well we &#x2013; it's really due &#x2013; well, in our case it's really due to the Spanish situation mostly, in terms of volumes and we are taking action to limit that as much as possible.</p>

          <p>Our next question today will come from John Beisler with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi everybody. I had two questions, please. The first one was on slide 41, where you outlined your cost of risk by division. We heard from SocGen earlier that they kind of went through again what they estimated their mid-cycle cost of risk was and gave an idea of a stress test, where in a recession the cost of risk might be typically double the normalized rate. So I just wondered if you could remind us again what you feel your normalized rate is by division and on the assumption we are going into a recession, whether a double that rate might be appropriate at a stress test.</p>
          <p>And I had a second question, which was just on your hybrids. You show us on slide 31 that hybrids pro forma for Fortis are now up to about 20% of Tier 1 capital. And I just wondered if there was a hard upper limit, beyond which you'd have to start to think about measures to increase common equity if there was further losses because of the market environment ahead? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well the cost of risk, well the definition of a normalized cost of risk is a perilous exercise. We, yes, it's precisely well kind of giving a flavor of it that we are giving the slide 41 with &#x2013; we are providing you with an overview long-term, overview of what happened in the past. So, you &#x2013; well I don't want to give you really specific figures because it's something which is difficult. I may make &#x2013; on the basis of slide 41, I can make some qualitative comments. In the French Retail Banking and taking the five points &#x2013; the five activities because it's where the cost of risk is lying, on the French Retail business, we have a very low custom risk, we are half &#x2013; well it's more or less half the cost of risk of most of our competitors in France, including the one you have quoted.</p>
          <p>And we really think that we have made a very strong selection of the quality of our clients on the time and that we in a period of recession or in period of financial recession, the gap between our cost of risk and the cost of risk of competitors should not only remain the same, but even widened because it's when you stretched (40.42) the environment that the difference in cost of risks are showing up the most. So we can only expect an increase in cost of risk in a risk while in a risk scenario environment, which is looming for the whole of Europe. But we are rather confident that it shouldn't be that big and certainly not doubling the current level or the level of 2006 or 2007, while which I think that really the quality of the portfolio is very good.</p>
          <p>In Italy, it's the same, we should see an increase in the cost of risk due to the economic environment. Well, to a certain extent, we have provided &#x2013; we have reserved in Italy, I would say, following the Group's <mark type="inaudible" /> (41.55), so we are well reserved, like we were in the Group. And so already the best views are the 90 days &#x2013; those views are qualified as doubtful and are reserved, which is not the case of the Italian banks, as you know. And so we are ahead, if you want, of the trend. To some extent, we have the kind of excellent &#x2013; beginning of the kind of excellent provisioning with the best use provisioning. So we probably would see a deterioration. So again we are not expecting a quite doubling from the current level, far, far from that.</p>
          <p>Now in BancWest &#x2013; in BancWest, the cost of risk at the moment is the addition of two paths, the red path on the slide, slide 41 you are referring to is the kind of exceptional path, which is the direct impact of the financial crisis and should come down to the euro progressively. We hope that the red &#x2013; the green path, sorry, which is more normal cost of risk on the loan portfolio is increasing very fast in the U.S. environment and it may keep increasing further, depending on the depths of the recession in BancWest. But as the grey path, the additional exceptional cost of risk on especially on the portfolio, on the investment portfolio, the impairments of new investment portfolio should come down with time. And that the total of both, may be not going to grow that much.</p>
          <p>And then PF, Personal Finance, while we have just talked about it, probably it will keep growing. I mean we were in the region of 130, as I would think. Now we are more in the region of 230, while it may go further than that. And in CIB, in CIB I think the quarter is characterized by the Lehman failure, so there is a big one-off effect I would say on CIB. But, the &#x2013; if you adjust for that, you see that arrange <mark type="inaudible" /> (44.51) of the cost of the risk, which is the underlying cost of risk, remains very low at the moment, very, very low, last one almost zero in terms of basis points. And in this quarter it swung from a net price back to a positive, though this quarter it's 24 basis points. So it's &#x2013; and I think that this kind of level maybe 20 basis points is a more normal level for CIB and in the crisis while it could go up to, you see that in 2002, 2003, it went up to 60, so it gives you a flavor of what it can be in threat conditions.</p>
          <p>So that's it I think, so I don't know if I have completely answered your question. But at least you have some ideas of our way of thinking about the cost of risks. So overall, the trend is up clearly given the environment. But given the levels we have reached now, maybe not in a dramatic way.</p>
          <p>Now you are referring on slide 31 for hybrid, let me go to slide 31. Yes, yes, the Fortis acquisition will bring both, I would say hybrids and common equity, it will bring 9 billion capital increase, which is going to be a real common equity, plus 6 billions in minority interest. And so it's going to bring a real common equity for a significant amount, I would say, plus something like 3 billion hybrids. So, yes, there is a balance and the French State is only bringing hybrids, but this is fortunate I would say.</p>
          <p>So, yes, there is a balance to be kept. You know that in the &#x2013; in Europe, the accepted &#x2013; the regulatorily acceptable level of hybrid is different from one country to another. We were living in France, with the feeling of 25% of hybrids. And we &#x2013; well we managed the bank by growing <mark type="inaudible" /> in parallel the common &#x2013; the common equity and the hybrids, in order to keep this proportion more or less 75%, 25%. And there are currently discussions at the European level in order to harmonize these proportions and so that the middle point, which could be chosen or has been already chosen, it has been returned already, I think it's official, the kind of compromise, which has been found between different countries is to increase the proportion of hybrids, to accept the proportion of hybrid up to 35%, having in mind that in certain countries, it was much more than that, even 50 or something like that.</p>
          <p>So we may have the opportunity of increasing a little bit of the proportion of hybrids in context. Well anyway, I think it's healthy exercise to keep I would say hybrids as a proportion of total of Q1, which is not too high. I think 25% when service, something which is reasonable. And we &#x2013; well, and we are generating, the good thing is that with the results quarter-to-quarter we are generating common equity and not hybrid. So it's helping us in the evolution.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Just a quick question and it's on leverage. Your balance sheet size is even bigger now after the Fortis acquisition, with 2.5 trillion. And let's say that the equity to asset ratio is effectively below the average in Europe. Would you agree in identifying these as the major question mark of your story at the moment? And if yes, what do you see as potential actions improving the ratio, I'm thinking about available for sale reserve for instance. And also, if you can provide us an update on the dividend expectations for this year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio, the leverage ratio is a kind of outdated way of -- a very simplistic and outdated way of analyzing a bank's balance sheet, I think. It's what I call Basel 0. And I'm not the only one to do so, by the way. I have observed that Deutsche Bank has explained that depending on the accounting standards you have a very different leverage ratio. And they have even provided the market with a slide explaining that because they are reporting their results in both <mark type="inaudible" /> and IFRS because in the IFRS it's 2 trillion at the end of September. And in U.S. GAAP, it's 1.3. So, I mean, it's one third of the balance sheet is about so you can improve easily your leverage ratio, if you change your accounting standards from the IFRS to U.S. GAAP, first.</p>
          <p>Another sure way to improve the leverage ratio is to build a structured investment vehicle, you know, a SIV, so because it goes out of your balance sheet and with off balance sheet commitments you have exactly the same risk in practice as has been shown by the crisis. But the leverage ratio is quite okay. So really the leverage ratio, I think, it's not something, which is really significant. I think that really it's difficult to stop talking I think. It's difficult to analyze a bank's balance sheet because it's very complicated are there are a lot of products. And even more, the off balance sheet commitments, which can be even more dangerous than the balance sheet volume. And so really I think the story of the regulation over the last &#x2013; and the rating agencies as well &#x2013; over the last years, has been to try to improve the merger of the risk and to &#x2013; trying to come to a merger which is as much risk sensitive as possible.</p>
          <p>And so the move from Basel I to Basel II is clearly inspired by this idea of coming closer to the risk. And really I think that at this stage I don't see any better merger of the real leverage of the Bank than the Basel II ratio. And I think that we should stick to that. And as it's not completely comparative due to a certain number of risks, we shall not taken into account &#x2013; still not taken into account in the Basel II ratio, they have invented the so-called Pillar II in order to add to the level which is required from the banks, the standard level, 4%, 8% to add to that layer, which tries to take into consideration the other risk, which of course the regulators know, or are supposed to know. And know, in fact, if really I think, if they are doing their job properly.</p>
          <p>And so this level of the Tier II level, minimum level, is also I think showing what is the real leverage of a bank meaning that, if beyond the Pillar I measure if a bank is leveraged in another way, which is less easy or not quantified, not captured by the Pillar I, the regulator can impose a higher Tier I on that bank in order to make sure that, I would say, the risks are properly covered by the Tier I capital. So I think it's the way it works and any shortcut I think is really counter-productive in the analysis of the risk.</p>
          <p>And so this is about &#x2013; now the dividend, the dividend, well as we always say, we are not changing, as we always say the dividend is -.</p>

          <p>Sorry. So the dividend is the decision of the Board, which is taken, you know, it's going to be taken in February upon the full-year results. We don't want to anticipate or to pre-empt this decision. And when we are calculating our ratios, we are taking just as a kind of theoretical assumption, the same payout ratio than last year, which is 40%. But for sure over nine months, our net income, Group share, is 4.4 billion, so we are clearly among the banks at least able to pay a dividend, which there are not that many today. And it's something to bear in mind, but I think that's all we can say at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few questions. The first one is regarding the performance of revenues in the corporate investment bank (sic) [Corporate and Investment Banking] , I'm talking up to the second &#x2013; the third quarter. Is there a form of, I mean aren't we exposed to a form of inflation of revenues? Because on the first hand, you have a switch into more stable, more attractive banks in this environment, which you benefit from, but on the other hand also maybe there is an additional activity related to volatility in the markets. So these two phenomena maybe will disappear over time, not disappear fully, but maybe we're seeing a kind of peak. And we might have the impression that revenues are very strong, but maybe there will be a correction as the competitive aspect maybe slows down and the volatility changes as well?</p>
          <p>That was the first point. The second was regarding Fortis. I mean, do you see some legal risk in the transactions in view of the series of legal challenges we see both into The Netherlands and Belgium? And also in your information, is the franchise suffering by trans leaving the bank on the country benefiting for the moment. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the CIB revenues, I think we will have to make a distinction between the financing revenues and the market revenues, I think. The two situations are very different. On the financing revenues part, I think clearly that we are benefiting from, yes, from new clients and good evolution of the business. But also from widened margins, better conditions and I think this is going &#x2013; this is poised to stay like that for some time now. I think really that what we are going to &#x2013; the crisis is really a crisis of disintermediation. Over the last few years, the financing businesses were really in competition with kind of shortcut or short circuits which were organized by investment banks and investors. And all that has disappeared now.</p>
          <p>There is a reluctance of all the non-banking world to take credit risk. And so I think that to a certain extent we are back to a period where banks were more or less the only ones to lend money to corporates, to the economy. And this is favorable in terms of margins. It is favorable in terms of volumes. So and this is going to remain like that for quite some time, I think. It's slightly early that... So this, I wouldn't say that on that part there is the risk that it would vanish rapidly.</p>
          <p>On the market revenues, there you have something different, because you have the client business and then the trading revenues. And clearly, even if both are linked, in our case, as we don't have significant prop trading activities, I would say, both are the two sides of the same coin.</p>
          <p>But you may have a lot of client revenues and not a lot of gains, because if &#x2013; and it's what happened in October for example, where you may have a lot of client business, due to as you said some extreme volatility or &#x2013; clients in October, clearly in equity derivative clients, were one-way. All of them were doing the same thing at the same time. And then as a bank, as a market maker, a bank, you are dealing with them and you are writing a huge number of tickets. But after that, the traders have a lot of difficulties managing the books and they may not only not gain, but they may even lose money in difficult markets.</p>
          <p>So, I think that the way you have to look at the market's revenue is that there's a kind of underlying trend which is given by the client volumes, but around this underlying trend, there is a lot of volatility of the trading actual revenues. And it's clearly seen if you take back, for example, on page 24, if you look at the &#x2013; since the beginning of the crisis with client revenues almost stable throughout,  we had very good quarters like the third quarter in terms of revenues, 2.1 and that quarter at 1.3 having in mind that again the financing businesses are providing that with a basis of roughly 600 to 700 per quarter. So, it means that from the market side, it may vary a lot from around the trend.</p>
          <p>So, I think that rather than speaking of inflation of revenues, I would more speak of volatility, inherent volatility of market revenues. And yes, in the third quarter, we had clearly a kind of good despite the crisis. It was relatively a good quarter in terms of revenues. I mean the pain of the crisis was felt more on the cost of risk but in other quarters, it has been the other way around and it may be again the other way round.</p>
          <p>Now, on Fortis. On Fortis, the legal risk on Fortis. Well, when there is such an acquisition in such a kind of rescue package, I would say, which leads to such a transaction, it's very usual for some people to protest because they have been really taken by surprise and they have not really seen what was happening in reality because they are relatively far from the day-to-day life of Fortis. And so they don't understand what happened. So, we have some &#x2013; the legal procedures are a kind of reaction to that which is relatively usual in such circumstances. While, we don't want to comment on legal procedures. I think it's not, well, we don't want to comment on legal procedures and they are going to be, well, handled and managed by the judges and that's well that way.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding the client outflows and inflows, it's very clear, I mean Fortis was <mark type="inaudible" /> huge outflows of deposits and clients until the rescue. Since now the future is clearer, I would say, both in the Netherlands and in Belgium and Luxembourg and especially as far as we are concerned in Belgium and Luxembourg, we are seeing a very positive reaction of clients and the situation of Fortis has improved a lot. Clearly, not completely I would say but significantly. And I guess that once the deal will be completed, of course, Fortis will fully benefit from the BNP Paribas rating and funding conditions and it's going to be, of course, even better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And may I ask just a follow-up question on my colleague from Nomura, John.  On the loan loss charges, how do you see the dynamics of that progression? You expect an acceleration at some point. How do you see the evolution over the quarters, if you look into your crystal ball?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't have a crystal ball. Sorry. And as I said, we &#x2013; and it's not the matter of a quarter, it's more it's a question, it's probably a trend going to last a little bit longer than just the fourth quarter. I think we are in a <mark type="inaudible" /> economic period, in the period of the economic cycle where necessarily the cost of risk will go up. I mean ex the crisis impact, I mean the underlying cost of risk will go up and, well, we are not expecting I think what I have discussed on a case by case, business by business is showing that we are not expecting a dramatic increase, but clearly an increase, yes.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have got a few questions. One related to IAS 39. I understand you haven't switched anything yet, but will you in Q4 and which assets and how much? Secondly, the risk-weighted assets are up 20 billion during Q3. Could you maybe just explain how much of that is driven by the increase in the dollar? Thirdly, on other counterparty losses, we find it difficult to assess quarter-after-quarter what could pop up in terms of other counterparties. Could you give us maybe a feel as to what exactly that is, how big is the amount, and how can we forecast that better?</p>
          <p>And finally on Fortis, the structured credit portfolio that you are going to acquire, can you give us a feel as to how that portfolio developed during the month of October which has been pretty horrible? And finally, on the legal risk again, can you, I can appreciate you don't want to comment on the possible outcome, but can you just say whether you could be liable for any legal risk? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No liable, I repeat the answer to your last question, because as we &#x2013; no liable for any legal risk, no. The only "risk" because, well, there are two kinds of procedures which have started, while are trying to, yes, to find some liability of the former managers or Board members or whatever of Fortis because they wouldn't and there was a plaintiff saying that they wouldn't have said enough or they wouldn't have disclosed enough or things like that but we are not involved in that at all. So, it's not our liability which is in question.</p>
          <p>And so those procedures are not involving us at all, in fact. I hope no consequence on ourselves. And the other kind of procedures are saying that we are not paying enough or something like that about the price and maybe Fortis. They said the plaintiff, I think, that Fortis was not in such a bad situation. So, it is the opposite to the first way and the first category. And in that the only thing which is at stake, I would say, as far as we are concerned is the implementation of the transaction, no, the set number of such procedures asking the judge to stop or to suspend the transaction. But there is no liability issue. So, this is the last question.</p>
          <p>Now, coming back to the third question, IAS 39. We, thank you for the question because that's something &#x2013; issues are something which I think are extremely important and I personally like in terms of very exciting intellectually, I would say. And I think really that this change, this reform, this amendment to IAS 39 is a good one. We were asking for that for several years, in fact, since the beginning of the implementation of IAS 39 and the switchover to the IFRS in 2005 and before even in the preparation because it's just common sense.  It's just common sense. There is no point in keeping assets which are completely illiquid in the trading book. I mean assets in trading book should be, by definition of what is trading, the assets in the trading book should be tradable. It should be possible to buy and sell them. If the market changed so dramatically, that assets which used to be tradable are not tradable anymore which is the current situation for some of our assets but may happen again in the future, I mean at anytime.</p>
          <p>In that case, yes, it's quite normal. It should almost be close to mandatory. I exaggerate a bit but clearly, it shouldn't stay in the trading books. I mean it should be quite normal to reclassify it in what we call banking book, I mean, depending on the assets. It can be the loans book or it can be in the valuable for sale on the health maturity book depending on the asset.</p>
          <p>So, in principle, we are not in favor of this amendment. We have decided not to apply it in the third quarter retroactively if you want because, well, for two reasons basically. One is that the ruling was issued on October 21st and we decided we should not thrust in implementing it. Until the end, there was some uncertainty about the scope of the ruling and so it came late in the closing process and it would have disturbed the closing process which has started the way, I mean the classical way.</p>
          <p>And also I have to say, we were not completely comfortable with the concept of transferring assets in October at the July price because one of the key aspects of the standard is that, of course it's allowed to transfer assets to reclassify assets from the trading book to a banking book, but at the price of the transfer day not at the former purchase price, of course because it has to be neutral for the results. So that's why it was a little bit my fault &#x2013; to do that at the July price when we were in October. So I think we are not completely comfortable with that concept.</p>
          <p>So I have noticed that other banks have chosen to do so, which is their right. That's actually their right, and especially I'm pleased to see that several non-French Banks, I mean, I have heard of Deutsche, UBS and RBS, I'm not sure it is completely true but it is what I have heard, have decided to implement it starting beginning of July, which shows that this is a &#x2013; the amendment to the standard which was really needed by a lot of different players.</p>
          <p>And so we are going of course to apply this standard now, now that it is in force. We're going to apply this amendment and we are going most probably, really we're going to transfer some assets from the trading book to the banking book in the fourth quarter. We have not yet completely, I mean, we have closed the accounts of third quarter accounts, so we have not yet completely chosen what kind of assets we are going to transfer. I don't want to comment further on that. What is sure is that, given the fact that these amendments, the standard, it requires a very precise disclosure. You will see in the notes to the financial statements and when we issue the fourth quarter results, all the details are going to be given, and even so the impact on the accounts are going to be calculated backlog, I would say. And so you will be able to follow that in detail.</p>
          <p>Now on the credit adjustments on further counter-parties. Yes, well, what &#x2013; the amount corresponds to the trade value adjustments for the whole portfolio of derivative trades, except the monoline. We are applying the credit adjustment mechanism to all our derivative trade. And whatever, I mean, the client, whatever the counter-party, including clients, including old banks and colleagues and so on. And on each counterpart, we make the sense of same calculation, which is based on the CDS of this counterpart. And as such when the CDS are widening and this is what happens in a very dramatic way at the end of September. Clearly, mechanically I would say the credit adjustments are increased. So this general widening of CDS threat for both financial and corporate counterparts between end of June and end of September led to an increase in the CDA. It's quite basic in fact. It doesn't mean really, as I have already said, this part is not necessarily going to lead to any loss contrary to the monoline issues where there will be a real losses clearly. The September memorandum now doubtful and clearly I'm not going to pay and the line is partly based on residential structured products, which are going to not compare fully what those investments, which has been putting in. So hold that on the monoline side, there are going to be real losses at the end.</p>
          <p>On this side, on the general derivatives with all our counter-parties, normally, there won't be any loss at the end. It's just a mark-to-market of the credit adjustments, which has to be done because it started the mark-to-market logic of the trading book of, I mean, the trading derivatives book, but it should not necessarily transfer into actual losses at the end.</p>
          <p>Now, I think I answered to a lot of things. So, the structured credit portfolio of Fortis in October, I think there is nothing specific to mention. It's of course, well, I mean, I think this is still &#x2013; it's still part of Fortis account and not in Paribas account. So I don't want to comment on that really.</p>
          <p>And the risk-weighted assets, where is the next question, the risk-weighted assets up 20 billion in Q3. The dollar effect on that and the dollar Q3 versus Q2, which is your question, increased by in fact more than 10%. But you're referring to the risk-weighted assets at the end of the quarter, so it's increasing. Sorry, your question is referring to the <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the risk-weighted assets increased 20 billion between Q2 and Q3. And I want to know how much of the 20 billion is simply due to the dollar effect and how much is organic growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so again it's-the dollar went up by 10%, more than 10%, during this quarter and you have to apply that to a total dollar balance sheet, which is our risk-weighted &#x2013; our total risk-weighted assets take something like one third denominated in dollars. So it's &#x2013; let's say probably well, it maybe about 10 to 15 billion out of the 20. Something like that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Philippe. I have a follow-up question first on risk-weighted assets. I'm curious to know if the Basel II accounting has had a negative effect in terms of growth on the risk-weighted assets. And beyond that could we have an idea of what you're planning for 2009. Should we take up some measures &#x2013; the 4% differential amount pushing you to or could it be different?</p>
          <p>I have a second question, which is regarding the sponsored vehicles. It has now the proportion of commercial paper which is owed by BNP has reached 30% of the total of the sponsored vehicles against 16% in Q2. Is it the trend which could lead to a consolidation of some of these SIV?</p>
          <p>And my third question would be on monolines. You mentioned that the other group really incurs real losses. We have just seen Ambac and MBIA coming again with additional losses in Q3. Is there any array of blue sky we could imagine on sub-stage or do we have to wait to see the <mark type="inaudible" /> quarter-after-quarter on this foreseeable future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the sponsored vehicles, very briefly, it came down now to 12% at the end of October. The figure at the end of September was high. It varies a lot depending on the appetite of the market for commercial paper. And in periods of I would say crisis or confidence of the market it may go up and it's sense is an example of the situation at the end of September in the wake of the Lehman failure and it lasted in October for the first half of October was also relatively high and then it came back to two points. It was this kind of situation is the control I would say and it doesn't, it doesn't imply also consolidation in itself, if it doesn't last too long.</p>
          <p>I remind you that at the beginning of the crisis, we had made a theoretical exercise of what would be the consequences of consolidation of these vehicles. And we &#x2013; it was relatively minimal, it was 10 basis points, 10 to 15 basis points of Tier 1 ratio. So it was relatively limited as an impact. There is no consolidation looming at the moment, really. And now the Basel II risk-weighted asset, I don't know what's, your question is about, what do you, the pro-cyclicality what do you mean in your -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly about the pro-cyclicality of the accounting rules and the weighting rules for assets, especially when a certain level of the rating is bridged?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, we give you some indications about that in that sense that we are, since the beginning of the year, we are providing you with the official risk-weighted assets, which are in fact floored at 90% of the Basel I risk-weighted assets. So it gives you, I would say, the Basel I evolution. So this is the official figure of those ones at the moment due to the floor. And we are also providing you with the EX flow figures, meaning the pure Basel II figures, and so you can compare both evolutions, the Basel I evolution and the Basel II evolution. And in fact the difference between those has slightly reduced, has been slightly reduced by 10 basis points between the beginning of the year and now.</p>
          <p>So up to now, we can say &#x2013; up to now the difference in procyclicality between Basel II and Basel I, up to now has been relatively limited. But it may worsen in the future, but well, we are observing that with care, we are watching that with a lot of care and up to now the difference is not too &#x2013; . I remind you that in theory at least, the procyclicality of Basel II should be mitigated by a certain number of factors. The first factor is that in the internal models, the rating, the internal rating is theoretically attributed through the cycle, with a through cycle view and as such, it shouldn't change too much in bad times or in good times. And so this rating is fixing the probability of default, which is taken in the models.</p>
          <p>And the other big parameter of the model, which is the loss given before, is also supposed to be relatively immune from the cycle because it has to be a downturn loss given before, so it has to be a worst-case scenario if you want. So it shouldn't be changed either, normally if, even in bad time. So we, in theory, but I agree with you that practice sometimes differs from theory. In theory, it shouldn't be too much procyclical, I definitely expect, like you, that it will be somewhat procyclical compared with Basel I. We have seen that at the level of 10 basis points in the beginning of the year and we are watching the situation.</p>
          <p>And now the next question about the monolines, yes, the monolines, they have, yes, of course they are losing money in Q3, I mean for the same reasons then our exposure on them is growing, because they are marking their commitments to us, they are &#x2013; what they owe &#x2013; what they potentially owe to the market is increasing because of the widening of the spreads. So the widening of the &#x2013; of the general widening of the spreads is, among different consequences, as a consequence that the theoretical debt, potential debt of the monoline, is increasing and as such they have to mark it in their exempt P&amp;L, I guess, I'm not an expert in insurance, especially monoline insurance accounting. But they have to mark the increase in the potential debt, they have vis-&#xE0;-vis the market. But it doesn't mean that these variations in spreads are translating into immediate losses because, actual losses if you want, because, beyond the accounting losses, because the monoline system, as the general monoline practice, the documentation of protection as well on CDOs or CLOs or whatever, is much more protective for the liquidity than the ISDA standard usual CDS standard, CDS contract.</p>
          <p>The events triggering the payments by the monoline is not the variation of the mark-to-market but it's restricted to only interest shortfalls and failure to pay, default principal at the end, at the maturity of the bond, or upon the winding up of the CDO. So the &#x2013; as a result, if you want, monoline has the possibility to pay only &#x2013; to pay the interest shortfalls only during the whole life of the contract and to pay the principal write-down only at the end, at the final legal maturity of the bond, which could be in 10 or 15 or 20 years time. So the liquidity of the monoline is protected and this is why they <mark type="inaudible" /> I am not bankrupt as of now and this is why they keep a good rating as well. I mean, even if they are not, all of them are not, not necessarily AAA anymore, but now AA, I think that's which are showing that everything is not that bad, because they have a lot of &#x2013; they don't have to post collateral, because they don't have any liquidity issue, and they have to &#x2013; they have the timing for them as well. So this is why, and in between the mark-to-market may change and each time the spreads are becoming &#x2013; are tightening, in fact it's a reverse effect, so the situation of the monoline is not necessarily desperate, at least not all of them.</p>

          <p>I just have a follow-up on this one. I understand that this is a specific situation, which pushes some <mark type="inaudible" /> some clients of monolines to accept commutations, could you tell us, if we could expect being paid to engage into commutation negotiation with some of its monoline insurers?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>High, good afternoon. Just on two areas. The first is on costs. The cost impairment looks good across the Board, particularly wondered if you could talk a bit more about your intentions in French retail banking, given you've got zero cost growth now, Q2, Q3? And also on the investment bank, I understand that you're obviously passing on all the write-downs to the staff, but I mean, could you discuss if there's a limit to how far you can do that relative to what your competitors are doing? And then the other area was just this whole issue of the appetite for structured products, whether the market's maturing? And I was just wondering if you could comment how that's &#x2013; what's happening now to potential &#x2013; to sales of structured products or demand for structured products, particularly obviously next to derivatives, given the downturn in markets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, on the cost side, we have said the French retail banking is confirmed. Yes, we have managed to come back to Europe's growth, due to, it's due to a combination of mostly two or three things in fact. We have first prepared for the current situation which we are, which we had on key basis somewhat, meaning that clearly the revenues and especially the finance role fees are traditional, we had, well it was relatively foreseeable so we have taken measures in order to free up costs in anticipation of the tightening revenue alignments, if you want. So we, the staffing levels have come down. We have achieved efficiency gains, held by the shape of the hedge pyramid especially in the back offices and the operations.</p>
          <p>And so &#x2013; and this quarter, in fact staffing levels were further reduced, thanks to the natural turnover. So we are &#x2013; this is one thing. The second thing is that we have also adjusted some investments, especially the branch refurbishing plan, as well as IT deployment plans. And so this is second thing, so we are delaying, we will beat southern border investments which can wait for one year or two, if you want it. And the third thing is that, a non-insignificant part of the staff compensation is now performance-based, or group profit-based. And so the result of these kind of profit-sharing schemes were relatively high in 2007, and are going to be much lower this year, and especially there is a link with the revenues.</p>
          <p>And so it helps, providing us with flexibility in the cost. So, this way we are at zero, we couldn't really, I think, reduce cost, I would say. I think, at zero, it's a little bit the bottom of the exercise, and it couldn't last too long either, because we &#x2013; there will be minimum of inflation. And so it's, I think we can keep flat costs for some time, probably a few quarters. If the top line is not improving, but we, yes it's not, it's something which has a limit, but it's a real flexibility. We are committed to deliver the one-point effect, I mean, this is part of the exercise. But clearly, it couldn't last too long like that.</p>
          <p>On the investment banking side, we have also frozen the staff in already, well toward the beginning of this year. And so the staff is stable, which means that in certain activities we are in fact scaling back because their outlook for those activities are not very good, and so we have to right size the team.</p>
          <p>In other activities, we keep investing a little bit on hiring, especially in, for example, in the Middle East and in Asia. So we try to adjust the costs in a clever, in a smart way, if you want, and not in a virtual and an undifferentiated way. And the bonus, the whole industry is hit by what is happening, and clearly the variable compensation are not going to be brilliant everywhere else, and even, I think we are among the players with the best performance in CIB this year, as shown in another slide. So I think that we have no problem in fact, and the staff understands that in such a year, necessarily, the bonuses are not going to be of the same size than the previous years.</p>
          <p>Now your second question about the demand for structural products. We, well, it has not, well, we have to adapt to the nature of the product we sell, but it is, it has not gone down that much in fact. If you, I would say, if you add up the new products we sell and the winding down of old products, clients coming in order to wind down our products, it makes even an increase in the volume. But the winding down aspect is not very positive. But even on the new product side, there is a demand, but of course not for the same product. So there's a demand for less risky products or products with guarantees, some of our clients are thinking that at this level of the stock exchanges, maybe it is not stupid to try to get indexed some way or another to the stock exchange indices. But of course they want to be protected and so you find &#x2013; you have to find a new products and as innovation is the name of the game.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Trying to state clear of the subject of <mark type="inaudible" />. Just two or three questions. All of my questions have been answered. But can I come back to the question about the &#x2013; your derivatives book and some of the charges you are taking there. Could you just give us a broad split between the financial-related derivatives and the corporate related. Because the CDS spread seems to be moving in all directions. But then <mark type="inaudible" /> mundane subjects on the tax charge in Q3, it looked remarkably low to me. I'm just wondering if you can give us any color on that front. And then just finally in terms of the currency exposure you've got, I think it's been a few quarters when someone asked you about the dollar impact on earnings. I think last time you've talked about 10% movement and the dollar was up 2.5% on earnings. Just wondering if you could update that figure and relative to that's still prudent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The dollar <mark type="inaudible" /> and you're right that it seems that now the dollar at the end of September to dollar that's found has crossed the level of last end of September. So we have no positive territory in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> of course it will help our results starting from now. You are right. And it's completely symmetrical. And I am not going to answer to your first question because I don't answer the split between the financial counterparties and the corporate counterparties. Really I don't have that detail, maybe we will try to answer to you directly to show some reserves.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Right. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the tax charge yes, we have a lower tax rate. In fact the tax rates are calculated on a year-to-date basis according to tax rules. So it's something which is not calculated quarterly, but on the year-to-date and yet then you detect what you have already provided for in the third quarter. We have a tax rate which is at around 20% for nine months in '08, which is low, you are right, because usually we are more in the region of 26, 27%. This lower level is due &#x2013; is mostly due in fact to foreign activities excluding France and Italy. In France and Italy, we are in a quite normal situation. But excluding France and Italy, we have a tax rate, which I would say the mix blended tax rate, which is low because it happens that we are making while in this difficult period, we are making losses in certain countries and gains in other.</p>
          <p>So we are not picking gains everywhere, which is unhappily. But and we're losing money in fact it happens that we are losing money in countries where the tax rate is high typically the U.S. because of the provisions and the U.K. because of the credit trading and Japan and that we're making profit in countries with a low or even zero tax rate like Turkey, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, Luxembourg. And through the blend makes that tax rate is extremely low outside France and Italy. And this is why in total the tax rate has come down to 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The fact that you have always overprovided tax in Q1 and Q2? And you're also catching up that in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not overprovided, we have provided according to the level of results in Q1 and Q2. And so each time, I mean, at the end of Q1 we're providing according to the results in Q1. And at the end of Q2 we're providing according to the results of H1 less what we have already provided for. And then at the end of nine months, let's say. So each time we're reassessing because if you stop for example, you may have full year &#x2013; obviously year-to-date effect, which up to 15 FX having happened in the first-half of the year.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Philippe. Good afternoon everyone. Since I've promised one of my colleagues not to ask question involved with consumer in Italy, still I've few remaining questions. The first one is when do you see you will be able to give us &#x2013; at least a simplified P&amp;L of the part of Fortis you brought or you are buying? Second regarding the what you call normal provision in CIB of 130 million in Q3. Could you give us some any more details regarding the geography of covered sector that is concerned essentially if Italy is one of the more specific cases. And lastly on July to accounting, one of your competitors, Deutsche Bank you were mentioning before, released some detail of the project of incremental <mark type="inaudible" /> and the impact in term of increase of the market risk-weighted assets. They said obviously going to attend between 2010 and 2011. But it's running too much play by more than three, the risk-weighted assets of the market risk. Could you &#x2013; have you already made some calculations regarding the impacts for BNP Paribas. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. About Fortis, we are in the middle of &#x2013; I would say the due diligences and we yes we intend to cover with the balance sheet and the P&amp;L for the business which are required. And it's going to be done at the occasion of probably the general meeting that which is going to decide the last part of the exchange of shares. And so probably hopefully, I mean if things are doing well, if we don't have any delay in getting the rate authorization, it could be done somewhere in December. So this is a kind of timeframe we have in mind. And the cost of risk of CIBs, while it's &#x2013; we have a little bit of LBOs, which is not showed. In fact a little bit of several things I would say, a few LBOs, a few <mark type="inaudible" /> in different industries. It was, while it was not huge in sense by the way, it's something like 120 or &#x20AC;130 million and it's an addition of several relatively small things. And relatively diversified I would say. It's not concentrated in the U.S.</p>

          <p>And now the impact on the risk-weighted assets of Basel 2.5 <mark type="inaudible" /> it's, well, we're expecting a low impact &#x2013; we're expecting relatively low impact because we are &#x2013; yes, the new rules are intended to reflect the losses due to the market risk in the trading book. And there are more severe scenarios and especially as far as illiquid assets are concerned &#x2013; as said, we're concerned &#x2013; we're in less proprietary trading position than a lot of &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> competitors maybe including Deutsche. And our trading positions are mostly on liquid products. We are not involved that much on illiquid U.S. mortgage related products, and we have especially a very limited involvement in ABS products, which are the scope of successful implementation of Basel 2.5 as early as 2009. So, we are not expecting as far as we are concerned given the fact that we're not in the heart of the problem in fact, we are not expecting significant additional <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I just had a couple of question here. First question on Asset Management, I was wondering we are looking at the quarterly evolution of the revenues in the Assets and Wealth Management division, I see assets broadly flat, I was just looking at the quarterly evaluation of these assets look okay, and good inflows. But the revenue seems to go down by quite a bit. I was just wondering whether there was any one-off like seed money things or some sort of money market items that some other banks have booked. That would explain that or whether there was a margin compression there. And the second question maybe as a follow-up on dividends. Can you please share your thoughts on the possibility of paying a scrip dividend knowing that this is a discussion with the Board? Of course, in your discussion, you had considered an option. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Asset Management first, I would like to &#x2013; yes, you are right. There is a one-off on the seed money, which is shown on page seven I mean 28 million. So, this explains part of the thing. And the other parties that the assets are also I mean, flat &#x2013; I mean, they are flat in the quarter. But in the previous quarter they were down. And the revenues of one quarter are made with net asset inflows of the previous quarter in fact mostly.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those areas are kind of tied up, but the 28 million, I'm also explaining. On the dividend, I don't want to elaborate really. I think that we have seen, well, a lot of I would say new behaviors in the market containing dividend. So we are going to look at them and to take all of them into account when we're making the decision. But it's a bold decision and I don't want to anticipate anything.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon. I have got three questions. Firstly, on the monoline actually. Just to get your feel for what you perceive to be the risk on the notional exposures that relate to corporate CDOs and CLOs? Second question is, to what extent are you holding unhedged corporate CDO and CLOs? And my third question is on fixed income, where you've referred to basis risk in credit. Just wondering if that relates to specific portfolios or if that is a more generic comment to explain what's going on in the fixed income part of capital markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat your last question? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question was actually on the fixed income business, where in your summary you talked about continued negative impact of basis risk in credit. And my question is whether that relates to specific portfolios within credit or whether it's more kind of generic comment you're making there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not yet. It's &#x2013; the basis risk, I mean, you should have seen, we have a surplus from already &#x2013; from the beginning of the crisis and especially early on in the year. It's linked to the CDO and corporate CDO, CLO business as well as we are part of our business which is consisting in building CDOs while hedging with them &#x2013; with the corporate bonds &#x2013; with cash corporate bonds, and clearly has been the affection for those corporate bonds and the widening of those price on the cash which has been much stronger, in fact that we said, led the way compared with the strength on the CDS. However, hedges were not efficient enough any more. So we have <mark type="inaudible" /> from what we call the widening of the basis since the beginning of the crisis and it's again in September. So we &#x2013; in fact your last question is the same than your previous question. Our position in the book &#x2013; in the trading book hedged &#x2013; basically hedged.</p>
          <p>There is no perfect hedge, but in principle and mostly hedged, I would say. But the hedge is no more efficient or part of the hedges are no more efficient. And so &#x2013; it explains why we have not very good results in the credit or even balances, so that we can say the credit trading since the beginning of the crisis. And your question on monolines now, yes the risk on the monoline, I mean the risk &#x2013; the CLOs and CDOs are much less risky than the mortgage-based products. The CLOs we have built were rated with highest adjustment points and they are backed mostly by senior secured loans. So, they are &#x2013; all the CLO assumptions we have in the book senior AAA rated. The majority of that 90% are backed by senior secured loans. Though in fact the risk profile is much better than the mortgage-backed based on the mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-backed CDOs. But, nevertheless there is this basis risk which remains under which is trading losses quarter after quarter, I would say, since the beginning of the crisis.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Alain Tchibozo with ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, sorry about that. Two questions, one regarding your tax rate. Can you please come back and give us the guidance for the full year tax rate, we should expect for the full year 2008 number? And the second question is also to come back on the IAS 39, could you make it clear whether we should expect any significant impact on the full year '08 P&amp;L, in terms of implementing the IAS 39? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's the guidance <mark type="inaudible" /> tax rate is difficult, because as I said, the reason why it's slow at the moment, it's because we have suffered losses in countries, where the tax rate is high. So it will depend at least on the results on the fourth quarter and where the activities are profitable or not. Well, given the fact that, by definition the nine months are weighing three times more than the fourth quarter. I guess we're not going to be far from 20% for the full year, but it's not necessarily going to be the case next year. I think that in the normal year, we should be well making profit relatively (2:0005) well ideally. And so, the tax rate should be more like it used to be in the past, I mean in the 26 or 27% region. But for this year, it seems that we're going probably to be &#x2013; to keep being in the 20% region.</p>
          <p>On 39, we &#x2013; the implementation of the &#x2013; expect &#x2013; the implementation of the amendment to 39 is, I mean, it's difficult to anticipate what is going to be the impact, because by definition if you implement it on the &#x2013; "normal" basis, I mean not retroactively. At the time where you transfer the assets form the trading book to the banking book, there is no impact on the P&amp;L, because you transfer the asset at the trading book price. So, you know a several number of journalists have said that you &#x2013; it's a way to come back to the top shares price. But, it's of course stupid, I mean the standard is very clear that you &#x2013; and it's quite fair, normal, I mean you transfer the asset at the latest trading price, the price of the day you are transferring the asset. So, by definition, at that time there is no impact.</p>
          <p>And then, of course the valuation of the asset is changing, because it's no more going to be &#x2013; to go up and down depending on the market. It's going to be amortized of those remaining maturity of the asset. And so, by definition, there will be a difference, but the way it will be different is not even known when you reclassify, because the market may go up again or further down, you don't know.</p>
          <p>And so, at the end you can calculate the difference &#x2013; the impact of the change backwards at the end. So, at the end of the year, we will calculate and post the difference. But, it may be positive or negative, depending on the movement of the market. So, it's a &#x2013; well, we intend to use the amendment not because we want to flatter the results in anyway but just because it's more healthy and it's more sound to remove assets, which are not liquid at all and to &#x2013; from the trading books. And to classify them in a way, which fits the actual way they are going to be managed, meaning on the long-term or medium-term basis now. So it's what we're going to do, but I can't quantify or I can't give you even any flavor of what kind of impact it's going to have on the P&amp;L. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a quick question regarding the retail. I would be very interested to have more colors regarding the margin evolution on the individual customers and also on the SMEs, because in one of your comments on the previous quarter, you were saying that you were able to reprise most of the higher cost of funding to corporates but not to SMEs or individuals due to the competition with <mark type="inaudible" />. Does the situation have changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's exactly the same. Margins have improved mostly for the largest corporates, but conversely for retail loans and small corporates, competition remains fierce and margins are still under pressure. And the signs of improvement are very, very dim. It's the same in Italy. A little bit better, I would say, margins are improving a little bit better in Italy, even for small corporates or retail clients. And it's much better in BancWest where margins are much much improving quite a lot because the competitive landscape has completely changed in the U.S. and the competition is less intense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one follow-up question regarding the financing business into the investment banking. You were having a goal of having a 10% risk-weighted asset in this division for the coming years, do you want to &#x2013; are you still maintaining it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have not yet &#x2013; we, I mean, we are not &#x2013; well, we are in the budget process and I think it's too early to give you &#x2013; because the budget this year is quite difficult. It's always difficult but especially this year I would say. The landscape has changed dramatically. The &#x2013; overall &#x2013; so we're going to assess all that. I mean, the evolution of the risk-weighted asset is really part of the budget process, because it is part of the budget targets we give to each business. So it's too early to make any forecast. In terms of looking back over the last year, in fact nine months 2008 compared to nine months 2007, the risk-weighted assets for the financing business have grown only by 5%. Only by 5% but helped by a declining dollar. But nevertheless I think over the year, the &#x2013; probably the evolution is going to be between 5 and 10. Naturally low.</p>

          <p>We'll move now to a question from Omar Fall with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just had three questions actually. Just a follow-up on equity derivatives, could you give us even a vague indication of what was the ROE differential, the profitability differential between the flow business and the structured products business pre-crisis, given that I guess we have to take a view as to when and if the exotics in the structured products business comes back materially?</p>
          <p>Secondly and sorry if I missed this at the beginning of the call, but can you give some color in equity derivatives as to how much of the negative revenues in October has been driven by prop trading if any? Or if this is purely a function of losses on delta hedging?</p>
          <p>Finally, if you could just touch on the operating environment and the outlook for your Ukranian business, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The return on equity between the flow business and structured product used to be very, very high with flow business being less profitable of course than the structured products. But recently the margins had improved in the flow business because there are, I would say, less players and also less trustworthy players. And so we're increasing our market share quite significantly, especially in the U.S. To simplify, the flow business is more conducted in the U.S. in terms of volumes and the structured products business more in Europe to simplify, oversimplify. We're at the moment penetrating the flow business product in the U.S., as you know, with especially the acquisition of the prime brokerage business with BOA and all that. And so &#x2013; and the margins are improving in the flow business.</p>
          <p>So I don't have the precise CDOs on risk. And I'm not even sure that we're computing that that way, because we tend to look at &#x2013; beyond the big divisions, I would say, we tend to focus more on profitability per client rather than per product, because it makes no point to cut the activity in certain product, if it's a pre-requisite to cross-sell other more margin product to the same client. So we tend to look &#x2013; I don't think I have those figures, but the differential is narrowing. That's the only thing I want to say.</p>
          <p>On your second question, yes, I have already answered. But briefly, I can repeat that. The equity derivative losses in October are not driven by prop trading, but more by the managing of the Greeks and the delta hedges which is &#x2013; was extremely difficult in a historically hectic and unprecedented environment. And the operational environment in equity derivative I would say, really characterized by this volatility &#x2013; huge volumes including client's volumes and extreme difficulty in managing the positions in October. Things are improving at the end of October, I hope it's going to continue.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just as a follow-up to that. Can we feel comfortable that we are not likely to see losses &#x2013; I know it's still early in the quarter that we are not likely to see anything that could erode the value, let's say i.e. something big enough to start impacting improve profitability actually?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just on the Ukrainian business please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Ukraine &#x2013; sorry. About Ukraine. Yes, about Ukraine. We &#x2013; well, like a said number of emerging markets, the Ukrainian market has changed dramatically over the last month or so. So we have immediately reacted to that. We have &#x2013; clearly we have slowed down a lot the way we were giving &#x2013; we were giving loans. And we were extending loans with the risk, we have strengthened the risk criteria quite a lot, we have completely stopped lending U.S. dollar loans to individuals. We have completely reviewed the corporate size and we have increased the margins. And we have also launched a kind of advertising campaign in order to clearly explain that our &#x2013; UkrSibbank is a subsidiary of BNP Paribas and so is very solid and safe, to attract the clients of other banks, and so this is competition and we have very good successes there. So we are also benefiting from the flat equality in Ukraine. And we try to be extremely cautious on the new loans, that's what we're doing.</p>
          <p>It works, I mean the risks are rising of course. In the third quarter it was not yet visible, I mean, as you have seen in the results, but we expect some increase in the cost of risk in the fourth quarter like everywhere else. But we are taking action in order to try to limit that as much as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just out of curiosity, why is revenue up 87% actually for..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It was extremely rapid and the growth was extremely rapid, because in fact what happened in UkrSibbank is that when we bought UkrSibbank it &#x2013; the bulk of the loan book was coming from an activity in corporate with margins which were good, because it's Ukraine, it's an emerging country, but nevertheless corporate margins. And big corporates relatively low-risk and so not huge, huge margin. And the &#x2013; we have &#x2013; well we have, I would say expanded the network as you have seen. And we have started a retail bank. In fact in Ukraine we have in the region of 1,000 branches in Ukraine now, so it's now a retail bank. We went from ranking number six to ranking number three of <mark type="inaudible" /> in Ukraine now. And so we have started gathering deposits from the clients and lending money to individuals and of course with margins much higher than with corporate and that's why the impact in terms of revenues is very impressive. But it is okay as long as the cost of risk remains I would say proportionate through the evolution of the volumes and to the margins. And so this is what we have to fine tune closely. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, this is Kimon Kalamboussis from Citi. Some of your banking operators disclosed their insurance embedded value and actually so is Fortis. So I wonder when do you plan to disclose the embedded value for BNP <mark type="inaudible" /> please?</p>
          <p>And the second question is if you could tell us what is the size of the French SME book please and maybe any comment on the underlying cost of risk for this book please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The insurance embedded value, we're of course calculating it, computing it and it's a tool which is used in the management &#x2013; in Mongoza I in the management of the insurance business. Up to now we have not yet while we have not yet to disclose that, because we want to get used to that and to the exact meaning of it before releasing it. So something will &#x2013; we want to get accustomed with as a management tool before releasing the figure. Because once we start releasing the figure you will ask explanations and so we have to do it every quarter or at least every year until it will become something which is going to be a communication tool I would say. And so we have to be quite sure of the way it works and so we want to get more accustomed to it before releasing it.</p>
          <p>The French SME book. Well, the amount you have &#x2013; you have log exposures of the corporates on slide 43, where you have all the details of the outstanding amounts of the French Retail Bank. So it's 54.2 billion euros at the end of September. It's to be completed, it's not 100% SMEs, because you also have some subsidiaries of big groups in there. But the bulk of it is smaller or medium sized companies.</p>
          <p>And in terms of cost of risk, I mean, it's &#x2013; we are not releasing the cost of risk separately between corporate and retail. Well, it's a low level. We don't want to disclose more than that, but it's a low level. We don't have any &#x2013; again we have over the last few years, we've improved a lot over the last 10 years, even. I mean, we have improved a lot, the quality of our clients, corporate clients in France. And this explains why the cost of risk, overall cost of risk of the retail bank is so low. Because the cost of risk &#x2013; the margins in France for small corporates are very small because there is a fierce competition with all the mutualist bank. And so it's worth doing that business only if you're quite sure that you're not going to suffer from a lot of provision burden. And so we were extremely selective, we are extremely selective in our relationships, corporate relationships. And we have a very low cost of risk.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just a couple of quick questions. The first one, coming back regarding your insurance activities. Considering the current level of indexes, by the end of the year would you have I mean to book some impairments on their investment books or how does it work? And what is the sensitivity, or let's say, I mean the breakeven point in terms of indexes for BNP Insurance?</p>
          <p>Second point is regarding RMBS in Spain. What would be, I mean, in your view, a comfortable level of coverage in terms of your potential provisioning? Regarding the floor, and how much the deal with OTC is going to affect, I mean, the calculations of the floor on the risk-weighted assets? And lastly, regarding this deal, is there any penalty fee in any case the deal is broken either by the Belgian government or under the pressure requested, I mean, from the review of the European Commission for instance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not going to answer to your last question because its part of the protocol which is not going to &#x2013; supposed to be public. But I'm quite sure that this is not going to be brought up. I mean it's going quite &#x2013; I think it's &#x2013; well, it's something which I hope will not happen. The risk-weighted assets with Fortis, it's not going &#x2013; well, it's not going to change a lot. I think we're going to apply the floor to Basel I risk-weighted assets exactly the same way. For Fortis, it's exactly the same way. So we &#x2013; when we say that it should bring &#x2013; the immediate impact should be an improvement of 35, around basis-points including the floor impact.</p>
          <p>The RMBS in Spain. I don't know exactly, well, the level &#x2013; I think we have, let me check. You're referring to slide 76, I guess, the exposure in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I'm just checking the amount. It's 800 million, if I'm right, 800 million for RMBS. Yes, it's coming down from 900 at the beginning of the year. We &#x2013; the &#x2013; I don't have &#x2013; this is the net exposure, net &#x2013; the exposure you have in front of you is the exposure of net of impairments, if any. At this stage, the current impairment by definition is an adequate level. So now if the market in Spain is further deteriorating we may have the need of further provisions. But it's difficult for me to give you a figure because it's about the depth of the crisis in Spain, I mean which really &#x2013; I don't know exactly.</p>
          <p>Anyway, I can't tell you more than that, the &#x2013; 98.4% of those RMBS in Spain are AAA, so I think that, well we &#x2013; it should not &#x2013; well, I don't know, because AAA can change as well. But that's it.</p>
          <p>And BNP Paribas Insurance, yes we have &#x2013; well &#x2013; first, the proportion of equities or equity products in the insurance portfolio are limited to 10 to 15% of our total portfolio in insurance. So it's limited stuff. Most of the &#x2013; I mean, 80% is in interest rate products and the rest is in real estate products. We &#x2013; it's a pure euro area portfolio, but as you say, the indexes have gone down also in Europe quite a lot and the latent capital gains are dented by this evolution. But at the end of September we are still in positive territory. We're in latent capital gains. I'm not going to give you the breakeven point because it's sensitive competition information. But be reassured that we're still in positive latent capital gains in the insurance portfolio at the end of September. Okay? Next question?</p>
