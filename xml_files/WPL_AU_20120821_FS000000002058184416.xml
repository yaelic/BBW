          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Woodside 2012 Half Year Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, 22 August, 2012. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your CEO and Managing Director, Mr. Peter Coleman. Thank you, sir, and please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our 2012 half year results briefing. Thanks very much for taking the time to call in or listen online for today's teleconference. As usual and as ever, we really do appreciate your interest in our company. I have with me Lawrie Tremaine, our Chief Financial Officer, and you'll hear from Lawrie later in the briefing today.</p>
          <p>If we can move to slide two, it shows our normal disclaimer. This includes a reminder that all dollar figures for Woodside are in U.S. dollars unless we state otherwise during the briefing.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide three, our financial headlines. Woodside, as we've spoken on many occasions, really has a very strong foundation business and this is evident again in our results today. The first half operating revenue was $2.7 billion, an increase of almost 18% compared to the same time last year. This resulted from a very strong performance from our base business including the North West Shelf and Vincent oil in addition to the startup of Pluto.</p>
          <p>Reported profit fell 1.9% largely due to a number of one-off items related to Pluto. However, the underlying profit increased 4.5% to $865 million. Our operating cash flow was strong and we've declared an interim dividend of $0.65 per share, an increase of 18% compared to last year's interim dividend and Lawrie will go into more detail on these items shortly.</p>
          <p>If we can now turn to our operational headlines on slide four. The standout achievement for the first half of the year was the safe startup of Pluto. We produced first LNG in late April and have achieved strong production levels from the facility, far exceeding our expectations which we benchmarked on North West Shelf Trains 4 and 5. In the first half, we delivered eight cargoes of LNG to our customers in the Asia-Pacific region. And we are focused on maintaining this reliability as we go through second half.</p>
          <p>Over at the North West Shelf, oil production from the Okha floating production storage and offloading vessel has increased following startup of the gas compression system. And as many of you would have seen now in our investor briefing back in May, we have successfully installed the North Rankin B topsides with hook-up and commissioning works progressing to plan. The Greater Western Flank Phase I project is also tracking well with drilling activities to commence this quarter.</p>
          <p>At the Karratha Gas Plant, refurbishment continues with the completion of planned maintenance at LNG Train 4 and the Trunkline Offshore Terminal. And while these activities impacted production in the first half, they really do provide support for the long-term LNG reliability and utilization of these facilities. Our oil assets continue to make a substantial contribution to the company's overall production. The tie-in of an additional infill well in the Vincent field is paying dividends, almost doubling production from the previous corresponding period.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide five, our safety performance is always a key measure of our operating performance. It's really a window into our organization. We strive for improvement in our safety performance and I'm pleased to report that in this half, our total recordable case frequency improved to 4.18 from 5.54 in the first half of last year. While this is a positive result really to achieve world-class performance, we need to continue to improve and drive this number down and that's really where our focus is.</p>
          <p>On the production side, we produced 34.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in the first half and recently increased our 2012 full-year target to a range of 77 million to 83 million barrels. We took this action as a result of the strong early performance of Pluto and I'll talk more about that later.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll hand over to our Chief Financial Officer, Lawrie Tremaine, to take us through the financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to review our 2012 half-year financial results, beginning with production on slide seven. As Peter just mentioned, production for the half-year 2012 was 34.2 million barrels of oil equivalent, up 7.2%. Not surprisingly, the startup of Pluto is the major reason for this increase. Pluto has contributed 5.3 million barrels of oil equivalent to our first half production. This is more than 2 million barrels higher than our pre-startup expectation. Better reliability during the startup phase has been the major reason for this outperformance.</p>
          <p>Production from the North West Shelf oilfields increased by 1.1 million barrels due to the startup of the new FPSO, the Okha in September 2011. We've also seen improved performance from the Vincent field. Vincent production was 1.3 million barrels higher, mainly due to increased facility availability and the impact of three infill wells brought online between September 2011 and May 2012.</p>
          <p>The production increase was achieved against a background of major shutdowns of North West Shelf Train 4 and Trunkline Onshore Terminal, together with ongoing work on the North Rankin Redevelopment Project. Also negatively impacting the comparison was the sale of the Gulf of Mexico shelf assets in May 2011 and the expiry of the Ohanet Risk Sharing contract in October of the same year.</p>
          <p>Now to operating revenue on slide eight. Revenue for the half-year was $2.7 billion. This represents a $402 million or 17.8% increase over the first half of 2011. $2.7 billion is also a record first half revenue for Woodside. The increased revenue is due in rough equal portions to higher sales volume, again with Pluto the main contributor, and stronger realized prices.</p>
          <p>Average daily Brent prices were 2% higher half-on-half, yielding an increase in realized prices of 9%. I can once again report that we continue to achieve strong premiums over dated Brent for our heavy Greater Enfield Area crudes. These premiums are a consequence of strong Asia Pacific demand for gas oil. In the first half 2012, we achieved average premiums from the Greater Enfield Area of $6 to $7 per barrel over dated Brent.</p>
          <p>Next to production cost on slide nine. And just to remind that we report our production costs in Australian dollars. So gas production costs were A$57 million higher than the first half 2011, A$39 million of this was due to the startup of Pluto. Excuse me, I have a cold. The remaining A$18 million was largely due to the North West Shelf Train 4 shutdown and Goodwyn well workovers, both executed in the first half of the year. There were no equivalent major shutdowns in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>We expect the full year unit gas production cost at North West Shelf to be lower than the A$4.63 per boe shown in this chart. The second half result will benefit from no major shutdowns at North West Shelf and the expected strong production at Pluto.</p>
          <p>Oil production costs were A$19 million higher than the first half 2011. The majority of this relates to the Vincent FPSO. We incurred almost A$6 million once-off transition costs, following the acquisition of the FPSO from Maersk. A further A$5 million in additional cost relates to the higher production from the Vincent facility so far in 2012. We've also incurred A$6 million in subsea remediation works at Laminaria-Corallina, which are also once-off costs.</p>
          <p>Unit oil production costs have increased on both a full cost and underlying cost basis. This is largely due to the impact of field decline on our relatively mature oil assets. Despite this, unit margins remain high on all of these assets, particularly given the strong oil price environment.</p>
          <p>Moving now to reported profit on slide ten. This chart shows the bridge between the reported net profit after tax in the first half compared with the prior year. Starting from the shaded area in the left, you can see Pluto contributed $163 million in gross margin. We also booked $81 million in startup and mitigation costs. We don't expect these costs to reoccur.</p>
          <p>Higher prices in the foundation business boosted pre-tax profit by $164 million, partially offset by lower volumes, which impacted us by $93 million. Cost of sales in the foundation business were $121 million higher than the first half 2011. I have already mentioned the drivers for the production cost increases. Cost of sales also include an additional $49 million in depreciation charges. This increase is due to the higher capital cost and higher production volumes at both the North West Shelf oil and Vincent fields.</p>
          <p>Finally, the tax and other bar on this chart includes higher tax expense of $49 million, amortization of Pluto Train 2 and 3 onshore FEED cost of $20 million and impairment charge of the Laminaria-Corallina asset of $21 million, and higher interest cost of $27 million, given we are no longer capitalizing the bulk of our interest. These increases were partially offset by lower exploration expenses of $83 million.</p>
          <p>Underlying profit on slide 11. Our first half underlying profit of $865 million is 4.5% higher than the $828 million recorded in the first half of last year. We've adjusted for non-recurring items of $53 million after tax, $28 million relates to the after tax impact of Pluto delay mitigation costs, $25 million is for tax paid to Timor-Leste in relation to the sale of a Woodside subsidiary back in 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning to operating cash flow on slide 12. Our cash flow of $1.5 billion was our best ever first half result and is 7.55% higher than the first half of 2011. Stronger realized prices and higher volumes, particularly from Pluto, are the major drivers of the improved result.</p>
          <p>The result underscores Woodside's cash generating capacity. At current oil prices and with continuing good production performance at Pluto, we are forecasting a full year cash flow result to rival the previous best annual result back in 2008.</p>
          <p>The chart on slide 13 shows our current estimate of 2012 capital and exploration expenditure. Investment expenditure is lower across each category, reflecting the recent startup of Pluto, the startup of the North West Shelf oil Okha facility, and the advanced status of the North Rankin Redevelopment Project. Exploration expenditure is down from prior guidance due to farm-outs of the Vucko, Banambu Deep, and Ananke wells.</p>
          <p>With a near-term downward CapEx trajectory, together with anticipated higher operating cash flows, we have an opportunity to further strengthen our balance sheet ahead of the next phase of growth.</p>
          <p>And now to interim dividend on slide 14. The Directors have declared a fully franked interim dividend of $0.65 per share. This compares to the 2011 interim dividend of $0.55 per share. The dividend reinvestment plan will again be offered, but will not be underwritten. No discount will apply to the allocation price and shares to be allocated will be acquired on market. Woodside's Board has approved the dividend policy. Consistent with recent practice, the company will aim to maintain a minimum dividend payout ratio of 50% of underlying net profit after tax.</p>
          <p>In determining the appropriate dividend, the Board will consider, among other things, Woodside's development profile, available cash flows, and funding requirements. As always, the Board maintains the discretion to determine whether or not a dividend is payable and the amount of any dividend. The full dividend policy is posted on our Web site.</p>
          <p>And now to capital management on slide 15. This slide provides my summary of our financial position. We are nearing the end of the heavy recent investment cycle. Our cash flows are benefiting from continued strong energy prices and the better-than-expected startup at Pluto. The conditions precedent on the Browse equity sale have been satisfied, and so we can expect an additional $2 billion in cash receipts from this transaction by the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>At the first reporting period following the completion of the Pluto development, we are pleased to report that we have cash and undrawn debt facilities of $2.2 billion and gearing of 26%. Furthermore, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's rating agencies have both recently restored our long-term credit ratings to a stable outlook.</p>
          <p>In short, we have the balance sheet capacity and the operating cash flows to support the next phase of growth. We will remain focused on the efficient and timely development of our growth projects, ensuring our cost base remains competitive and enabling us to achieve top quartile shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>We are not under pressure to mandate projects and should growth be delayed or our investment criteria not met, the company's strong balance sheet places us in a great position to return cash generated by the business to shareholders.</p>
          <p>I'll now pass you back to Peter to discuss our projects and operational performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lawrie. It really goes without saying that we like the look of our balance sheet. It's really a balance sheet that does give us a plenty of options. And before I turn to the strategy and project activities, let's take a quick look at the current economic environment on slide 17.</p>
          <p>Over the recent months, more and more companies operating and investing in Australia are talking about the strong headwinds that their businesses face. This slide lists a number of those issues, which must be factored into any development decision that we make.</p>
          <p>And while acknowledging this challenging environment, I need to highlight that Woodside is well placed to continue to invest through the cycle. We have a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from existing and new projects, which when coupled with our long-term value focus and investment discipline, we believe, enable us to capitalize on appropriate opportunities should they arise.</p>
          <p>So with that context, let's have a look at our strategy and just a quick reminder of what we're doing. On slide 18, we took considerable time to talk to you about our strategy at our Investor Briefing Day in May, but I think it's important to remind all of us of the direction we're taking. This slide outlines the three elements of our strategic focus. First one is maximizing our core; secondly, leveraging our capabilities; and then finally, growing our portfolio to deliver superior returns.</p>
          <p>If we firstly look at maximizing our core, our facilities really have a track record of proven performance in delivering value. The world class performance was demonstrated just a few months ago with the safe startup of Pluto. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to maximize value from this business and commercialize our discovered volumes.</p>
          <p>On leveraging our capabilities, I'm still very impressed by what we can achieve for the size of our company. We are a mid-cap with some of the capabilities of the super majors. And we have the capability, expertise, and discipline to deliver some of the world's most complex developments. And our new technology organization is further enhancing these capabilities and we have some focus areas that we're pursuing.</p>
          <p>On growing our portfolio, we've mentioned previously we've mobilized teams of very experienced people to support the business growth. The team has already assessed several growth opportunities using a disciplined process to ensure they really do add value to our bottom line and align with our strategy and, just as importantly, our capabilities.</p>
          <p>As part of this work, we've also commenced studies of prospective basins around the globe. And underpinning all of this is a cultural change program across the organization, focused on keeping our employees well informed, engaged, and motivated to support our vision of being a global leader in upstream oil and gas. If we can move &#x2013; so that's really where our strategic direction is heading and what we're all about as Woodside. We can kind of get back to the meat and potatoes now and think about our assets.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 19, looking at our core business, which is really underpinned by the continued strong output from the North West Shelf, production in the first half of this year generated a revenue of just over $1.5 billion for Woodside, just short of our previous records, just some rounding there, that was generated in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>The shelf delivered 111 cargoes of LNG on behalf of the joint venture compared to 132 in the first half of last year. And the decrease is largely attributed to the significant refurbishment activities and ongoing maintenance that we've talked about previously, combined with the impact of the North Rankin Development Project activities that required some shutdowns of the pipeline system offshore.</p>
          <p>Refurbishment and maintenance activities during the first half included the planned major shutdowns we've talked about, which really were some of them more complex that we've undertaken at the Karratha Gas Plant. And I'm pleased to say, these activities were for the most part completed ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>If we can move to slide 20, we're working very hard to bring undeveloped North West Shelf gas reserves online to maintain supply to the Karratha Gas Plant. This slide provides an update of our two key projects that are currently underway. The first is the North Rankin Redevelopment A &#x2013; A$5 billion project &#x2013; that will recover about 5 Tcf of low pressure gas. The North Rankin B platform is now in place. We have more than 450 people working offshore on hook-up and commissioning and the project remains on budget and scheduled for completion in 2013.</p>
          <p>Second project, the A$2.5 billion Greater Western Flank Phase 1 Project is progressing well. Engineering and fab activities are progressing to schedule with drilling activities currently underway. The project includes a subsea tieback to the Tidepole and Goodwyn GH fields to the existing Goodwyn A platform with a phased development of the Greater Western Flank necessary to bring or to unlock about another 3 Tcf of gas and up to 100 million barrels gross of condensate. This project also remains on budget and scheduled for completion by 2016.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 21, Australia oil &#x2013; the Australian oil assets delivered revenue of about $780 million in the first half. That was due to a combination of higher sales volumes and slightly higher prices. In May, the Vincent oil field achieved the highest monthly volume since production began in August 2008 and this was the result of strong production from the latest infill well. And, of course, the performance there was offset by some lower volumes at Enfield and Stybarrow due to natural reservoir decline and some maintenance activities.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we'll continue to improve our understanding of the oil reservoirs and look for additional infill opportunities. And we're quite confident this work will extend the life and value of these assets.</p>
          <p>Just a message, as we go through those charts, is really our commitment to delivering on our commitments, whether they be turnarounds in our plants, whether they be major project activities or whether they're getting world-class performance out of our existing assets such as we're doing at Vincent and elsewhere.</p>
          <p>If we can move on to Pluto and we'll hear a lot more about Pluto over the coming days and weeks. But on slide 22, the first cargo from Pluto marked the start really of a new era for us at Woodside, providing a step change in production and revenue. And, as we've said before, Pluto is a robust and profitable project and one we're very happy to have in the portfolio. It's a great achievement to have gone from discovery in 2005 to first LNG just seven years later. And bringing a mega project like Pluto off the drawing board and into production is a difficult task, really requiring world class skills and capabilities right across the LNG value chain.</p>
          <p>Startup of Pluto LNG is achieving superior performance compared to the expected ramp up, with the delivery of eight LNG cargoes in the first half of the year and the expected ramp up was based on actual performance that we saw at North West Shelf Trains 4 and 5. So we had a good base point on which to base our expected ramp up of Pluto given that train was a look-alike to those trains.</p>
          <p>We are adding a fourth LNG tanker to our Pluto fleet from the middle of next year. That tanker is already being built. It'll be on a time charter of up to 20 years. That will enable us to meet the needs of long-term customers, also enable us to take advantage of some strong demand that we're seeing in the spot market.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 23 and looking at production in more detail. From the startup to the end of June, the plant produced just under 600,000 tons of LNG and more than 500,000 barrels of condensate. Capacity utilization for the first two months of operation was forecast to be 36%, as I mentioned. However, actual capacity utilization was just &#x2013; was on the order of 80%.</p>
          <p>Production in the second half of this year is expected to be more closely aligned with our normal annual deliverability plan and the plant is running per expectation.</p>
          <p>This graph illustrates the sort of performance we could expect for the remainder of the year. And as we all know, this is not an exact science. The chart provides for a range of possible outcomes and the lines on the chart includes a 20-day contingency allowance for shutdowns in second half of 2012. So as you look at those lines, we had built in or factored into those lines a 20-day contingency allowance. As previously advised, Pluto LNG is now expected to contribute 20 million barrels to 23 million barrels of oil equivalent to Woodside's overall production in 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 24. While the foundation project is outperforming expectations, progress on Pluto expansion has proved a lot more challenging. We've had disappointing exploration drilling results over the past two years, most recently with Ananke-1 in the Carnarvon Basin. And at this point in time, unfortunately, we do not have sufficient discovered volumes to progress an equity gas expansion. And if you recall, we had indicated we would advise the market in the third quarter of this year with respect to our expectations.</p>
          <p>Since our final Pluto investment decision in 2007, Woodside has drilled 25 exploration wells in pursuit of Pluto expansion volumes. 11 of these wells intersected gas and four of these discoveries, all in WA-404-P, have reserves booked against them based on backfill to Pluto Train 1.</p>
          <p>Evaluation of our Ragnar discovery continues and there will be follow-up drilling in WA-430-P next year. However, discovered Woodside equity gas is insufficient to support an expansion of Pluto LNG at this time.</p>
          <p>While it's disappointing, we are pleased to have commercial volumes to tie back into our existing Pluto facilities and we'll be taking time to pause our drilling activities to evaluate and refresh our exploration portfolio in the region. We say this as a natural part of the process. We've drilled all of these prospects that we had in inventory. It's now time for us to prudently pause in the program and allow exploration team to weave those results back into their forward program.</p>
          <p>Of course, other options for us to facilitate Pluto expansion through the commercialization of other resource owner gas. We have been in discussions with those owners in the region for some time now, and I'm pleased to say that these discussions remain quite active. While they're encouraging, they are inevitably complex and we're predicting it will take some time to conclude these talks.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Browse on slide 25, some happy faces in this photo. All conditions precedent have been satisfied for the sale of a minority portion of Woodside's equity in the development to a subsidiary of Japan Australia LNG or MIMI, as they're better known, for $2 billion. This transaction is a very strong endorsement of the value of the development and it also reflects the high demand for LNG for all premium developments such as Browse.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, Woodside welcomed MIMI to the Browse development with a signing ceremony. That's the happy faces in the picture. We particularly look forward to exploring additional opportunities with both Mitsui and Mitsubishi under the terms of an MOU that we signed, which reflects Woodside's focus on building strategic relationships globally.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Shell announced recently a transaction under which it will acquire all of Chevron's equity interest in Browse. The total value of this transaction is &#x2013; or the details are confidential. But I can say that total value of the transaction is of an equivalent order to that of our transaction with MIMI.</p>
          <p>The Browse development is currently in the assurance phase. We've received all tender bids for the upstream and downstream infrastructures previously reported and we have an evaluation process underway to determine project cost and economics, so we'll be in a position as a joint venture to make a final investment decision in the first half of 2012 &#x2013; or 2013, in line with our retention lease conditions.</p>
          <p>Also last month, you will have seen the Environmental Protection Authority recommend a conditional approval of the precinct at James Price Point. There's a number of management plans and strategies in the Strategic Assessment Report to ensure the precinct can coexist with both &#x2013; with the environmental, cultural and heritage values of the Kimberley, and we're very confident that we can do that. And then following the statutory appeals process, the EPA's reports and recommendations will be considered by both the state and commonwealth ministers who have the responsibility for making the final decision.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Sunrise on slide 26, the conclusion of the Timor-Leste elections last month give us some clear head now to get back to the negotiating table in Timor-Leste. We recently provided additional technical data to the Timor-Leste government to help build our mutual understanding on the Sunrise development and we're really looking forward to the next engagement, and we're building a good and positive relationship there. We are updating the costs on and, of course, some of the uncertainties and challenges of the development concepts in preparation for our next expected engagement, which will be very soon.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 27, on the US and international. Looking at Neptune, in the Gulf of Mexico, we &#x2013; recompletion operations of an existing well into a new zone was completed in August. And in addition, the operator will be drilling a well in the North Flank next year.</p>
          <p>Exploration continues to mature portfolio of opportunities in the GoM. We have two non-operated assets, which are progressing through the permitting phase, with the expectation that these wells could be drilled in 2013, subject to all the joint venture participants agreeing and rig availability.</p>
          <p>Down to Brazil, operator Repsol has indicated that the Panoramix-3 appraisal well is expected to be drilled in Q4 of this year, again, depending on rig availability and evaluation of Panoramix and Vampira oil and gas fields continues. Woodside does continue to evaluate a growing number of opportunities in the GoM and the Americas and we'll continue those evaluation activities.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 28, closer to home, we've drilled four wells in Australia this year, resulting in one gas discovery at Ragnar-1. Vucko-1, Banambu Deep and Ananke were unsuccessful. We were awarded two new permits this year at WA-472-P and WA-473-P, as the sole equity participant.</p>
          <p>These blocks extend our acreage position on the Lambert Shelf, where we're exploring in shallow to moderate water depths. And recently, we were granted a third permit, WA-478-P, which lies north of our Ragnar discovery and has gas potential.</p>
          <p>During the first half of this year, we also began our major 3D seismic campaign in three large Outer Canning blocks, where we're a 55% equity holder and operator with Shell. These blocks contain several very large multi-Tcf gas prospects, but I must caution are high risk. When complete, the seismic survey will extend over 11,500 square kilometers, making it the largest proprietary single 3D program in WA. In addition, we successfully acquired the Rafter 3D seismic survey in WA-275-P aimed at finding additional gas volumes adjacent to our Browse fields. So very busy in the seismic programs this year.</p>
          <p>In 2013, we'll be back to drilling. We plan to drill up to eight wells in Australia. Potential targets include two oil prospects in the Exmouth area, four gas prospects in the Greater Carnarvon Basin and North West Shelf, and two prospects in the Outer Canning, subject to approvals and rig availability, of course, and as you know it's a very tight rig market in Australia. A further 10,000 square kilometers of 3D is planned for 2013, mostly in the northern Outer Canning blocks and in the four Lambert Shelf blocks, so you can see our seismic interpreters are going to be very busy.</p>
          <p>Slide 29, internationally, our current exploration assets comprise multiple lease blocks in the deepwater GoM, a large onshore permit in Peru with oil potential and two deepwater permits in the Republic of Korea and nine blocks in the Canaries.</p>
          <p>We drilled the Jujak-1 well in Korea earlier this year, which was unsuccessful. And we're examining the results of this well. In the Canaries, our operator Repsol is planning to reprocess the existing 3D seismic ahead of recommending prospects for drilling.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we've established a group to study exploration opportunities in basins around the world. And the first evidence of this team's activity is our partnership to bid for an exploration area offshore Cyprus, where we're pursuing large gas opportunities in deepwater.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we expect to resume drilling the Innsbruck-1 well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in late 2012. One or two more wells will likely follow in 2013. In Peru, acquisition of 2D seismic in Block 108 is also expected to occur next year.</p>
          <p>Finally, Woodside has embarked on a series of global basin studies and will seek to position itself only where we really can see value. As part of this review, we're currently examining opportunities in the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and the Americas.</p>
          <p>Finally, slide 30. To summarize today's briefing, the first half of 2012 has seen very strong financial performance resulting in a healthy profit and balance sheet. Our focus on our base business is really paying off with the successful startup of Pluto and impressive operational performance from our North West Shelf and Australia Oil assets. Projects to further enhance value from the base business, including the North Rankin Redevelopment and Greater Western Flank Phase 1, are on track. Our renewed strategic direction has resulted in significant work to identify and progress a suite of opportunities to grow the business through potential strategic alliances and entry into new basins.</p>
          <p>With the increased cash flow being generated from Pluto, we continue to look at improvements to our capital efficiency and for ways to enhance shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>Again, I thank you very much for your support and that concludes the formal part of today's briefing and we'll move over to take questions and answers.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Adrian Wood of Macquarie. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter. Just a question on M&amp;A. The growth projects that you have organically seem to be slipping with the disappointing well program in the Carnarvon Basin, the Pluto expansion, and the uncertainties around Browse and Sunrise. It looks like there's very little sort of organic opportunity for growth perhaps in the current portfolio between now and, let's say, 2018. I guess the big unanswered question here today is what comes next. Pluto startup has been fantastic, ahead of expectations. And you have, of course, bolstered the M&amp;A team. Do you feel growing pressure from the rest of the sector that's going to be delivering transformational growth over the next three or four years?</p>
          <p>And also, if you are looking for deals, we've seen several occasions where national oil companies have come and outbid the likes of Shell trying to get exposure to resource. Does that force you to look further up the chain? And if so, perhaps a longer development timeline and so probably doesn't fix the near-term production hole that may be appearing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, thanks, Adrian. As you know, M&amp;A is a difficult business for anybody to be in. So you really need to be quite disciplined in it. If I can go back, though, what we've talked about, though, is not just M&amp;A activities, but it's also commercializing or bringing forward value in our existing assets. We have two parts of the focus on that. One is how do we do the normal opportunity, generation-type activities, which is infill drilling and so on; and then also improving our operational performance, increasing that reliability, our turnaround performance, and so forth. Our cost management on the base business. So it's really making sure we're in the very best shape we can in the base business.</p>
          <p>As we've also seen on our captured resources, both on Browse &#x2013; recently on Browse, and then I think into the future we're looking at opportunities around Pluto and elsewhere. We're looking really hard at how do we materialize or bring forward value. And we strongly believe that the sale of equity in Browse for MIMI brought forward significant value to our shareholders and de-risked a lot of the value in that asset. That was quite a conscious decision on our behalf to ensure that we felt we had a proper value out there in the marketplace for that. And now, of course, you can look to the recent Shell sale then to &#x2013; or Shell purchase from Chevron as really un-valuing that asset in the same way, so underpinning what we felt was a fair price out in the market for Browse.</p>
          <p>So I would say, we're looking very hard at our existing assets, not just at other growth opportunities. And generally, in the marketplace, your observations are correct. It's a very competitive market in upstream E&amp;P. But we're looking all along the value chain. So we've said we want to build our exploration portfolio. We acknowledge that that will take some time to do that and we're looking at opportunities to accelerate that, but equally recognize it may take some time. And then we're looking at other potential entries into discovered resources.</p>
          <p>That's hard, but that's an area where Woodside has some very complementary competencies that we've talked about and we've indicated previously to the market the type of activities that we're looking at. So all of those things, I would tell you, are underway. I'd say we've got an active list of things we're pursuing, but it's hard work. I wouldn't tell you that it's easy work at all.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of John Hirjee of Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. My question relates to the newly-announced dividend policy. And, Peter, I just want to get your views, do you think it's possible for Woodside to combine yield and growth in the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Look, the short answer is yes, I do. And as &#x2013; what we're trying to do is combine &#x2013; we're looking at total shareholder return. And as you know, we've indicated previously, we'll look at all of the aspects of that. At this point in time, we've had &#x2013; we've got an opportunity to increase our dividend to shareholders, but we'll also look at other ways of making sure we get good returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>As far as the growth part of it, I think we're well positioned &#x2013; when you look at the &#x2013; we've talked about the debt on our balance sheet. But if you look at the current robust cash flows that we have, we particularly look at debt capacity and we think our debt capacity is very strong at the moment. And the ratings agencies are taking a similar view as they're seeing us de-risk some of our forward programs.</p>
          <p>So we are very much focused on getting the right balance between that. We're not sitting on our hands, on our laurels. Our focus really is continuing to focus on growth. But the reality is, where we are today, it's a tough business to be in and we want to make sure that we return value to our shareholders as quickly as we can through that phase, so very much focused on the future. We think we're in great shape because we do have that robustness in our balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And another question, if I may, and this relates to obviously the announcement regarding Shell and Chevron within Browse. So Shell assumes quite, subject to no preemption, of course, 26% in the JV and starts to sort of nearly match your equity holding in the project. Does this mean that &#x2013; given Shell could bring its other key operational focus such as floating LNG to come to bear on this if the tenders that you've now received for Browse indicate that it's going to be quite a marginal project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John just a couple of things. Firstly, a point of fact. As we indicated, we've waived our preemptive rights on Browse as have the other joint venture partners. So as part of the transactions that we completed earlier in the week, the joint ventures waived those rights. That also helped disclose on some of the other transactions that we're moving forward, particularly around MIMI, so that's why we're pleased to be out to report today that all the conditions precedent on the MIMI sale are now complete and we'll just go through a period under that contract &#x2013; or under that agreement with MIMI. So if I can put that to the side, the conditions precedent on the sales have been satisfied. Or the &#x2013; I should say the preemption has been satisfied.</p>
          <p>On the technology and so forth, the key on Browse is we have a commitment on Browse under our retention lease conditions to take James Price Point through to a decision point. And we're on track for that. So we've completed most of the geotechnical work that we needed to up on site. We do have the tenders in hand. Those tenders are a huge piece of work, as you're aware. They're in five different currencies. There's many thousands of pages of documents and we'll work through them this year. And we have assurance processes with the JV. So we're still on track to make a decision on James Price Point in the first half of next year.</p>
          <p>With respect to technology, we're pleased to have Shell taking a greater interest in Browse because we think particularly Shell are the global leader in LNG. There's' probably two up there, ExxonMobil and Shell. But Shell probably has the lead with respect to LNG globally. And for somebody like Shell to take a larger piece of a project like this, given their global technology and capabilities in this area, we see that as a real positive.</p>
          <p>Now, what will they bring to the table? They're committed to running through the James Price Point process. They know that. What I would tell you, though, is that clearly it brings options for us in that regard. And I think Shell being able to bring those options to the table, it brings alternatives for us as we go down the path into the future. But James Price Point is clearly the base case for us.</p>

          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Mark Greenwood of Citi. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day. I've got a question about Pluto expansion. You've got all the results now from your exploration program, so you're in a position to make an informed decision about a third-party gas deal. I'm just wondering, why should there be any further delay in a deal? A lot of <mark type="ph" /> fund (44:11) capital sitting there at Pluto that could be utilized and you're saying that it could extend throughout 2013, those discussions. So should we take from this that those projects are marginal projects even with the benefits of the existing infrastructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Mark. I wouldn't talk at all about another operator's project or another owner's project. What we're trying to do is match. You're exactly right, we're trying to match the advantage of having the existing infrastructure sitting at our Pluto site and we've been talking to those owners about some of the new options we have around LNG technology and some of those we showed at the Investor Day where we're trying to reduce the capital cost of the LNG plants.</p>
          <p>So what we're talking to them at the moment about is how do we optimize the size of those facilities with their upstream investments. The previous discussions that we've had have been based around multiples of the existing Pluto trains which have 4.3 MTA multiples or thereabouts. The multiples that we may look forward into the future may be smaller trains, but far less costly trains than the ones that we established for the Pluto foundation. So that's really what it is. We're going back into a CapEx optimization process. And then what happens out of that then, we then have alignment discussions with respect to what equity may look like or what tolling arrangements may get put in place. So I wouldn't read anything more into it than Woodside's provided a proposal now to those other resource owners that wasn't on the table before and that proposal has a lot of interest to them and we're talking about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And one more if I could. You talked about sort of optimizing and maximizing value from the base business. Our previous management went into some detail to highlight the potential debottlenecking opportunities of the North West Shelf and Pluto. I'm just wondering if you could update us on your ambitions for output at the North West Shelf and also Pluto in the longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The North West Shelf, the challenge for us in the short term, short to medium term is getting through the series of turnarounds that we have scheduled and we're very much committed to those because they're both reliability and integrity related. So that's really where the North West Shelf opportunities are going to come from in the near to medium term on that market, just making sure that we execute those programs in the timeframes that we have and we make sure we do them in the years that we said we would do them.</p>
          <p>So at this point, I wouldn't say we've got many plans around the North West Shelf other than to improve &#x2013; continue to work on reliability and uptime availability for it. And we had already squeezed that up to pretty much world-class levels. So where we are today, there's not a lot of headroom left on the North West Shelf to be frank in that regard.</p>
          <p>Pluto, it's early days for us. As you can imagine, as we've been looking at expansion opportunities, we've now turned our engineers' minds to how can we de-bottleneck the existing Pluto train. They've got some ideas. They clearly have some ideas that they're working on. It's too early for me to give you guidance on where those ideas are heading. But I can unequivocally tell you, we are turning our mind out of Pluto and what opportunities there are at Pluto.</p>
          <p>But we really wanted to keep the operations and engineering team focused on near-term reliability because that's where the biggest bang for our buck is, so to speak. We're starting to deliver on that. Once we've got that up and running and we've got all the bugs out of the system &#x2013; and there's still a couple in there &#x2013; then we'll start to make some assessments of what we think potential de-bottlenecking may deliver for us.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Wilson of JPMorgan. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, Peter and Lawrie. Ben Wilson here. I just had a couple of queries on perhaps the Browse development and Price Point specifically. I just wondered if you could let us know post receiving of the state environmental approval, so what's the ongoing &#x2013; the extent of your ongoing engagement with the KLC, the Jabirr Jabirr people and also whether you're still engaged with Joseph Roe and the Goolarabooloo people up there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, a couple of things. Under the state environmental approvals, as you're aware, there's a process where parties can go back and make comment on the approvals or on the conditions. Woodside has made comment on those conditions. They're more practical comments with respect to the conditions in the way that those conditions may operate and we don't see any impediments in those conditions that would stop us going forward with the project. So while we've made comments on them, we think the comments &#x2013; we believe they're comments that will facilitate the execution of the conditions.</p>
          <p>With respect to the native title owners in up in Browse with the both the Jabirr Jabirr and Goolarabooloo, we continue to work quite closely with them. They have stood up their company called Waardi, which is required under the native title agreement.</p>
          <p>The constitution for Waardi is now being approved by both ourselves and the state through that agreement. And Waardi really is their project development or business development organization that is standing up. We had some statutory &#x2013; we had some payments that we needed to make at certain milestones and we've been making those milestones to Waardi. So we're very pleased that they're starting to gain some momentum now in their business development activities and I must congratulate them on the way that they've done that so far.</p>
          <p>With respect to the engagement with the people out there, as you know, we have quite a large presence in Broome, a permanent presence of people who have committed to living in Broome, and I think our relationship is quite good, particularly with the Jabirr Jabirr. As you know, Joseph Roe continues to challenge things and we're just dealing with Joseph in a very respectful way and working through the legal processes that are available to both parties in that regard. So all I would say is Woodside is trying to be the best citizen that we can out there and work it in a very respectful way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a quick follow-up question on that post Shell-Chevron transaction. A couple of days ago, the WA Premier has come out with some comments, more reiteration of his previous commentary and some not-so-valid threats regarding the retention licenses. How does that sort of commentary regarding his commitment to a Price Point development impact your activities with the traditional owners or with the JV parties? And secondly, can you &#x2013; are you still able to confirm the retention licenses out there, which are state mandated and which are federal-related or are they all one or the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look, if I can answer the second part first because it's the easiest, the retention leases are a federal retention lease, but some of the resources in state waters, part of Torosa, is refill and is above the water line, so that's in the state waters. And so you'll find any approval process go through the state and then on to the federal government. So that's a &#x2013; that's the comment I believe that the Premier was making in that regard. But it's a federal retention lease. It's not a state retention lease, but it does have the state involved on the way through.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Premier's comments, I'm pleased to be working in a state where the Premier really cares about development and about people meeting their commitments and is committed to having the state get behind us and progress what are very complex and difficult developments. So I wouldn't read anything more into those comments than we continue to work with the state government that's very committed to the development of James Price Point. It, in no way, affects our relationship with the native title owners or the agreements that we have in place.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Sorry about that. Peter, just your comment on taking a break in the Pluto drill program. That, to me, implies you guys are thinking about a second round of drilling activity potentially in support of Pluto expansion, which means that the whole thing could push out even further. Am I reading that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, two things to it, Gordon. And you know as well as anybody, on an exploration program, when you've got a drill program &#x2013; as you know, we've been at this, we've had about five rig years of activity pursuing Pluto expansion. You get to a point where you're &#x2013; the creaming curve value is starting to diminish. And as you saw from our results this year, we're starting to drill dry holes and non-commercial wells. And so it was a time for us to just call a pause on it.</p>
          <p>What we're doing now is go back and put those results back in. We'll get the guys to run through the seismic and so forth and reevaluate it and rebuild our portfolio. So what I would say in &#x2013; so that's just normal practice, as you know.</p>
          <p>With respect to &#x2013; there's one thing getting before another with respect to ORO gas or equity gas, now I've been consistent over the last year. The best gas gets in first. And so if we have a ORO opportunity, we'll pursue the ORO opportunity. Now, we'll be mindful about equity options, but we'll pursue the ORO opportunity. It won't be an either/or situation here. It will be an and.</p>

          <p>That's a good question, Angela, and good morning. Yeah, the CMATS is certainly out there. It's something that I think exercises the minds of both governments and ourselves. With respect to where we are on it, we really have no control over CMATS. CMATS is a government to government negotiation and it's an issue between the Timor-Leste government and the Australian government. As you're aware, CMATS will rollover, so there's a clause in there that allows CMATS to roll over, if none of the parties decide they want to cancel it. At least that's my understanding of CMATS.</p>
          <p>So we don't see it as a huge impediment to progress. But it's certainly something that in the background is exercising the mind of government. Our view is we've got to focus on the development and getting the best development out there. CMATS, in many ways, was an enabler for development. It wasn't a &#x2013; it wasn't the development itself. It was an enabler. And so I still see that whatever happens, we'll be able to come to an appropriate accommodation there.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to follow up, I think you mentioned about reworking cost estimates. Are you going to then be sort of re-estimating costs for floating or for onshore Timor or for onshore Darwin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one of the commitments that we made on reengagement was, well, the joint ventures still firmly felt that floating was the best option. As part of the reengagement, we would work with the Timor-Leste and Australian governments and update the cost for both Darwin and Timor-Leste LNG. So those numbers haven't been dusted off for a while and we just &#x2013; as part of the reengagement process, we said we will come back to the table, and in an open book way, share our estimates because, of course, they have their own. So we wanted to be able to lay them side by side and see where our assumptions differed to theirs.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Stuart Baker of Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Just a few details given most of the substantive stuff has been done. Just with respect to the once-off cost associated with Pluto, you've shown in the underlying &#x2013; the cargo mitigation costs, but, obviously, within the segmentals and elsewhere, there are other significant expenses and it's more or less in the order of, what, $80 million or $100 million. I'm just kind of &#x2013; which do look like once-off cost to me. I'll be pleased to know if that's not the case. I'm just kind of curious to know as to why you didn't back those out of the underlying figures as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Stuart; it's Lawrie. The amount, you're right, was $81 million. It did include mitigation costs and we talked about that, I think, at some length in the &#x2013; six months ago. We did back the after-tax impact of that one out. There are a couple of other charges, which essentially are start-up costs at Pluto, and they are once-off in nature. But because they &#x2013; well, we just haven't &#x2013; we haven't bothered to pull them out of our reported results. But you could have. I think given the guidance, we only forecast out of underlying as an exception rather than a rule.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And just a follow-up question also regarding slide ten, looking at the other costs for mitigations, Laminaria impairment, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The bar chart there was for after-tax costs. I'm wondering if the figures that you give on the left pre-tax or post-tax, I don't see a tax reconciliation in the financial. So I'm just curious to know what the pre-tax figures would be to go with those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Each of the bars in &#x2013; on the chart on slide ten are &#x2013; each of the items are pre-tax other than tax bar, obviously. The commentary I provided are all pre-tax comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so the other &#x2013; and so just because you mentioned it, there are a number of individual items there. And they're all &#x2013; they've all been mainly one-off in nature. So, for example, the impairment of Laminaria-Corallina, we wouldn't expect to be reporting that as a matter, of course. There is also, mentioned on the slide, one-off tax items, so that was the tax that we paid to Timor-Leste on that &#x2013; on the disposal of that subsidiary back in 2007. But those items are all sort of once-off in nature. And so, although we haven't adjusted all of them out of our reported profit back to underlying profit, well, I've tried to give you some guidance as to what's recurring and what's not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. And then just one final question regarding other growth projects. There's no mention in the current pack about where are we at Laverda. I can understand there, from the previous presentations, that the development studies are underway, looking for a concept selection in 2013. I wonder if you could give us an update on whether that is progressing positively or whether there have been some setbacks to the timeline or potential commercial outcomes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good questions, Stuart, and thanks for reminding us. No, Laverda still is on track. As you know, we've drilled a couple of wells on Laverda. It's really firmed up the resource for Laverda. So we're very much on track in that regard for moving forward on Laverda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. What, at this stage, do you see as the most likely outcome with Shell's remaining stake in Woodside? I know you've said in the past there was interest among investors in that stake, but, obviously, nothing has come of it so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, James. Yeah, Lawrie again. Yeah, we've said in the past that we've had some discussions with Shell. We've also said that there's really been nothing crystallized out of those discussions that we can report. And I must say, I think our focus in conversations with Shell recently have been more about the Chevron and Shell transaction and our own transaction with MIMI. And so there's certainly been no progress with respect to their shareholding in Woodside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Peter, just a quick follow-up question. I wanted to just ask you about the LNG &#x2013; sort of emerging LNG supply competition towards the end of the decade. How do you see that affecting your growth plans in Australia, especially with regard to, say, East Africa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, I've mentioned &#x2013; our view is we watch the world pretty closely, as you know, from a global point of view because while we're Australian based and majority of our assets are here, we're competing in a global commodity market. Clearly, East Africa is an extraordinarily &#x2013; it's an extraordinary gas province that's been discovered in Mozambique and could go north. What does that mean? It's likely that that LNG will be a development there. I think the question will be the timing of those developments, how quickly they're able to get into market and so forth. So while I see that as another competitive source coming in, we don't see it as fundamentally changing the market in that respect. So we don't see it affecting our projects directly. We won't be going head-to-head with that particular gas. But it does provide other supply options, I think, in other sectors of the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. We probably have time, I think, guys, for about one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your final question comes from the line of James Bullen of Merrill Lynch. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Just firstly, on the DRP, you've elected to keep it in effect for this period. When will you be looking to shut that off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our approach with the DRP has been that &#x2013; it has been a very useful mechanism for us to ensure that it's been an equity component of our &#x2013; funding our growth program. We wanted to maintain the capacity in the program that exists today, and so for that reason we didn't want to turn it off. We know that there are investors that appreciate the opportunity to continuing to step up in their Woodside shareholding. But having said that, we will continue to measure the proximity of our growth projects and we'll make decisions on the DRP on a six monthly basis, depending on that growth. And remembering, I'd say we &#x2013; I'm really talking about the Board who retain that responsibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, I would add the program, as it's currently designed, is designed not to be dilutive. And so this is a change in the program. So as you'll note in the details, it's designed not to be dilutive. It's really designed to maintain the option there, both for ourselves to access that capital if we require it and then also for our shareholders who wish to have a facilitated way of reinvesting in our stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And just one on exploration. I guess based on the presentation at the Strategy Day, you are looking to expand your exploration, but you also noted during the presentation today that you've been disappointed with the results of the past two years. Just curious as to how you're going to go about improving the performance from your exploration to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There's two parts to exploration. One part is the sandbox that you're working. And so what we're really focused on now is expanding the opportunities for us in the regions of the world where we can actually go and explore in. So that's the first part to that and that's really where the focus is now, is making sure we're exploring in the very best and most prospective parts of the world.</p>
          <p>And we said we want to have a balance in that program between mature, emerging, and frontier regions in the world. So you won't find it's all greenfield frontier; it'd be a mix of the three. So that's how we're rebuilding the program. That's really where we want to be. And we have been acquiring spec seismic in certain areas to enhance our knowledge and understanding of that.</p>
          <p>The second part then is building our team. And we're currently in a rebuild process, and so we've been active in the marketplace in targeting specific skill sets that we believe we require to move forward to improve our performance and to broaden our knowledge base. So we're working &#x2013; we recognize and we're working on those two aspects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, guys, thank you, again, very much for your time this morning. We'll get a chance to speak to some of you over the next few days. But, again, thanks a lot for your interest in Woodside, your continuing support. The quality of your questions indicate very strongly to us the interest that you're taking in our company and I hope we're communicating in a very positive and open way with you.</p>
          <p>We believe our performance is starting to determine the path that we're going to go down and demonstrate that we are really focused on meeting our commitments and we'll continue &#x2013; hopefully, we'll continue on this journey together as we work on this. But it is a journey; it's not a sprint. But I think today is a pretty good milestone in that journey.</p>
          <p>So, again, thanks very much for your time. And I look forward to meeting with a number of you over the next few days.</p>
