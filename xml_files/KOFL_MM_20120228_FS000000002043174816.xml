      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the fourth quarter of 2011, our operators delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth in both of our divisions in the face of a challenging cost environment and tough weather conditions in some of our territories.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter of 2011, we have integrated the results of Grupo Tampico as of October and the results of Grupo CIMSA as of December in our Mexican operations. These results contribute to our Mexico and Central America division and our consolidated results. In addition to these newly merged territories, the main drivers of our company's performance were our strategy of selective price increases implemented across our operations during the year and the strength of our <mark type="ph" /> multiple favorite (1:59) portfolio beverages led by brand Coca-Cola and our growing array of still beverages</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues reached more than MXN 36 billion, up 29% from the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the integration of Grupo Tampico and Grupo CIMSA in Mexico, total revenues grew approximately 24%. On a currency neutral basis and excluding the newly merged territories in Mexico, our consolidated total revenues grew 18% for the quarter, driven by average price per unit case growth in every operation and volume growth mainly in Mexico, Argentina and Colombia and Brazil.  Our consolidated sales volume grew 11%, including our newly merged territories in Mexico.  Organically, our volumes grew 4%, primarily supported by the performance of our sparkling beverage portfolio in which brand Coca-Cola in Mexico, Argentina and Colombia combined with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:16) in Brazil were the main drivers of the category's growth.</p>
          <p>In addition, our still beverage category grew 11%. This growth mainly resulted from the recent launch of the Jugos del Valle line of business in Venezuela and its continued strong performance in Mexico and Brazil, together with Hi-C orangeade and the Cepita juice brand in Argentina. Our bottled water portfolio registered low single-digit volume growth.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated gross profit grew 27%, which is more than MXN 16 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Higher PET and sweetener costs across our territories combined with the average depreciation of <mark type="ph" /> our remains (4:10) operation with local currency as applied to our U. S. dollar-denominated raw material costs accounted for the majority of increase in our cost of goods sold. As a result, our consolidated gross margin declined almost 80 basis points to 45.6% in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated operating income grew 28% to MEX$6.5 billion, during the fourth quarter, supported by double-digit operating income growth in both of our divisions, including our recently integrated territories in Mexico. Operating leverage, achieved mainly through higher revenues, compensated for higher labor costs in Venezuela, increased labor and freight costs in Argentina, and cost associated with integration of our new territories in Mexico, as well as increased marketing investment to reinforce our execution, widen our cooler coverage and broaden our returnable base.</p>
          <p>Our operating margin remained almost flat at 18%, compared with 18.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010. On a currency neutral basis, our consolidated operating income grew 22%, demonstrating our operators' ability to deliver strong bottom-line in the face of important raw material headwinds.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated EBITDA increased 27% to MEX$7.8 billion in the fourth quarter. During this quarter, we also reported MEX$1,142 million in our expenses. These expenses mainly reflect the write-off of certain non-productive assets, including production equipment, coolers, forklifts, and returnable bottles and cases, resulting from our routine inventory, and &#x2013; also consistent with prior quarters &#x2013; the recording of employee profit sharing and loss on sale on fixed assets. For the quarter, our consolidated net controlling interest income grew more than 6%, reaching MEX$3.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Now I will expand on the performance of our operations.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our Mexico and Central America division recorded close to 18% volume growth, selling more than 410 million unit cases of beverages. Our Mexican operations volume grew more than 19%, including 49 million unit cases contributed by our newly merged territories.</p>
          <p>Organically, our volumes in Mexico grew 4%. This increase mainly resulted from 5% growth in brand Coca-Cola, in both single and multi-serve presentations, 14% growth of our <mark type="ph" /> Ciel (7:34) water brand in personal presentations and 4% growth of the still beverage category, supported by the Jugos del Valle line of products along with Nestea and PowerAde.</p>
          <p>In Central America, we've registered 6% volume growth in the fourth quarter. This increase was driven mainly by brand Coca-Cola, which grew 7%, combined with double-digit volume growth in the still beverage category, supported by our recently incorporated <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:11) portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our multi-segmentation strategy and strong execution at the point of sale contributed to a 6% increase in our average price per unit case in the division during the fourth quarter. As a result, our division's total revenue grew close to 26%, reaching MEX$14.5 billion. Excluding the integration of Grupo Tampico and Grupo CIMSA, total revenues grew approximately 13%.  And on a currency neutral basis and excluding the integration of the new territories in Mexico, total revenue grew 11% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>With regard to our profitability, higher PET and sweetener costs across the division were further impacted by the average depreciation of the Mexican peso as applied to our U. S. dollar-denominated raw materials costs. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2010, our gross profit increased 17% to MEX$6.6 billion and our gross margin reached 45.4%.</p>
          <p>Our operating income increased 16% to MEX$2.5 billion. Operating leverage achieved through high revenues partially compensated for gross margin pressures across the division. As a result, our operating margin was 17.2%. On a currency neutral basis, our operating income grew approximately 15%. Our EBITDA grew more than 20% to MEX$3.1 billion compared with the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In sum, our Mexico and Central America division delivered positive results for the quarter. Our strategy of selective price increases targeted to mitigate the increased cost of raw materials continues to build on the brand equity of our products, especially brand Coca-Cola.</p>
          <p>We continue to benefit from the investments we have made over the years in support of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:44) presentations, which continue to contribute significantly to our company's growth. In addition, we seek to foster the availability of single-serve packaging alternatives, such as the <mark type="ph" /> 200 ml worldwide (10:59) presentation for brand Coca-Cola in Mexico and the affordable 12 ounce presentation for brand Coca-Cola in Central America, contributing to a healthier price mix.</p>
          <p>Within the still beverage category, we continue to incorporate Estrella Azul portfolio in Panama, distributing shelf-stable milk and juice products in <mark type="ph" /> our red tops (11:23).  This new venture with our partner, the Coca-Cola Company, continues to provide us with a deeper knowledge and understanding of this exciting category.</p>
          <p>We have successfully integrated the beverage division of Grupo Tampico. Now our new Northeast region in Mexico, as well as the beverage division of Grupo CIMSA. And we are working to capture the announced synergies according to the timeframe we've previously shared with you.</p>
          <p>Additionally, as you may know, in December 2011, we announced our agreement to merge with Grupo Fomento Queretano's beverage division, another key step for the Mexican Coca-Cola system. We are honored to have reached our third merger agreement with one of Mexico's deeply respected family bottlers, with whom we share an aligned vision of economic and social value creation.</p>
          <p>These transactions, combined with our <mark type="ph" /> incursion in the daily segment (12:31) in Panama, together with our partner the Coca-Cola Company, amounted to more than MEX$28 billion, our most significant investment since the acquisition of Panamco in 2003. Aggregate expected synergies from our mergers in Mexico are more than MEX$800 million. We remain confident that our operators' abilities and discipline will continue to deliver a positive result, despite raw material cost pressures.</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about our South America division. Our South America division's total sales volume grew more than 3% in the fourth quarter, reaching more than <mark type="ph" /> 220 (13:24) million unit cases. This increase was driven by volume growth in every operation.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we continue to expand the strong performance experienced in 2011. Every category group, leveraging on solid consumer environment. Sparkling beverage grew 9%, driven by 13% volume growth of brand Coca-Cola. Still beverage expanded their solid performance, growing more than 45%, leveraging the successful launch of Hi-C orangeade earlier in the year as well as the strength of Cepita juice brand. The Aquarius flavored water line drove the 5% growth of our water portfolio.</p>
          <p>In our Colombian franchise, volumes increased 3% despite tough weather conditions experienced during the quarter. The sparkling beverage category supported by 6% growth of brand Coca-Cola and the performance of Quatro and Sprite in flavored sparkling beverages grew 5%.</p>
          <p>The still beverage category grew 3%. These increases compensated for a volume decline in our water portfolio.  In Brazil, despite unfavorable weather during the later part of the quarter, our volumes grew more than 1%, building on strong fourth quarter of 2010 in which we posted 8% volume growth. Sparkling beverages grew 1%, supported by the Fanta and Schweppes brand. Still beverages, driven by the Jugos del Valle line of business and PowerAde, grew 5%. These increases compensated for a volume decline in our water portfolio.</p>
          <p>With regard to Venezuela, our volumes grew almost 2%. Our operators' continuous efforts to evaluate different portfolio alternatives for our consumers, such as introducing new still beverage offerings in the marketplace, combined with increased consumer spending, yield positive results. Our still beverage portfolio volumes doubled, mainly as a result of the successful introduction of the Valle Fresh orangeade. This increase in combination with 1% growth in the sparking beverages offset volume declines in the water category. We will continue to evaluate different portfolio strategies for our consumers, such as affordable <mark type="ph" /> one-way weekly (16:21) presentations and expandability availability of our single-serve returnable package.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2011, our South America division's total revenue grew 32% to MXN 21.7 billion, as a result of double-digit revenue growth in every territory. Excluding beer, which accounted for MXN 1.2 million of revenues, our total revenues reached MEX$20.5 billion. Selective price increases implemented over the past several months <mark type="ph" /> at closer division (17:01) accounted for close to 90% of our incremental revenues. And volume growth in every country accounted for the remainder. On a currency neutral basis, total revenues in the division grew approximately 24%.</p>
          <p>With regard to our profitability, our South America division's gross profit increased 35% to MEX$9.9 billion. Higher PET and sweetener costs across the division were further impacted by the average devaluation of our <mark type="ph" /> remains operations' local currency as of light to (17:44). U. S. dollar denominated raw material cost. Nevertheless, our gross margins expanded 100 basis points to 45.7% for the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our operating income grew 36% to MEX$4 billion. Operating expenses were affected by higher labor costs in Venezuela, higher labor and freight costs in Argentina and increased marketing investments <mark type="ph" /> in reservation (18:21) to reinforce our execution. Consequently, our operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 18.4% during the fourth quarter. Our South America division's EBITDA increased 32% to MEX$4.6 billion in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In summary, our South America division delivered solid results in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our broad array of beverage alternatives on top of consumer's preference for our brand Coca-Cola and our ability to offer these consumers valuable packaging alternatives, such as returnable and affordable single-serve presentations, have proven successful. Today, we are able to provide our consumers with a wider array of choices to quench their thirst.</p>
          <p>We continue to foster the introduction of new products that capture volume and value opportunities in the beverages space, such as the Valle Fresh and Hi-C orangeade, in Venezuela and Argentina respectively. Indeed, one of our main competitive advantages continues to be the multi-category portfolio of high-quality beverages we have developed through the years.</p>
          <p>Now allow me to walk you through our financial performance for the quarter. This quarter, once again, our geographically balanced portfolio franchise territories delivered increased cash flows. As of December 31 of last year, we have a cash balance of MXN 12.6 billion pesos and our total debt was MXN 22.6 billion pesos. Our net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio was 0.4 times and our EBITDA to net interest coverage ratio was 22 times, highlighting the strength of our balance sheet and financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Our financial flexibility is underscored by the solid balance sheet and the strong cash flow generation that our company has built over the years. In addition to the investments we have made to grow our business <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:52) via innovations and categories, business models and packaging alternatives and through value-creating mergers and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>We have been increasing the dividends we pay to our shareholders. With this in mind, our Board of Directors has agreed to propose a dividend of approximately MXN 5,625 million to our shareholders. This proposed amount represents a dividend of approximately MXN 2.77 per share computed on the basis of 2,030.5 million shares, which include the 45.1 million shares to be issued in connection with the merger of Grupo Fomento Queretano.  As compared with dividend of MXN 2.36 per share paid as of April of last year, this represents an increase of approximately 17%.</p>
          <p>We are confident that the strong brand equity of our multi-category portfolio beverages, our operators' relentless pursuit of optimal execution at the point of sale, the innovation capabilities of our talented team of professionals, the incorporation of new businesses into our company and the financial flexibility that we have achieved over the past several years will enable us to continue growing our business and delivering increased value for our shareholders now and into the future.</p>
          <p>As many of you may know, on February 20 of this year, we announced that we have signed a 12-month exclusivity agreement with the Coca-Cola Company to value the potential acquisition of a controlling stake in their Philippines bottling operation.  Both parties are confident and our companies' expertise are demonstrated with our successful track record of operating in fragmented markets and emerging economies can be effectively deployed in this territory and contribute significant towards expanding the penetration of, and consumer preference for, the Coca-Cola company's brands in this market.  This agreement does not require either party to enter into a transaction, and there can be no assurances that a definite agreement will be executed.</p>
          <p>Thank you, as always, for your continued confidence in us. And now, I would like to open up the call for any questions that you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And the first question will come from the line of Lauren Torres, HSBC. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Hector, despite some significant cost pressures last year, you were able to maintain or we saw maybe slight compression for the full year with your gross and operating margins. Just curious how you're thinking about this year. I assume some of your cost pressures are still weighing on your result, or will weigh on your results this year. So if you could talk about the offsets, I mean, is pricing still your main option here, or do you think we'll see some further compression on the margin side if these pressures do exist?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Lauren. Yes. As you correctly explained, this year where in 2011, the pressure we have on raw materials, especially PET and sugar, was very, very strong.</p>
          <p>When you look back and just as a reference &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> I know with (25:12) Mexico being a very important market. And you look back at sweet and sugar prices two years ago, we basically have more than doubled the prices of sugar.</p>
          <p>And in the case of PET, and that's basically across all of our territories, we have suffered increases of around <mark type="ph" /> 65% (25:38). So those are very tremendous increases for these very important raw materials. As you know PET and sugar together with a syrup that we pay to The Coca-Cola Company are basically 90% of our raw materials that we use.</p>
          <p>So with that cost pressure that we have experienced in the past, <mark type="ph" /> they are willing to be high in (26:07) flexibility in the pricing is very important. And I think that basically, we have, as you can see from the numbers, been able to pass along most of those price increases &#x2013; most of those cost increases to our consumer.</p>
          <p>In total, the impact that we have just because of sugar and PET, the whole company for the full 2011, was basically around MEX$1,900 million, which is a very large figure.</p>
          <p>We have flexibility in some countries &#x2013; some more than others. But I think that the good news is that those are costs that are impacting the full industry. So we are seeing some more pricing flexibility from our competitors, and as you might expect, I'm sure <mark type="ph" /> that this will be in (27:11) some of the markets and to look up our prices, we still are maintaining a very significant price gaps with the rest of our competitors.</p>
          <p>I would say that the main yellow light, if you want to use that expression, is Mexico, where we have a new operator with Pepsi-Cola, after the formation of the new bottling operation in Mexico <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:38) Venezuelans. They have been a bit aggressive on the pricing.  As an example on cans, we're basically selling at double the price than what they are selling.  They are selling in some instances <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:55).</p>
          <p>But we think that where those are broadly temporary &#x2013; in our opinion, those are temporary price points and that they will &#x2013; that they are using just to, I guess, reignite a little bit the prices in Mexico, no?</p>
          <p>Other than that, Lauren, I think that, in general, we are expecting, for the full-year, more or less a stable prices in PET, and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:30) because of the oil prices at the beginning of the year, have been increasing. So January has been a little bit higher than what we're anticipating in PET prices.</p>
          <p>And sugar prices, <mark type="ph" /> we expect that there (28:44) is still some volatility and some potentially increase. But we feel that the main matter, which is fixing the price of our product &#x2013; or fixing them and taking care of the prices of our products &#x2013; I think that we have this flexibility to start moving going forward, because everyone in the industry is suffering from this same cost pressure.</p>
          <p>The other part of the equation is what can you do with operating expenses. And I think that, and you have seen in the past that we are stressing a lot on that line. I think that Mexico and Central America, which have been very successful in improving the OpEx line. We still have some room to move in South America, but I think that we are moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>But trying to compensate exclusively, we are more efficient in operating expenses line. These increases that we have been suffering in raw materials is complex, so we will make this flexibility on the pricing front in our approach to fully compensate for that.</p>
          <p>And as I said, most of &#x2013; we are seeing most of our competitors moving the prices.  As I said, the only exception is right now, and I think it's more as an effort for the new management of PepsiCo in Mexico. That's the only way we're working from reluctance to move prices, but again, we believe this more as a temporary price activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as a follow-up, can I ask that the visibility that you have now with respect to pricing and managing the operating expense line, do you think you can maintain margins this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes,  Lauren. I think that it's &#x2013; given the expectation we have with prices, operating expenses and cost of raw materials, I feel that what we can certainly maintain margins on a consolidated basis. You might see some differences country by country, but on a consolidated basis, I think the idea is that we maintain the margins that we've had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Alan Alanis with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions, one technical and one more strategic, Hector.</p>
          <p>The technical question is, is the improvement that we're seeing on the SG&amp;A in Mexico related at all with the write-downs that you're doing in the fourth quarter? And I guess, I mean, you have already answered with you expect flat to &#x2013; I mean, you don't expect margin contraction, based on Lauren's question.</p>
          <p>But I just want to want to understand what will be the right level of selling and SG&amp;A expenses that we should see going forward and if these writedowns in any way or form are related to that improvement that we saw in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Alan. For the first question. I think that in general, we can see some additional efficiencies in Mexico on the operating expenses line. And I certainly hope that in South America, we can also improve.</p>
          <p>I'm seeing, as I mentioned, some improvement in Mexico already. But I think because of the integration of inventory turns and the scale that we're gaining, we thought we would continue to see some improvement in the operating expenses line.</p>
          <p>In South America, we are still working &#x2013; we are behind what we've done in Mexico, probably by 12 months. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:00) on the operating expense line.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned, in general, I feel on a consolidated basis flat margins at the operating income line.  And again, we might see some differences on a temporary basis on a country-by-country basis, depending on how raw material costs are affecting each of the different countries. And maybe some of the movements on currencies. So remember that most of these raw materials are dollar denominated, no.</p>
          <p>But I see that that's basically how I'm seeing 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're not &#x2013; I mean these improvements are not &#x2013; have nothing to do with declines in marketing spending, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that general marketing expenses have been very flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do have some adjustments at the end of the fourth quarter. Because sometimes due to some provisions during the year, you end up spending a little bit less than what you were anticipating.</p>
          <p>But at the end of the day, basically we target a certain level of marketing expense to work with The Coca-Cola Company.  Sometimes the fourth quarter you need to take an extra charge because the provisions were a little bit smaller than anticipated. Sometimes your marketing expenses goes a little bit below.</p>
          <p>But at the end of the day, the full amount for the year is what you spend for the year. Is that clear, Alan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no, it is clear. And last question, more strategic, and I know you and I have discussed this in the past many times, but it will be good to get an update.</p>
          <p>Regarding your views on the Philippines, I mean the context of the question is Amatil operated that territory for some years. Unfortunately, they had to sell it back at a lower price than they had acquired it, so it was painful for them. I guess the question that I'm framing here is why the Philippines and what can Coca-Cola FEMSA do differently than Amatil and other co-bottlers in order to create value in that country?</p>
          <p>And what the likelihood of closing and controlling a percentage? I mean, do you see more than 50%, less than 50% chance of closing?  I know you were very clear in saying that there is no guarantee, but if you could throw in there a percentage, it would be highly appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that &#x2013; I guess that you have heard me say for many quarters that we will continue looking for opportunities to grow.</p>
          <p>When you look at what is left &#x2013; let me use that expression &#x2013; in Latin America, you have a very large bottler like Arca, you have <mark type="ph" /> Antina (36:20) that did have a recent merger announcement.</p>
          <p>So assuming that these other bottlers continue independent, there is no much opportunities to continue growing. I mean, there are a few territories in Mexico, there are some in Brazil, and then not much left.</p>
          <p>So a little bit of our thinking is we have to &#x2013; setting aside, Alan, everything related to new categories, as when we did the acquisition of Jugos del Valle, what we did with their beverage business in Panama. Which are &#x2013; our strategic thinking is these categories are growing, we need to be present there. <mark type="ph" /> We see a lot of (37:06) participants in the non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink business.</p>
          <p>Looking at on the sparkling opportunities, we have to look at our geographies. Because again, in Latin America, there are not that many opportunities left. And even if you do all of those that are available, it's not that large in terms of cases. It's not another Panamco or another opportunity like that.</p>
          <p>Obviously, Asia always catches the attention of everyone doing an analysis because of the potential for growth, as you got to see, and the stage of development that you see <mark type="ph" /> in these (37:50). As we announced on February 20, both The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola FEMSA, we were very concerned that a lot of rumors would trigger. We will start basically in the Philippines. And we concluded what better to do this announcement, basically saying that for this 12-month period, we have an exclusivity from The Coca-Cola Company to analyze these opportunity.</p>
          <p>We are not reaching any conclusion, Alan. So therefore we are just starting to analyze that. We have very few information.  We will start travelling to Philippines in the following weeks. And  actually as a reference, the 12-month exclusivity period have also to do with the fact that this is &#x2013; we are starting at the very important high season &#x2013; or they are starting at the very important high season on sales and volumes in the Philippines, so they preferred to delay our &#x2013; let me use the word landing &#x2013; in Philippines to start analyzing and do all the analysis that we have to do after this too.</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we basically have very few information right now.</p>
          <p>From a very preliminary analysis of just what we have tested in the past and analyzed, we think there is a market that is, in certain aspects, similar to what we have in Latin America in the fragmentation of the <mark type="ph" /> rotate system (39:38) and the consumption pattern of some of the consumers, et cetera. So we think that we can take advantage of some of our expertise that we have developed in tackling these markets.</p>
          <p>I would not venture to give you a percentage possibility of success because as I said, we are just starting to do our own analysis. But what I will ask is you give us the benefit of the doubt that we will do a very profound analysis, and negotiate the structure and the price and the conditions that we have done in the past, I feel, appropriately. And we have demonstrated that in the past.</p>
          <p>So give us some time, and we will keep you informed on how we are evolving. But so far, we are so early in the beginning of the process that it's very difficult for us to venture to give possibilities of closing a transaction, or even venture to give some additional information on values or whatever it is. We are just starting to do that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Hector, I wanted to just follow up a bit on the &#x2013; on the cost pressures you've face, particularly in Mexico in the quarter and I wonder if you could just go back and sort of &#x2013; just give us a better... well. I would like to understand how much of the fourth quarter pressure kind of was related to currency and the currency strength and a bit here.  You also mentioned that you're expecting PET to be stable this year, but I guess, I think PET rose during the course of last year, so I'm not sure if you're talking about stable with fourth-quarter level or stable with the average of last year and then sugar is also down from its highs, although not from maybe the average level. So could you give us a sense of how much of the sort of intense cost pressures you felt in the fourth quarter was going to be sustained as you start to beginning of 2012 or how much of it was unique to some of those factors or more associated with those factors in terms of the fourth quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Lore.  Let me give you some figures and maybe I'll refer to <mark type="indiscernible" />  (42:24) to confirm a little bit breakdown of how much is actually, how much is price, later on. The figures that I have right now, as I presented to the Board of Directors last week, the effect that we have during the fourth quarter, <mark type="ph" /> showed you (42:45) in the fourth quarter for both the effect of foreign exchange and the prices of sweeteners and PET is MXN 920 million. More or less is half and half between Mexico and Central America and half is South America. I don't have any specific breakdown right now, Lore, of how much of that is related just to pure pricing and how much is related toward the FX effect because as you correctly are pointing out, part of that had to do with a very important devaluation of some of the currencies toward the end of the fourth quarter. <mark type="ph" /> On our last call (43:28), which I tried to break that down between prices of raw materials and FX. So total impact in Mexican pesos, which combines both FX, is MXN 920 million. For the full year, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, was MXN 1.9 billion. So in the fourth quarter, the effect was basically half of the total effect that we have during the year. So it was very important. During January, we have seen some increases in PET compared to December, compared to the prices we have in November and December. And that's ahead of what we have last January also. But in general, as a general trend I will say  that PET for now and for the full year should be flat or slightly up, and again and I'm a little bit concerned with the rising oil prices that we are seeing right now and that might change a little bit how we look at prices going forward. And in the case of sweeteners, we are seeing flattish, average prices for the full year compared to last year. Again, some of the currencies have been <mark type="ph" /> perpetuating (44:53) some of the lost space that they had at the end of last year so that we will benefit a little bit in January and February, but it will depend on how the currencies behave <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:12) breakdown between prices on peak and FX in the fourth quarter, so we have a clearer picture. So that's more or less our environment <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:23).  PET flattish to slightly up and sugar prices more or less flat compared to full average for last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of Tampico and also CIMSA, can you just give us a sense of &#x2013; or just an overview of where you are in the integration process? You mentioned that the OpEx includes some cost to integrate the acquisitions, kind of when do you expect to see the positive effect of those acquisitions? And then just lastly, if you could give us your CapEx budget for 2012, that would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Un the case of Tampico, which is the one that we started the process earlier, strange enough, it's the one that is going to take a little bit more to fully integrate. Not because of the distance, but because of some of the integration and systems that were very different from what we have. In there we are still running some &#x2013; I don't know how the technicians call that, but we are going separate processors in terms of systems and the administrative expenses related to managing and some of the accounting. And that will probably take us two more months to finalize and then we'll substantially start saving on that front. So the commercial process is fully integrated, the logistic process is fully integrated, all the production capacity has been decided, how we're going to do it and allocated to the different plants. So I think that in that front, we are branching very fast.  And again the OpEx line in Tampico is the one that we are having a little bit more problem because of the difference in systems that we have. But I will say that two more months, that will take probably five full of months since we started integration, will imply for us to really cut those expenses down.</p>
          <p>In the case of CIMSA, we started in December.  But CIMSA was a company that was running systems very similar to what we have, and in the case of CIMSA, we're banking on the factor on the OpEx front.  We're pretty much advancing the integration of logistics and production. But we're still probably a month away from that full integration of CIMSA. So I'll say that during the full year 2012, I'll expect somewhere around 65%, 70%, 75% of the synergies that we announced for a full year to be achieved during 2012. And just to give you the latest number, we're more or less expecting around MXN 300 million in each of the operations around synergies. Once we integrate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:57) we expect to have <mark type="ph" /> to the transaction (49:02) of the end of the <mark type="ph" /> fourth (49:08) quarter, we will start looking at around probably another MXN 200 million for a total, <mark type="ph" /> 800 million net sales.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The CapEx is &#x2013; we're expecting somewhere around $600 million of CapEx, Lore. But bear in that we're starting plants and waiting for authorization for two additional production plants &#x2013; one in Colombia and one in Brazil.  Depending on speed of the authorizations for all the work permit that you need from the different government agencies in the two countries, that might increase the &#x2013; I probably say around  $100 million more, if we start building those two plants during this year. So, if the speed of the permits go fast, we might end up closer to $700 million this year.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Hector, and congratulations on the results. I had a question regarding the debt during the quarter. When you announced the acquisition of Tampico and CIMSA, you announced that both companies had a net debt of around MXN 4.7 billion. I was wondering if the outflow of cash that we saw during the quarter was related with the payment of this debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Karla. It's totally related to that. They had that level of financing that was part of the acquisition price at the end of the day and we ended up immediately paying those financings as soon as we took control of the operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up. Previously you mentioned that the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:26) in Mexico was being reluctant to move prices.  Besides that have you seen any other changes out there regarding competition?  Are they more aggressive in the market, maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Karla, as I said during the summary comments, I think that &#x2013; again, I think that PepsiCo is being a little bit more aggressive, more of a temporary process for the start of the new <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:06) new company operating here in Mexico. I'll say especially in single serve presentations as I was describing, this huge price differential that we have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:18)  &#x2013; where we have, basically we are selling at double the price than <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:26). But the good news is that some of the other competitors that for years were not tend to move prices, they started to move prices last year, especially <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:36)  was for many years as you remember <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:38) during company's conference call saying that they have two liters at MXN 10.  Last year, they moved prices to MXN 11 and we understand and we're seeing some price movements from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:55).  <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:55) starting to move to MXN 12.  So it's an important increase from our competitors and because of that, I should <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:12) comments I made earlier that these raw material pressures effecting all the competitors, and that's why we see that the pricing level has been an important element in the past to compensate for that. And those prices are ticking, because the competitors are also moving the prices now.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning everyone. One quick question and then a question about Brazil. When you first started the Jugos del Valle business, you had said you were going to be re-investing all the profits for a few years until the marketing spend was up to par, et cetera. And then at some point we're going to see some equity income. If you could update us as to when we could expect to see the first trickling of equity income from that unit. And then the second question is just after the big minimum wage increase in Brazil, have you seen a marked impact in consumer behavior in Brazil at January. And how should we look at Brazil volume growth for 2012 in the context of this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jose. Let me tackle first Jugos del Valle question. In general, we have two different models in what it expects to Jugos del Valle in Mexico versus Brazil.  Remember that Jugos del Valle when we acquired it had a very important operation in Brazil. The agreement that we have with the Mexican bottlers is that Jugos del Valle is basically <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:14). So the Jugos del Valle <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:22) have very small margin and basically the 50% on the profits that we share with The Coca-Cola company, The Coca-Cola company receives that through selling some of the formulas and ingredients to the formulas that they sell to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:42) producing entity and we get a price from Jugos del Valle and the margin that we get when we sell that to our clients is basically our 50%. So there is not that much money left in Jugos del Valle and the only exception is that <mark type="ph" /> better serve modern freight (56:06), Jugos del Valle is the one that sells <mark type="ph" /> two modern freight for the whole country (56:10). And then <mark type="ph" /> with modern freight (56:15) you have information of the number of stores that you have by regions and everything is very efficient in terms of serving that client, those clients and also been able to allocate the 50% to profit for the bottlers, to each of the bottlers according to the presence of those stores in the different regions.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, the formula is totally different because there are important tax incentives in the area where the production happen. So most of the profits in Brazil remain at the joint-venture and then the joint venture pays dividends to the different participants or more as a &#x2013; let me use the words of who gave you <mark type="ph" /> what &#x2013; those who have (57:13) reasonable profits there in the operation.  In both instances, I will say, right now we continue to be at a level where we continue to invest heavily behind those brands <mark type="ph" /> and into our sources (57:33). In some cases going faster than others/  Mexico have not grown very importantly, but we have continued to invest behind the brands. And I think that the important elements for next year is that under the new international accounting rules, we will have to register and we have to explain with much more details in the coming weeks, but we have to register the participation on these associated companies as part of the operating income.  It's not going to be any more than other revenue line below the operating line. So in general to try to answer your questions, both businesses for Brazil and Mexico are profitable, but we continue to reinvest some of the  money- in the case of Mexico that margin is staying directly in Coca-Cola FEMSA because we have a margin the we distribute. In the case of Brazil, we have, it's just a participation on the equity of that joint venture.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of second question with respect to Brazil, I think that- I mean we have the salary increase, the important salary increase in Brazil. I think that is one of the positive for the consumer. So far in January we haven't seen that because the weather continues to be unusually wet, especially January. So I think that one thing has compensated the other, but I'm optimistic that the consumer has really a little bit more disposable income, we will see some volume growth that we haven't seen lately in Brazil, we'll start to see some volume growth in that operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess in the case of January and not in the summer, but in the case of January, this wetness was already in the base because last year had already been a wet January. So I guess, I'm not sure how much of the case you can make about the weather playing a part in January given that it's in the base, but I hear you and the answer is no impact yet. So that's....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see what you're saying, I mean, I look at some of the presentations from the operators, they are complaining about that.  They show me pictures of some of the disruptions that have been <mark type="indiscernible" /> (60:26) and all of that. It's important &#x2013; honestly I don't remember how it was last year, but you know that in this industry sometimes it's every excuse from the operators <mark type="ph" /> from the weather (60:41) and I take a look at what has been happening last year. The charts that they have been showing to me in terms of rain and inches of rain and how that has been balancing some of the roads, it's important. I mean I was in Brazil in January <mark type="ph" /> and it was nice (61:03). We were trying to look at some of the area where we will be building this plant, it was impossible to reach because it was totally <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:10). But honestly, I don't remember exactly how that was last year. But that's &#x2013; I've think that my methods, Jose, I think that the salary increases, although it's not affecting everyone, will help in the disposable income and am positive that at some point in time that it will start to trickle down into some of our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:36). So far January it has been very flattish, February is a little bit better, but it's still flattish compared to last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Hector, I had a question with respect to the hedges you may have on in terms of high fructose corn syrup as well as any sugar positions for the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Robert. In general, I'll say that in Mexico we have advanced importantly with high fructose.  And we basically have agreed that the estimate that we have to use for the full year, we are basically 90% covered in the price at where I believe are good prices compared to last year.  We don't have, as you know, any hedges on sugar in Mexico.  We do have some in Brazil, but I'll say around 30% to 35% of the <mark type="ph" /> needs (63:21) in Brazil have been entered into some hedges and we have done some hedges with respect to the currency on some of the dollar-denominated raw materials.  In other words, we are not hedging <mark type="ph" /> this early (63:40)  the price of the raw materials because maybe there is not a market for that, but <mark type="ph" /> for simple (63:43) for PET in Colombia or PET in Brazil, we have <mark type="ph" /> a balance (63:46) in hedging some of the exposure to the dollar in those markets. And I'll say <mark type="indiscernible" /> (63:55) and it's probably around 20%, 25% of the <mark type="ph" /> needs (64:07) from Brazil from here to early August, September. So it's not the full-year, but around 20% to 25% of the <mark type="ph" /> needs (64:15) from here to August, we have covered some of the exposure to foreign exchange for some of the raw materials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then I had a second question and that is, with your experience in Panama with Estrella Azul, can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the synergies you're seeing with better distribution and perhaps the products that you think lend themselves to better distribution opportunities, right?  Things that may be higher margin in nature, but at the same time shelf-stable, or you can with a minor modification to your distribution you can add them to the pipe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Robert. Estrella Azul is a very important learning experience for us in this category and I'm glad that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (65:21) in a country like Panama we are leading brand, Estrella Azul, again because it's more market and we're following exactly what we said in the past <mark type="ph" /> days (65:33).  We're learning from that, <mark type="ph" /> it's more market and so its module (65:36). I will not call it an experiment, but this is a learning process for us, an important learning process. In Estrella Azul, we have been running that operation <mark type="ph" /> together with the company (65:47) and say that pretty much according to the model that we used for the acquisition. We are a little bit behind our budget, but the budget was a little bit more aggressive than the valuation model.  And the two areas where we are a little bit behind, one related to your question. We have been getting shelf-stable products in <mark type="ph" /> red-top (66:19), mainly juices on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (66:21).  Remember that Estrella Azul was, Estrella Azul had in the past very few SKUs with shelf-stable <mark type="ph" /> milk  (66:35). Most of the competitive days was with a <mark type="ph" /> milk (66:41).  <mark type="indiscernible" /> (66:44) are not shelf-stable and they also have non shelf-stable juices and <mark type="ph" /> nectar (66:52), it's an important element there.</p>
          <p>So as we develop some of that new formulas and new products, and moving toward shelf-stable products, we have been getting those products in the <mark type="ph" /> right truck (67:04) and I'll say that we're having our own share of pains and problems all the way from finding the right incentive to the <mark type="ph" /> reseller (67:22) and the guy who does the distribution and convincing the store owner of buying from the same guy, Coca-Cola and <mark type="ph" /> these products (67:33). So we're having our learning curve there.  I think that we're improving it little by little, but again it has served very well as a learning experience.</p>
          <p>The other area where we have some delays in our <mark type="ph" /> plant (67:55) had to do where all the supply chain, getting the product from the farmers on the way to our production plants and having the efficiencies that we are used to seeing in our <mark type="ph" /> CSV plant (68:06). It's been &#x2013; it has been a little bit of a challenge. I think that again we're advancing little by little with very solid steps . Those are the two areas where we find challenges and I think that whenever you have a chance to visit Panama, it's a very nice experience, because you see how this because you see how this business is being transformed from the previous stage to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (68:37) company where a lot <mark type="ph" /> of have noted (68:45) their own problems and how we're trying to integrate with a very fast moving company is Coke FEMSA in terms of value chain and distribution efforts. But I think that the example, the exercise is going in the right direction. Again we are a little bit behind our budget, but ahead of our <mark type="ph" /> evaluation (69:11) plan and the two areas <mark type="indiscernible" /> (69:13) have to do with supply of the area and how it goes to the production plant and all the problems that you find in production.  And then, in the distribution front, how do you better serve your clients <mark type="indiscernible" /> (69:28).</p>
