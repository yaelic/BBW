          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our second quarter conference call. First, I'd like to focus on the market environment and the highlights of the second quarter 2010, as well as the progress on our strategic priorities. Then Lothar Steinebach, our CFO will provide to you with the Q2 financials in greater detail and after that, I'll comment on the outlook for 2010. And finally, we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements with the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation can be accessed via our website at henkel.com\ir. The presentation and discussion as it conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>Now, let move on to the market environment and highlights of Q2 2010. The market in &#x2013; the second quarter of 2010 was a bit more friendly than what we've seen in the past. We've seen most economic indicators are showing an upward trend. We are see &#x2013; starting to see recovery in the industrial sector. We are seeing private consumption on a moderate level, especially in Europe but also to a certain extent in the U.S. and we are seeing raw material price increases continue to be present.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, I'm certain that you saw &#x2013; we saw an all-time high for the last 12 months of oil. So, we are seeing the raw material price increases coming through and we are seeing moderate inflation rates.</p>
          <p>What were the highlights for the second quarter for Henkel? On the positive side, it was the third consecutive quarter with adjusted EBIT margins above 12%. We saw a further positive development of our Personal Care and Adhesive Technologies divisions. We saw a double-digit growth in our emerging markets and we continued to have our eyes on the cost. And furthermore, we made progress on our strategic priorities. So, overall solid progress across-the-board.</p>
          <p>On the areas that gives us cause for concern, are our Laundry &amp; Home Care business, with negative sales growth and I'll go into detail of that in a later stage. We continued to see intensified competition. Raw material continued to increase. And our Fast Moving Consumer Goods business development in North America was a cause of concern and not to our satisfaction. We will be dealing with that in the third and the fourth quarter. So, it's on our radar screen; we're not happy with the performance and we will be dealing with it.</p>
          <p>Overall, it was another excellent quarter after a very strong fourth quarter and first quarter in 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me move to our Laundry &amp; Home Care business. We saw an overall volume decrease &#x2013; increase, but negative overall organic sales growth against high comparable, due to price reductions and promotions.</p>
          <p>Let me just remind you of how the numbers looked last year. In the first quarter last year, we had zero growth in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business. In the second quarter last year, we had 6.5% growth, so we had approximately 3 to 3.5% growth for the first six months last year. In the first quarter this year, we had approximately 3% growth and now we have 1.5% negative. So, what you are seeing &#x2013; you're seeing 1 to 1.5% growth over the full period of last year. It was our highest growth quarter last year. Notwithstanding that, we are still not happy with the top line.</p>
          <p>We saw growth in our emerging markets, predominantly driven by Middle East and Africa with double-digit growth and we continue to see a very competitive market in Eastern Europe. We did improve EBIT and EBIT margin, despite raw material price increases. So, not only did we increase our overall EBIT, we also did increase our EBIT margin, year-over-year.</p>
          <p>It was particularly our laundry business that was affected by the price war. We did see a positive development in our Home Care business and we continue to focus on bringing new innovations into the market, that did not only drive growth, but also did drive our margins.</p>
          <p>It was a good result despite strong competition in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our Cosmetics and Toiletries business. There was a very strong organic sales growth against high comparable. Last year, we had a very consistent growth throughout the year of three point plus and this quarter, we had a very strong growth compared to a strong quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Our emerging markets across the board again, with double-digit growth rates. It was our strongest quarter ever in terms of EBIT, with significantly higher market investment compared &#x2013; in the year and it was also our highest year ever when &#x2013; highest quarter ever when it came to sale.</p>
          <p>We had very high market shares, record level in hair coloration. We continued again, as in our laundry business, to bring successful innovation into the marketplace and not only draw sales, but also again accretive to margin. So, it was a continuation of a profitable long-term growth performance &#x2013; a very good and a very solid quarter for our Cosmetics and Toiletries business.</p>
          <p>For Adhesive Technologies business, it was a very strong organic sales growth, but also against low comparable. But overall, the actual number was very strong. We saw improvements across the board; in every single region we had growth. However, the emerging markets were the main growth driver.</p>
          <p>We more than doubled our EBIT and we strongly improved the EBIT margin to an all-time high. We saw, within Adhesives, all business groups improving, particularly Transportation and Metal, but also Electronics. And again, for the other business groups, the strategy of bringing new innovations and accretive to margin was also here present. So, very strong performance in Adhesive Technologies Group and a continuation of the upward trends, we're now seeing since the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>How does that materialize in sales? Overall, it was, as I said, a very good quarter. Our sales came in at almost 3.9 billion or 11.6% organically, almost 7%. And adjusted gross margin at 47.4, up 170 basis points. Adjusted EBIT, up to 476 million, up 54%. Adjusted EBIT margin at 12.2. I said at the beginning the third consecutive quarter above the 12%, up 350 basis points. Our free cash flow, down by 27 points represents &#x2013; and our net working capital, a reduction in the positive sense of the word from 11.7 to 8.7.</p>
          <p>So, it's worth to describe each of the different line items worth &#x2013; but worth, we had an overall very good quarter. Our sales was solid, our adjusted gross margin was very good, our adjusted EBIT was very good, our adjusted EBIT margin was very good, our free cash flow was okay and our net working capital was very good. So overall, a quarter that we are very proud of and very happy about.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the focus on our strategic priorities. We defined our strategic priorities back in 2008, at the same time as we defined our financial targets for 2012 build around, achieve our full business potential, focus more on our customers and strengthen our global team. Now, let me give you an update briefly where we are in each of the three strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>On achieving our full business potential, we are well-ahead of plan for the integration of National Starch. This will be the last year that we will be reporting on National Starch. It is planned and we will also have the full integration of National Starch done by the end of the year. We continue to make progress on the profitability of brands, that would put it up at the very the forefront and we're seeing our emerging markets being its growth engine. We set a target for 2012 of reaching 45% of our total sales in our emerging regions. Right now, we reached 41% of our sales coming from the emerging regions, an all-time high. So, we are making strong focus on our portfolio.</p>
          <p>When I look upon the brands and the strengthen of our strong brands, what we are seeing now is that our top three brands for Henkel account 25% and our top 10 brands now account for 45%. The top 10 brands now have increased five points over the last fiscal year. So, the strategy of focusing and driving growth around our top brands are paying out. And our top brands are also accretive to our margin.</p>
          <p>In our Detergents business, our top three brands account for 51%, while top 10 brands closed at 82%. Within our Cosmetics and Toiletries business, it is 72 and 90% respectively. And within our Adhesive business, it's 25 and 50% respectively.</p>
          <p>As you know that we have investor day planned for month of September and then we'll go more into detail on our brand strategy as it relates to Adhesives business, that you can see across-the-board we've made significant progress in our overall brand strategy.</p>
          <p>When it comes to innovation, we defined and communicated also two years ago, that we will only launch new products accretive to gross margin and that is also the case across-the-board. When it comes to Laundry &amp; Home Care, Cosmetics and Toiletries and Adhesive Technologies, we are driving a very rich and disciplined way of implementing new products and only introducing products if they're accretive to gross margin and that is also what you've seen over the last two years across-the-board in our businesses. So, I will not go through the different new innovations that we had, but just saying that that is a fill or meet criteria. They are not accretive to gross margin over the products that we replaced, we will not bring these products into market.</p>
          <p>On operational excellence, we have significantly increased our use of Shared Service Centers &#x2013; not only for finance, but also for HR and purchasing. In the second quarter and you can see that in the provisions that we have made, we have made significant launch announcements of moving significant amount of work for purchasing and HR globally into our Shared Services Centers out of North America and Western Europe into Manila and Bratislava and that work has now started.</p>
          <p>We've further optimized the manufacturing footprint. On a previous occasion, I've said that we have approximately 65 purchase ongoing. We have net, now of 45. On that net, we also have moved more &#x2013; or close to more plants than the 45. But we have opened more than five new plants in our emerging regions to support the revenue target of 45% of our revenue, coming from the emerging regions.</p>
          <p>We are well-underway and we'll continue to have that as an area of focus moving forward and on an ongoing basis, we will give you updates where we are, but the target is still is the target and we will not move away from that target. So, not only have we increased the speed in our manufacturing footprint, we have also enlarged now the size of our &#x2013; use of our shared services.</p>
          <p>On our customer focus, we have now for the second time in a row, won the Walmart Sustainability Award. For the third time in a row, we're listed in the World's Most Ethical Companies. And in Germany, we won Best Brand 2010 in Sustainability. We are seeing that is becoming competitive advantage in the market where sustainability is playing more and ever more present role when customers, both consumer and retail and industrial make their choice and we are recognized as the leader in sustainability. This will continue to be at our forefront and you can also see that in our sustainability report by the end of the year, we will have an update as it relates to our strategy in sustainability.</p>
          <p>On our global team, let me give you an update on the following. We have increased the share of women in senior management to now 28.5%, up from almost &#x2013; from 21% in 2003 and 24% in 2006. We don't have a quota; we will not put a quota in place. We do promote based on performance and qualifications.</p>
          <p>But it is a very important drive force that we have a balanced management team which brings into the next part that we have more than 50 different nationalities being part of our top management and being a global company, that is essential for us. You can't run a global company by having two or three nations dominate the whole management structure.</p>
          <p>On a previous note in 2008 and 2009, I said that we would overtime change our compensation system. But back then, our compensation system was not inhibitor for making our products that we believe that we could have put a better compensation system in place. We have now, in the second quarter, announced a new compensation system for our top managers in the company. That will be implemented in 2011 and there are specific topics for all managers and top managers in the company for achieving targets for 2012. So, what we've said in 2008 and 2009 that we would place changes of compensation system is now coming into place. It has been announced and will be fully implemented January 1, 2011.</p>
          <p>We also used our 2010 slogan 'A global team &#x2013; winning together' to users. And as I said, it has been communicated across the board.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to hand over to Lothar Steinebach, who will give you an update on where we are in the financials for our second quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kasper, that also welcome from me to the analyst investor community with a keen interest in our company.</p>
          <p>We'll start with financials for our 2010, Q2. As usual, take a look at the fast evolution in terms of organic sales growth of our company. A very quick outlook perspective on foreign exchanges impact on our numbers. It's been very similarly positive in terms of sales growth for our Laundry &amp; Home Care and Personal Care and even bigger in the Adhesive Technologies that obviously due to the strong U.S. dollar and some other emerging market currencies, which have had an impact on our sales figures.</p>
          <p>In terms of Laundry &amp; Home Care, let me start with taking a look at organic sales growth. We had a volume growth of 3.2, which sounds good. However, price deflation of minus 4.7, resulting in total growth of minus 1.5. Take a look at the components of it, let me first point out strong prior year comparison of 6.3 in Q2, last year and it's not an explanation, it simply pointing out the fact ground against which we've been working in Q2. We've seen Home Care with positive growth, still under difficult circumstances. So, the strong impact of what we've seen in terms of price deflation has been concentrated in the Laundry sector.</p>
          <p>We have communicated during the course of this year already, that we are expecting increasing pricing pressure because of the impact of private label in the matured countries and obviously, also of the downturn in the economy and the negative impact on consumer behavior in our countries. So, volume growth in first half year has been &#x2013; still was 5.2%, pretty good. However, in terms of pricing, we've seen strong pressure in the markets and from our peers.</p>
          <p>Take a look at the Personal Care division. 5.0% organic sales growth in Q2, pretty strong performance. But then, even stronger performance in volume growth, 5.7 and minus 0.7 in pricing. It's been the first time that we've seen negative in pricing, for a long period of time. Pricing has been similarly difficult as an environment in our Personal Care division, and it has been the case in our Laundry &amp; Home Care division. However, we've been even more successful in terms of growing our volume.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at the components of our total growth. We have been able to strongly outperform our markets, and that's obviously mainly driven by our retail business. We've seen weak professional business, continuation of the weak professional business through Q2. The outperformance that we're been able to put up were obviously been driven by our innovations that have been successful in Q4 and Q1 of this year.</p>
          <p>Despite difficult market conditions in the matured countries, we've seen excellent performance in Germany in particular and obviously also, in the emerging markets. Next division, Adhesive Technologies, obviously against the weak first half year, is still a weak second quarter for last year, 13.6. Again, composed of volume growth of 14.2 and a negative pricing of minus 0.6. There again, we've seen pricing pressure in the phase of a pretty strong recovery, that we've experienced in the first half of this year. We've seen pricing pressure because obviously, that's, it's time to gain market share and maintain market positions. So therefore, the pricing environment has been difficult and we've been able to increase our volume significantly.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at the individual strategic business units, that contributed most to our growth. We've seen strong growth in all of our business units. All units have been in double-digit growth except our Consumers and Building Adhesives and packaging Adhesives business units. They're all have been positive. So, from that perspective, the strongest growth has been in Transportation and Metal, Electronics and General Industries with a very strong performance in particular in Asia-Pacific, while all regions have continued to experience positive growth. Asia Pacific has been in the twenties, so therefore that's been a strong growth compared to the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>Total company volume plus 8.7, obviously mostly driven by our Adhesives division, but also strong contribution from our Cosmetics division, pricing negative &#x2013; minus 1.9. We have continued with our focus in the recovery on volume, because that's where our market share that been determined. Therefore, we've been able to maintain our market position.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at the regions, all regions have been growing. All regions have been positive &#x2013; with positive growth. Organic sales growth in Europe, Africa, Middle East with 6.3, particularly strong and that's also been a result of positive growth in the matured part of Europe and an even stronger growth in emerging part of Europe, that is Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>North America was a strong contribution from our Adhesives division, strongest contribution from our Adhesives division, negative both, fast moving consumer goods and it has to have of little bit of that already. Latin American &#x2013; Latin America continues on its growth path with 12.3% organic sales growth, Asia Pacific even stronger, 16% and as I mentioned, in the twenties from our Adhesives division.</p>
          <p>Now in total, emerging markets, Cosmetics, Toiletries and Adhesives Technologies with double-digit organic sales growth in the emerging markets, resulted in a sales share of emerging markets in our total portfolio of 41%. That's a strong improvement, strong advantage over the same period of last year, three percentage points more than last year. Emerging markets have been continuing to grow in our businesses, double the pace in the mature markets. What we've seen also a pretty good growth in the mature markets.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at operating earnings, adjusted EBITDA by business sector. I'll start with Laundry &amp; Home Care with an advance of 100 basis points over the same period of last year in respect of margin. Now and that's in the phase of the weak organic sales growth, strong performance driven by further efficiency improvements in our business divisions and our ability to over-compensate higher raw material price despite cost savings. That's a collaboration between the business division and the purchasing function, which has resulted in our ability to over-compensate the evolution that we've seen in the pricing of raw materials and direct materials in the market.</p>
          <p>Next Personal Care. In advance of 20 basis points, compared to the same period of last year, we're continuing with our profitable growth path with a strong organic sales growth and at the same time, strong growth in our margin of 20 basis points and at the same time, with a significantly higher marketing investments. So we've spent &#x2013; we deal off the improvement that we've seen in the gross margin in &#x2013; an advance in the adjusted EBIT margin, but also high investment in our marketing process. We've continued with our strict cost focus, which has permitted us to reach the benefits of the stronger gross margin. Taking a look at our operating performance in the Adhesives Technologies division, we have seen a continued improvement in our cost structure and we've seen strong growth in our high-margin segments.</p>
          <p>Now, continuing improvements in our cost structure has resulted in the much better utilization from higher capacity &#x2013; capacity utilization. We have adjusted our structure to a lower environment &#x2013; to the lower industrial environment and demand and now, we're reaping the benefits of taking out capacity and at the same time, growing our sales volume.</p>
          <p>Strong growth in high-margin segments that I mentioned earlier that we've seen the strongest growth in Transportation and Metal and in particularly at Electronics. Those are divisions or sub-units of our Adhesives division with higher margins than the others and therefore, the strong growth that we've experienced in the sub-units have contributed disproportional, over proportionally to our margin growth. 630 basis points adjusted EBIT margin resulting in the highest EBIT margin that we have experienced in this division.</p>
          <p>Next to look at the gross margin, adjusted gross margin make comparable to the same period of prior year. We have obviously benefited from the volume leverage and cost-saving measures that we have implemented in the course of a practice during the course of last year, which then have resulted in overcompensation of higher input cost and lower selling prices. No doubt you've seen that we've had a negative pricing on our hedge growth and we've experienced a higher level of raw material, direct material cost in the markets. And together with our measures and the stronger utilization, we've been able to overcompensate and increase our gross margin at the same time.</p>
          <p>Now, capacity utilization in particular in our Adhesives division is up by more than 10 percentage points and that obviously speaks to the operating leverage that we've been able to manage. Income statement, first to adjusted EBIT. Two items that I'd like to highlight marketing, selling and distribution expenses and admin expenses. Minus 30 basis points marketing, selling and distribution. Now, as I mentioned earlier, we've invested higher in terms of marketing and selling and distribution costs has come down as a percentage of sales. Therefore, we've seen the change in 30 basis points lower than last year. Admin expenses while having increased on an absolute level, that's still substantially below sales growth, which then resulted offset in a change of minus 50 basis points as a percentage of sales.</p>
          <p>Now, reported to adjusted EBIT. First of all, restructuring charges of 47 million in Q2, of which we still have 3 million from the National Starch integration and normal restructuring of 44 million, resulting in total volume of 78 for the first half of year. Now, our outlook for full-year remains at 100 to 120 because that is obviously disproportionate distribution of provisions that we have taken with respect to restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>EBIT to net earnings, financial results significantly below the same period of last year. First of all, the level of net debt has been significantly lower and we have seen not &#x2013; the big difference from Q1 of 2010. Positive FX result as a result of some of the emerging market currencies, which have appreciated and where we have not made hedging &#x2013; have not incurred hedging costs. Full-year guidance remains at 180 million, which obviously is something, which we are going to be able to achieve and as much as first half of year is in the range of 90 million.</p>
          <p>Cash flow statement, operating profit up obviously for first quarter. Highlighting the change in net working capital minus 71 cash out. Even though we have improved our net working capital ratio, we haven't increased in the consumption of cash flow net working capital as a result of the strong recovery in sales volume, which obviously result in higher total amount of inventory and receivables. We've made progress in payables, which has mitigated some of the impact from the additional sales volume while still needed some more cash than last year, where we had a decrease in sales volume, which has been generated cash.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, cash flow from operating activities, free cash flow in Q2 is lower than the same period of last year. One difference, less cash out for personal plans, property and equipment. Again, total first half year is now at 112 of full &#x2013; guidance or the guidance for the full year 2010 has been at 350 to 380. We expect higher cash out in the second half of this year, but we believe that we'll probably end up at the lower end of our guidance.</p>
          <p>In terms of net working capital, we've been able to continue with our strong performance combat within the same period of last year and the periods before. We are now at a level of 8.7; we've been at 8.5 in Q1. These are exceptionally good results despite the fact that we've been at lower level at the end of last year. We've been able to pretty much maintain the level of around 8% and therefore, that remains our target for the full year to remain in that order of magnitude.</p>
          <p>Net debt has been impacted by a number of different factors. One of which is obviously cash outflow dividends &#x2013; dividend payments in Q2. The other is obviously free cash flow that we have generated and the third is the change in the U.S. dollar. We have U.S. dollar denominated debt, which has resulted in an increase of U.S. dollar denominated that then translated into euro. You obviously have seen the U.S. dollar already depreciating against the euro, but the average rate obviously and in the end of the quarter rate has been higher than its current indication. So therefore, there's an impact on our net debt.</p>
          <p>National Starch integration, that's probably the nice picture that we're going to show &#x2013; last chart on this topic, because we're very much thrilled with our actions. What we are going to realize is pretty much only execution from what we have initiated already. Q1 has been delivering 55 million of savings; Q2 has been delivering 60 million. So, then just on a run rate, we're going to deliver the 225 that we have targeted for this year and the rest 250 full-year 2011, obviously is no more than an adaptation of the actions that we have undertaken already.</p>
          <p>In other words, we're ahead of our plans in terms of realizing the savings from the National Starch integration. We're also in terms of getting the actions announced and eventually, then implemented ahead of our plan and therefore that pretty much completed a sizeable concern. With that picture, I am going to handover to Kasper again to provide the outlook for full year 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar, I am coming to the outlook now. We are using a chart from period, different period and we've done that for the last two years where we on the monthly basis look on the outlook for the global GDP. And over the last 12 months, the outlook is improved with 1.3 points. So, when we sat here a year ago, the outlook for 2010 was assumed to be 2.3% growth and right now it is at 3.6% growth.</p>
          <p>So, it has been an improvement overall in the outlook for the global economy. However, it is not &#x2013; average is always dangerous, what we are seeing is, we are continuing to see that Europe being constrained, we are seeing mixed messages coming out the U.S. also from some of the announcements from other companies, we have seen this, this week so, mixed numbers that are out of the U.S. and mixed expectations.</p>
          <p>The growth driver for the global economy for the 3.6 is coming from the emerging markets and that is why it is so important for us that we increase our share of the business in the emerging markets to continue to grow &#x2013; drive only growth towards the profitability for us as a company. And with 41% of our total business coming from that part, we are now getting to a substantial chunk of our business book.</p>
          <p>We are expecting a global growth of 3.6% for the remainder of the year, with different growth rates for different sectors. Based on the numbers that we have posted in the first quarter and the second quarter, we are for the second time this changed our guidance. What we are saying, which is consistent is we'll continue to just try to outperform our markets across &#x2013; both our Home Care Personal Care and our Adhesive business in order to gain market share in all the relevant markets for us.</p>
          <p>We expect, when it comes to EBIT, an improvement both in our Home and Personal Care and business compared to last year, I do want to just spent one second on Home Care at this stage. We had a very mixed business last year, with an okay first-half and a very, very strong second-half. We are seeing dynamics that have &#x2013; give us all reasons to believe that the second half this year will be more difficult than the first half this year, due to raw material price increases and last year we had in the second-half, an all-time low on raw material prices.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies, we expect a substantial improvement for &#x2013; and for the overall group that we now see substantial improvement of 25% plus when it comes to EBIT and of course also for adjusted EPS. So, we are taking the guidance up for the second time this year to 25% plus for EBIT and EPS, which brings me to the summary.</p>
          <p>It was a very strong quarter following a strong fourth and a first quarter. So, the third consecutive quarter across &#x2013; above the 12%. We are continuing to be very focused on our strategic priorities to ensure that we execute what we had said, we're going to do. And we will continue to adapt our structures to the changing market environment. And the important note I made in the beginning of my presentation was the amount of restructuring that we've actually booked in the first half. We continue to say that we will adapt to our markets and because the integration of National Starch and Global Excellence is over, does not mean that we believe that we can't further enhance the competitiveness of our company and you will continue to see that as Loth already guided you on the restructuring plans of 100 to 120 million. That will be an ongoing amount moving forward also. So we'll continue to adapt our structure and we are fully committed to hitting our financial target for 2012.</p>
          <p>We believe, we've come a long way at the same time, we also believe the homework to be done and probably, within what we find was a very good quarter, with two areas that we'll be working hard on. One is the organic sales growth for the detergent business and the second as I mentioned very early that we're not happy with our Fast Moving Consumer Goods business performance in the U.S., and we will be dealing with that business units.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to come to the end of my presentation and Loth and I would now be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would very much appreciate if you could talk us a little bit through the key drivers behind your gross margin and your operating profit margin development, in terms of what are the levers and what have they contributed to the net gains in gross and in operating profit margin. In particular, cost savings and volume leverage on the positive side, that offset price mix and commodity on the negative side. And in conjunction with that, it would be extremely helpful to get a feeling of the cost savings that you are expecting from both the National Starch integration as well as from Global Excellence for the rest of 2010 and going into 2011. It would be very helpful to get us a feeling of how much cost savings have actually contributed to the positive margin development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try to start with the key drivers behind gross margin and operating margin improvement. First of all, I've mentioned earlier that we've seen an improvement of 170 basis points in the adjusted gross margin, which is in large part driven by our Adhesives division and the volume increase or the operating leverage that we've been able to generate there. We've seen an advance in all business divisions, but it's &#x2013; obviously the strongest advance in our Adhesives division. Now, we've also seen a negative impact on the gross margins from price increases, on raw materials and packaging and obviously, also from lower selling prices. Now, if not &#x2013; singles out each impact this time, because some of the items are very difficult to single out and I would have decided to not provide the bridge that we had provided on previous occasions. Except to say that the stronger impact in terms of a 170 basis points is from volume &#x2013; the volume increases compared to the other positive impacts.</p>
          <p>Now, with respect to Global Excellence and National Starch, we have communicated that the savings and that's not just now alluding to gross margin of savings in first half year from National Starch has been 115 and from let me see &#x2013; just effect of &#x2013; now the 80 million is from Global Excellence, which we have announced with 160 for the full year, so we've generated 80 million for the first half year. With respect to the amount that has been impacting gross margin, we expect that to be from both Global Excellence and from National Starch integration about half of it. In other words, 40 million from Global Excellence for the full year and 60 from National Starch integration with an impact on the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which then means that for 2011, there is a very little incremental cost savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Incremental cost savings from the two programs, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Will there be other cost saving programs coming up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. With respect to cost saving programs, we have communicated that a number of activities that are now necessarily only addressing the gross margins, like the shared service program that we have communicated in the first half of this year where we're transferring again functions into our Shared Service Center, we'll have a bigger impact next year and that I guess with respect to SG&amp;A in general, I would refer to savings programs that we're implementing on a almost continuous basis. In fact on gross margin, it's from content measures against the increase in raw material prices.</p>
          <p>For the time being, we assume that combination of fluctuating savings, changes in the composition of our products, changes in raw materials, plus price increases will be able to mitigate or eliminate the impact from the raw material price increases that we expect for the second half of this year. In other words, cost savings activities are ongoing part of our business. We have a total gain programs in fact in our detergent divisions, delivering more than 100 million this year and that's been the practice for the past years. Nevertheless cost saving is an ongoing part of our business, partially it was an impact on the gross margins, in terms of raw material prices and direct material prices, but also with respect to impact on SG&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Susanne, just to be clear on it, we've had &#x2013; we started Global Excellence in 2008. We board and started the integration of National Starch in 2008. We did a major reorganization and reduction program in our Adhesives division in 2009. And right now, we're doing a major moving shared services. So the point is, it's not that we've done in one program than we've done &#x2013; we will continue to adapt our structures and that's what we're pretty consistent about. We've done in the past, we'll continue to do so in the future and that's why the guidance around the 100 to 120 is so important. That has been the case, since following Global Excellence in 2009 and 2010 and will be the case moving forward.</p>

Do you think that pressure from pricing plus, higher input cost that you will be able to compensate that pressure with your efficiency gains going forward and well into 2011?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Can I just ask the question on the Adhesive margin, not actually in the year-on-year progression, but the absolute margin seems that there has been another step change to 13.5% in Q2, as you've highlighted well-ahead of any previous margin probably from the remainder of the division. What, was there any shorter-term factors inflating that margin in the quarter or is this at or about the level of profitability that you think you can maintain or even build on in the near-term. And perhaps, I mean, you also referred, I think, to capacity utilization being improved by 10 points in that division. I'm not sure if you can give us the absolute capacity utilization or just a full-pack range where that might stand at the moment in that particular business?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you give us an update with the guidance for input cost headwind in the full year. You've previously suggested a mid-single-digit increase in raw material prices. I'm not sure if you have a sort of a different or equal view on that topic at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark. This is Kasper. I'll take the first question and Lothar will take the second question. You'll find in the longer-term, it's clear that our expectation is that the margin of Adhesive business has to be significantly higher than 13.5 because that would be dilutive to our margin in 2012. So, what we believe is, while a specific change in the right direction would be, we still believe and are convinced there's more to be gotten. The biggest single driver is utilization rate, that we've taken the utilization rate up to 62% in the second quarter of 2009. So, we are seeing a big 2010 &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; second quarter of 2010. So, you're seeing a big step change almost nine points quarter-over-quarter and that is the major driver.</p>
          <p>We still need to get the utilization rate further up. So we're not where we need to be and that's why we've been very clear on our manufacturing footprint program that while we made good progress and addressed approximately 45 net locations, we still have approximately 15 to 22 goals to get with the the utilization rates further up. And as Lothar indicated, it's also a mix question that you are seeing a stronger growth in our high margin businesses. So, the drivers for getting the margin further with high utilization rate and then more attractive mix, but we are on the right way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the second question headwind from commodities, our guidance on commodities has been increased slightly. We do expect that to be in the mid-single digits or a bit higher. Now, the impact needs to be seen in perspective because as obviously, time delay between, increase in raw material prices and the time that it take to impact on our P&amp;L because of the inventory revaluation issue and also the delay between the increase in initial raw materials and the time it takes in order for that should be effective in the materials that we buy.</p>
          <p>So, from that perspective, we expect the impact to be in the second half more stronger than in the first half and we've announced price increases. I'm sure you've observed that, as have been some of our peers. And in response to what we expect in the second half of this year, basically. So therefore, there will be a more significant headwind from commodities, because of the components that I mentioned, but we have also have already announced price increases.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we'll continue to see a stronger volume compared to the same period of last year. We'll not see the same type of growth, obviously, because the second half of last year has been better than the first half of last year. However, we are going to see a better utilization of our capacities. We've taken out significant amount of capacity in order to reduce our structures to the lower level of demand. So therefore, even with slower growth or slower growth rates that we expect in the second half of this year compared to the same period of last year, we'll continue to benefit. And therefore, we're confident that we're going to be able to either completely or at least the major part, overcompensate the impact from commodities.</p>
          <p>Now, that all needs to be seen in relation to continuing uncertainties in the markets. We've been cautious and careful with our outlook, simply because it's very difficult to have a long-term or longer-term time horizon on how markets evolve in this &#x2013; next six months. Now, our current outlook is based on a focus, continuation of the positive development, not a dramatic improvement, but a continuation and not a kind of a return of crisis proportions.</p>
          <p>So with that background, I think we are going to be able to manage our margins, maybe not exactly at the level that we have achieved in the second quarter. And Kasper mentioned, the mix impact, we have seen strong growth in particular in sectors in Adhesive business with strong margins and that's not clear that this is going to stay at the same level. If it stays at the same level well, it should be able to maintain our margin in the range. We see some fluctuations and we've been trying to communicate about the volatilities that we see in the markets, then we see some changes. Long &#x2013; not long term, but the outlook for this year, we're confident that we will be able to maintain the company at the level that they have achieved.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes through from the line of Martin R&#xF6;diger from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Two questions also from my side. On currencies, first what was the currency effect on your EBIT line and on <mark type="inaudible" /> and also on the individual segments, because I think it's not all of the U.S. dollar, but also other currencies, which benefited well, pretty good for you.</p>
          <p>Second question is a clarification question on the restructuring costs. You have mentioned ongoing 100 to 120 million not only this year, also the next years. Will these restructuring charges lead to additional earnings or if it just to defend the current earnings and margin level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with the currency impact. We have rule of thumb, suggesting that a change in the U.S. dollar of $0.01 up or down results in change in our operating earnings of 2.5 million. Now, the margin impact is basically neutral. So therefore, we're not benefiting from the change in the currency in terms of up or down, except in the absolute amount of operating earnings. Now, we don't have a similar rule of thumb for all other currencies because that would be too difficult to try to evaluate. Obviously, we've seen a recovery in some of the emerging markets currencies, in the course of this year and we've seen a strong downturn in the course of last year. In the type of business that we're in, which is Fast Moving Consumer Goods and at least this &#x2013; which at least the major part, addressing Fast Moving Consumer Goods. We see our ability to reflect changes in the currencies, maybe not the U.S. dollar, that's a different story, but the other currencies.</p>
          <p>We see the ability to reflect changes in the currencies if they are simply a reflection of inflation rate adjustments. So, in other words there are short-term fluctuations in currencies this year up, last year down and we're managing it to the extent that we don't see an impact on the margin, but also in terms of price increases that we implement in the various countries that are affected by the fluctuations in those currencies. Different story, maybe different situations in particular or individual countries. There are situations in Latin America and in Manila which is a difficult environment because of state intervention and currency regimes that are sometimes difficult to follow, but that's a smaller part of the total problem.</p>
          <p>In terms of restructuring costs, our guidance for the full year, it's 100 to 120. Now, part of that is obviously resulting in improvements in our operating earnings. We've communicated about part of that in the course of last year, that we expect that portion of about one third will be reflected in additional operating earnings, certainly next year. So, in other words, part of that is obviously defending and adapting our structure, part of that is improving our structure to the point that we get benefit of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just try to elaborate on what Lothar said, because that increase is very important to understand, how we think about restructuring. We think about it in two different ways. One is defensive and the other one is offensive. Defensive is counter &#x2013; countering what our competitors are doing against us, which we can't really foresee, we expect certain new elements and you're seeing the movements right now for P&amp;G.</p>
          <p>Other ones are offensive, where we believe that we can get competitive advantage ahead of the curve before our competitors, i.e., shared services structures, et cetera. So, we are looking upon it in two ways. The defensive ones are, of course, getting us back to square one. The offensive ones are getting us ahead of the curve. And of course, we're doing both since we can't predict what our competitors are doing. There'll always be an element of defensive ones. But we can take the decision in our own hands and that's what we're trying to do with the offensive ones. And it's going to be a mixture of the two and that's why some of them will fall fully through and some of them will, well, assuming just get us back to the line where were in the past.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, gentleman, good afternoon. Two questions from my side. And the first is, some of your peers are discussing a slowdown in &#x2013; or at least expecting a slowdown in automotive for the second half. What would this do to your growth rates and furthermore, they're also seeing a little bit of a slowdown in China and maybe you could comment on this. What are you seeing especially in adhesives, of course?</p>
          <p>The second question is to do with the footprint on capacity utilization. We've seen an improvement to about 62%. The targets for Henkel in my view or at least, I thought that you communicated that it was way above 70%. But could you split how much or at least try to do an estimate, how much is cyclical and how much of that is structural. What I'm trying to get at is, how far are you now down in the number of factory closures in order to substantiate that push towards more than 70% capacity utilization? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me start with the first question and then I will hand over to Lothar. Starting with automotive in China, right now the forecasted automotive numbers for the year and these are the CSM Autobase forecast as of July. They forecasted total volume of 67.3 million automotives. And the production in the first half have been 34.9. So, you can argue, you pretty much have 49, 51 at this stage. So right now, there is nothing that indicate a slowdown or substantial slowdown in automotive, because you also need to look upon the models, et cetera. So, according to the current forecast &#x2013; halfway through the year, according to the CSM, we're pretty much halfway through the expected manufacturing. So &#x2013; and the numbers that we have accessed to, there is no indication of slowdown. Second part is that we've not seen a slowdown right now in our China business. And we have no indication at this stage to see a slowdown in our manufacturing auto on China business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start by addressing the capacity utilization issue by saying that, the numbers that we communicate need to be seen in respect of the different businesses that we're addressing in our Adhesive division. And therefore, it's kind of a wild mix of different capacity utilization figures for the business units, the sub-units and also because of the big difference between Adhesives volumes in packaging adhesives compared to electronics material, very difficult to come up with kind of easy or let's say interpret the numbers easily because, there may be a change in the Adhesives sector, which has not a big impact on the margin, but have a big impact on capacity utilization, because it's a large volume business. So, from that perspective I always caution and always reluctant in providing the numbers, because &#x2013; very easy to misunderstand the figures.</p>
          <p>From that perspective again, I think what we're trying to &#x2013; what we've been trying to say is that we've seen pretty strong improvement in our capacity utilization figure for the total business and that goes to all sub-units. So therefore, whatever that the number says is supposed to say that we've seen strong advance in capacity utilization in each of our sub-segments in our Adhesives business.</p>
          <p>Downturn in one of them might have either a bigger impact or less of an impact on the total capacity utilization and even less so on the margin and total operating leverage. So, sorry to say, but it's difficult to interpret, from that figure and therefore, I don't know that it would help you a great deal to try to differentiate between cyclical pieces of our business and non-cyclical, which again, I think what make interpretation even more difficult. Total messages in all our subdivisions, we've seen a similarly strong improvement particularly in the industrial sector, less so in the Building Adhesives and Consumer Adhesives sector.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Thanks. Maybe a small follow-up question, just for clarification purposes. Your full-year guidance on the financial result is still for about a 118 million. Just looking at the run rate of the half-year stage, I would expect a lower number for the full-year. What are we missing out here in the second half, that it's still going to be around that ballpark number? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of the financial result is, the results from foreign exchange hedging and we've had a pretty good positive impact in Q2, which is not something, which we can plan basically. So, therefore there's volatility in our financial results from foreign exchange hedging and -- or not hedging for that matter. And we've seen pretty good positive figure in Q2, which we cannot expect to come again in Q3. So, that's not the run rate, such as the interest it's the interest is something, which we can obviously can look at. But the results from foreign exchange hedging depends on currencies and haven't found anybody who can predict the currencies to the extent that would be necessary in order to make a prediction on that number.</p>
          <p>Now, for the full-year we are confidant that we're going to be able within the numbers that we have provided, but in terms of suggesting that the run-rate sort of speak of foreign exchange results will be the same next quarter is impossible. So, that's simply, that is the difference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everyone. Two questions on the household business, clearly it has been tough in Q2 against some tough comps and clearly, competition. The comps do get easier in the second half, but basically, how long can you continue to increase margins in the household business, if growth continues to be subdued, i.e., would margins have to fall to get back to growth, maybe you could expand on that.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the Adhesives. If I take comp into consideration, your Adhesives business on a kind of a two-year run rate isn't really growing. So, when we start to reach normal comps towards the second half or towards the back-end of the second half, what's the right run rate of growth in Adhesives, now that we're kind of normalizing comp basis, just to get an idea on that and therefore the leverage that would follow from that. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Let me start with Laundry margins. We totally agree that without growth, it would be difficult or impossible to grow our margin. So therefore, it's not our expectation that we will not able to return to growth, because that I mentioned that we had seen dissatisfying results in &#x2013; particularly in North America and that are going to address it. So therefore, we're pretty confident that we're going to be back on an organic sales growth path, also in our Laundry division. With respect to the run rate of growth in Adhesives, we do expect, let's say this year &#x2013; next year, GDP growth of 3.5% in the world and we're trying to communicate that &#x2013; our Adhesive business will be growing stronger than our markets, in other words, we expect more than 3.5% growth for Adhesive business.</p>

          <p>Harold, if you statistically back, you would also been able to see that our Adhesive business has consistently grown above the slow GDP growth in the past. So, we've the upside and downside. So, it's not hope, it's pretty much based on statistics.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much everybody for participating in our second quarter conference call. After what, we believe is a successful first-half 2010. We're now looking forward to significant improvement in our results of more than 25% for the full fiscal year versus 2009. At the same time, we will maintain our rigorous approach to cost management and our continuous adaption of our structures to changing market environments. We are therefore optimistic as we move forward.</p>
          <p>I wish you all the best and I look forward to see you all hopefully and certainly by the time of our Adhesives Technologies Investor Day and Analyst Day on September 16, 2010 in D&#xFC;sseldorf. Thank you very much for participating everybody. Good-bye.</p>
