        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christina. Good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to Merck's third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. My name is Joshua Young, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations for Merck. Joining me on today's call are Karl Kley, Chairman of the Executive Board; Matthias Zachert, Chief Financial Officer of Merck; and Stefan Oschmann, Head of our Pharmaceutical Divisions and a Member of the Executive Board.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by reminding you that we will be making forward-looking statements on the conference call today. Please review our disclaimer about the risks and uncertainties of such statements on slide two. Also note that our guidance is related to current business conditions and our outlook as of today, October 26, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update this guidance prior to our full year 2011 earnings conference call on February 29.</p>
          <p>As part of our agenda for today's call, Karl will provide a broad overview of our third quarter performance, Stefan will then give you some deeper insights into the recent activities of our Merck Serono division before Matthias will close our formal remarks with a detailed summary of our operational results and provide the update on our guidance for 2011. After that, we will conduct a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the Karl &#x2013; the call over to Karl.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Let me begin the presentation on slide number four. I would like to summarize the key messages for Q3 in three areas. Change management first, then business trends, and financial performance.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with change management. After having completed executive management changes at the Board level in Q2, we successfully recruited a number of highly experienced managers into the second layer of senior management during the third quarter. These individuals have proven track records of delivering results at companies that are known for strong execution. We believe these new leaders will be instrumental in helping us to restructure and grow our business while driving cultural change at Merck.</p>
          <p>With these executives on board, we have been able to form the next layer of our global organization. All organizational decisions have been made with the goal of reducing complexity, enhancing execution mindsets, and increasing speeds in our organization. We are making our organization more global, reducing redundancies, and ensuring that we have all corporate functions really supporting the business and creating value, not bureaucracy.</p>
          <p>Moving now on to the business, we reported revenues of &#x20AC;2.5 billion in the third quarter, which resulted in a 7% organic revenue growth. The growth was driven by solid performance in the Merck Serono and Merck Millipore divisions, which more than offset the weaker revenues in the Performance Materials division, a weaker performance that we anticipated.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line, we reported an underlying core operating result of &#x20AC;552 million, down 12% compared to Q3 last year. The primary drivers of this decline were continued adverse effects from changes in foreign exchange rates, higher production costs, as well as higher R&amp;D costs in Merck Serono due to the large share of the division's project being in Phase III trials.</p>
          <p>I would like now to move to chart number five. From a regional perspective, organic sales in Europe came in flat in Q3, reflecting a tough environment as well as the impact from government austerity measures. In contrast, sales in the U.S. saw healthy organic growth of 13% driven by the strong performance of Rebif as well as Merck Millipore. Also, emerging markets continued to perform strongly with 12% growth.</p>
          <p>The key products that drove this growth in emerging markets were Erbitux and CardioMetabolic Care products. Overall, emerging markets contributed by more than one-third to the group's sales in Q3, and given the significant growth potential of this region, we feel good about our ability to sustain momentum in these markets.</p>
          <p>Chart six. Moving to a divisional perspective of our third quarter performance, Merck Serono delivered revenues of &#x20AC;1.5 billion, representing organic revenue growth of 9%. Also, this performance is somewhat inflated due to lower sales from a change of our distribution model in China in Q3 2010. Organic revenue growth was still a healthy 6%, if you adjust for this China effect. All key franchises contributed to this growth, with emerging markets performing particularly well.</p>
          <p>On a product level, Rebif sales saw an organic increase of 8%, benefiting primarily from price increases in the U.S. as well as stronger volumes in Europe. Sales of Erbitux grew 5% organically, driven by the strong performance in China and Latin America. While sales in Japan were down 23% organically and continued to be weak, they increased sequentially. And we believe the business will further stabilize by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The division's underlying core operating result decreased by 6% year-over-year basis were &#x20AC;338 million. This lower profit was adversely affected by the changes in products. We also saw lower gross margins due to the start-up costs of our biologics manufacturing site in Vevey, as well as higher R&amp;D costs.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health Care reported solid organic top line growth of 7% to &#x20AC;133 million. The selling and marketing expenses being more tightly managed, the division's operating results improved slightly to &#x20AC;17 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven. And with this, I would like to move on to our Chemical business. Revenues of &#x20AC;342 million from Performance Materials were softer compared to last year and sequentially softer than Q2, which we foreshadowed on our last earnings call.</p>
          <p>A good demand for IPS and VA materials helped our Liquid Crystals sales increase 2% organically to &#x20AC;258 million. This level of revenues represents a sequential decline from Q2, and this is due to lower demand from panel manufacturers, lower volumes as a result of our customers' efforts to work down inventories that they built in the very strong first half of this year.</p>
          <p>For Pigments, sales were down both year-on-year and sequentially, impacted by decreasing demand in the market. Overall, lower capacity utilization, continued FX headwinds, as well as adverse changes in product mix left the division's operating results declining by 24% to &#x20AC;113 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Merck Millipore turned in a solid quarter in what has been a challenging environment for most life science tool companies. Merck Millipore delivered organic revenue growth of 7% in the third quarter, resulting in &#x20AC;587 million revenue. This performance was driven by Lab Solutions where our lab water products are performing particularly well, and by Process Solutions where we are benefiting from Biotech's expansion into Singapore and into China.</p>
          <p>The level of organic revenue growth Merck Millipore generated in Q3 needs to be interpreted by the lower base that we had in Q3 2010 due to supply chain difficulties in the business. But all in all, despite the challenging environment stemming from the softening demand of academic and industrial customers, we believe the growth potential of Merck Millipore, and we are actively making investments in SG&amp;A and R&amp;D to support this growth. This higher level of investment combined with higher supply chain costs and negative effects on change in products lowered the division's underlying core operating results by 14% to &#x20AC;107 million.</p>
          <p>Before I now finish, let me conclude my talk by stating we have put our team in place. We are about to finish establishing the new organizational governance and accountability. And the next step, we will come back to you in the first half of 2012 with more clarity on what we would like to do with our cost base. The direction is clear. It will develop Merck into a more performance-oriented company with higher levels of commitments and greater execution skills. We are fully aware that this requires that we take tough decisions similar to the ones that Stefan will describe to you now in the next few minutes.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And I turn the call over to Stefan Oschmann.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Karl, and good afternoon, everybody. When I met with many of you last April, I provided insights into where we have identified areas that Merck Serono needed to improve in order to get it leveraged for strong assets we have in the division. I talked about several key priorities, including increasing our commercial effectiveness, improving our pipeline, strengthening our R&amp;D organization, optimizing our cost structure, and streamlining of processes.</p>
          <p>Since the beginning of the year, we have taken a series of steps to address these priorities. Additionally, we have attracted highly experienced senior managers into the organization who will help us to execute on our goal of extracting greater value out of the business. I can confidently state that the change process is gaining momentum at Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>I want to talk about three key areas today. First, the tough decisions we have made on our pipeline, second, how we are strengthening and defending our franchise, and thirdly, what we're doing to build an organization with clear responsibilities and accountability.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start with an overview of the first actions we have taken to strengthen our R&amp;D pipeline over the past months, which I show on slide 10. A key guiding theme of this process was to focus on maximizing the commercial success of our total R&amp;D investments under the constraints of the budget we have assigned to this area. As a division, we need to realize that we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company, and we do not have the scale or reach of a large pharma company. The consequence of this is that we need to be very effective at scrutinizing investments in the pipeline, and only advance those projects that have truly the potential to generate the highest returns at a reasonable level of risk.</p>
          <p>As we progress through the pipeline review, we had to make difficult decisions to terminate late stage projects that just did not offer a high enough financial return or probability of a commercial success to warrant additional investment.</p>
          <p>The key message that I want to leave with you is that we have taken action. These decisions, while being very painful, were made based on both the commercial attractiveness and potential success rate of our pipeline assets. We want to ensure that we do not continue to invest good money after bad, and that we put the division in a stronger position for the future.</p>
          <p>In Q2, we informed you about our decision to discontinue three projects: cladribine in multiple sclerosis; Erbitux in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer; and IMO-2055, a cancer drug candidate that we're licensing from Idera Pharmaceuticals four years ago.</p>
          <p>In addition to these three projects, we are announcing four other pipeline projects that we have decided to discontinue, resulting in seven pipeline projects stopped over the past few months. We are stopping the development program for ARX-201, a long-acting growth hormone we were developing with Ambrx. We have decided to withdraw the registration for our Rebif HSA-free formulation in the United States. And we have discontinued one of our two c-Met kinase inhibitors for use in solid tumors. Finally, last Friday, we announced our decision to return all rights of safinamide, a Phase III compound to treat Parkinson's disease to our partner, Newron.</p>
          <p>The delays recorded by the ARX-201 program combined with the progress of competitors in this market significantly reduced the potential of this compound and led to our decision to discontinue the project. We are also not pursuing the registration process of the HSA-free formulation of Rebif any longer, because, based on feedback from the FDA and external experts, it is our assessment that pursuing the registration would require additional clinical trial datas to support approval, thus, making the potential financial return less attractive.</p>
          <p>And we decided to discontinue development of EMD 1204831, one of our two c-Met kinase inhibitors, based on pre-clinical, clinical data generated thus far and as part of the planned selection process between both compounds which were being investigated in parallel. The most significant project that we are adding to this list is the late-stage development program for safinamide our drug candidates against Parkinson's disease, which we licensed from Newron five years ago.</p>
          <p>This decision was made for strategic and commercial reasons, due to a more limited market potential for the drugs than we originally had anticipated. Over the past three years, we have written off &#x2013; sorry, over the past three quarters we have written off the book value of safinamide, and we did not believe that the investment that would be required to bring this product to the market would work with additional sales profits from the drug we would receive.</p>
          <p>So, to close the discussion on the pipeline review, we have taken action, and we have made tough decisions. In just three months, we have eliminated two late-stage Phase III projects while terminating pipeline projects that were not showing progress. These projects were taking up internal resources but were not showing the expected progress toward potential approval.</p>
          <p>I believe that this represents a new paradigm at Merck Serono and shows that we are making pipeline decisions based upon stringent, fact-based, scientific and strategic criteria rather than just on hope. However, I want to stress that we are not just terminating projects, of course, but we are also cultivating initiatives for future growth, and this is evidenced by our recent licensing activities.</p>
          <p>On the next slides, I show some evidence of this activity. We are strengthening and defending our leadership position in multiple sclerosis, and we are focused on extracting value out of this strong franchise. In September, we acquired the global development and commercialization rights of the experimental drug, PI-2301, for a total of &#x20AC;1.2 million from Peptimmune, Inc. As a second generation of peptide copolymer, PI-2301 is thought to work through immune modulation by enhancing the regulatory response of the immune system and, thereby, controlling the pathogenic autoimmune response observed in autoimmune diseases such multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>This compound has completed a Phase Ia study in healthy volunteers, as well as a Phase Ib study in patients with secondary progressive MS. Results of these studies are consistent with pre-clinical studies and confirm the potential value of the compound in our development pipeline in this domain with the goal of providing patients with various therapeutic options. The compound will be evaluated for entering into our clinical development engine.</p>
          <p>We further strengthened our multiple sclerosis franchise through the recent collaboration with Ono Pharmaceuticals on ONO-4641, an oral medication of Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, currently being investigated in the Phase II study against relapsing-remitting MS.</p>
          <p>As part of this collaboration, we acquired the worldwide exclusive development commercialization rights of this new drug candidate, excluding Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, for an up-front payment of &#x20AC;14 million. As you can see with Gilenya, S1P receptor agonists represent a class of compounds with a new mode of action which can add a valuable treatment option to the studies portfolio in these therapies.</p>
          <p>ONO-4146 (sic) [ONO-4641] showed the potential in pre-clinic data to have a more selective profile than others in this field. We expect results from the Phase II study DreaMS  to be available in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, I show a snapshot of both the strength capabilities of the division as well as the overall attractiveness of the therapeutic areas to Merck today. You can see that we are continuing to invest in areas like oncology and multiple sclerosis where we have substantial capabilities and where there are significant unmet medical needs.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we are investing in our fertility and endocrinology franchises to leverage our strong market presence. For example, we just recently received approvals for three new fertility pens in Europe and initiated a Phase IIIb trial for Kuvan to potentially extend this treatment to phenylketonuria patients younger than four years.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we are looking to externalize areas like Parkinson's disease, where we do not have an established franchise. We are also in the process of evaluating areas like Alzheimer's, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.</p>
          <p>While lupus is definitely an attractive market, and we have a promising pipeline molecule, atacicept, we do not have strong franchise in the rheumatology market today. Most specifically, we do not have a sales force, nor the strong relationships with key thought leaders in this market. As a result, we need to assess whether the value that is inherit in the atacicept is best unlocked in our own hands or the hands of the third party, and this is what we are currently exploring.</p>
          <p>So, to summarize, we're becoming more externally focused, and we actively invest in franchises where we have substantial capabilities, while externalizing areas that we do not have established franchises. Investments we are making represent comparatively low-risk, high-potential return on projects. These projects are just the beginning of our efforts to build a longer term growth story.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, it shows the old R&amp;D organization of Merck Serono. I think the slide speaks for itself. Our existing R&amp;D organization is too large and complex, our spending is not focused, and our R&amp;D processes are insufficient. We had too many silos, business units directing R&amp;D investments, we were not acting as a global organization, and we had lengthy coordination processes because of too many committees. Committees were springing up like mushrooms everywhere and added a lot of complexity and interfaces to getting the drug approved.</p>
          <p>The next slide talking about the type of problems that required major changes to simplify our forces and extract value out of our R&amp;D assistance. This led to the decision of separating Research and Development into Global Discovery and Early Development and Global Drug Development and Medical. I showed these two new organizations on slide 14 and 15. Both of these functions have very clear and straightforward mandates. Global Discovery and Early Development will gain full budget control in order to drive forward preparations until proof-of-confidence in a more entrepreneurial environment. Global Drug Development and Medical will be able to fully concentrate on ensuring excellence in clinical studies or in expanding skills in regulatory and medical affairs.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, I show several important benefits of this new organization structure which ultimately is geared towards speed and better execution in our R&amp;D function, such as, a simplified committee structure with the mutual participation of both functions will ensure the seamless transition between the two functions. The focus on external research will be significantly increased. This will enable us to fill our pipeline more quickly, both in terms of new substances and additional talent.</p>
          <p>With these measures, we will address the core elements in making our development functions successful in the future., build excellent development skills. We will industrialize and standardize our advanced development in order to increase efficiency, and we combined risk management compliance with regulations and safety standards in order to ensure patient's safety when using Merck's normal product.</p>
          <p>So, I will close by stating that the first part of strengthening the division was to find highly experienced executives to join the organization in both commercial execution and drug development, who have proven execution skills. The second phase was to put together an organization structure that would improve our speed in decision making. And now, we begin the real work, which is increasing our commercial effectiveness and optimizing the cost structure of Merck Serono. I look forward to sharing more details of these plans with you in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Matthias.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>A warm welcome from my side as well. I hope that in the course of this morning, we could provide, through respective calls and through the investor and end of this debrief, already more clarity as far as the financial results are concerned at group level and also at segment level. So, I would be crisp on the key points that I would like to take more into the limelight in the course of this call.</p>
          <p>I will start with slide number 18 and here, address the group P&amp;L, and, of course, the organic growth rate was predominantly driven by Merck Serono, as well as by Merck Millipore. I will dwell on that in more detail.</p>
          <p>As far as the gross margin increase is concerned, or the gross margin and absolute numbers is concerned, please take note of the fact that last year we took the step-up costs for the inventories in the P&amp;L. SG&amp;A costs were driven upwards due to, predominantly, royalty expenses that increased in light of increase in Rebif and Erbitux sales. As far as R&amp;D costs are concerned, I will allude in a second towards, of course, the projects that we still have for late-stage pipeline and that predominantly impacts Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>As far as amortization is concerned, the key driver behind this number is the reference we gave to the shortened amortization periods on Rebif with the second quarter conference call. So, the above leads organically to a decline of the respective hits, notably from the R&amp;D, but also from Liquid Crystals business, which suffered, as guided in Q2, quite heavily in Q3.</p>
          <p>Net profits. We saw an upside versus third quarter 2010, basically driven by a one-time tax credit that we received in the third quarter that, of course, will not occur on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>With this, I move to slide number 19. And here, reference on organic growth that we have posted on Merck Serono is definitely coming from the good performance from the products that we will address in a moment. But please take note of the fact that the organic growth rates posted here is, to some extent, inflated also by the low base that was triggered through the distribution model change that we had in Q3 2010. So, the base in Q3 2010 is relatively low, whilst in fourth quarter comparables, this would be exactly the opposite effect, so please make adjustments of around about 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>As far as SG&amp;A costs are concerned in Merck Serono, you do see that Stefan is managing his cost base very nicely. So, this has been kept under control, whilst royalty expenses have increased due to Rebif and Erbitux sales, which, of course, we nicely recorded, and amortization, I made reference to Rebif amortization period already.</p>
          <p>With this, let's move to slide number 20. I think the key element here that you see in the Rebif sales is the reflection of the price increase we alluded to already with the second quarter. That's point number one, whilst having also in Europe nice volume elements.</p>
          <p>The second element that you see here which is a change towards Q2, we have &#x2013; we are not out of the woods yet in Japan, but the decline is no longer that pronounced. We gave guidance that volume decline in Q2 was in the neighborhood of 36%, and in Q3 this has gone down to around about 23%. So, also here, especially as first line patient recruitment is concerned, we are going in the right direction.</p>
          <p>What I would also like to flag is that the other franchises are doing quite well as far as Fertility is concerned, but also Endocrinology, especially here. Kuvan was more visible in the third quarter. As in the previous quarter, it's still a small product but will grow according to our assumptions. On Glucophage, I would simply like to stress we are doing very, very well here, especially in the emerging markets. We have thus reached our capacity limits. We will adjust them, but this will take around about three quarters, so don't be surprised to see very, very modest development on Glucophage in the three quarters to come. While then in fourth quarter '12, this might, then, again.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to Consumer Health Care. Basically, the key points that I would like to highlight, the two brands, BION3 and Nasivin, have nicely contributed. Please take, however, further note of the fact that the Q3 quarter, seasonal-wise, is always the strongest, as this is the quarter where the pharmacies are loading the stocks in order to provide for the winter season in Q4. So, don't be surprised if fourth quarter will soften versus Q3. Again, this is the normal seasonality of this business.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll move to page number 22 and refer to the nice organic growth that we've posted with Merck Millipore. And as we confirmed in Q2, it's a nice business, gradually growing. The growth rate of 7% is definitely 2% to 3% overstated, due to the fact that here we've faced distribution problems just after the merger in 2010. So, the base here is also on a low end. And so, therefore, the organic growth should be adjusted by around about 2 to 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>I do take note of the fact that the markets on the life science tools industry turned somewhat bearish in the last two to three months due to the Academia, which of course &#x2013; notably in the U.S. has softened. But you should see in Merck Millipore that our exposure is not solely to Academia. So, the Bioscience business, of course, suffers where we are most presented in the Academia business.</p>
          <p>The other two business unit, Lab Solutions and, especially, Process Solutions, are more geared towards industry segments that had nothing to do with Academia. And here, notably, the Biopharma business, of course, is disconnected from any Academia softness, and this business did pretty well.</p>
          <p>The other elements in the P&amp;L, I would like to give reference to currencies here, especially the weakened U.S. dollar gave a hit of around about &#x20AC;10 million to &#x20AC;15 million versus previous years, so softening operational profits. And we took single digit millions in our hands in the marketing and sales, and also in R&amp;D, in order to differentiate ourselves in the markets as we go ahead into the next few years, because we consider this business as a business with low risk but decent growth rates.</p>
          <p>With this, I move to performance materials. We guided already in Q2 that Q3 will be softer, and you clearly see this happening. As a matter of fact, in Pigments, it softened further, so here we saw that volumes really went downwards, as you can see from the sales that we will report &#x2013; that we have reported. But also, the Liquid Crytals business softened due to destocking on the inventory side at our customer level. And also PS-VA, going further down and reaching now more the average levels that the other technologies have. So, we had an unfavorable volume development, but also a further mix impact which then, accordingly, led to a erosion in gross margin and profitability.</p>
          <p>What I would like to indicate at this point in time is that we also see a softer Q4 similar to Q3. However, in Q4, we will have a easier comparable base compared to the third quarter. So, all in all, we can see that the chemical &#x2013; true chemical parts of the Merck portfolio turned softer, and, therefore, I would like to make reference when the chemical industry softens, generally speaking, it softens two to three quarter, and that should then be no difference as far as performance material is concerned. However, we are not seeing any sharp decline in volumes that we have seen, for instance, in fourth quarter '08 or first quarter '09.</p>
          <p>The last point I would like to make on performance materials, please take note of the fact that in Q1 2012, we have the toughest comparable base and one element was also the extremely favorable currency situation that we encountered in Q1 2011 which, by now, has completely changed.</p>
          <p>We then move to page number 24, and I will address balance sheets. Only two elements: the gross financial debts basically states where it is. The net financial debt, we have lowered by around about &#x20AC;1 billion. I think we are here and clearly on track as far as the deleveraging is concerned. And as far as gross debt is concerned, please take note of the fact that we have the first bonds maturing in Q1 2012 ,which we are going to collect and not replace.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, the strong cash position that we have is nice. But of course, we don't need &#x20AC;2 billion of cash sitting on the balance sheet. We will gradually move that down to more appropriate levels as we go ahead.</p>
          <p>Page number 25 gives you an overview on the cash flow, working capital, capital expenditures, moderate improvements, but not a big story line. As far as free cash development is concerned, you see that through the divestitures that we contemplated or closed in Q1 and received respective cash returns, but also through the nice underlying operating cash flow that Merck generates, we had a decent free cash flow and also a decent underlying free cash flow, while it's, of course, absorbing, now, the around about &#x20AC;120 million incremental interest costs that we incurred due to the financing of Millipore.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to slide 26 and, here, address the guidance. I've indicated in Q2 already that we give the hard guidance on the group numbers. And here we have narrowed the revenue guidance compared to Q2 from 10% to 10.4%. We've precised that now to 10% to 10.2%, which is normal when you are coming closer to end of the year. So, that's the one element.</p>
          <p>The other element is that we stick to the underlying cooperating results which we've guided for in Q2. Please take note of the fact that, of course, in Q4, we will take the hits on safinamides, which we guided for or publicly wrote on our press release last week. This will incur costs of around about &#x20AC;40 million. We would back that out of the underlying cooperating result because &#x2013; that we have to take action, everybody knows. And when we take action, I think this should be considered as good elements. But of course, this will then have to be adjusted on the core operating result level.</p>
          <p>As far as the operating result is concerned, we gave that to you, but I will be explicit. We regard the &#x20AC;2.25 billion operating result as not the primary guidance for 2011. Here, there is less room with the safinamide charge we will take.</p>
          <p>On the divisions side, the numbers we will &#x2013; we have given you, here is a further precision. On Merck Serono, the 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points, you will note that this is a, let's say, unchanged, whilst the underlying business is going into the direction that it's rather the 2 percentage points than the 1 percentage point. We have not changed that for the Q3 conference call, but please take it to consideration, if the movement should be healthier, we will also incur like its normal in the fourth quarter in pharmaceuticals companies, also, respective costs.</p>
          <p>As far as Consumer Healthcare, Performance Materials, and Merck Millipore is concerned, we've precised the guidance further. With Q2 we indicated already the numbers will be rather on the low end. Now with Q3, I think we confirm this and; however, think that this is now the realistic set of numbers.</p>
          <p>Let's finish with 27, page 27. And here, on the indicator side, we listened to the buy side and also to the sell sides in the last 4 to 4.5 months quite extensively. We took note of the criticism that the market conveyed to us that the various indicators of Merck, like the OR, the Core, the ROS and everything with and without exception, all tend to be a little bit irritating. We have now taken the decision for 2012 onwards to simplify the matrix and will, therefore, run the business from the performance standpoint, and here I explicitly say from the annual performance standpoint on EBITDA reported and pre one-time charges. Of course, we will provide you with the Q4 data, historic numbers for the segments and for the company so that you can adjust your models appropriately. But this will be the future indicator that we will use, and I think it will simplify &#x2013; and it combines, I think, the performance indicator that somewhat adjusts for, also, the intangible assets that we have and that should, therefore, make life easier as we go ahead.</p>
          <p>The other elements are points that I have conveyed to you in the last two to three months, qualitative guidance we will provide with full year numbers, and we will provide qualitative guidance on A, for the group, but B, where the divisions, where we see the divisions in the course of 2012. We will, however, then only start giving quantitative guidance with Q1 numbers. So, this would be a change, and it's something that's &#x2013; for those of you that has dealt with me in the past 10 years are accustomed to, I know that Merck was a little bit different in this respect. So, next to the financial matrix, we'll also adjust this slightly.</p>
          <p>Disclosure policy, we got feedback from many of you that you would like to have further transparency on some elements, especially as regards Pharma. We are currently preparing that, and we also conveyed that we might rather move from business units in Performance Materials than to segmental guidance in the chemicals field, and therefore, we would provide further clarity as requested by many of you on Pharma while adjusting somewhat the segmental information on the Performance Materials side.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to open the floor to the questions that you will have on your end, and please start right away. Christina, if you could assemble the Q&amp;A roster, please.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Edward Dulac of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Three questions, please. First one, perhaps for Matthias on Merck Millipore, specifically on gross margins. I believe in the second quarter, you suggested that we look at the second half of last year, of 2010, gross margins as a gauge for the shorter-term gross margin for Merck Millipore. However, when I look at the performance of the first nine months of this year, suggests that the gross margins are far better than the 51% or 52% that we saw in the second half of 2010. So, are you now more comfortable with gross margins in the 56% to 58% range or potentially even higher, or is there a reason we should expect pressure here going forward?</p>
          <p>The second question, perhaps for Stefan. When I look in the presentation, and as you've outlined as part of your comments, many of the therapeutic categories that will require investment going forward are among the most competitive, and many companies have been shifting towards external research and innovation over the last few years. So, what is the market-to-value proposition to potential external partners, and how will you differentiate as a specialty pharma company versus some of your larger peers? And, I guess, as a second component to that, will most of the focus externally be on early stage collaborations and agreements?</p>
          <p>And then, just finally, on healthcare reforms, if you could help quantify the impact that you've seen year-to-date and give us a sense of how far along that process we are. And as you look into 2012, perhaps there's more pressure to come from Spain and elsewhere, in terms of where we are overall in healthcare reforms. Are we, kind of, midway through that process? Do you see more risk in the future, or is this largely behind us? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Ed, let me address the first question. And I think as far as healthcare reform is concerned, number-wise, I will give an indication and, of course, Stefan will address the therapeutic areas.</p>
          <p>As far as Merck Millipore is concerned and the gross margin is concerned, please take note of the fact that in the second half of 2010, we incurred around about the &#x20AC;80 million, &#x20AC;85 million of step-up costs that we had in our inventory. So, they were caused simply by the takeover price and were pushed down to respective balance sheet items, including working capital thus inventories, and they were eating through the P&amp;L in Q3 and Q4. So, the base here is lower, and we simply, now in 2011, have come to a normal gross margin levels.</p>
          <p>And as far as the healthcare reforms is concerned, there are number implications here. Of course, we, in the entire European environment, predominantly you refer to Royal Decree, also to that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:46:53) in Germany. This is something we have to manage. We will not disclose specific numbers country by country. But, of course, we have to manage. We took respective hits in the P&amp;L already, gradually in 2010. This is also an element we are confronted with in 2011, and to a certain extent, of course, this will also be the case in 2012. So, we have to, as a company, get prepared for that. Stefan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question as to the choice of therapeutic areas and what specific capabilities we feel we have, especially compared to big pharma companies. We believe that we, indeed, have excellent capabilities in the oncology field. We agree that this is a highly competitive field. So far, our track record commercially as well as in development is pretty good, I would say. And the same applies to multiple sclerosis. When we make statements about areas such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson, we do not refer to these areas as not showing potential, but we believe that given our current situation, the need to focus, that these areas are less attractive for us specifically.</p>
          <p>The question is how we differentiate us versus big pharmas is we &#x2013; to give you the example, on oncology, Erbitux, we have clearly followed a personalized medicine pathway in the &#x2013; when facing quite formidable competitors. And so far, I think that our approach has yielded acceptable results.</p>
          <p>What is also important from, especially in the oncology area, is that we believe that we combine capabilities in the area of biologics, in the area of small molecules, and immune therapy so that we can address all aspects of a cancer, i.e., targets on the surface of the cell &#x2013; intercellular targets as well as the environment that &#x2013; the environment of the tumor.</p>
          <p>Your second question was related to healthcare reform and pressures going forward. We as a company that has a pretty strong position in Europe, are, of course, affected by this and you heard Matthias talk to this earlier today. We do see price pressures, and we expect price pressures going forward in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we should acknowledge that we are one of the companies with the highest share &#x2013; among the highest shares of our sales coming out of the emerging markets. So, we believe that we provide a comparatively balanced profile.</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Matthew Weston of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions if I could. The first is for Matthias, and really, just to clarify something that you said in your introductory comments. You were referring to Performance Materials and the pressures in 4Q, and I think you made a comment that it was going to be like 3Q. And I firstly wanted to check, was that a reference to all Performance Materials or just Pigments? And if it was a reference to Performance Materials, are you suggesting that the organic growth will be similar in 4Q to 3Q, or the absolute revenue number will be in a similar range?</p>
          <p>And then, a second question, probably for Stefan. R&amp;D, clearly you've reduced Phase III projects very materially in your short time at the company, but R&amp;D spend continues to increase. I fully understand that that's because you're entering a period of late-stage spending and cost acceleration. When do you think that that will come to an end, and we will start to see R&amp;D spend roll over on the existing projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Matthew, on the Performance Materials side for fourth quarter, the two statements I would like to give here in order to precise that a little bit, the fourth quarter base Q4 '10 is not as tough as the third quarter base '10. So, therefore, you will see a lower delta compared to the delta that we have posted in Q3. Volumewise, the trading does not differ a lot. There might be slight improvements in Q3 from the volume side, but I don't expect in Q4 that the volume trading will be significantly upwards. So, that should give the clarity on Performance Materials. Stefan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the R&amp;D projects that we have produced, yes, we have obviously tried to kill some advance on this. And this has, again, obviously &#x2013; and the fact that they're initially &#x2013; that this incurs additional costs. Moreover, as Matthias and Karl stated, we are &#x2013; our pipeline spend is very much still skewed toward rather expensive late-stage projects.</p>
          <p>Another comment is that our historical governance structure was not the right one in order to drive more efficiency in this area, because then such spend would've been redistributed within the business units. We have new people onboard. We have a new governance structure. We're now focusing on making this work, and we will communicate to you on the details of what that means for our R&amp;D spend in the first half of 2012.</p>

          <p>From Sanford Bernstein, we are now taking question of Jack Scannell, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Jack Scannell. My question, I think, for Stefan Oschmann. Over the last couple of years, there really has opened up a huge mismatch between the expectations of financial markets and those actually running drug companies with respect to returns on R&amp;D. Financial markets now behave fairly clearly as if R&amp;D destroys value. People running drug companies presume financial markets are wrong, and it's still worth investing.</p>
          <p>So, with the aim of narrowing that gap, can you think of any evidence that investors should look at that would convince them that those running drug companies are right? And alternatively, can you think of any evidence that investors could bring to your attention that would convince you you were spending too much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack, I may not be intelligent enough to solve all the problems of the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. I've focused my own attention on trying to fix Merck Serono, but we are very much aware of the issues that you have just portrayed. And, indeed, many pharma &#x2013; especially big pharma companies are priced for value destruction through R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>I have tried to highlight some of the factors why this was the &#x2013; why this applied specifically to us. We're trying to fix this. And we are convinced that we will be able to add value through R&amp;D. We have &#x2013; we're focusing ourselves on few high unmet medical need specialty areas. We are trying to have an organization that is solely focused on delivering proof-of-confidence candidates and an organization that industrializes and standardizes that development.</p>
          <p>I think we are somewhat &#x2013; we have been somewhat behind several of our competitors with regards to optimizing our R&amp;D spend. And we think that we have more scope for action with respect &#x2013; in this respect than others. But we do see that there are pharmaceutical companies that are successful with R&amp;D. And this is a tough game. And we need to be one of those who do a particularly good job. I'm not sure whether I can address the overall question of the R&amp;D conundrum the pharmaceutical industry is in.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have three questions, if I may. The first one on Merck Serono, you reported a 2% FX effect to top line. What was the effect, bottom line, from the strong Swiss franc? Second question on your pension provision, you had an increase 4% year-on-year while other companies' product provisions just came down due to the lower inflation assumptions. What was the trigger for your higher pension provisions? And last but not least, your nine months' CapEx was slightly below last year. Can you give us a guidance for the full year, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure, of course. You reported a 2% FX, or a negative FX effect top line and what was this effect on the earnings, so as your &#x2013; part of your cost-base is in Switzerland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, of course, top line is different than bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've provided guidance with the second quarter on both currencies. And we've been quite explicit on that. As far as the U.S. dollar is concerned, we gave the indication that this is in the teens as far as negative implications are concerned when the dollar moved by $0.01 weaker and, bottom line, that it is in the mid-single digits millions hits. On the Swiss franc, we've said this is not so much the sales implication but predominantly the cost implication. So, we said &#x20AC;0.01 somewhat leads to &#x20AC;4 million implication. So, that is something I think we have included that in the appendix...</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in Q3 call, you will find that in the Q2 call. To some extent, that is also the rationale behind the pension accrual that we have. So, you've seen that currencies further strengthened as far as July and third quarter is concerned, and this was the primary driver as far as pension is concerned. The true view on pensions you will get, again, get when we go towards our closing process in Q4 and make the respective analysis with the country-by-country pension plans with the actuary assessments.</p>
          <p>And as far as the nine months CapEx is concerned, sorry, the full-year CapEx is concerned, I think this is not a big number for our entire balance sheet. We are currently on the run rates of around about &#x20AC;350 million to &#x20AC;380 million. So, that is something that you should take into consideration for your models.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Richard Vosser of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Rich Vosser from JPMorgan. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Two Merck Serono related questions first, please. Given that you've licensed a couple of MS products, the Ono and the Peptimmune that you mentioned, I wondered if you could give us your thinking around developing these agents in parallel? Would you go with both of them into Phase III or would you prioritize the compounds?</p>
          <p>And with that in mind, how do you see, I mean, we've seen today, I think, BG-12 data showing that it's probably superior to Copaxone. Obviously, it was a very small investment in the Peptimmune compound, but how does that affect your thinking around moving that agent forward?</p>
          <p>And then finally, with respect to those agents, how should we think about the investments in terms of, in relation to your R&amp;D budget and spending with these products?</p>
          <p>And another product-related question. Just &#x2013; you mentioned atacicept and looking at reevaluating that with partners, I just wondered whether you, any of your thinking around reevaluating this product with &#x2013; to do with only having one Phase III trial ongoing? I think other agents have used two Phase III trials to gain approval in lupus.</p>
          <p>And then finally, one for Matthias, on, I think you mentioned moving cash off the balance sheet once you've paid some of the debt down. That could probably happen, I suppose, in, from '13, and I was wondering for an update on how you see the uses of cash both on acquisitions for both Merck Serono and Millipore or Merck Millipore, and how we should think about dividends going through with that period of time, too? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, let me address the cash one first of all, and then Stefan will take up the other respective questions. What we indicated on the cash side is that there's a bond maturing in course of first quarter 2012, and this is a benchmark bond of &#x20AC;500 million. So basically, what we are currently planning is to pay down the &#x20AC;500 million in the first quarter and that will naturally reduce the cash position.</p>
          <p>We have other bonds outstanding in 2012 and also 2013, and we will see what we will do as we go ahead, if we also just repay them or if we make a liability management, maturity management. So, the deleveraging of the balance sheet and, thus, also through the deleveraging increasing EPS due to lower interest rates is, of course, an element that we are interested and focused on as we go ahead in 2012. So, that's the primary objective to get the balance sheet in order again. So, that's point number one on the cash side.</p>
          <p>Point number two on the cash side, dividends. We are humble dividend company. So, that's, I think, not the theme of Merck at this stage. So, in the next one, two, or three years, when we would address the overall company and look what we can do whilst paying down the debt that we have, we will then potentially reconsider a dividend policy. But at this point in time, please expect that we will maintain a humble dividend policy. And with this, I turn to Stefan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the multiple sclerosis compound, you should note that the Peptimmune compound that we have indeed acquired very moderate sum and the ONO compound are in different stages.</p>
          <p>Peptimmune is a Phase II-ready product. As I said, we're currently evaluating that. And we will take a decision, a turnover decision in the future. And the Ono compound has finalized Phase II. The data are not available. We expect to see the data in the first quarter of 2012. So, just given the sequence of these two compounds, they would not be developed entirely in parallel. They would also be addressing different market segments. The Peptimmune compound, if developed successfully, would be competing with Axon segment, while the Ono compound, if developed successfully, would be competing with Gilenya.</p>
          <p>On BG-12, obviously, we take BG-12 very seriously. It's potentially a serious competitor. We should note, however, that some of the data are not clearly comparable. The studies done on Rebif, for instance, whereas Rebif had a different database, different patient database compared to today. I think, the decisive point for BG-12 will be when we see the Phase III data versus Copaxone. Before that, it's premature to make any final statements as to the value of the product. And atacicept is currently in Phase B. We have not taken any decision as to one or two Phase III trials.</p>

          <p>Okay, Vincent, bon jour. On the first question, breakdown of the investment on therapeutic slide area, we will not provide the level of detail. So, please accept this answer. As far as Liquid Crystals is concerned, for the fourth quarter, pretty much the indication still sticks that on pricing, we will see automatically, due to PS-VA going down, we will here make adjustments, but we have indicated already in Q2 that they would be in the single-digit area for the entire Liquid Crystals division. One, of course, volumes are humble. So, it's more in the fourth quarter the pricing aspects that will come through and &#x2013; but also a moderate volume momentum. So, this is as refers to question one and two, and three and four will be taken by Stefan.</p>

          <p>When it comes to the Rebif price increase, we believe that this is in line with the &#x2013; with comparative developments, and that it reflects the therapeutic value that product delivers. It is impossible for us, right now, to make any forecast about our future pricing environment in the U.S. Our long-range planning is not based on radical price increases in any market in the world.</p>
          <p>Your second question to the relevance of RNF, when it comes to biosimilars, several external observers have noted that the FDA is stating a very, very stringent approach when it comes to the comparability of biologics, and several people believe that this situation means that. specifically in the U.S.. that the regulatory hurdles of biosimilars are very high.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Odile Rundquist of Helvea. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First, a question on Rebif. If you could just give us the breakdown in your Rebif performance, meaning how much comes from volume and price increase, and also, the breakdown of sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world? And then on the chemical division, if you can also give us a bit more color on the PS-VA pressure and how much market share do you have now?</p>
          <p>And finally, a question for Mr. Oschmann. I want to understand a bit more precisely what are the reasons for your changing of perception in market potential for safinamide? Was it related to a competitive landscape or was it more because of the data that we saw with safinamide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I will -- Odile, bon jour -- will address the first two questions. On Rebif, the communication that we've done &#x2013; so, the organic growth 8% is, from the pricing side, predominantly, U.S., U.S., U.S. while on the &#x2013; and this has driven third quarter predominantly -- while we also alluded to the volume sides, which makes the other delta -- but precisely further information by country, we will not provide. So, it's predominantly the U.S. price increase of 8.5% that was posted in June. And then we had some further nice volume intake also from, in the European context.</p>
          <p>As far as your questions on Liquid Crystals is concerned, I would like to provide the two areas of information. One for the entire product, Liquid Crystals, we have a market share in Q3 around 58%, and I referenced early on that PS-VA has come pretty close to the overall market share of the Liquid Crystals segment now, which is normal after the technology was the leader for three years that have then, step-by-step quarter-by-quarter average is down to the average leadership position that we have in Liquid Crystals. And with this, I turn over to Stefan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the safinamide decision, this was, obviously, based on our assessment of how high our chance would be to differentiate the product in the marketplace. It was not based on any new clinical data. It was part of the ongoing review and reprioritization of our R&amp;D pipeline. We believe that safinamide has less of a chance to differentiation and, thus, a more limited market potential than we have initially thought. That was a difficult, really, truly difficult decision for us, but we need to make sure that our resources are directed towards the most promising project.</p>
          <p>We initiated &#x2013; we initially assumed that there would be a higher chance to differentiation based on advantages connected to safinamide. So far, as you all know, there is no evidence as to that. And we think that in the current regulatory reimbursement and competitive environment, the product has less potential and does not warrant further investment.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Holger Blum of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. Holger Blum, Deutsche Bank. Three questions. Firstly, you mentioned Kuvan as a single product but didn't mention the revenues. Could you, maybe, give us a rough guidance on the annual revenue and where the product is currently?</p>
          <p>And, secondly, with regard to Merck Millipore, you talked about the margin and the incremental development here pointing again in a better direction. Would you still see the business in the long run around a 20% underlying core operating margin, and if so, would there rather be more upside or downside risk in the long run to that, even though you're currently a bit weaker?</p>
          <p>And third question, on emerging markets, Would you see any kind of risk that really &#x2013; if the macro outlook deteriorates further, what kind of impact would this have on emerging markets, A, from a chemical perspective, and B, from a pharma perspective. If you, let's say, at least Pharma can keep the impressive gross rates of its pharma products, or is there all or maybe risk if the macro outlook deteriorates? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Herr Blum, as far as Kuvan is concerned, we mentioned Kuvan because it's one element that has driven growth here. So, it's a product that has very recently, 2009, been introduced, and it is making nice developments in &#x2013; especially now, this year. So, at group level, it's not triple digit, the numbers. It's clearly in the low double-digit numbers so far. But it's becoming visible and, therefore, it's one element that's &#x2013; will gradually improve, and I think in 2012 and '13, we will reach a level that if the product continues further, then it will be also exposed as one of the drugs that can be more considered. And with this, I would basically leave it at Kuvan.</p>
          <p>We would simply like to flag that endocrinology is a segment that we are good at, because we have not only one drug, but basically five. And all of them, to some extent, contribute to this wonderful niche position that we have in this franchise.</p>
          <p>As far as Merck Millipore is concerned, please take into consideration this is a healthy business with average rates of around the 20%. In the past, that has been slightly higher. And now, through currencies predominantly on the weakening U.S. dollar compared to 2010, we have been slightly lower. But the average run rate of roughly 20% is, I would say, something that this business can definitely perform at, but of course, with volatility on currencies that need to be taken into consideration.</p>
          <p>As far as, generally, the emerging markets are concerned for the Merck group &#x2013; and I'm 100% sure that Stefan will specifically address that for Pharma &#x2013; at group level, let me convey that we are beautifully balanced. So, we have two segments: one pharma, one chemical. Overall, I think this gives us a somewhat more balanced position regardless where the economic setup is going to go.</p>
          <p>Of course, pharma is more balanced but has its own characteristics. Also in the emerging markets as chemicals are concerned, of course when the global chemical industry turns down, we will follow accordingly, with our very much focus on Performance Materials where we are truly exposed to Asia. So, that's somewhat the area where volatility, if it occurs, will be directly at our camp.</p>
          <p>And Stefan, you would like to say something on emerging markets Pharma?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emerging markets in Pharma, we should &#x2013; I think we should note that we have a fairly well-balanced country, regional, as well as product, portfolio. We have a strong position in Latin America, in Asian markets, in the Middle East, in some Eastern European markets. So, our success in emerging markets is not driven by a single country or region.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we should note that we, in contrast to many of our few biotech competitors, we have -- given that we're part of a larger company, we have an existing infrastructure in almost any market in the world where it makes sense to do business. And in these markets, we have two pillars for our business. One is what we call our CMC and GM products. These are older brands like Concor, or like Glucophage or Eutirox. And in the emerging markets, brand loyalty and quality play a big role. The other pillar is, of course, our biotech product. So I believe that we have a comparatively good risk benefit balance in the emerging markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Thanks for taking my question. I've got two questions regarding the tax ratio. What should we put in our spreadsheets following this one-time as seen in Q3? Perhaps you can give us guidance there.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I really didn't understand why Pigments fell short, why those expectations are so weak in Q3. Can you give us, perhaps, an explanation; is that belonging to Japan still? I see demand weak from all your customers; perhaps you can give us some insight. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would, Mr. Huwald, I would like to address the &#x2013; both questions on tax quota or tax ratio. The guidance that we've provided in the past with the 25% to 26% remains unchanged. So this is something that you should take into your model as you go ahead. I alluded to Q3, that this is the &#x2013; this was an exceptional item, and the general underlying tax ratio of 25% to 26% is the one that prevails for the next two to three years.</p>
          <p>As far as Pigments is concerned, I would like to make two explanations. One, the overall pigment industry, you will hear that most likely from other players in the inorganic or organic side, is softening and that takes place with us as well. The other element that we have seen now, with one to two quarters delay &#x2013; of course after the tragic situation in Japan in Q1, we have seen that some customers have, of course, sourced competitive products from others, because we have constraints on the volume side, and this is something that we have to catch back or catch before or regain again in the quarters to come. So, that's the result of the situation we alluded to and stemming from the tragic Japanese situation.</p>

          <p>Our final question today comes from Sachin Jain of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for fitting me on. Now just three quick ones, hopefully. Firstly, on Performance Materials, I'm wondering if you could provide any color on the defensibility of margins in a more aggressive top line downturn than you're expecting at the moment? Any difference in operational leverage versus '08, '09?</p>
          <p>And secondly, Consumer Health, you have mentioned, I think, in the second quarter call, some potentials for easy wins on SG&amp;A, potentially exiting countries, I think, had been talked about. Just some color as to what's going on there?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just a retouch on the R&amp;D spend levels for 2012, understanding that there's a high-level of spend given the Phase III ongoing. But just wondering if there's any level of flex within that spend at all or is the &#x20AC;1.2 billion kind of run rate that you're at for full year '11 already largely committed to for next year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are primarily financial questions with the exception of two. But on two, there's nothing new to be said. I think Karl has alluded to the statement that we will work on our areas and come back on respective actions potentially taken in one or the other area of the company in course of 2012. So, there's nothing new to be added.</p>
          <p>On the rather financial-related questions, Performance Materials and R&amp;D cost developments, we would like to clarify, potentially, the fourth quarter 2008, which has left a burning mark with many of the investors. The way you see margins in Performance Materials and notably Liquid Crystals going down to that number of 10%. I looked that up in the books, and the feedback that I would like to provide for Liquid Crystals, margins went down drastically in Q4 2008 to Q1 2009 because, A, we had, at that point in time, dedicated to currency hedges for Liquid Crystals. And if you go to &#x2013; back to 2008, fourth quarter, markets went bananas on currencies and, of course, at that point in time, there was a technical hit that was because of hedges running out of the money and hitting Liquid Crystals, respectively.</p>
          <p>Point number two, in 2008, fourth quarter and first quarter inventories had to be impaired as well because market prices went down. So, with the three month average approach that you take on inventories also &#x2013; or the net realizable value that has to be taken according to accounting policies, fourth quarter and first quarter &#x2013; fourth quarter '08 and first quarter '09, we're taking quite technical further hits because of that. We don't see Liquid Crystals anywhere in this situation when it comes to a normal chemical downturn. 2008 was a very specific situation for the entire chemical industry and for Liquid Crystals specifically, due to currency and inventory topics.</p>
          <p>The third question on R&amp;D, I think we reflect that &#x2013; Stefan has indicated that &#x2013; Karl-Ludwig has indicated that we do have late-stage projects running. And so, because of that, we take tough decisions, but due to late-stage projects, the R&amp;D costs were not from one quarter to the other dropped, but we still have to incur the running costs for the development late stage III that's simply are still committed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just a quick follow-on. Are there any areas of flex within the budget for next year? I think you've alluded to net fixed cost basis before or perhaps in fixed cost legacy Serono, or is it all committed to at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Sachin, I know what you are driving for. And I think Stefan has been very crisp and clear also on these respective points, that this is something we will address in the forthcoming calls in 2012, and please understand that we will not provide any further color on this point today.</p>
