          <p>Welcome to the First Quarter 2009 Results Conference Call of Bayer AG for investors and analysts on the 29th of April 2009. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louella . Good afternoon, everybody. And also on behalf of my colleagues, I'd like to welcome you to our Q1 conference call. With us on the call today are our CEO, Mr. Werner Wenning; our CFO, Klaus K&#xFC;hn; and the CEOs from our subgroups: Arthur Higgins from HealthCare, Friedrich Berschauer from CropScience, and Patrick Thomas from MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Mr. Wenning for his introduction, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statement wording which governs our call. Mr. Wenning will now briefly review our Q1 financial results. Thank you, Mr. Wenning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As expected, there was a wide variation in the performance of our subgroups in the first quarter. On the one hand we raised pharma sales and earnings and delivered record quarterly sales and earnings at CropScience. On the other hand the economic crisis has severely impacted our industrial business. The drop in sales and earnings at MaterialScience was even greater than we expected and left a distinct mark on the entire Group. We expect business conditions as a whole to remain difficult. And even the crop protection and healthcare markets are not completely immune to the effects of the economic crisis. In all our markets we are seeing considerable inventory reductions along the distribution channels due to a stronger focus on cash and liquidity management.</p>
          <p>Sales at MaterialScience stabilized at a low level in the first three months of the year. The downturn seems to be bottoming out and we can see the first signs of a moderate recovery in demand. We now expect in the second quarter a sequential improvement in sales and earnings and positive underlying EBITDA at MaterialScience for the full year.</p>
          <p>HealthCare and CropScience remain well on track overall. We can reconfirm our full year target for both these businesses. Against this background our aim of limiting the decline in Group EBITDA before special items to 5% looks increasingly demanding, but it is still achievable if there is a tangible recovery in the MaterialScience business.</p>
          <p>Our teams are working hard to make sure we stay ahead of the worst global recession we have seen in decades. And the first results of that work are already apparent, as you can see from the trends in net cash flow and net debt. We are convinced at Bayer, with its successful strategy and long-term alignment, we will emerge from this crisis even stronger than before.</p>
          <p>And now for the figures. As always I will be referring mainly to currency and portfolio adjusted sales numbers. The Group sales of about &#x20AC;7.9 billion were nearly 10% below the record level of the same period last year. The decline was due almost entirely to lower volumes. Selling prices were virtually unchanged. Currencies in general increased sales in the range of 2%, driven by favorable development of our major currencies, U.S. dollar, yen, and renminbi, as our production and thus cost base is predominantly in euro and all major currencies. The massive devaluation of smaller currencies, especially in Eastern Europe, led to a significant negative transactional impact. This impact plus a negative swing from hedging diminished earnings and consequently diluted our EBITDA margin.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter the margin dilution due to currency movements was at HealthCare 0.9 percentage points and at CropScience and MaterialScience in each case at 0.3 percentage points. For the Group that translates to a 0.8 percentage points lower underlying EBITDA margin due to shifts in currencies. Underlying EBITDA for the Group was down 22% because of the slump in earnings at MaterialScience. Core earnings per share were &#x20AC;0.91, down 37% from the year earlier figure.</p>
          <p>Like other companies, we are finding that healthcare markets are not completely immune to global recession, especially where you have exposure to the Consumer Health segment. We are not losing market share, but the rate of market growth is slowing, particularly in the U.S. where we estimate that the Rx market this year will probably shrink by about 1 to 2% for the first time in 50 years.</p>
          <p>Against this background and in light of the very strong prior year quarter we are well satisfied with HealthCare's performance in the first quarter. Sales and underlying EBITDA of the subgroup were slightly ahead of the prior year period. Increased pharmaceutical sales by 2.5%. Growth here was driven by the continuing strong momentum in Asia/Pacific and Latin America. In China, sales even rose by 19%. Most of our key pharma products posted encouraging increases. The Yaz product group was up nearly 5%, Mirena by 7%, Betaferon/Betaseron also about 7%, and Nexavar by nearly 29%. Sales of Avelox fell by 14%, partly on account of a weak flu season in the United States.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA of Pharmaceuticals improved by almost 9%. This earnings growth was due to higher sales, lower manufacturing costs and synergies from the integration of Schering. However, earnings were held back by higher marketing and R&amp;D expenses.</p>
          <p>Business in our Consumer Health segments was down by 4%. Sales in North America declined by 11%. Also we recorded pleasing increases in Europe and also in Asia/Pacific. Sales of our OTC products were nearly 4% below the first quarter of 2008. For the first time we felt the effect of the economic crisis more strongly, especially in North America. For that reason sales of Aleve were down by 18% and Aspirin by 16%. However, Bepanthen and the dermatology business of Intendis continue to develop well.</p>
          <p>The Medical Care unit combines our blood glucose monitoring and medical equipment businesses. Here sales were down by 5%, again the result of a drop in consumer demand.</p>
          <p>Animal Health also posted a slight drop of 4%, as our Advantage product line destocking by distributors had an adverse effect.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA of the Consumer Health segment came in at 234 million, a good 19% below the prior year quarter. The main reason for this apart from the drop in business was higher marketing expenses. Earnings here were also held back by the negative effect of currency changes on the cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>Despite a difficult market environment overall our HealthCare business as a whole remains on track. Our targets thus remain unchanged: growth above market in all divisions and improvement of the underlying EBITDA margin toward 28%.</p>
          <p>We are especially pleased to report a successful start into the season in our CropScience business. Business expanded by over 7% compared to the record first quarter of last year, with higher volumes accounting for 3% and higher selling prices for 4%. Currently the effects of the economic crisis are only evident in certain Eastern European markets and to a limited extent in our consumer Environmental Science business.</p>
          <p>Crop Protection sales advanced by 7%. Here we achieved our strongest growth in North America, where business improved by 19%. Sales were up by 9% in Asia/Pacific and by 8% in Europe. Only in Latin America did we see a drop in business, which was due to the drought in Southern Brazil and parts of Argentina. Business in this region was down by 12%. The strongest increase was achieved in our seed business. The BioScience business expanded by nearly 20%, driven by strong increases for canola seeds.</p>
          <p>The Environmental Science business shrank by 3% because of lower demand on the consumer side. The new products continued to develop very well, with total sales of these products rising by 14%. The pleasing growth in business enabled us to increase underlying EBITDA of CropScience by more than 3%. Earnings development here was held back by higher raw material cost and higher marketing expenses. In the light of the successful start to 2009 we can fully confirm our guidance for CropScience for the full year. We continue to target further growth and an underlying EBITDA margin of about 25%.</p>
          <p>The global economic crisis severely impacted our MaterialScience business. Sales fell by more than 38% due to massively lower volumes, and selling prices were also 5% below the prior year quarter. The decline applies to all product groups and all regional markets. As a result underlying EBITDA slumped to minus 160 million. This was due primarily to lower volumes and selling prices, accompanied by substantially lower capacity utilization at our production facilities. The drop in earnings was mitigated by savings from our restructuring programs. The relative easing of the situation on the raw material markets had only a slight beneficial effect on earnings compared with the prior year quarter, since the bulk of our sales in the first quarter of 2009 was of products manufactured with higher priced raw materials. The crucial question is now what comes next for MaterialScience business. Since visibility remains very low, any forecast obviously involves a high degree of uncertainty. So we have decided to give you a deeper insight than usual into our business so that you can form your own impressions.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at the monthly sales figures since October last year, we can see that after the low point reached in December business has stabilized at a very low level. On the right you can see the level of incoming orders from the main customer industries. Comparing April against January there has been a slight improvement in demand. It's obviously much too soon to speak of a tangible and sustainable recovery, and there is no doubt at all that 2009 will be a year of massive declines in sales and earnings at MaterialScience. But we do believe these figures back up our statement that the downturn appears to be bottoming out. We therefore expect MaterialScience to improve sales and underlying EBITDA in the second quarter compared with the first and to report positive underlying EBITDA for the full year.</p>
          <p>As we presented our annual figures in March, we told you about the new Group-wide working capital project. This project has been launched with the aim of reducing the cash tied up in working capital by more than &#x20AC;1 billion this year based on constant sales and prices. We are very pleased to report a substantial improvement in net cash flow. The significant reduction in cash tied up in working capital resulted in the 31% increase in net cash flow and 68% growth in the free operating cash flow. This had the effect of bringing down net financial debt by some 200 million despite the 200 million negative currency impact. This development is all the more gratifying because the Group tends to be cash absorbing in the first quarter and the first half due to seasonal variations in the Crop Protection business.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our main focus is safeguarding earnings for the long term. We don't intend to put our long-term earnings performance at risk in order to boost profits in the short term. That's why we are continuing to support the expansion of our sales organizations in the emerging markets, the launch of new products, and our research and development activities. We believe that those who adopt a long-term approach right now will come out of this crisis in a stronger position. Everything we are doing is based on this principle. We will therefore implement our account restructuring projects as planned.</p>
          <p>At MaterialScience we have raised the savings targets for the year to 200 million. We have identified an additional 50 million in cost actions. We adjusted our production output through extended maintenance and mothballing. In polycarbonates, 300 kt were mothballed in Q1. In TDI, 100 kt in Q4 of last year. And in MDI, 160 kt will be mothballed in the second quarter. We are developing further measures expected to be finalized in the second quarter of 2009. This is in addition to the restructuring plans announced under the river project in 2007.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures on plant, property and equipment will be further reduced from 1.5 to 1.4 billion. Our working capital projects are fully underway and expected to deliver a 1 billion improvement over 2008 as already mentioned. Based on the above, the full year outlook for net debt remains unchanged. Our goal is a reduction towards &#x20AC;10 billion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the first quarter has shown that because of the economic crisis it would now be unrealistic to speak of matching last year's earnings level, still less of improving upon it. Limiting the decline in Group EBITDA before special items to 5% is now an increasingly demanding goal, but it could still be achievable if there is a tangible recovery in the MaterialScience business. We hope to have a better understanding of the demand situation by the time our Meet Management conference takes place in June.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. My colleagues and I will now be pleased to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes from Sachin Jain. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Thanks for my questions. I've just got four HealthCare related questions. Firstly, on HealthCare sales guidance, while you've kept your above market growth, I think you've lowered your market growth outlook. So, could you just clarify what your expectation is for Consumer Health market growth this year and what visibility you believe you have on that at this stage? And second in terms of the 4% decline in Consumer Health in this quarter, could you just give us a bit of color on how much of that was underlying demand versus inventory work down? Thirdly, on the Xarelto, just wonder if you've got any confidence or color you could give us on the timely approval by the end of May, any color on whether FDA is still reviewing the analyst data at this stage <mark type="inaudible" />. And then finally on HealthCare margins, just color on mix for your 28% target. Is first quarter a reasonable run rate? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Arthur, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me, however, begin by reassuring you that as you heard from Werner, despite a softer first quarter we remain committed to our guidance, as you mentioned, of all businesses are going up above market and that we will achieve an EBITDA margin toward 28%. You were right obviously to identify that the significant change has been our market outlook and assumptions. And obviously we have some visibility in pharma because of IMS and their perspectives. So I start with pharma &#x2013; our original &#x2013; going into the year assumption with a 5 to 6% growth rate in pharma, along with other pharma companies projecting a 2 to 3% growth in pharma. For our other consumer businesses collectively we've probably started the year again with a 3 to 4% growth rate. And now we're expecting a 1 to 2% growth rate. And we expect as I mentioned to grow above those growth rates I think reasonably significantly.</p>
          <p>And then if I move on to your question on the consumer performance in the first quarter, again we would say that the &#x2013; not we would say &#x2013; we would point to the fact that the majority of the softness was in the U.S. If you look at our consumer business, it overall was minus 2% currency adjusted, but it was minus 12% in the U.S., with the rest of the world being plus 3. We believe the majority of that softness in the U.S. was inventory reductions as retail looked to cash and liquidity concerns.</p>
          <p>I can give you also some additional comfort that if we look at consumption data through the first 24 weeks to the end of March, we see our business performing better than the majority of our competitors have already I believe reported. We were flat in terms of consumption and the only sector who did better than us of course was not surprisingly own label. So we take some comfort from the fact that we believe much of the impact in January and February was related to inventory and take even more comfort from the fact that in March and April we've seen a slight recovery in our U.S. business. So I hope that gives you some color on our consumer business.</p>
          <p>As far as Xarelto is concerned we remain with our partner J&amp;J in constructive dialogue with the agency. We remain committed to our PDUFA date at the end of May, but I would remind you that the track record of the FDA in meeting PDUFA dates recently has not been good. But the dialogue is constructive and there's no issues that have been raised that we don't feel we can adequately answer.</p>
          <p>As to margins, again, I don't believe the first quarter is at all indicative of our margins for consumer. It's much more indicative of our margins for pharma. But consumer, we had three effects as you heard from Mr. Wenning in the first quarter. Again, the impact of the U.S. market, which is a high margin market, because of inventory destockings, so we had a mix effect. Then we also had the increased costs associated with our investment in emerging markets, which will remain, on the belief that it's a good investment. And certainly not insignificantly we had a transaction effect in cost of goods. This is particularly important in our diabetes business where we get the majority of our strips from Panasonic in Japan. So that impacted our first quarter. Going forward we expect to see a good improvement in margins. And let me also reassure you that we have in place contingency measures if we don't see the necessary improvement so that we will protect our bottom line in our consumer businesses. So I hope that answers your four questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Louella, can we have the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. The next question comes from Paul Major. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, it's Paul Major from Redburn Partners. Thanks for the detail provided on slide eight. I've just got a couple of questions regarding it. In order that we can understand it better could you give us a little bit of background about what might be the normal sequential progression of the business in a typical year in the sort of October to March period? And then in a similar theme to the previous questions, could you give us any color on to what extent this is due to supply chain restocking or reflective of end user demand in the different industry groups? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let's start first with the details of slide eight and the MaterialScience sales development, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Paul. As you know we do see some seasonality normally, but if I take month-by-month we would have normally expected to see November sales at or equivalent to October. So for us the drop from October to November was the significant change in the sales pattern last year. December we always rank as a slightly shorter month because of the construction holidays that take place over the Christmas period in most of the Northern Hemisphere. And so December would normally have been lower, but not by this amount. Normally we calculate on the basis of a 2.5 month volume &#x2013; roughly 2.5 months worth of sales in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a half month in December at worst. If you then look at January, January was hampered this year slightly by the seasonal effect of Chinese New Year. So it was a slightly shorter month in Asia. But February-March progression would normally be relatively stable during that period. There normally wouldn't be any significant difference. A slight difference in number of sales days but not dramatic. The March increase, therefore, we see as significant, and in fact if we look in our books for April we see a slightly higher prognosis than March. So directionally we think this shows what we have demonstrated, which is that we've bottomed out.</p>
          <p>The second part of your question was talking about the order inflow. And I think what you see there is a mixture of destocking effects and real demand effects. Certainly in the electronics industry in April we're seeing quite an increase in the demand for polycarbonates that go into things like laptops, which are mostly manufactured now in China. That's driven quite heavily by domestic demand in China, and in fact in some subsegments of that industry we're actually above last year as we go into April, for example polycarbonates that are used in the electronics industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The construction industry, you see something slightly different happening. And if you look at the numbers you see it's the only industry that is going in the wrong direction between January and April. And some of that reflects the fact that in January, February, March the construction industry hadn't been so dramatically affected by the turndown, as we were seeing projects reaching the end of their completion. So, a lot of the actual construction projects have finished using the insulation materials that we produce. And those construction projects are now finished, and of course now we're seeing a slightly further decline in the construction segment as the order books are slightly emptier in that part of the segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then perhaps just as a follow-up question, on a geographic basis, I mean it looks from your quarterly report that there's not really much difference in activity levels across your major geographies. Is that still the case now? Are you seeing a pickup more in one region than another?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you're right in your assertion about, the pain is equally felt in the major regions. The one exception or perhaps two exceptions we're seeing, one is domestic Chinese market has not been as dramatically hit and it is recovering much faster. So, when we look at the year-on-year sales volumes in the domestic Chinese market we see a relatively flat picture. And in fact we're seeing some growth in some segments, although the market is of course relatively small compared to the big North American and European markets. And also of course the Chinese economy hasn't suffered such a financial crisis and therefore consumer confidence is much higher in China. So the domestic spend there is holding up reasonably well and growing. The other market where we're seeing a similar pattern is in India, but, of course, that's a much smaller market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe you have still one question open in regard to the inventory adjustments mainly in U.S. &#x2013; others. It was only &#x2013; what that related to...</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Thomas Gilbert from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I've got a couple of questions as well. Just coming back to consumer healthcare, what do you expect relative to the downwards revised market costs? Sorry for the hair splitting, but do you include the bolt on acquisition in your gross assumptions of growing more than 1 to 2% for the full year? That's the first question. The second question is whether you can quantify the transactional impact of emerging market currencies on your EBIT in the first quarter, please. The third question is on the seeds business, obviously very strong, 19.7% local currency growth. Am I right, is that most of that was pricing but not volume, i.e., acreage? And the last question is coming back to MaterialScience, and I do apologize, maybe I'm asking the same question in a different way. If we build a bridge of EBITDA from Q1 '08 to Q1 '09, i.e., from the roughly 400 down to the 116, in that bridge what delta is due to idle facility costs and what delta is due to inventory write-downs? And will either of those recede in a way that allows you to be positive EBITDA already in the second quarter? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Okay, a couple of questions. I believe the easiest one is the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the easy one. No, that doesn't include bolt on acquisitions. So our outlook was for organic growth. And in terms of your effect on EBIT, we do the transaction in the quarter, it was &#x20AC;32 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is that what's for the Consumer Health business? And I was wondering what it was for the Bayer Group as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was for HealthCare. I'm sorry, I don't have....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're coming back to the Bayer Group a little bit later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For HealthCare, the transaction impact was &#x20AC;32 million in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>So before we are coming back to your second question, Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Berschauer will answer your question regarding seed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we had a very pleasing performance of our seed business. This was mainly driven by an excellent InVigor business, the canola business in Canada. We increased the prices in our seed business on average by 8%. That was basically your answer. And again the main effect is coming from our excellent performance of the canola business in Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the bridge in MaterialScience, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thomas, the numbers I think you're looking for as we bridge from the 400 down to the minus 116, roughly in volume effect that was a minus 340. On price there was a minus 124. And then in the raw material energy balance and cost of goods sold balance, there was 112 cost of goods readjustment coming from inventory. Then to answer the other part of your question in fixed costs, there were obviously some savings and some improvements in raw materials to get back to the 116. But there was 55 million of unabsorbed fixed costs in manufacturing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what do you think that bridge looks like into the second quarter? Will pricing year-over-year not be very tricky to get you back into positive territory already in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the assumption we're making is that there will be a slight recovery in volume as we've suggested and also in margins, as we get the full effect of the beneficial raw material cost rolling into the second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming back to your second question regard to the currency, Klaus K&#xFC;hn will answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for the first quarter on the Group level, you see really a huge diversion between the major currencies, dollar and yen and the other currencies. I will relate that to sales first. So, compared to previous year, the sales impact was on dollar and yen combined positive by 300 million and minus 140 million on the other currencies. That's on the sales side effect. So the overall sales effect was as Paul mentioned 160 million, which is 2% roughly, which Mr. Wenning mentioned. If we look at the clean EBITDA effect including hedges and everything we had a positive effect from the dollar and yen of 50 million and a negative effect in the transaction from the smaller currencies of minus 75, so overall minus 20 plus million.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Andreas Heine from UniCredit. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. My question refers first to the net working capital target. You referred that this is due to &#x2013; is based on constant volumes and constant prices. Obviously that is not the case in MaterialScience. Looking on what you have already achieved in the first quarter, how do you see the net working capital reduction especially in MaterialScience? And what would be the target if you put into consideration that sales and volumes are going down?</p>
          <p>And then I have one question regarding Nexavar. There seems to be a progression in the U.S. in Q4 but is not anymore the case in the U.S. Could you elucidate a little bit what is going on here?</p>
          <p>And very interesting was the strong growth of phosphi in the CropScience business. Is it already linked to LibertyLink, higher LibertyLink use in traits? And how do you see this going forward? Because I saw that the real jump only comes off 2010 when Monsanto comes with some Smart Stax, which as far as I know includes LibertyLink. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Nexavar, the Nexavar question, Arthur, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andreas, I think there's nothing I would read into the Nexavar performance in Q1. I think all products, all of our prescription products suffered a little bit from inventory de-stocking in the quarter. And you've also got to look from the quarter versus quarter year-over-year comparison that there was some sales in the U.S. related to some clinical trial material. So, we remain pleased with obviously our performance in the U.S. but even obviously more excited by our performance outside of the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And CropScience, well that's for Berschauer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are talking about glufosinate. We indeed have a significant increase of our trades; there are various reasons. One first of all is that &#x2013; and I mentioned it I think during our last call &#x2013; that glufosinate was under registration, so we had limited production capacities. The situation has now improved so we have some shift from Q4 last year to Q1 this year. And secondly we are indeed selling more Liberty for the GM crops in fields mainly in canola and in cotton in United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And now net working capital, Klaus K&#xFC;hn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. Heine, you are correct that we said that we want to improve the net working capital or the performance by roughly 1 billion adjusted for a change in the business and for the volume by roughly 1 billion. So the bulk let's say of the improvements in the first quarter came from BMS and low volumes, that was clear, but many of the measures will &#x2013; but also HealthCare currently has contributed here in the first quarter quite significantly to that improvement. And over the course of the year we will see and expect significant improvements here mainly on the inventory side, but we will also see the upside on the payable side. And if we go by contribution by the subgroup at the end on target and we are fully with all measures on line, the overall improvements will be roughly balanced throughout all the three subgroups. If the performance-related contribution is higher from CropScience and HealthCare than for MaterialScience.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions please. One on diabetes care. Could you talk about the market share dynamics you're experiencing, especially in the U.S.? As one of your major competitors seems to have returned to growth, so some idea of how that business is going to progress going forward and how you're seeing your market share would be great. And then secondly, on Nexavar, if you could remind us when we're expecting data for Nexavar in breast cancer and also when you will be taking the go/no-go decision to take Nexavar forward into Phase III in breast cancer. Those would be great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Arthur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Richard, again, you have to look at consumption to get a true picture of what's happening. And if we look at the U.S. market and if we combine quarter four and quarter one, we consistently see us performing above all of our competitors. So we believe we are gaining market share in the U.S. and I think we have seen some recovery in one of our competitors. But again, I think you got to look at it as a sustainable recovery. Certainly when we look at March &#x2013; sorry, certainly when we look at the fourth and first quarter together, there is no question that our business in the U.S., maybe globally, in diabetes care is significantly outperforming the market and our competitors. Clearly we are concerned by the softness in the U.S., which is not only a functional inventory, but also it would appear that patients are testing less frequently. But again, we take great comfort in fact, Richard, from the fact we are definitely not losing any market share and continue to be the fastest growing company. As regards breast, we expect to make the decision to move into Phase III by the end of this year. And obviously right about that time we'll update the marketplace in terms of the data that will either support or refute that go/no-go decision.</p>

          <p>China reimbursement, I don't think we expect that until 2010. The good news is that it's not hampering our ability to grow our business in China. We saw very strong first quarter growth in China. And we have a pretty ambitious full year where we would expect, you know, let's say a 50% plus growth in our market in China. And just to come back, the actual sale &#x2013; if you're looking for the sales split, ACC, RCC, it's currently 60% ACC, 40% RCC and I reiterate my comment that the majority, indeed almost all of the growth, is coming from liver.</p>

          <p>I would say not at all. And again maybe that's the difference between the U.S. and Europe. Europe predominantly, now predominantly is essentially a reimbursed market with the exception of the U.K. and NICE, but even in the U.K. we are getting reimbursement. So we've seen limited, if any, impact. And again if I look at our largest market in Europe, Germany, we're seeing very strong development of Nexavar. So long and short answer, no impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my question. First is on MaterialScience. Patrick, I take it from your comments you don't place much hope on recovery in the construction industry; is that correct? And second, I also take it from your comments that China/Asia is currently undergoing the most significant recovery. Looking at the western world, would you see a better sequential improvement in Q2 over Q1 in Europe or in North America? And then one question on CropScience, actually a clarification to Andreas' question, are you seeing early effects of the glufosinate joint venture from Monsanto or is that just a general glufosinate trend in the U.S.? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Christian. Your comment on the construction is an interesting one, because I think my comment is correct short-term but in the medium term most of the incentive packages that are being launched in the U.S. and in China are both pushing up the need for polyurethane construction materials. So because the lead time to those orders is quiet long following an incentive, because obviously you have to get the construction underway before you can start using our materials, and you have to do lot of design before that, the number of spade-ready projects in the construction industry are relatively few. And I see that as a benefit towards the end of this year and the beginning of next year on construction. So I think there will be a bit of a dip in construction and recovery. Your comments on China, I think that quarter two is where we'll see some sustained growth, certainly the April numbers would tend to support that. I think from what we can see of North America and Europe, we expect to see the both markets relatively flat.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As discussed in the earlier conference calls, we are extending all our capacity in terms of glufosinate, significantly due to the investment in Knapsack. This capacity will go on-stream mid of this year, and we are expecting significant higher volumes based on our agreements with the companies which I've mentioned. Though the effect we have seen so far is mainly based on, as discussed, based on cotton and canola, we are expecting again a significant increase of our business based on these agreements. But again we need the capacities available and this will be available beginning mid of this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A couple of follow-up questions actually please. Firstly about the Consumer Health, you gave some useful information regarding the margin impact of the transactional FX impact. Could you just possibly give a little bit more color on the other two margin impacts, ranking those, and if at all possible give us some idea of how you see the marketing spend developing over the coming quarters there? Secondly, more generally across the Group but specifically I suppose most importantly with regard to CropScience, the pricing increases that you refer to in the release of 4%, are those local currency pricing increases? And to what extend are they offsetting the FX weakness? I wonder if you could split that out, please. And then finally on MaterialScience, Patrick, your comment seems to rely on the drop in input costs coming through reasonably rapidly and for pricing not to accelerate downwards. Can you perhaps give a little bit more color on what visibility you have over those two components over the next quarter or two? Thank you.</p>

And again I want to mention that clearly the de-stocking in the U.S., which I described and showed you that we were down 12, 13% in the U.S. but black in consumption, clearly caught it a little bit by surprise and we could not adjust our PNI fast enough to address that. We are taking measures to better align our PNI; hence again we're pretty comfortable you will see this improvement in our margins going forward. And note the expense of sheer hoist because we're seeing all of our competitors having to respond to the same dynamic. So, we expect with every confidence you will see margin improvement in our consumer business as we go through the year.</p>

          <p>So our price increases on average 12% is based on the near-term CI increasing prices in the weak currency countries much more above the 12% of course. Otherwise we would not be able to run our business profitably, so it's very clear.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Input and pricing, Neil. I think what I would be looking at is a slight recovery in margin. I think it's incredibly difficult to forecast because what we're seeing is very, very high levels of volatility. We're actually seeing across the product range some prices staying constant across quarter one and quarter two and in other product ranges drops and increases. So we have almost a set of parameters which we've never really seen before. So very high levels of volatility is the key, very difficult to predict, and of course we've seen extremely high levels of volatility in contract and spot prices on all of our raw materials as well. So even forecasting what the final settlements will be a few days before has become very, very difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, that's sort of the impression that I'd sort of gathered, which is why I was slightly surprised that you proffered a full year outlook for MaterialScience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Neil, that's a fair observation. I think that what we have done is try to give our best view. There is obviously upside and downsides available to that view and the sizes of those, as you know, can be quite large. I think the one thing we are seeing is a bottoming out in terms of volume, and we've seen the effects of raw materials changing year-on-year. But I wouldn't rule out shocks on the raw material side as well.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jean De Watteville from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi, Jean De Watteville, Nomura, speaking. I'll start again on MaterialScience if I can. Two questions. Question number one, I know you're reducing capacity because of the low level of demand. Can you share with us your thoughts about permanent capacity closures and job reduction? Is that something that you are currently repairing, or what would be the trigger for you to take such action? Second question, again for MaterialScience and following up on Neil's question on pricing, we understand raw material prices are quite difficult to anticipate. But what about the systems? I mean, we all know that isocyanide prices went down, peptane oxide prices went down. Is there a lag effect? How does that work? Will we see lower prices for systems passing through the lower raw material prices? Just if you could elaborate on that, that would be very useful. And the third question is on CropScience. I just would like to know about &#x2013; we know that last year we had a very low level of inventories in the distribution chain, both for Bayer in terms of raw materials but also for the retailers. We know that Bayer's had quite increased inventories at the end of last year, and we know that demand is still quite good in Crop Protection sector overall. Can you just comment on where we stand right now on the inventory situation, both for Bayer and for the retailers in Crop Protection? Has that been recovered to normal levels at this level of time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let's start with the material side, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jean. I think if you &#x2013; as you've been following our mothballing story and reduced capacity story, you're correct to then get to the next stage, which is when you decide to make permanent changes, and that's something we would make in quarter two based upon on our current planning. Your question about systems pricing is always an interesting one. Systems prices usually lag the commodity prices in terms of what we are selling. That can be very segment-specific though. So for example in the footwear industry at the moment where systems price is under a lot of pressure, and we've seen them drop recently rapidly, but in some other segments we have seen almost zero change. So, it's very mix by industry segment in how dramatically industry segment is pushing back on price or rather just being concerned about order volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And CropScience, the inventory-related question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Inventory, internally as well as externally first of all, internally, we have collectively high inventories. We are expecting for 2010 and we already need to produce for 2010 a significant business growth because the fundamentals for our business are still very positive. Commodity prices are on a good level and we don't expect let's say a decrease in the commodity prices in the years to come. So we are in terms of our business in 2010 and years to come we are still positive.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of inventories at distribution level, one needs to understand the nature of our business. So in the Northern Hemisphere, what we are selling in the Northern Hemisphere in the first quarter is basically just we are delivering our distributors and they are selling the stuff of course to the farmer, so it's now very important. And so they have of course distribution in the first quarter the entire inventory. And they are shipping the product to the farmers and now of course it's of key importance that the products are really applied and the application of the products in our business, in Crop Protection, depends on commodity prices and we never should forget on the weather condition. So that's obviously the nature of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Can I just have a follow-up on the first question? Patrick, when you said the decision about permanent closures will be taken in Q2, is that depending on lack of recovery or you already have plans of announcements for a plan on capacity closures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's more driven by visibility than anything else. I think we have to see the April, May data before we really take a decision. When we take an asset completely out of the market that's a permanent decision. It's not one that you can reverse after one or two years. So mothballing is the order of the day at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay, so if no recovery by May, you will go in the second step basically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking my question. On HealthCare first of all to come back on Xarelto, could you please let us have an idea of the penetration in Europe of this product and the current indication and do you reiterate your guidance for 2009? Second question, on Kogenate, could you update the long-acting project on Kogenate? Is it still valid that we will have some interim data mid year? And the last point on YAZ generic in the U.S., could you comment on the Yaz generic version from Teva? You had some discussion with the company. And what is the risk there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start with Xarelto. We do reconfirm our guidance for the full year in the range of 20 to &#x20AC;30 million. Let me reiterate that from our perspective, Xarelto is on track with our expectations, but I would remind you of my previous comment that we are expecting modest sales in our initial indication of DVT. That's why the outlook is in the 20 to 30 million range. And I would remind you that the introduction of Xarelto in DVT prevention is really about pre-marketing. It's to sell, to build confidence, awareness to allow rapid rollout of our major commercial opportunities in DVT treatment, staph, ETS. The product for your information has been approved in 50 countries. Feedback remains positive and indeed only last week we received a positive recommendation from NICE, which confirmed that the product had both a positive clinical and cost-effectiveness benefit.</p>
          <p>As to your question on Kogenate liposomal, we are still on track to update you on that project by the end of 2009. And as to Teva, we are not commenting on any &#x2013; we're not in a position to comment on anything that Teva would do. We have an agreement obviously with Bayer and we believe that agreement will be honored by Teva.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. I really want to just to carry &#x2013; first of all carry on from Thomas Gilbert's question, which was Patrick, you'd indicated that there was a sort of a one-off effect from inventory of about 112. I don't know whether that was the case and so is it right in terms of EBIT? Can you hear me? Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the material side is it about 112 million of inventory write-down effect? Or did I misinterpret that? In other words was there some significant one-off factors which depressed the first quarter? Because in the subsequent answer you seemed to give the impression you were looking for a gradual improvement in the performance of the business in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So I just want to quantify if you like the one-off factors in the first quarter from the underlying performance. So that's the first one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the growth of CropScience in the USA was quite extraordinary, and perhaps if you could just give some details there on how sustainable that is in. And thirdly there was one response where you talked about the Consumer Health margins being below average but the overall HealthCare margins being kind of what you expect. In other words, the implication being that the Pharma margin was well above trend in the first quarter. And I wondered if that was the case, if that was what you were trying to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to start with your third question in regard to CropScience U.S. Klaus K&#xFC;hn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be wonderful if this excellent performance in the first quarter would be sustainable. This will most likely not happen. It just demonstrates that the mood in the industry is still good, that distribution is positive. And now again our overall performance for the full year in U.S. will very, very much depend on the aforementioned factors, which are &#x2013; one very important one is the weather conditions. And quite frankly in the U.S. presently, we still have very cold weather in the Midwest. And now it's important that the weather situation improves and the products can go into the ground. But again to make this very clear, this excellent performance in the first quarter most likely &#x2013; or it's unrealistic to believe that this will be sustainable. But I'm just pleased having this good start and we are positive that at the end of the year we'll have overall positive development in United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Andrew we're coming back to your first question about the one times in BMS in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me just clarify it for you, Andrew. As you can imagine there was an improvement in raw material pricing generally in quarter one. That was offset by 112 million of cost coming from quarter four inventories into cost of goods sold in quarter one. So that's a movement of quarter four to quarter one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not &#x2013; not on margins, no <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Andrew, I think your observation and assessment is correct. What we're saying is we had a weak margin performance in consumer that will improve and we're probably very much looking at the first quarter being what we would expect broadly for Pharma for the full year. So my comment was, if you do the math, you will see a very significant improvement in margin in Pharma quarter one versus quarter two &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; quarter one '08 versus quarter one '09. And that is not a trend and that was really what I was trying to guide again. We're very pleased with our margin performance in Pharma in the first quarter. We believe we can maintain that but the issue is not to use that as a base to project off. We're not going to see that improvement every quarter. And we do expect and I reiterate quarter-on-quarter performance on our consumer margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks, can I just quickly go back to the MaterialScience? I just want to &#x2013; you said there was 112 that offset other factors. But in that sense there wasn't an exceptionally large amount of one-off factors, so we shouldn't look for a significant margin improvement in the second quarter versus the first quarter because of those one-off factors. That's correct, is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's the right way of looking at it. Effectively what we were doing in quarter one was finishing off the consumption of high raw material prices from the end of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Andrew &#x2013; and it's basically the lag effect of the good stretches somewhat earlier and then go running through the P&amp;L. And so we still had higher price inventories from Q4 from the end of 2008 in the first quarter, and this will be reduced over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, a quick question on CropScience. The margin year-on-year for Q1, can you just talk me through why the modest reduction and equally can you talk me through why for the full year the guidance is as I can see it flat? So, where you see the improvement over the next three quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we had in the in the fourth quarter, in terms of EBITDA the major effect of impacting EBIT negatively was currency. It was exactly 7 million. The most important factor was cost of goods because we are just carrying the high raw material and energy prices from the year 2008 into the first quarter of 2009, and this effect was in the range of &#x20AC;44 million just in the first quarter. And then top of it, we increased our sales organization in U.S. and Latin America and India because we are expecting significant growth in these countries or regions in the years to come. But the major effect clearly was cost of goods, and we are expecting, and this is very logical that we will have a belief in cost of goods beginning of the second half of this year, but not in the second quarter.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I just have a few questions on the Crop Protection business. I was wondering if you could break out the volume versus price impact by category, so fungicide, herbicide and insecticide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, again overall, we had price increases by 4% and volume increased by 3% in the first quarter. And honestly we are not doing this analysis exactly formulation by formulation. It would be worthless more or less because we also have significant phasing from one quarter to the other one. So, we are seeing overall portfolio and sometimes we are of course combining offers in terms of our customers. So, this analysis basically makes in our business no sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. And then what are your people sort of on the ground and the distributors saying about those 4% price increases sticking? Are they seeing any pressure on that in the month of April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, maybe you have read the reports from our competitors' companies who reported first quarter. You can see there also what they've achieved in terms of pricing and that we are in a competitive situation. Overall we have been able to increase the prices and just demonstrate that that the ag industry is still overall in good shape, that farmers are earning money and so they are willing to invest, and they are willing to invest in high value product. So, the overall moods still is in our industry fortunately positive.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The last question comes from Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. My thoughts of three questions. First question, technical one, tax rate, 33%, obviously above the guidance of 28 to 30. I think you still stick to the guidance, but the point is obviously you've got &#x2013; low tax countries didn't deliver so much. Which countries actually we have to look for improving the tax rate? Can you a little bit elaborate? And why you believe tax rate will come down during the next quarter? And second question is on Bayer MaterialScience. Obviously if I look through the monthly phase development I think there is a mix shift between volume and prices, clearly prices started to drop more severely especially in  March, acting out some potentially volume improvement.</p>
          <p>If I look to some sales improvement in April that must mean by more falling prices, selling prices, that volume is getting even better. Can you a little bit comment on that mix shift and the price development, minus 5% actually for me, and price of course was a positive surprise for biomaterial science. I would have expected more. Should we be afraid of seeing much lower price in the second quarter? And the last question is once again to Bayer CropScience and price increases in Euro terms, you said 4%. Obviously on the Group basis in Crop Protection you didn't state any currency effect. So could you give us a number, price increases excluding currency, meaning in local currency, or is that also that 4%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, let's start with the tax-related question, Klaus K&#xFC;hn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, tax rate is higher. Our guidance was 28 to 30%. Probably will tend more towards the upper boundary of that range over the course of the year. As we mentioned the reason is for some of the countries with lower tax expenses, the main countries are here mainly that's Hong Kong and also Switzerland where we have regional headquarters for some of the businesses, for instance, also for BMS, who had to suffer. And that is the reason we think that terms might increase a little bit, one, due to let's say we see somewhat better performance of BMS in the rest of the year, and secondly also to some adjustments within maybe intercompany pricing. These are the reasons we see here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And BMS, in second quarter volume price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, it's quite complicated, but the 5% that you mentioned is of course year-on-year. So, that's comparing quarter 1 '08 with quarter 1 '09. If we look at it from quarter four to quarter one sequentially, then the price decline was closer to 11%, which is perhaps closer to the number you might have expected. If I look at the mix in the portfolio of that price effect, then it was dominated by the effect of TDI. TDI last year has been running very, very high in a very, very tight market before the decline. And the decline in TDI prices I think on average was close to 30% across quarter four to quarter one, just the price effect. So, on the other products, it was single digit to low double digit levels of decline, averaging out to 11%.</p>

          <p>So, would you expect a significant bigger drop in the second quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very, very difficult to estimate. We're seen some trying to going into the second quarter increasing and some reducing; it's a very mixed period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>CropScience, overall the impact of currencies on our global business is very limited. The top line lies &#x2013; the positive effects of U.S. dollar and yen, unfortunately has been offset by the weak currencies in, for example, in Eastern European countries as well as in U.K. So, the overall effect on top line was basically as small as nothing. And then in terms of EBITDA as mentioned, we had a negative effect of just 7 million. So, overall the currency effect in our business in CropScience in the first quarter has been minor.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Meaning the 4% price increases were also price increases in local currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because then you underperformed as an example Syngenta with twice as much price increases in local currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But one comment on Syngenta, if you have a detailed look on Syngenta they have glyphosate, where they have been able to increase prices significantly. So, if you take the glyphosate effect out it's some lower, but anyway, numbers are published and you can do your analysis.</p>
