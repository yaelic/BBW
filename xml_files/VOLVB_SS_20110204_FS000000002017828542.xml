          <p>Welcome to the Volvo Group Report on 2010 Operations Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to your host President and CEO, Leif Johansson you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning, and good afternoon, good evening perhaps to all of you and welcome to this conference call for the fourth quarter 2010.We have as we have done over the past couple of years, we have our CFO also in the room Mikael Bratt here and then we have business area leaders who will speak to their business areas respectively and we also have in the room IR people to follow-up any question that you may have.</p>
          <p>We will be making a presentation first and then we will take whatever questions you wish to make. Slides have been made available to you on our Internet site and let me start on slide two, the one that is headed Group Highlights. If you look at the fourth quarter, it turned out to be a very reasonable quarter. We had good operating income at 7.5%. We have discussed the detail over the day here, how 7.5% is related to the growth that we had, which was more than 25% and we'll be coming to that in as we speak about each different business areas.</p>
          <p>We had very good cash flow at SEK 15.1 billion for the quarter and SEK 19 billion for the full year. And the Board decided to reinstitute a dividend from zero last year to SEK 2.50, based on the earnings per share of above 5 crowns. But also of course, the much better balance sheet that we have this spring compared to last spring and perhaps also in that context, this spring a much, much better outlook than what we've had before.</p>
          <p>So all in all, the dividend then with those things in mind goes to the SEK 2.50. Business environment was changing and improving all over, perhaps most notably so in Europe and in North America. Europe is still a slightly scattered picture, the overall numbers come in to be quite positive, but is still a slightly scattered picture. North America on the other hand on the on-highway business and the trucks, but also in North America when it comes to construction equipment, we have seen real and significant improvement in demand; we've shared with you our order intake numbers there.</p>
          <p>Asia continues to be strong in both in India and China, and I should say that outside of Japan, which is still not heading in the right direction. South America again also continues to be quite strong with double-digit and then some increases in the demand.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide three says Volvo Group and then the different headlines there net sales and operating income, you saw net sales clocking in at SEK 73 billion for the quarter to SEK 65 billion for the full year, operating income then at SEK 5.5 billion for the quarter and SEK 18 billion for the full year and as you can see a fair amount of turnaround there in those numbers over the past year.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter if you look at the pie chart there, you can say that represents how the Group geographically is divided. You see North America and Western Europe actually if you would compare that slide to the third quarter having gained in slightly; that's really on the strengths of North America and Western Europe, now coming back up and we &#x2013; it's still fair to say off of very low numbers and still not into the long-term trend lines. But we are coming into better times both in North America and Western Europe.</p>
          <p>At the same time, it's rewarding to see then that Eastern Europe for example grew by 48%. South America, Asia, as we have commented on before, did very well too. On the mix side, it's important to recognize and when we &#x2013; as we are now selling many new products, new trucks, new equipment of course, we have lower margins on those than we had when we sell mainly a mix of spare parts and services. And therefore, from a sales point of view, sales goes up but the margins say, dilutive effect because &#x2013; I wouldn't even want to call it a dilutive effect, there is an effect there. When we sell new products they in turn of course come out and become vehicles and equipments that will again pull with them spare parts for many years to come.</p>
          <p>Operating income there on the base of the increased volumes, improved capacity utilization, good cost control. If you do the calculation of adding over the year, sales and administrative cost and research and development, you can say they have gone up very, very marginally while we have increased year-on-year sales here by 25%, 30%. So all in all, good cost control there and we will speak the different business areas as we come in there.</p>
          <p>Before that, let's make a couple of different points Mikael. Mikael Bratt, our CFO on the financial side of the business and slide four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Slide four. Thank you, Leif. Continued focus and good control of our operation expense have resulted in what you see on the slide. Sales up 25% while only the operation expenses have gone up 3%. So we'd focus on cost control here and continuous efforts to identify cost reductions to offset volume growth here in the cost side will of course continue. And I would say that we have a good control process to manage the upturn now and reviewing all the upcoming projects within the administrative area for example. So, I feel comfortable for the future there.</p>
          <p>Let's move on down to page five, which has been very much of part of the topics for the day today. We have put together for you here the same kind of disclosure we did in the third quarter. I will not intend to go through all the details here unless you have questions later on here. But I think the key point here is really that the underlying currency impact is limited, I would say and the big impact comes really from the hedges that are reevaluated on a quarterly basis here.</p>
          <p>With the old GAAP of accounting I would say the result would have been SEK 65 million effect from currency, which is SEK 137 million net roughly SEK 72 million out of the SEK 269 million that is really related to what you see on the top half there. What we will do from 1st of January 2011 is to apply that the way of thinking towards the business area and that's what you see on the last point on the right hand side here.</p>
          <p>So we will allocate the portion of the hedge book that is related to the receivables and payables that are already on the balance sheet there. So we will have a more complete hedge and a currency effect in the in the business area are fully reflected there. So that's the change from the first of January.</p>
          <p>Moving on down to page six, here we have also put together for your information then our net currency flows, which are for the main currencies here for U.S. dollar count, euro and Canadian dollar, but also now the Japanese yen as we have grown significantly there during last couple of years here. Let me point out maybe there that what you see in the net flows for dollars and euros is a little bit on the lower side compared to normal years, but pretty much you get the right picture here when you look at the net effect here.</p>
          <p>So all in all, currency effect has a limited impact on the Group on the running basis here. And our ambition there is to drive towards natural hedges here and try to get a very well-balanced currency flow inside the Group here. This information can also always be found in the annual report for reference back in time.</p>
          <p>So let's now leave the currency and move into cash flow on page seven, and what you see there is the cash conversion cycle and I'm happy to report here that we have now reached a point where we have the lowest ever cash conversion cycle &#x2013; 27 days &#x2013; and that's the result of first of all good focus on the inventory development and we have managed to keep the number of days and inventory at also historical low I would say, and we also are getting back when it comes on trade payables here.</p>
          <p>So, they are the main contributors here and also here we have the ambition to improve further, and we have talked before about the 20 day target on overall cash conversion cycle here.</p>
          <p>Page eight, the next slide is then showing the net effect here of the improved working capital situation, as well as the improved profitability throughout the year here. And we can also here report a record strong year actually on the rolling 12 months, SEK 19 billion for the full year and also a very strong quarter, with the SEK 15.1 billion in here.</p>
          <p>Finally, then page nine, we have now back on the right side of the 14% net debt to equity ratio which has been and is our ambition to be on, very strong recovery from the peak of more than 80% and so very improved net debt position here. Despite I would say the headwinds we have actually got here from currencies, as you see through the quarter with close to SEK 1 billion here. So good cost control and a lot of good work within the working capital area has then resulted in this situation here.</p>
          <p>Looking forward here, I would say, we will have the traditional seasonal effects when it comes to cash flow here in the first quarter. And so I want to remind you again here that Q1 and Q3 are the weaker cash flow quarters in the year and we have the quarter one in front of us here.</p>
          <p>So I think I will stop there and hand over back to Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good thank you Mikael. Let's go to Trucks then on page 10 and there you can see very good sales development there up by 34%, if we adjust for currencies had an operating margin which is 0.7% better than Q3. And of course &#x2013; well it is almost 10% better than Q4 '09, which certainly was an unpleasant quarter.</p>
          <p>Q4 '10 then we saw improving demand in market condition as you say everywhere when it comes to improving demand except Japan and generally in market conditions and the way that we have now come through most of the issues around having inventories in markets or for that matter used trucks, an abundance of used trucks in there, so you have to say much more normal market conditions in most of the &#x2013; all of the geographies almost.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; when we look at the order intake we will go into details on that but we see continued increase and that puts us into couple of next quarters here with production ramp up as we did in the ramp up in quarter four. And of course when you ramp up as quickly as we have with 34% up year-on-year, then we bring in new people. We need to train them for a couple of weeks before they are really productive.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, with the roller coaster that we have been through, so has the whole of the supply system, which means that they too are brining people in, suppliers too are bringing people in and trying to get up to the speed that we're requesting from them now. And every once or so, they cannot deliver what we need. And we need to go retrofit or in some cases, even not be able to build on the normal days, but it will have come to comeback here on weekends and things like that.</p>
          <p>Those are the types of productivity issues that you can encounter in an upturn as deep as the one that we are in here, and frankly which we would be probably see also in Q1 and Q2 as we come along here. Of course each level gets productive, but then when you come into the next level that in turn creates a little on the leverage side, slightly less leverage than if everyone was productive from day one.</p>
          <p>We also have &#x2013; as you remember we took a decision to continue to invest in R&amp;D, up <mark type="inaudible" /> points of about 13 million on the Group level and we have a number of product introductions ahead of us. And we think of course that those will represent very interesting and competitive new products as we roll them out over the next couple of years in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide 11, which is net order intake then. There you see some very good numbers, if you look towards the bottom of that page you see Q4-on-Q4 up 63% and even Q3-on-Q4 up 22% driven by as you can see a strong Europe. If you look at North America, North America is now once again as they should be bigger than South America, but South America continues to grow there and then we have Asia also continuing to grow, again with the exception of Japan and other markets.</p>
          <p>If you look at that slide you can see the gradient towards the end there is actually picking up, improving rather than leveling off. That's because Europe and North America is coming on so strongly and then the other markets remain at high growth rates.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 12, there you have the heavy duty truck markets in Europe, which is Europe 29 then and we earlier said that that was above 200,000 units, now we are another 10% up and saying 220,000, and as you can see even with 220,000 we are well below historic trend or trend lines being represented by the dotted line there in the middle. And of course, what happens here is that when even though we think of this as a good growth rates or even high growth rates, it means that we went down very far as you can see on that slide. And we are coming into what could be characterized in '11 and possibly '12 as more normal market conditions and far off top cycles yet.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide 13, there you see the heavy-duty truck market in North America. And you can see all the way on the roller-coaster there from 325 at the emission legislation driven peak and then all the way down. And in 2010, we ended up at 142,000 where I should say in line with our projection. Now we were saying last time we met that it would be above 200,000 and now we are even firming that up to 220,000. And Dennis Slagle who is our North American Truck President even made the point that it might come higher than that. We just multiply the last couple of months order intake any which way we think now, we are upping that forecast of North America into 220,000.</p>
          <p>Good development on the overall truck markets both in Europe and in North America, and I should say as Dennis showed at the press conference, also in the case of North America and that's both actually true in Europe, we are also gaining share in that increasing market.</p>
          <p>With that let's slip slides to slide 14 and go to construction equipment and Olof Persson our head of Construction Equipment. Olof.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. We'll now start with the market, I am looking into the Q4, it was &#x2013; the world market up 31%. Good to see and I have been talking about North America as having a lot of positive signs in terms of spare parts and utilization, and fleet utilization with rental and so on and so forth. And we now start to see that those are coming into the order intake and also into sales. It's good to see that in the quarter 31% upward trend in the North American market.</p>
          <p>Also interesting I think to note on the Q4 market is the uptick on the road machinery, 45% up in the quarter, which is of course good news for us because of our new and very good position in the road machinery segment after acquisitions of &#x2013; that we have made over the last year. If we then look at the total year we're talking about the 44% up. Financials then, Q4, good revenue growth, 51% if you FX adjust quarter-over-quarter and the margin Q4 best ever at 12% operating.</p>
          <p>Our capacity utilization went up 63% in the quarter compared to 32% last year and 69% Q3. So we are ramping up our production and we're looking at further increasing production output in the quarters to come. If we've done some 2010 a little bit, it was an all time high in revenues, earning operating margins and we actually sold 66,000 units. The pricing environment managed and it has been brought as stable there. I've talked about that before. We have an average full-year price registration of 2%, if you take an average of all regions, all models. And we also have that moved quite substantively in productivity, we are now basically producing seven machines per year and blue collar worker in 2010 compared to 2008 where we had in the range of four machines per year and blue collar worker.</p>
          <p>If you look out in 2011 and the market outlook, we are fairly optimistic; the market is we believe in a growth mode, all of the major markets around the world. And you have the numbers in the report with North America up 20% to 30%, Europe up 10% to 20% and then the rest of the markets somewhere between 5% and 15%. And when I look at order intake in January this year we see a supporting trend to those numbers as I just described. When it comes to in focus, I would say that the <mark type="inaudible" /> has taken place. It's a successful launch we have gone from introduction volumes in 2010 and we would now have ramp up volumes in 2011 and then we will have the full volumes coming back in on 2011 and then going full speed into 2012.</p>
          <p>Another important focus area is of course the introduction of the Tier 4i with IIIB engine that is now rolling out. All is according to plan, production was started up in the beginning of January and we're now starting to deliver the first machines to customers and that would be then put in use during end of Q1, coming into Q2 and that Leif was the report from VCE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. That takes us to Buses, and H&#xE5;kan Karlsson and we have page 15 to support that presentation. H&#xE5;kan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. In Buses, the market in North America and Europe had a negative development during 2010. And we are traditionally six to eight months behind our truck orders. So hopefully for 2011, we will seen to end in the second half of 2011 an upturn in North America and maybe not in Europe where we see still a flat market going forward.</p>
          <p>Despite the weak markets in North America and Europe, we delivered a decent quarter with sales of SEK 5.6 billion, which make the total sales of 2010 about SEK 20 billion and that is a record for Volvo Buses, the best level ever so far.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we had a good order intake and that has resulted then in an increased order bank plus 26% compared to 2010. So we are moving into 2011 with a slight higher order bank than last year. Despite the flat sales, our profit increased during the fourth quarter up to an operating margin of 3.9% and that is also the total operating margin for 2010, which gives us a fairly good leverage, compared to 2009 in the range of 50%, 55%.</p>
          <p>We also have a good cash flow during 2010. And the result improvement comes mainly from then the better market mix and the successful delivery of our global turnaround program that we have around now during 2008 up to 2010.</p>
          <p>In focus going forward is still to secure some tenders and orders in North America and Europe, which are still in a tough market conditions. We continue to work hard to improve our profit margins, to improve cost and capital efficiency. And now we have to get another level of that because we have to counteract then the negative currency that we have in front of us. But we have also included in our programs now a focus on profitable growth to capture our investment that we have done in the past, but to also to capture the market potential going forward.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we introduced our new inter-city product range and in combination with that we make some major changes in our Polish factory and that will gain significant improvement of the production efficiency.</p>
          <p>In India, we invest in doubling our capacity to meet the increasing demand for Volvo products in India and that investment will come in place during the next coming quarters.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we're looking forward for 2011 and hope that we can see some improvement of the markets especially then in North America and Europe, and that was the report from Buses. Leif.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's with that go to slide 16, Volvo Penta and the leader of Volvo Penta, G&#xF6;ran Gummeson. G&#xF6;ran?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Yeah, we have seen the world market for Marine engines continues to be weak during the fourth quarter. This has actually gone on now for quite sometime. On the contrary, on the industrial engine side, we have a strong demand and we have seen a good growth in all our main markets, so in global markets I mean that. The strong momentum we have on the industrial engine side that also actually follows the balanced strategy we have within Volvo Penta has helped us then to compensate for the weak Marine development.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, our industrial sales had a share of close to 50% of our total turnover actually. The order book at the year-end was 70% higher than last year and lately, we have seen the Marine engine part of the order book actually growing again. After seeing this from the first boat shows <mark type="inaudible" /> in Europe and Toronto for instance in Canada indicates also so far that there is a positive momentum and interest demand potential boat buyers.</p>
          <p>The focus to grow our share of the global Marine Engine business will be intensified. We have a very competitive product range that will give us a good opportunity to gain market shares and capitalize on increasing demand in the global Marine markets. We see a good growth potential in the Yacht segment and we will focus our sales efforts around our IPS systems and its advantages.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, capital efficiency is high on the agenda in order to maintain a positive cash flow. And then during the fourth quarter, Volvo Penta we signed also an agreement with Yamaha Motors in Japan regarding a technology cooperation around advanced boat control system. Yamaha Motors is the world leader in the outboard engine business. And as you know, we are a world leader when it comes to in inboard and stern drive power systems, which means that our products are actually complementary.</p>
          <p>This agreement forms a strong alliance in the Marine sector. And will offer both our companies good opportunities in many areas of cooperation. That's Volvo Penta. Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good and that takes us to Staffan Zackrisson, the head of Volvo Aero on slide 17.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Leif. The demand for air transport is very strong, it's up 8% and that's on a level that are already on pre-crisis for air transport. If you look on the company sales side, and we take away the FX effect and the divestiture of Bus and look on the underlying business growth quarter-on-quarter is 14%. And what is especially positive is demand for spare part sales, which increased and I'll point out that fourth quarter is usually the strongest one for spare parts. This was after eight quarters with the downward trend on spares.</p>
          <p>Also this is very good profit margin for Volvo Aero. It's double digit margin for the second time on quarter and we had an operating income of 282. In the market, which is very important for us is that the Airbus has launched its new aircraft, Airbus A320 NEO. This is the best selling aircraft in the industry and it's going to be offered with two engines options and we are intending to participate in the future in this program, and it's going to be entering to service 2016.</p>
          <p>What we focus on is the productivity and we are in the middle of our five-year program for improvement and to keep on working on the cost side and to balance out the increase of sales to get that productivity gain in the company. Also since there are so many programs like the Airbus 320, there is an execution on new contracts that is in focus on the product developments and there are going to be a number of new aircrafts introduced into the market now. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>That takes us to slide 18. We have Marty Weissburg, our Head of Financial Services. Marty?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Positive trends continued through the fourth quarter in our customer finance business. New financing volume for Volvo Group customers was SEK 10.7 billion in the fourth quarter and that's an increase of over 50% versus the fourth quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>Operating income for the quarter was SEK 98 million, still not at satisfactory levels, but improving, and the improvement over the prior year quarter driven mainly by lower credit provision expense.</p>
          <p>To touch on some highlights, after many quarters in a row of a reduction or shrinking in our portfolio size, we had in the fourth quarter net portfolio growth and this was net growth in all of our regions around the globe. This is an important trend shift to an increase in our net earning assets globally. This comes from continued control growth in Brazil and China, but it's also good to see North America and greater Europe that they had returned also to portfolio growth.</p>
          <p>The strong new business that we booked in the fourth quarter and the resultant return to portfolio growth is driven by of course strong new unit sales by the Group as a whole, but also strengthening of customer credit profiles and targeted increases in our penetration of financing in markets where we provide financial services.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter also demonstrated continued improvement in customer repayment trends. And this is again the case in all of our regions around the globe. Account delinquency statistics are in the best condition since mid-2008.</p>
          <p>Solid performance also continued in our BRIC markets. And this is not just the good new volume and portfolio growth as already mentioned, but also stronger portfolio performance in both Brazil and China as these markets continue to grow and I would add good improvements in Russia. So, positive trends in these important emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In focus remains operating leverage and operational leverage. Strong global operating platforms, good cost controls put in place through the downturn, which continue, and some efficiency gains should continue to provide us with lift and enhanced operating leverage as we continue to grow.</p>
          <p>In terms of competitive landscape, of course, as the markets continue to firm, more competitors, especially banks, are returning, seeking to providing financing to Volvo Group customers. This is not a surprise of course given again that customer credit profiles have strengthened and given that there is ample liquidity in most of the markets where we provide financial services.</p>
          <p>On the positive side however, this aids our ability to syndicate parts of our portfolio to other financial institutions and this syndication remains an important part of our commercial and risk management strategy.</p>
          <p>Lastly business cycle management, of course in financial services, we offer customer repayment terms of three, four, five years. And so, we are mindful not just of current conditions, but also remaining prepared for eventual market corrections. We're always in a state of preparation and on watch for this. And again the business cycle management also means upturn management, and we see many good opportunities to provide financing to both existing and new Volvo Group customers as the quarters and the year moves on. That's the report from financial services.</p>

          <p>Good. Click with me please to slide 19, and I'll make a short summary there before we open up the Q&amp;A session. You see earnings per share is at SEK 5.36, SEK 1.59 billion in the quarter and cash flow at SEK 15 billion for the quarter and SEK 19 billion for the full year; 29% up quarter-on-quarter operating efficiencies in focus as we ramp up, we think we can do that quite well, proposed dividend of SEK 2.50 and then good R&amp;D investments, future oriented R&amp;D investments that we kept spending during the crisis and with that we think that we have a good rollout over the next couple of years of also exciting and competitive products.</p>
          <p>And operator with that let me switch over to Q&amp;A mode, and take any questions that we may have.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. I'd like to ask three questions please. Leif, I was hoping you could perhaps provide us with your ideas of where the biggest structural opportunity lies for the new CEO? And two questions for you Mikael, one you highlighted on your slides that you can still reduce your cash conversion cycle to 20 days from 27 days, is there any area where you could specifically reduce this going forward? And number two, normally in the annual report you provided the unrealized pension losses and bus service cost. Last year, I imagined, I remember this was about SEK 9.5 billion, where are you now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me start, I think it's too early to give good advices as a new CEO since we don't even know who he or she might be, but let me tell you what I will be telling them. I will say that I think the Group has very good positions geographically, but we have good opportunities to continue to grow geographically especially out in Asia. I think there is good reason to make those investments now and I think, we have a good position in many of those companies across different business areas where we can do that. Likewise, I would probably argue that we could expand the product range further within the definition of what we have as business areas today. I'm not arguing for any more business areas, I won't be arguing for any more business areas, but I think we can widen the product range a little like we did with FMX on the Volvo Truck side, go after segments of markets where we are relatively underperforming and in even medium-duty trucks, medium-duty engines and what have you.</p>
          <p>Then on the operational side, I think things never get ready that we have considerable still opportunities on creating a combined strength across the Group on different product ranges and with Powertrain and engines in the middle there. And when I look to the opportunities that we have there they are still quite big. So, I think the new CEO will have his or her hands very full and hopefully they will do a much better job than I have. But it's too early to say now. They will come in somewhere in the second quarter, so I don't know. Mikael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with a cash conversion cycle question there, and it's of course so that it's not a single thing that will take out the remaining days here to reach the 20. It's a lot of hard work in all areas, I believe certainly that the biggest opportunities lies within inventory management in order to secure the whole supply chain internally here is managed as efficient as possible. So I think that we have a couple of days to gain on the payables side. We are not yet back to the days outstanding there, which we were having &#x2013; which we had before the crisis here, so there you have a couple of days to be made. So, I would say it's all over the working capital side what we need to focus on. So, and there is no single stroke that will solve the gap here, but lots of hard work.</p>
          <p>There is another question on pension here. We have seen improved situation on the post employment benefits compared to last year. We, I would say, have obligations coming down a little bit to discount rates a bit and we have also seen a good performance of that maybe flattish or slightly improved on the plan assets that we have. So, the unrecognized gains, losses have come down a little bit here with about SEK 2 billion. So the cost for unrecognized gains and losses will be lower than past year. So I think, we have disclosed also how much there, so during 2010 we had SEK 416 million being amortized over the full year. So it will be slightly lower than that, I think you should expect around SEK300 million.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Frederic Stahl from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hi, good afternoon gentlemen, it's Frederic here at UBS. I think the first one just relates, I was wondering on Japan, the market is still on a very low level and I was wondering if you guys could a bit closer to that market can provide us a bit &#x2013; more color on what the situation is in terms of fleet age, and what you're seeing, where are they in the replacement cycle, spare part sales, et cetera, to get us a feel for how long can that market stay low before it's forced up by replacements? And then secondly, I have a question on the tax rate, which is I guess for Mikael. It was lower in the quarter, 24% I think. So has there been a change there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, Frederic. I'll ask Mikael Bratt to answer your question on Japan too. He just came home from a visit there. And I think he's well updated. Mikael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And yeah, the Japanese market business is as you said, extremely low here, and also with historical measurements. The fleet age is certainly so that is on the high end there and the replacement cycle should have an impact here now. And our expectations here for next year is that we would see an increase in demand here. We ended up the year on 39,000. I think we're looking at closer to 50,000 plus here for next year here.</p>
          <p>So an improved market conditions in Europe (sic) [Japan] . I would say on that aftermarket side, we have a stable and good business in Japan there. We have probably one of the most interesting set-ups in the world there actually where you have mandatory service checkups twice a year there on the vehicles, which of course gives a good aftermarket business for us there, so very interesting market from [inaudible].</p>
          <p>On the tax rate side, I would say that the tax rate we saw in this quarter is not what you should expect going forward. We had a few one-time positive effects, no big ones, I would say. There is the different things that have impacted positively with I would say 0.5 percentage points in different locations around the world here. We still guide you towards around 30% tax rate and we maintain that guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Peter Testa from One Investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Peter Testa. Thank you. I had a couple of questions please on productivity. You gave us a very useful statistics in Construction Equipment on productivity. I was wondering if you were able to help us get to the bottom of the truck productivity during the ramp-up phase, so maybe if you have a similar number for trucks in Q4 compared to the average for the year or an average over a period you would choose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Leif here. No I don't have a similar catch-all number. No, I am &#x2013; I'm trying to say something intelligent here that would catch, you can say the mix of medium-duty trucks. The fact that we are producing sometimes you can say a standardized Euro haulers, which are probably the closest to standard truck that we are making, while at the same time we were making logging trucks for very heavy application in forestry and things like that.</p>
          <p>So I don't have a catch-all number and I'm not so sure that it would be a meaningful statistic actually if you look at it, you would have to make it very even and it would be very sensitive to mix changes. But I can confirm that productivity you can see that on the operating leverage over the whole of the year of course with the volume is going up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and there was &#x2013; one you mentioned especially this morning's meeting retrofitting a number of times, which implies supplier challenges have also been a factor. I was wondering if you felt based upon your conversations with suppliers that the supplier disruption effect would be waning now in Q1 and Q2 or that would still be running at similar high-level as in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they will be waning when it comes to the plateau that we have now reached. And they are of course very different: if we lack a important bearing in an engine then even the engine won't get make and we can't build the product around it, and that has dire consequences and we will have to run large parts of our production systems Saturdays and Sundays to compensate for that. If it's outside rear mirrors we can go out on the order and retrofit them at very little cost. So it's therefore it's so difficult to give you any numbers on what will be the effect.</p>
          <p>My impression is that altogether and let me make emphasis on that we are not critical of our suppliers there, they've gone through the same rollercoaster that we have. We don't think that they have industrial capacity restraints, that they would need big investments to come out of, but what they had the same problem that we do, they need to bring people in, they need to train them, and they need to get products out of the door in-line for us to put them on to our trucks or equipments on the assembly lines here.</p>
          <p>So, I think you can say we expect this level that we have now reached to be fine. But of course, we are increasing our production rates again in quarter one and quarter two, and we can't expect that at that increase you can say we will have immediate productivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering whether you're finding your suppliers were catching up quickly and quick enough to make these issues sort of less of an issue as you go into the first half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think they are catching up and I take off my hat for many of them, how much they have contributed here. But, I can't escape the fact that we had shortages of components on the upturn in quarter four. And frankly, if you ask me I would say the risks are high that we will have that also in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question is just on Construction Equipment where you're seeing signs in North America and maybe even Europe of a pickup and just wondered the extend to which you feel that your supply chain in your own organization, say, is more prepared since you have the business already in a good running &#x2013; a run-up rate throughout 2010 to deal with this challenge on a productivity basis in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is something that we monitor very closely. It is of course a situation we need to manage, but the plans we have and if you look at order intake and the production plans, both internally in our own factories as you can see, we're running on a 63% average capacity utilization. So we have capacity there, but also with the suppliers and we are &#x2013; what we can see right now, so far so good. We are basically in line with the production ramp ups as we plan for the quarters to come and the line up of the suppliers. But again, it needs to be managed, it needs to be worked on all the time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly just a comment on foreign exchange. If it's possible to present your foreign exchange impact segregating balance sheet, i.e., receivables and payables items versus P&amp;L items in the future, just so we have clarity and save lots of questions, that would be great?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. We dramatically increased disclosure between Q3 and Q4. And I hear that you are very satisfied with that and you are encouraging us to do even more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm encouraging just if you can summarize it that way, because there are lots of individual items, which are very helpful to see, but just to make it easier to count for everybody, because it's been so confusing to some. Thank you very much, though, for the disclosure.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Laura Lembke from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I've got three questions please. First one is a follow-up on the productivity question asked early on. And you mentioned that obviously your production rates in Q1 and Q2 could or will likely be impacted still by the ramp up and also some bottlenecks at the supplier. So my question is do you think you can actually make up for that in the second half of the year, or do you think this is a delay in productivity that will actually reach into 2012? Second question is on China construction equipment, what are your expectations for demand and pricing especially on the wheel loader side given that you're still in a ramp up phase with your excavator products at Lingong? And then lastly on CapEx, how do you see this position developing going forward? And, do you feel that you have enough capacity on the engine side to actually deal with sharp increase in demand? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the first question there on &#x2013; what we call production disturbances of productivity, I think the same reasoning that I had on the other past question here is that, when you reach a plateau, then in general you can expect good productivity from a stable situation. And what we are really discussing here, you're looking at a Group that has increased its output by 30% quarter four on quarter four and that we're really discussing the leverage on the extra that has come up. And then we're saying we've had some production and productivity impact on that. But of course, you can say, we have done the 30% up &#x2013; ramp up here and we've done that, we feel reasonably well. I think everything the same and everything equal, which as you know Laura usually doesn't happen, but everything the same, if we are stable on production volumes and we don't continue to ramp up, then I think you could assume that we should come into a more stable productivity and setup you can say. If we are still ramping up in quarter three and quarter four, then of course, you will have these issues. People who come in and go in a factory on Monday morning aren't productive that first Monday morning. We will need to train them three or four weeks to make them really productive. You can't get away from that. So, if we're still ramping up and hiring people and our suppliers are too, then you will see these effects on the ramp up part of what we do, of course not on the plateau that we have reached in quarters earlier or the weeks before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I maybe ask a question on that again? How do you then feel you are equipped in terms of staffing right now? Do you think you have now hired enough people to reach a relatively good level of productivity once these people have been trained or do you think we will see a lot more hiring going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you &#x2013; as you can see on the improvement in our order intake, which is if I remember now 22% quarter three on quarter four, it means that we will increase production again in quarter one and most likely in quarter two and for that we will need more people. So we are still in a hiring mode in that sense. So, on that extra volume, you can say that that sort of comes up, we will need these training weeks. And potentially also we will have disturbances from our suppliers, that's what we were saying. But we are happy that we have reached these levels where we are now and that we are &#x2013; that we have a reasonable activity on those.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx side on the engine side, I think, it's fair to say that if the markets continue as they are now and I think, I said this in the quarter three conference call, in the best of all worlds, it would be good to see India, China, and Brazil not coming down, but lessening their growth rates. It might be good also from an overheat or inflationary point of view, but it would be good from our point of view. Now, that's not happening and that means that most likely somewhere during this year, if North America and Western Europe continues to come up then we will have to look at capacities for engines and possibly gear boxes and possibly axles on the construction equipment side again for capacities to come in '12 and '13 perhaps. That's decisions that will need to be made if relevant to be made in the later half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And regarding China and the market development, I would say the general consensus looking at the China market is that the excavator market will continue to grow on a steady pace over 2011, whereas the wheel loader market will grow, but at a slower pace, and that's our base scenario also as we look at the volumes into 2011 going back to issue about the Lingong ramp up and the Lingong wheel loader situation. We should also remember that Lingong <mark type="inaudible" /> has over the year in 2010 captured market share in the wheel loader market per se. So you have an effect there are also coming in from 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Firstly, thank you for the extra disclosure on FX and I'm pleased to see you are going to be changing the way you report it in 2011, it strikes me as being a much better solution. I was just wondering if you could help us a bit with the impact from Q4 from a divisional basis, would it be right to assume that most of the items you are referring to are for construction equipment and therefore on the new 2011 basis, you had reported a lower margin in construction equipment in Q4? And then secondly, I was hoping for some help to understanding was happened to get Penta. You had some productions, technical problems in Q3, which I assume had not recurred. The margin was still, I felt, quite weak in Q4. I know it's &#x2013; there's some adverse mix and Q4 is normally a weaker quarter. But could you just help us understand the impact of those issues and whether you have already seen the end of the problems you had in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I think Mikael, do you want to speak to currency status, your favorite subject.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not breaking down the currency effect per business area here, but as I said before of course, this is more I shouldn't say sensitive, but has a bigger portion of currency exposure than most of our other business areas. Aero is also of course dependent on the dollar due to their business model and for the rest I would say it's fairly even distributed here depending on what kind of impact you have on the Group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Japanese yen, yes. Of course, as we're growing in the world here and becoming more and more global, I would say more kind of different currency payers is coming up here. So I'm of course quite general in what I'm saying here, but on a Group level in absolute amount, it's to see that has that impact. But of course, all the business areas are operating globally and so they have their fair share of currency impacts of course.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, regarding the production disturbances we had during the third quarter, they are over with and done so to say. We had some delays in quarter four, but minor delays due to that. And I think, you talked about the margins also and coming back to that traditionally, we have a weaker margin during quarter four and that we have had for many, many years and that's a seasonal effect we see due to the customer and product mix. So it's a natural situation for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Yann Benhamou from Exane. First question to assess what could come from the earnings win in the U.S.? Could you confirm that you are still losing money in the U.S. in 2010 for trucks? And do you expect the shift towards vertical integration to lead to similar margins in the U.S. compared to what you had in Europe? This is my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question relates to the geographic mix for Construction Equipment. My understanding is that most of your profits comes from Asia today. How can you compare the profitability of Europe and the U.S. versus China today in terms of margins, I would say? And my last question relates to CapEx and R&amp;D. Do you have any quantified guidance in terms of percentage of sales for those two items into 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, I think on your first question on confirming where we are in terms of profitability for the individual continents or countries as you know we don't do that, so we won't answer, we can't answer that, but we can certainly have Dennis Slagle who is with us here as the President of Mack talk you through the swings on the verticalization et cetera. Dennis?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I wanted &#x2013; I'm glad you raised the point on vertical integration, because we feel every &#x2013; all of the OEMs in North America are trying to move toward a more vertically integrated product range. Mack Truck has always been vertically integrated, but I can report good progress on the Volvo side. Our engine power for example, our penetration there is 75%, which is a record high for Volvo in North America and we're also seeing good popularity around the I-Shift and the recently introduced mDrive, which is the Mack version of that. So, not only does that benefit us, profitability of course it drives more business to our dealers and I'll add that as we face greenhouse gas and future emission hurdles having sort of all the Powertrain integrated gives us advantages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say that you could have reached the same kind of margins in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; we are walking around the subject every time. We are &#x2013; we see no reason long-term why North America should have shorter margins than Europe, but North America as you know, and I think we have explained that many times, has a different market set up than Europe. But over time, which is exactly what Dennis was describing, is over time beginning to be more and more similar to Europe. Therefore, we are expecting the same type of margins long-term. But, obvious as you know, that's population, it has to do with the spare parts market, the way customers service their trucks et cetera and the vertical integration that we have touched on. Olof you want to speak about &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much repeating the answer I mean we don't comment on the profitability per regions, but it's clear that the going forward, we will continue to work on the profitability in all our markets, in all our regions, independent on where they are right now and that's something we are going to continue to do. And I just want to also to come back to what Leif said about the installed base and the spare parts structure that we also have to look into when you adjust the different regions over each other, but in general we don't split it out, but we're working on improving the profitability regardless of market origin or product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's put the question in a different way. Given that you forecast a much stronger growth in mature markets versus BRIC markets, do you see that as a positive for you or as a negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you are coming back to it from different angles all the time, I think if you look at Asia and compare with the &#x2013; if you go back five or six years ago, China is right now in Asia a very big portion even with its markets numbers that you see which is not our growth numbers but the market growth numbers, China and Asia will be a big part of our business also in the future. And that is a shift from five, six, seven, eight years ago. We are very pleased to see that the North America market is coming back, something we have been longing for, it's a good market for us with a big installed base and the same goes for the European region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on this question on CapEx and already as a percentage of sales. I'd be hesitant to give you anything there. If you just look back over the past two years you can say with the volatility of our sales and even though we think that's a unique situation even with the normal cyclicality, you can say those changes would change over the years. The best thing I can do for you is probably to say, if you go back and make a ten year average on R&amp;D then, and likewise perhaps on CapEx, we could make an argument on R&amp;D and on CapEx that since we are more bigger in volumes and better in, you can say, spread across the continents that they should have a little of a tendency to go slightly down. On the other hand, we have aggressively grown the company with acquisitions and as you know. So I think the best we can do for you there if you want some kind of average is take a ten year average and assume that to be about right. And then, don't go into trying to divide them quarterly, you know you won't get any meaningful numbers out of that.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jose Asumendi from RBS.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jose from RBS. Couple of questions please. The first one on China, could you please give us an update on your joint venture with Dongfeng? How many trucks do you plan to sell in 2011? If you could give us some clarity in terms of your installed current capacity and if you have any investment plan for this JV?</p>
          <p>And second item would be on Brazil and the Brazilian truck market, are you not worried that for three quarters down the road this market is going to correct severely and how would you react in terms of capacity and what kind of capacity have you got at the moment in Brazil? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I think the numbers on the number of trucks have we &#x2013; those are -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> 700, 800 trucks in the Dongfeng, DND joint venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At a pace of about 1,000 -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I remember correctly. And then your question there is good. That is a joint venture that we have operating today between Dongfeng and our company used to be Nissan Diesel, therefore Dongfeng ND, Nissan Diesel, which is now UD Trucks. There is an interest from us and from the markets to use that joint venture to expand both the volume and the number or the range of products that we have there. And we are interested in doing that, but as you know on that part of our truck business in China, it is very well regulated by Chinese authorities and the automotive policy down to some detail there. So we have that desire, we think our partner has that desire, but it's a matter of making sure that we can deliver that and we will advise you, you can say, when we are.</p>
          <p>Then on the imported side, we are doing very well. I believe we are &#x2013; between Volvo and Renault, we are the biggest Western imported brands of special products, sophisticated products that go into China. The good thing with that has meant that we have been able to build up a very good network of servicing dealers and spare part dealers.</p>
          <p>That business has actually gone quite well, and the reason that it's expanding as much as it is, is that you see with all of the infrastructural investments going on in China, container harbors, the ability to take heavy containers off of a ship and directly onto a truck, all of those means that they require more qualified sophisticated trucks &#x2013; more like the ones that we are selling in the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>I think the greatest change that's going to happen here in the Chinese market is that customers will actively be looking for more sophisticated, qualified trucks. The more sophisticated and qualified they become, the better have we a chance of leveraging our Group and also in the Chinese market. And you can say, then, regardless of the joint venture, now or the joint venture itself, we think it's a good way to go also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How many trucks are you currently exporting or are there being imported into China at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let us have Christer to give you a call there and we try to give you the details on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then your question on the Brazilian trucks market, I should say the numbers are in the official statistics in China, whatever. So that's clearly you can do something with it. And Brazilian truck market is &#x2013; I think it's correct as you say, the higher the Brazilian truck market the perhaps higher risk or the expectation that it might come down perhaps can be there.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Brazil is doing very well and some of us were just out there, you can say the fact that there is new found oil there, an economy humming alone very nicely, a big infrastructural investments, et cetera. You could make a case that Brazil is actually doing very well under the underlying economy. The truck population and everything else justifies a market at these levels.</p>
          <p>If the markets were to come down I think in the case of Brazil, we have a slightly better situation than we have for example with North America, because the trucks that we are selling in Brazil are very similar to the ones that we're selling in Europe, and therefore we have a better ability to use the capacity that we have in Brazil on a more global scale. While that usually can't be done on the truck side, it can be done on the engine side, but usually not on the truck side, when it comes to the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can I add just one follow-up? I mean you made some comments this morning which sounded encouraging in terms of the joint venture. Am I reading them wrong, if I think that you might be at a turning point where you could start the &#x2013; you could start penetrating the Chinese truck market much faster than what you had been doing it in the past 5, 10 years. And obviously, this would be a huge opportunity for you going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you can say had we really been at a turning point, we would have been overwhelmed with joy and we would have told you so. I think it's better to note that my interest right now is that it's an interesting market, we are there in a complex automotive policy. We have a desire to be bigger in China and while we can't announce that we have come to any conclusion on the joint venture, we are doing our absolute best in selling products produced elsewhere and with that we are actually doing well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Christer Fredriksson from ABG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Christer Fredriksson from ABG. Four questions. Firstly on the cost savings you announced two years ago, you said roughly half of that was structured cost savings, and I guess now when volumes have recovered I guess you have a pretty good feeling what the outcome was. So how much has the structural cost savings been, was the first one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you talked about increasing R&amp;D efficiency by 30% at the <mark type="inaudible" /> in New York last year. Can you talk about how this progresses and how far you have come?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, capacity utilization, you said it was 63% for VCE, how high is capacity utilization for the different divisions in the truck business?</p>
          <p>And fourthly, raw material costs, is that mainly within VCE that we are going to see higher raw material cost, or should that effect other divisions as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me take those and I'm being told by my colleagues here it has to be the last question here. I think on the cost saving structure, you can say, we can basically say we've &#x2013; or not basically, we can say we've done what we said. And if you just look at how our costs are developing versus a 30% increase I think it's fair to say, we've done what we said there.</p>
          <p>Increases in R&amp;D efficiency we are heading down that road and I think we are in general doing well, we've made the point that we &#x2013; that presents us with a strategic choice to reduce R&amp;D for the same business or use that 30% to increase our investment into other segments where we are not yet, et cetera. And I think that gap is coming there, I think in the next year or two, you should not expect any absolute numbers coming down there. The reason is that we have this Euro 6 and Tier 4 projects ahead of us and with that comes also the ability, the opportunity to change on products, trucks, and construction equipment and introduce more competitive products too.</p>
          <p>Over the longer-term, there is a strategic choice to be made if we can deliver on the 30%. And right now, I think we're making good progress there. 60% on the &#x2013; 63% for VCE, I think we can say in Europe and North America on the truck side, we are still at low levels of full capacity utilization. While if you do Asia with the exception of Japan, we are beginning to come &#x2013; and Brazil likewise you can say we're coming fairly high up: let's say 80, 80 plus even or perhaps even more in that for example in Brazil. But 60 number is probably a good number if you are looking at North America and Western Europe on the truck side, which is why as we said before, we don't really see an industrial capacity issue, we see a ramp up issue there as we had discussed at length before.</p>
          <p>Raw material, the 600 number Q4 '09 to Q4 '10 is above across to globe. And I think we should recognize that specialty steels et cetera hit VCE proportionally more than the truck side. But, all of us &#x2013; all of our business areas are actually impacted by the type of across the board material increases that you see here. And we have made the point over the day here that our intention is and our experience is that we are reasonably good at getting that across to our customers in general. And then we certainly have the ambition to try to do that also over the next couple of quarters here.</p>
