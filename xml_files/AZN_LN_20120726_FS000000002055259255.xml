        <plist>
          <p>Welcome ladies and gentlemen and thanks for joining our second quarter results conference call and webcast. After my brief opening remarks you will hear from Tony Zook, Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations; followed by Julie Brown, Interim Chief Financial Officer. We're also joined by Martin Mackay, President of Research and Development, who will here to participate in the Q&amp;A session and of course members of the Investor Relations team as well.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter and indeed our first half financial performance reflects a revenue profile that was expected given the loss of exclusivity of several key products, most notably Seroquel IR, from March. Products with lots of exclusivity accounted for 15 percentage points of our 18% decline in second quarter revenue in constant currency terms.</p>
          <p>In addition to the challenges from our specific portfolio due to generics, we continue to face the same difficult market conditions that that whole industry faces as the global economy struggles to return to sustainable growth. Government interventions in the marketplace continue to take their toll. We estimate the impact to AstraZeneca at around $300 million in the second quarter alone. The disposals of Astra Tech and Aptium created good value, but they also weigh on the year-on-year revenue comparisons. And finally, in terms of revenue headwinds, we saw a continued impact on our business from the supply chain interruptions following the implementation of new IT systems in our plant in Sweden.</p>
          <p>Our best estimate of the impact in the second quarter is around 2% of revenue overall, but as you'll have seen in the press release, supply issues reduced our growth rate in emerging markets from around 8% down to 1%. Production is now well ahead of normal levels and is responding to ongoing demand including filling back orders and restoring normal inventories in the distribution channels. We estimate the revenue impact for the full year to be around 1%.</p>
          <p>Despite the challenges, our commercial organization continues to drive performance for those brands where we retain market exclusivity and in geographic markets where we are investing for future growth. As you will hear from Tony in a few moments, there's been a very resilient performance for Crestor in the face of a highly genericized statin market, particularly with the recent launches of generic atorvastatin in many markets.</p>
          <p>There was also good growth within the diabetes and oncology portfolios. As for Brilinta, well, Brilique is gaining momentum in Europe although it's fair to say that the ramp up in the U.S. remains slow. In addition to ongoing discipline in managing our operating costs, the restructuring programs are delivering real benefits to improve our long-term competitiveness. Expenditures in research and development and SG&amp;A are both lower in the quarter in constant currency terms even after making the necessary investments in development projects to advance the pipeline and in support of new launches.</p>
          <p>We've made further progress on the pipeline since Martin's conference update in February. We received a positive recommendation by the CHMP in Europe for approval of FORXIGA, a first in class new diabetes medicine from our collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. It's now being reviewed by the European Commission which has final approval authority. We also received a positive CHMP recommendation for approval in Europe for Zinforo, a new intravenous cephalosporin antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community acquired pneumonia. Here again, we wait approval by the European Commission.</p>
          <p>Across the entire pipeline, 22 projects have successfully progressed to the next phase of development including seven projects into first human testing. 10 projects have been withdrawn. Our portfolio has also been strengthened by a string of successful business development initiatives in the first half. The collaboration with Amgen on five clinical stage projects in inflammation including brodalumab which will enter Phase III before year end.</p>
          <p>We completed the acquisition of our Ardea Biosciences which adds lesinurad, a Phase III asset for the treatment of gout to our portfolio, and then just this month we announced an exciting expansion of our diabetes alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which will add two important on-market products for diabetes, the GLP-1 analogues, BYETTA(r) and BYDUREON(r), once Bristol-Myers Squibb completes its acquisition of Amylin Pharmaceuticals.</p>
          <p>As we strengthen the portfolio through externalization, we continue to deliver attractive cash returns to shareholders through our progressive dividend and share repurchases. We are determined to navigate through the market challenges we face with a relentless focus on execution. In the context of the first half performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our financial targets for the full year with core earnings per share in the range of $5.85 to $6.15.</p>
          <p>So with that as an introduction, let me turn briefly to the headline numbers for the second quarter. Tony and Julie will provide more detail on revenue performance and the full profit and loss statement a bit later. Revenues in the second quarter was nearly $6.7 billion, and that was down 18% in constant currency terms, and I've already mentioned the key drivers.</p>
          <p>Core operating profit was down 27% to $2.3 billion, and as you'll hear from Julie, operating expenses are down in constant currency, but not enough to compensate for the revenue decline.</p>
          <p>Core earnings per share were $1.53 in the quarter, that's down 6%. As we noted on the front page of the press release, core EPS benefited from the release of a tax provision related to a cross border transfer pricing issue. This amounted to $0.19 per share.</p>
          <p>Adjustments to core earnings were slightly higher this quarter compared with the second quarter last year, so the decline in reported earnings per share is a bit more than for core. It's down 11% to $1.27.</p>
          <p>I won't spend any time on the headline numbers for the first half other than to say revenue was down 15%, core operating profit was down 23%, and core EPS was down 13%.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Tony Zook, who will talk about the second quarter commercial performance for regions and for brands. Tony, over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Before I get into the numbers, a few words on the overall commercial performance in the first half. Simon has already set out the framework. While the global pharmaceutical industry continues to face challenging market conditions and as we tackle the particular challenges we face with our current portfolio, we remain focused on the things that we can truly influence, putting our commercial resources behind the brands that retain market exclusivity and continuing to invest in the markets that offer attractive growth opportunities in the future.</p>
          <p>We create the headroom to make those investments by our restructuring and reshaping efforts. We're certainly looking to achieve a net reduction in spend, but we are absolutely focused on preserving our commercial capabilities and capacity to drive performance where we can make a difference. That means reducing non-customer facing positions and consolidation of our regional headquarter structure is a key component of that.</p>
          <p>In fact, around 40% of the head count reduction in sales and marketing related to our previously announced restructuring program will be in non-customer-facing positions. We are evolving the size the deployment of our field force to match the evolving product portfolio with a general move towards reductions in the more mature developed markets while investing in emerging markets. Where we reduce our sales force, we're building up our head count in new channels like service teams and call centers. Along with digital, with these new channels, we're maintaining and in some cases increasing market share for our brands at a lower cost than the traditional sales rep only model.</p>
          <p>So, with that as context, let me walk you through the second quarter revenue performance using constant currency growth rates, looking first at revenue on a regional basis. As Simon said in the opening, global revenue was down 18%. Loss of exclusivity is the main driver with disposals and supply issues also playing a role. Revenue in the U.S. was down 29% in the second quarter with generic competition for Seroquel IR accounting for 80% of the decline. There was good growth for Symbicort, ONGLYZA, and Faslodex, but this was offset by the disposals of Astra Tech and Aptium.</p>
          <p>Revenue in Western Europe was down 20%. In addition to Seroquel IR, generic competition for Nexium, Arimidex, and Merrem were also important contributors to the decline in revenue. Revenue in the established Rest of World was down 12%, chiefly on the 30% decline in Canada. In addition to generic competition for Atacand, generics for Crestor entered the Canadian market in April pursuant to the previously disclosed settlement of patent litigation. Revenue in Japan was down 2%, this being a year in the biennial price reduction cycle. It's also important to keep in mind that when we look at our performance in Japan, for many of our key brands, Crestor, Symbicort, Seroquel, and most recently Nexium, we record revenue based on shipments to our marketing partners. So, the numbers in any given quarter often reflect ordering patterns and inventory movement as opposed to underlying demand where we're seeing good performance for Crestor and Symbicort, for example.</p>
          <p>Revenue in emerging markets was up 1% in the second quarter. Two markets in particular are putting a damper on our performance: Brazil, where we had the loss of exclusivity for Seroquel IR and Crestor, and Mexico, where the macroeconomic conditions are making performance difficult, particularly for the kinds of products in our portfolio at the moment. Revenue in China grew by 12%. Supply issues have made the biggest impact in emerging markets. If you adjust for this, revenue growth would have been around 8%. We are expecting a rebound in emerging markets performance in the second half, but achieving double-digit growth for the full year is now unlikely.</p>
          <p>Looking at brand revenue, you can see the mix picture, with some good performances in brands that retain exclusivity and by and large I would count Crestor in that category, although, as you can see, the loss of exclusivity in Canada and Brazil account for the small decline in revenue in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The growth in Symbicort was largely from a strong U.S performance where sales were up over 20%. The oncology products, Iressa and Faslodex, both grew strongly as did ONGLYZA. And Brilinta/Brilique is starting to make a contribution to growth as well. At the bottom, of course, is the significant drag on revenues from those brands most affected by loss of exclusivity, in particular, Seroquel IR. I'm going to look at a few of these brands in more detail, starting with Crestor.</p>
          <p>Crestor sales were down 5% in the quarter, largely due to the loss of exclusivity in Canada and Brazil. Sales in the U.S. were down 1%. Crestor total prescriptions in the U.S. are still growing ahead of the statin market and the performance has been quite stable in the face of generic atorvastatin.</p>
          <p>As we have mentioned many times, 94% of Crestor volumes come from continued therapy, which we expected would remain stable and that's been the case. We've also seen a stable trend in net dynamic volume, that is new starts and switches to Crestor minus switches from Crestor. And that's holding steady even since the launch of multisource atorvastatin products at the end of May.  We're also seeing a steady improvement in the volume of patients switching from Crestor since the initial bump from the atorvastatin launch.</p>
          <p>We've taken a decision that we will not pursue many state Medicaid contracts where the price point required is not justifiable on sound business grounds. So we may see a slight reduction in TRx volumes in the second half, but the revenue impact will be even smaller. We're seeing that same resilient performance in Rest of World markets where except for Canada sales we're up 1%. And that's not by accident. It's the result of considerable work to position Crestor in the market as the preferred statin for patients at increased cardiovascular risk, a position that has helped support usage of the product in a highly genericized statin market. Crestor continues to grow well ahead of the market in Japan, although that's not reflected in the 4% ex-factory sales growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Seroquel IR, which could be summed up in one word, generics. Sales in the U.S. were down 86%. On this chart, we show two recent generic launches in the U.S. CNS market, Seroquel IR and the antidepressant escitalopram.  As you can see here, how rapidly brands now erode in the U.S market once generics enter. This is especially the case like ours when there is not a 180-day exclusivity that limits the number of generic players.</p>
          <p>Seroquel IR sales in the Rest of World were down 39%, again typical of the pattern where erosion is not as fast and as deep as in the U.S. market. It's a much better picture for Seroquel XR. Worldwide sales were off just 1% in the quarter. Sales in the U.S. were down 4% where the atypical anti-psychotic market has also turned ex-growth in prescription terms. Seroquel XR market share took a bit of a hit in April, down 17 basis points in the first full month of generic Seroquel IR, but has stabilized in May and June. We continue to believe that Seroquel XR will remain an important treatment choice and that we should be able to grow revenues alongside generic quetiapine IR.</p>
          <p>Seroquel XR sales in Rest of World were up 3% in the quarter. Western Europe was down 6% where we've had a generic launch in the U.K. and an at-risk launch in Germany. The launch in France is off to a strong start. Sales in emerging markets were up 40% in the quarter. Symbicort sales were up 3% in the second quarter on the back of a strong performance in the U.S. where sales were up 21%. In the U.S., Symbicort total prescriptions increased by 12% compared with 1% for the fixed combination market. Symbicort's share of new prescriptions is up a full point since December to 22.5% in June and share of new patients is at 27.2%. Symbicort sales in Rest of World were down 3%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Brilinta, I'll come to the U.S. performance in just a moment, but first, in Europe, the big news since the first quarter is that we have now successfully secured pricing approvals in Germany and most recently in France, where we have now launched. We continue to generate a strong performance in Germany. We have good uptake in Nordic markets, and we're off to a good start in our launch in Italy. But I am going to go through a couple of slides to illustrate each of these points.</p>
          <p>In Germany, we're maintaining our number one market share for oral anti-platelet therapy for ACS patients in hospitals where we're on protocol, which is now at 85% of our target hospitals. And now we're starting to see this presence in the hospital drive retail utilization, where we've grown to 8.5% market share in the dynamic OAP market, now second to clopidogrel.</p>
          <p>In the Nordic markets, we've also taken over the number two position in volume market share in the oral antiplatelet therapy market. The launch in Italy is also off to a strong start, where in just six months we're joint second with prasugrel in terms of share of ACS therapy for patients in hospitals where we're on formulary.</p>
          <p>Turning to the U.S., you can see on this slide that progress is slow but steady on all key indicators: formulary acceptance, protocol adoption, and trial by interventional cardiologists. We are slowly establishing reimbursement on Medicare Part D plans. All of this translating into a steady build in total prescriptions. We are also pleased to see Brilinta receive a strong class I recommendation in the recent guidelines updated by the ACC and AHA. On balance, I think it's fair to say that as the third brand into the market and having to contend with generic clopidogrel, we are finding that penetrating in the U.S. hospital market has been a real challenge. However, we remain confident that we can establish Brilinta's value in the world's largest market.</p>
          <p>Onglyza had another strong quarter with alliance revenues up 72%. Revenue in the U.S. was $58 million and, as you can see on this next slide, the combined market shares for Onglyza and Kombiglyze XR are well up from a year ago in a DPP4 market that's growing at 24%. Onglyza revenue in Rest of World was up 62% to $21 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, a quick snapshot for two of our oncology products that are now at a run rate that will annualize at $600 million each. Faslodex sales were up 24% in the quarter on continued penetration of the 500 mg dosage form, but also from expanded use. We also saw good growth from Iressa where sales were up 13%.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Julie Brown who will review the second quarter P&amp;L. Julie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tony. I will cover the core P&amp;L for the second quarter with an emphasis on the key drivers of operating profit and margin. I will briefly touch on restructuring. I will comment on our cash performance and cash distributions to shareholders, and finally I will close with our thoughts on guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the second quarter P&amp;L. I will focus here on core margins and profit. The press release does, of course, contain the statutory numbers and a detailed reconciliation to the core measures. When I refer to growth rates, they will all be on a constant currency basis. Revenue was $6.7 billion. Core gross margin in the quarter was 79.9% of sales. That is down 190 basis points compared with the second quarter last year largely due to a change in product mix following the loss of exclusivity on key brands.</p>
          <p>Core SG&amp;A expense was down 18% compared with the second quarter last year. We continue to exercise discipline in managing these costs and see meaningful benefits from restructuring being realized, whilst at the same time creating headroom to support our new product launches. The absence of Astra Tech also contributed to the lower SG&amp;A in the quarter. The excise tax component of U.S. healthcare reform amounted to 2.8% of the SG&amp;A expense in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Core other income of $182 million was unchanged compared with the second quarter last year. There were some moving parts. Royalty income from Entocort in the U.S. was lower following generic entry, but it was largely offset by income from the Zomig marketing agreement with Impax Laboratories in the U.S.</p>
          <p>That leads to a core pre-R&amp;D operating margin of 49.9% of revenue, down 190 basis points compared to the second quarter last year on lower revenue and gross margin. Core R&amp;D investment in the quarter was just under $1.1 billion. That is 4% lower than last year. Benefits from restructuring have more than offset increased spend on projects to progress our pipeline, including the additional projects from the Amgen collaboration. For the full year, I expect core R&amp;D expense will be lower than last year in constant currency terms, both on an overall basis and if you exclude the impact from intangible impairments from both periods. This leads to a core operating profit of $2.3 billion in the quarter, 27% lower than last year, and core operating margin was 34.1% of revenue, down 430 basis points.</p>
          <p>Turning to our productivity program: in the second half, we have charged $907 million of the projected $2.1 billion total cost for Phase III of restructuring, with the split between cost of goods, R&amp;D and SG&amp;A as laid out in the table. We still expect most of the restructuring costs associated with the program we announced back in February will be taken in 2012, and we remain on track for delivering the estimated $1.6 billion in annual benefits by the end of 2014.</p>
          <p>Cash generated from operating activities in the first half was $2.8 billion, in line with last year. With disciplined management of working capital and lower tax spend, we were able to offset the lower operating profit and contributions to the pension fund. In terms of cash distribution to shareholders, we maintain our commitment to our progressive dividend policy. The board has recommended a first interim dividend of $0.90, and as you will recall the aim is to set the first interim at around a third of the full year dividend for the prior year, which in 2011 was $2.80 per share. Subject to market conditions and business needs, the target for our net share repurchases in 2012 remains $4.5 billion. We completed gross repurchases of $1.9 billion in the first half and issued $0.3 of a billion in consideration of share option exercises, giving a net figure of $1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cash profile for the second half, we have the pending Amylin payments, approximately $3.4 billion to expand the collaboration subject to a final true up, plus a further $135 million relating to the option to establish equal governance rights over key strategic and financial decisions regarding the collaboration. We will also be paying the first interim dividend in September.</p>
          <p>The other potential call on cash this year was the Merck shares option or the second option as it is also called. We've reached an agreement with Merck to amend certain provisions related to the second option and now intend to exercise the option in 2014 barring unforeseen circumstances. We have agreed on the valuation methodology and the option exercise price, which will now be around $407 million representing $327 million for the PPI products, subject to a true up, and around $80 million for the profit allocation in the partnership. The expected payments to Merck will be capitalized and amortized as set out in Note 5 of our second quarter financial statements.</p>
          <p>One other accounting item to note, with effect from the 1st of January 2013, we are updating our definition of core financial measures to exclude all amortization charges and intangible asset impairments. The new definition will provide better clarity on the impact from amortization and impairment charges, which are included in our core results under our current definition. In addition, it will aid comparability of our results versus the peer group. We will publish and update on this with our third quarter and nine month results.</p>
          <p>Finally, turning to guidance, we knew that 2012 was going to be a challenging year in revenue terms, particularly with the loss of exclusivity on several products, most notably Seroquel IR. We expect government interventions on pricing to continue at the upper bounds of what we anticipated both in Europe and in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property. We prevailed in the U.S. trial on the Seroquel XR patent and we have also had positive outcomes in Spain and in the Netherlands, but we've also had an adverse judgment in the UK and some at risk launches in Europe. There are rulings pending in other jurisdictions. On balance, our revenue assumptions are unchanged. We expect to decline in revenue for the full year to be in the range of low to mid teens in constant currency terms including any residual impact from supply issues.</p>
          <p>The other items of guidance are also unchanged with the exception of tax. With the tax benefit realized in the second quarter, we now expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be around 20%. That is 2 points lower than our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned in the press release, we did have a probability-weighted view of the likely realization of this benefit when we revised our guidance at the first quarter results, and this taken together with the dilutive impact of the expansion of the diabetes alliance with BMS means our core EPS target for the full year remains unchanged in the range of $5.85 and $6.15.</p>
          <p>Whilst currency was negative to core EPS in the first half compared with last year, it was broadly neutral versus our guidance, which was based on the January 2012 average exchange rates. Our forward look to guidance takes no account of the likelihood that average exchange rates for the reminder of the year may differ materially from the January 2012 average.</p>
          <p>In summary, our revenue performance reflects many of the expected challenges that we've provided the framework for our guidance update in the first quarter. We are seeing the benefits of disciplined cost management. Our restructuring programs are delivering real benefits through lower R&amp;D and SG&amp;A costs that help provide the headroom for the investments in our business development, our pipeline and new launches. We continue to focus on shareholder returns with our progressive dividend policy and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>And I will now hand back to Simon. He will chair the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you, Julie and Tony. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>So with that introduction can we have the first question, please. I think the first question is going to come from Gbolahan Amusa at UBS.</p>
          <p>&lt; &#x2013; [05X3X8-E Gbolahan Amusa]&gt;: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I've two on products. On Brilinta, first of all, and we are seeing some progress on your prescription trends in Europe, but we see the phrasing on formulary, target hospitals, et cetera. Would you be able to comment on what percentage of overall demand the slides you show in Germany, Nordic and Italy respectively, what percentage of the market that actually is you're showing. And then on cholesterol and Crestor, ATP IV guidelines are still long overdue. Do you have any further insights on what the holdup is exactly and when you think they may finally emerge and whether ATP IV could have the effect on the market and on Crestor that we saw with ATP III and ATP II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gbolahan, thanks very much for those questions. On Brilinta, I'll ask Tony to comment. I mean this is a very important medicine. We continue to have real confidence in Brilinta's ability to bring real benefit to patients. We're pleased with the progress that we're making in Europe and other markets around the world. As Tony said, we'd love to be getting Brilinta to more patients more swiftly in the U.S., but we feel we're working steadily through the process of gaining getting onto formulary protocol and building trial. But Tony, do you want to try and tackle the question on overall demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Gbolahan, thanks for the question. As you probably know if you looked at the incident rates in Germany, it's about 360,000 incidents in a given year. If we look to our protocol inclusion on the hospitals, in Italy for example we're on 85% of the top, we are targeting 85% of the top 1,000 hospitals, likewise in Germany it's a very high percentage of the hospital base. And so we are very pleased with the progress that we continue to make. You also saw that for the first time in these markets we are now seeing that that hospital performance is also beginning to be pulled through to the dynamic share as well. So while lower, nonetheless it's still continuing to show solid progress and now we have passed the second entrant and are now going head to head with clopidogrel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tony, thanks for that. Martin, do you want to comment on Crestor and cholesterol guidelines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, very briefly. Just to say that we are not actually part of the update process which is carried out by the committee and as you know these are nominated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, but I would say is previous updates also, as you know, have made target levels more aggressive, but we do expect to see full guidelines at the second half of 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Martin, thanks very much indeed.</p>
          <p>&lt; &#x2013; [05X3X8-E Gbolahan Amusa]&gt;: Perhaps, UK, when those guidelines are anticipated I know you are not involved there as well, but we have the alliance with making some fairly bullish statements about how cholesterol drugs should be used. Do you think that might be influential in, let's say, the UK guidelines when they come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You would think so, you would think it would be influential, but until we see both sets of guidelines really it's just a little premature to comment. I just said the way the targets have gone over the years has certainly been to be more aggressive and one could speculate on that, but I would say let's wait to see the guidelines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, but, I mean, clearly I think Martin's final comment was important one. We do see in many markets, when new guidelines come out they tend to be more demanding in standards and that of course is something that provides benefit in Crestor which I think has got a strong evidence base that it's the treatment of choice for the higher risk patients looking to get their cholesterol into target. And so we obviously watch, as lays behind your question, the guidelines with great deal of closeness. Now let me move to Alexandra Hauber now, number two, Alexandra.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is &#x2013; it's actually James Gordon from JPMorgan standing in for Alexandra. Thanks taking the questions. One question is just on the supply chain disruption. In the release today you say the impact on the top line for the full year will be around 1%, which I think would be around $300 million, so the question how much is actually left, that you need to fall into Q3, as we've seen I think you had about $70 million in Q1 and then in Q2 about $100 million in emerging markets and also hitting Europe, so the first question how much is left for Q3 and also maybe how would that split between Europe and emerging markets? And also just squeezing a second question in, Western Europe declined about 20% and you said half of that was the big four genericization, so of the other 10%, how much of that is other genericization versus price cuts or other issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, James, thanks for questions. Let me deal with the first question on the supply chain interruption and, Tony if I may, can I ask you to pick up the dynamics in Europe. So, on the supply chain, we did indeed as we trailed at the first quarter, we've experienced the interruption to production, really towards the end of the first quarter into the beginning of the second quarter. We anticipated that the sort of $60 million or so impact we've had in the first quarter would be increased in the second quarter and that's exactly what you've seen.</p>
          <p>As the sort of second quarter progressed, we were able to largely resolve the issue, significantly ramp up production. As I said in my remarks, we are now operating well above usual run rates. So, we are now responding to ongoing demand and we're also replenishing inventories in the supply chain. The dynamic now James is there will be some back orders which impacted our sales in the first quarter, we'll be meeting those, but there may be some additional lost sales actually in the marketplace and hence we've guided to 1% impact for the overall year and that allows for a range of sensitivities from here. But I think that guidance of really 1%, is the right sort of benchmark we have in mind.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to Tony on Europe and obviously we talked about loss of generics, Tony, in your remarks. It is an environment of pricing. Do you want to elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, James, and you are right. A big part of it was the volume pressures that we felt with the introduction of generics, but, as you rightfully say, the pricing pressures in Europe are quite intense. When we came into the year, we believed that the pricing impact would be in the range of mid to single &#x2013; mid single-digits, low to mid single-digits and the pricing impact that we've seen has certainly been at the upper end of that range and in some countries has actually exceeded it. Within Europe, the Southern European markets have been hit probably the hardest. We see countries like Spain, Italy and Greece that have exceeded that limit. And so the pricing pressures do play a component as you have suggested.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, thanks for that. I think the other factor is whilst there's been probably a disproportionate impact of the supply chain interruption in the first half was in the emerging markets, it's fair to say some markets in Europe have been impacted. Having said that, I think within Europe, we've seen strong performances from drugs like Crestor, from Brilinta as Tony mentioned, from ONGLYZA. So, whilst we've got a challenging environment, we also continue to be encouraged by the performance we're making where we've got brands with exclusivity. Let me turn to I think Peter Verdult of Morgan Stanley. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Peter Verdult, Morgan Stanley. Simon, couple of questions around product and accounting, just on Crestor, I mean clearly trends holding up well at the moment, you made some comments in the presentation about how your confidence is high that will remain in 2012. I just want to look into 2013 a bit, just sort of get a sense as to how confident you are that you can maintain this tier 2 access that you currently enjoy, then a quick <mark type="ph" /> annal (37:36) on products for Martin just with <mark type="ph" /> dapagliflozin (37:40) filed in the U.S, just wanted to see that anything, any update you can give us in terms of path to market for dapa in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And then just quickly shifting to accounting, on the tax rate, the guidance implies a big jump in H2, now given the profit loss in U.S, I was quite surprised by that. So just maybe a few comments about the mix and what's going on there. And then as it relates to your new reporting, which will exclude amortization, I saw with Ardea that the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was minimal. I was just wondering on the $3.5 billion that you're spending on Amylin, should we expect a similar treatment, i.e., most of it goes onto the intangibles which will then be amortizing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Peter, thanks for that. My interim CFO tells me and she is fairly astute with the numbers, tells me, that was actually four questions, Peter, rather than two, but nevertheless, we will respond to them because they are all good questions.</p>
          <p>So let me ask &#x2013; can I suggest, Tony, would you like to pick up Crestor and sort of looking into 2013, Martin, if you could then pick up SGLT2s, <mark type="ph" /> dapagliflozin (38:49) and then we'll let Julie tackle the accounting items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks for the question, Peter, as you said, Crestor has been fairly resilient in the U.S. marketplace where we have seen as I mentioned before that high stability factor with the patients that are already on product and even the net dynamics have moved in a positive direction. And so we are confident in our ability to retain our positioning as the statin for that patient at higher risk. Relative to our contracting status, as you said, we've enjoyed fairly healthy open status and Tier 2 status. We don't anticipate any significant trend differences moving forward relative to our Tier 2 status, in fact many of the contracts are in place not just for the second half, but already for 2013. So in a broad sense, we expect still very good access for Crestor in the Tier 2 marketplaces. The only place where you may start to see a subtle shift in our contracting strategies I mentioned before, there are just certain very, very small segments of the business the state Medicaid populations that for us simply aren't worth pursuing from a contractual basis, but the broad commercial platform we believe is quite sustainable going into 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon, and thank you for the question, Peter. Not really much more to report in the U.S. as you know the FDA are requesting more data to get a better assessment of the benefit risk. It's not crystal clear the way forward at the minute, but we are working very closely with our partners, Bristol-Myers Squibb and with the FDA to define that way forward. We are still confident about the molecule and our ability to get it approved.</p>
          <p>Of course, just a comment on Europe, more positive news there in terms of the positive opinion from the CHMP and we are looking forward to the EC decision in due course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, thanks very much. Julie, let me turn to you on the tax issue, and let me just comment on Amylin and rightly, Peter, that the &#x2013; as we show the majority of the Ardea consideration went to intangible assets and that just reflects the value we see in the medicines and, in that case, projects that we were acquiring. The accounting for Amylin we'll obviously disclose when that transaction is completed by our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the collaboration starts. I'm not going to prejudge that, but I think it's fair to say that we see significant value in the products and therefore expect that it will be predominantly an intangible asset, but we will disclose that fully at a time. Julie, over to you on the tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Peter, for the question. With regard to the tax rate, we are expecting the second-half to return to more normal levels for the group tax rate. So, on the core basis about 24%, on a reported basis about 25%, obviously we have trading flows running between 100 countries across the group and therefore we will have a number of tax audits open at any one time and clearly the settlement that we received in the second quarter caused us to have a very low tax rate in the second quarter of 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a core basis. But basically in the second half, we expect to return to more normal levels of tax.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can you quantify the likely dilution from Amylin in 2012, trying to put in the context of the tax benefit that you're saying will be an offset. And then on respiratory, Symbicort is a big product, but it's at the tail end of its lifecycle. I'm kind of surprised you don't have more late stage offerings in your respiratory pipeline. You show variety of assets in phase 1 or phase 2, but is there really much you can do at this point to improve upon existing therapies or to fend off competition, and on that same topic can you update us on when you think generic versions of Symbicort could potentially launch in Europe or other parts of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well Tim, thanks. Martin, can I ask you to address the question on respiratory franchise and Tony if I may any update or any insight that you want to share on the potential for generics in that marketplace and then we'll come back and talk about the Amylin earnings impact. Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Simon, and thank you for your question, Tim. I'd make a couple of comments. First up to say that we believe Symbicort's still got a long runway. It's a terrific combination there and doing very well as Tony described and we believe we'll continue to do well. You're absolutely right, Tim, in terms of our respiratory portfolio, it's an earlier portfolio, it involves both large molecules from our Medimmune R&amp;D laboratory and small molecules also from our M&#xF6;lndal facility. Clearly we would like some late stage products and as in other areas where there's high unmet medical need and breaking science we are looking for partnerships in that area, and will continue to do so over the next period.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Martin. Tony, Symbicort, potential generic alternative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Martin suggested I think it's important to recognize that Symbicort has performed extremely well in a number of our markets around the world, not just in the U.S. We are seeing phenomenal performance in Japan where it's over a 35 market share. We are seeing great uptake in a number of markets, so I just want to put that in context, but specific to your question, we are aware that a first EU submission of a budesonide formoterol product was made in April and it would be &#x2013; for us it wouldn't be appropriate to speculate as to the time of approval of that product, but I would also just like to remind us that the turbuhaler device retains patent protection in 2019. So often times when we see the potential for a product coming into the marketplace, we still believe that there is an opportunity for us to differentiate versus those brands and retain a sizeable partition of our business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for the question. The expansion of our collaboration with BMS will result in a dilution in 2012 and 2013 earnings and after amortization this will be in the range high-single digits to low-double digits per share. The corresponding pre-amortization amount, if we exclude the amortization charge, will be in the low single digits per share and both measures become accretive from 2014 and we expect meaningful accretion to occur thereafter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Julie. We've now, we've got a question that came in on the WebEx from Paul Major at Redburn. Paul's question was that an observation that core SG&amp;A spend has been now reduced through the first half, but Paul's question was how sustainable is this trend and to what extent is it being driven by the faster than expected realization of the benefits from the ongoing restructuring program? Would we comment on the relative level of underlying SG&amp;A we might expect in 2013 compared to the 2011 base? Tony, you touched on some of this in your remarks, but I don't know if you'd like to address Paul's question for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, Simon,  I'll be happy to go into more of the sales and marketing component and then round out as you see fit on the other pieces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say first and foremost, Paul, is when we went through our restructuring across the commercial organization and the first thing we want to do was minimize disruption at the country level and try to mitigate impacted customer facing roles. So our initial focus and energy went into the above country infrastructures that we thought that we could improve upon and make more efficient. That translated into moving from five regions to three. It meant that we were moving from having our commercial resources, again above country, from seven sites to three. We also, we're taking a hard look at our overall selling forces. And we have seen a flow of our selling forces and we take a hard look at that, as you might imagine, not just every year, but every month and we want to make sure that where there is opportunity for growth that we continue to resource appropriately at the level needed. But as our portfolio evolves, so does then our mix in shift of our selling resources. So we have seen a gradual trend moving away from the developed markets in total sales force size in favor of where there is significant growth opportunities in the emerging market sizes. Where we have reduced our selling forces even in some of the established markets, we have augmented that some of our new channel work that we talked about in the past and what we have seen now is great examples where these new selling channels are augmenting our share voice and in many cases actually improving our share performance, but at a lower cost, and so our overall sales and marketing ratios, we would say, are more than industry competitive. We continue to find ways to improve upon those, but we are not shy about investing where we see opportunity, and so it will change and flux as does the opportunities in the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, let me just &#x2013; I'm going to make a couple of quick comments on G&amp;A. I think Martin might use this opportunity to talk a bit about the progress of sort of restructuring productivity in research and development, but quickly, Paul, on G&amp;A, the big areas of G&amp;A are in IT, finance, HR, and to some extent they are just the facilitates and the infrastructure and on those &#x2013; remember G&amp;A can be a third or more of the SG&amp;A and what we are engaged in here is a program of bringing those support activities into essentially regional service centers investing hard in IT to improve those efficiencies. We're, I think, mid-way, perhaps more than mid-way through that process and that's continuing to help us to lower the G&amp;A costs and, of course, we are also absorbing through that SG&amp;A line, for example, the excise fee in the U.S. So the underlying reductions are somewhat stronger, but the key point to make, and Tony made it is, the focus is on above market activity. It's on the enabling support act, the back offices if you like, and where we see opportunities to invest in the front-line to drive growth, we will be doing that. That's on SG&amp;A. Martin, quickly on research and development and progress there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, very quickly, Simon. And, Paul, as you know, we embarked on some significant change in research and development starting 2010. And if I can just give one example of that which highlights this, in 2010 we had 21 R&amp;D sites, by the end of this year we will have 10. These site closures were made in two waves and really to get to the heart of your question, the second wave has been rapid. We've moved through that very quickly allowing us to realize the benefits. I'd say two really important things about the speed that we moved, first of all we did it with a greatest respect for colleagues and AstraZeneca that have left the company over this time and secondly, and also very importantly, we haven't missed a beat in terms of the portfolio. So we continue to progress the late stage, the mid-stage and early-stage programs at speed and that we made a real point of making sure that we were able to do that through the significant change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, thanks for that. And, Paul, I know we extended beyond SG&amp;A, but I think it's important that you will understand just the pace with which we're moving, but the way in which we're doing it to protect the portfolio. Now let me come back to the lines. I think we got a question from Brian Bourdot, Brian at Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thanks very much. Thank you for taking my questions. On Brilinta, Tony, it was interesting that you chose to describe it as a third to market antiplatelet in the U.S. Just wondering if that's how we should think about the market for hospital initiated drugs these days driven more by cost considerations rather than things like mortality benefits because they will perhaps fight tooth and nail to save costs. And just wondering if you could give us any idea of the number of patients on therapy in that market that are reimbursed. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, Brian, thanks for the question. And, Tony, over to you on Brilinta, it's an interesting question about the dynamics in this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, I think when I conveyed that it's third to market, it just is an additional challenge and hurdle to overcome. We're not saying that it's not going to happen. We're just being realistic that when you come third to market entrant there are added hurdles going through the formulary and protocol process that are involved and so we recognize that. We're continuing push hard. We're optimistic about the value that Brilinta will bring patients in the U.S. marketplace. As you have seen, we've made steady progress on the key indicators that we are continuing to drive and we're looking forward to seeing greater uptake of the brand. But when I use the third to market entrant, I was just trying to explain that it does pose additional challenges for us in the marketplace. Clearly the mortality benefit is still the dominant driving force and we believe that will be the differentiator for the brand over time. In the short term, of course, the cost matters to formulary and protocol teams, but we believe the long-term value that that's the key differentiator for this brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess it's also fair to say that we're investing already in quite extensive lifecycle management around the brand, Brian. Martin, do you want to just touch briefly on the lifecycle management program for Brilinta?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Just very briefly, we have the Pegasus study which is over 20,000 patients and we also have the Euclid study now for peripheral arterial disease. So we really believe in the molecule and believe we can build it through lifecycle management as described.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I didn't address the other part of your question, I won't go into the total numbers that we are covering within the U.S. though I mentioned that our overall reimbursement and restricted access is at 66% which is up 8% quarter-on-quarter. Where we need to continue to drive improvement is in the unrestricted part D segment of the marketplace. Today we're at 34% which is up 25% from where we quarter ago, but we know that's still an area for us to improve especially as we want to pull the product through into the retail side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. So, Martin, having -- maybe one question for Simon and one for Martin. Simon, in your interactions with the board, can you just kind of update us a little bit with regard to what you see as the greatest needs for the business in the next six months and then perhaps over the next sort of five to seven years, if you can possibly go that far out. And then, Martin, in some recent meetings with the Chairman, people have mentioned a move towards more of an open source type platform. Can you just talk to us about what your vision is for what that open source type platform might actually be and how that evolves going forward? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, well thanks for those questions Seamus. So let me focus on, I mean, you framed as greatest needs, let me term it priorities, opportunities for our company. In the near term then, I think, these are very clear and you probably will know what they are. We've got some great brands in the marketplace. We've got very strong positions in a number of geographies around the world and we continue to create the headroom and put investment in order to drive growth where we've got exclusivity, where we've got growth in the marketplace. And that is priority number one and we are very focused on that across the business and we meet on a very regular basis to test and probe and understand where we can put more investment to work to drive our current portfolio.</p>
          <p>Second priority is progressing the pipeline and strengthening the product portfolio. And in research and development, pretty much anywhere you go in any of our sites, you will find four crystal clear priorities that the research and development organization are working on. It's progressing the late phase, it's bringing through the proof of concepts, it's conducting the lifecycle management programs, and it's supporting our business development agenda which brings me to the other component which is pursuit of our business development agenda. We are pleased with the three more significant deals that we've done in the first half of this year with Ardea and Amgen and Amylin. We've talked about those on this call. But there is a whole host of business developments and collaboration going on across research and development which Martin will address in a moment. So that's priority number two, strengthening the pipeline, strengthening the on-market portfolio.</p>
          <p>And the third priority is ensuring that we continue to maintain our position, we feel, as one of the more efficient and productive peers in our sector, because we need to maintain the margins from delivering that brand portfolio in order to fund that reinvestment while continuing to provide good returns to our shareholders. So, three pretty clear priorities honestly, Seamus, sell the products, get more at the right price and maintain productive to get returns to our shareholders. Looking beyond that, those three priorities will certainly govern everything we're doing, but I think when you look longer-term, clearly then we're starting to think about the evolving shape of our &#x2013; of the pharmaceutical marketplace, and where we need to continue to further strengthen our commercial position, our product portfolio in order to ensure we are very well positioned for the very continued strong fundamental growth we've seen in some markets, and that could start to look at where we are doing research and development in Asia, it could look at expanding our product portfolio as you know we have made early strides on this in BGx.</p>
          <p>The other longer-term priority is in &#x2013; and Martin will touch on this now &#x2013; is driving that earlier portfolio, making certain that we're really positioned in terms of discovery in early development in those areas of unmet need and <mark type="ph" /> breaking some (58:47) that will drive the future. And that's probably a good handover for you, Martin, to talk about I think what <mark type="ph" /> late described (58:54) as sort of open architecture, I think what Seamus was describing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Simon, and thank you for the question. I would love to spend some quality time with you, Seamus, to go through this in some detail, but in interest of time, let me just hit the high points of how I see this. I do believe our ecosystem will change dramatically over the next five years, and open source will be one of those ways, certainly not the only way, and I think you will have read recently, we are involved in a number of precompetitive consortia with large companies, small companies. We recently did deals with the National Institutes of Health and the Medical Research Council in the United Kingdom, and some really interesting things going on in Asia in terms of open sourcing. If you add into our portfolio the fact that we work with biotech companies such as Nektar, Rigel, Forest, and of course we have some excellent peer-to-peer relationships with Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, and of course with GlaxoSmithKline.</p>
          <p>And actually the GlaxoSmithKline one we do with our third party at the University of Manchester in the inflammation space, which is very much an open source type idea. Where does that come to in terms of the way that we work? If I look at the virtual medicine unit that I've spoken about and you've read about in neuroscience. So this group have been going for a few months now. We hired a tip-top leader in Mike Poole, an MD, PhD, steeped in the art of neuroscience. He in turn has hired just outstanding people, and appointed people from within AstraZeneca. There's now a group of about 30 people based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They've already done two company deals. They did what I think is just a wonderful academic deal just within the last two weeks. Four academic centers with true leaders in the Alzheimer's field. And last but not least, they inherited our legacy portfolio from the existing work and have now pushed that along with two first in human starts and two first Phase 2 starts.</p>
          <p>So in answer to your point, Seamus, there's a lot happening. We are very much involved at every level of collaboration, every level of open source innovation, and we truly want to be a partner that people come to because we're good people to work with. Again let's spend some time when we're together going through some of the details on that.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seamus, thanks for your questions. And let me move on, we've got a question on the line here from Mark Clark at Deutsche. Mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I just wanted to sort of drill into the emerging markets a little more. Two things really, firstly the 8% figure you mentioned for Q2 is the sort of underlying run rate in emerging markets, how exactly have you calculated that,  and should we expect an even stronger run rate in the second half given that the comps start easing in LatAm? And secondly just on China, your growth rate there is at the low end of the sort of big cap pharma field. Most are reporting figures in the range of about 20%. I just wonder if you could just tell us what &#x2013; why you are sort of slightly underperforming peers there and what could be done about that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, Mark, thanks for that. I mean I &#x2013; fundamentally we continue to see the emerging markets although that's a pretty heterogeneous group of markets, but I think all tied together with some very strong fundamentals; large, growing, increasingly affluent populations, desire by individuals and governments to expand access to healthcare and medicines, and that creates a fundamentally attractive area of opportunity for us, and we will continue to invest very hard to capitalize on that opportunity with our product portfolio. In terms of the growth, I mean I think the calculation, that's relatively straightforward. We can identify very specifically backorders and/or sales lost associated with the supply interruptions. By removing those, we expose essentially the underlying growth rate of 8%, but I can probably hand over to Tony in the first instance to talk a bit more about some, I think, questions on China and comparatives for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Mark. On China we did post strong growth of 12%. If you look to the underlying demand in China, actually growth was a bit stronger than that at 16%, and if we would exclude the ERP issue that Simon had mentioned earlier, it would have been closer to 20%, and several parts of our portfolio in fact are showing substantial growth. Our cardiovascular business is up 22%, our respiratory business is up 37%, our oncology business is up double digits, and so we do expect China to pull through and continue to post strong results in the second half of the year as we move forward. As Simon said, in the broader context of emerging markets in addition to the growth we expect coming from China, there are a series of other markets that we need to continue to take complete advantage of. We're pleased with what we are seeing in markets, for example, like Russia that are also up 15% for the year on the backs of some very strong brand performances. And so, there is a mix, as you would expect, across the emerging market portfolio. There are some challenges like we see in Eastern Europe and a few others, but all in all, we do expect our growth rates to pick up, as Simon has suggested, in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Mark, and I think, as Tony said, in China particularly I think that, and you saw in Asia the supply chain interruptions did impact the relative growth rate versus the market and our peers. As Tony said, we have outperformed in many segments, one or two therapeutic areas not quite as up with the market, and Tony knows that's the job for the second half and beyond, and we are very focused on it.</p>
          <p>I am going to go next to, if I may, Kerry Holford at Credit Suisse. Kerry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's actually Matthew Weston on behalf of Kerry. Two questions, if I can, the first with respect to the supply chain interruption. Do you have any concerns that there could be some permanent disruption to your brands or should we anticipate that in the second half of this year and particularly going into 2013, we should have a full rebound in sales of the products in question? And if you could actually just walk us through product by product which are the top three or four which were most impacted?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, previously AstraZeneca has given medium term guidance for $2 billion to $4 billion worth of sales from new product launches, and probability adjusted pipeline, I think it was by 2014. Given the progress with Brilinta and the pipeline, I wondered if you are still confident in that range and whether or not you now include the Amylin deal and Ardea as being important to get into it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, Kerry. Thanks very much indeed &#x2013; sorry Matthew, I beg your pardon, I am looking at the screen here, Matthew. Let me ask if I may, on the supply interruption, I think the points I made in my remarks that &#x2013; and earlier, that we're now back at well over full production. We are responding to demand. We are replenishing supply chain inventories and during this period, we have been very focused indeed on meeting patient needs and have had very limited impact on patient demand. The &#x2013; but, Tony, perhaps you could just touch on the question around which of the particular products and any questions &#x2013; and anything you'd like to add further in terms of likely impact for the remainder of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matthew. The brands that were primarily impacted were Symbicort Turbuhaler, Nexium, and Atacand. Those were the brands that we felt more impact. And you asked if we believe that there is any permanent damage to the brands from a brand loyalty, brand perception? No we do not believe that. We believe that we've done a good job of managing at the local levels and have kept physicians abreast of what was happening, and we are already beginning to see some rebound relative to share performance with those brands, and so, again, it was limited. There were other brands involved, but the ones that were most involved were Symbicort Turbuhaler, Nexium and Atacand, and we feel confident that we're on a rebound performance in the early days so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Tony, thanks. And then to your second question, Matthew, about the, sort of prospects beyond this year. I mean, because you know our custom and practice is to review during the course of the late summer and then through into the autumn, we undertake our annuals update of strategy business plan, and then we update the market in terms of our mid-term guidance in the end of January at our full year results, and that's exactly what we will do this year. And in terms of the this specific question, the pipeline &#x2013; the pipeline's revenue potential, we revised that to two to four at the beginning of this year, and clearly we're very committed in terms of delivery of our launches and pipeline to meet that &#x2013; to meet that goal, and we can update you I think at end of January, so, Matthew, thanks. Sorry, Martin, you wanted to add something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just very briefly, the question that Matthew asked, would the Amylin products be added to that two to four, and the answer is no. We have the list of products that are within that window, and as Simon says, we are still confident about being within that range.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Firstly, on the net share repurchases, I'm slightly surprised at the run rate here for the first half given where the share price has been. Have you seen any volume restrictions or other factors that's making it run, what to me, seems to be a slightly low rate given the target for the full year. And then just secondly, can you give us some sort of idea how much resource is being spent in the U.S. promoting Brilinta, and how do you, on an ongoing basis, keep evaluating whether you are putting too much against that product, both on the marketing side and in terms on post marketing development? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jeff, thanks. I can go very quick through the first. I think we, as Julie mentioned, we've done a share repurchase of $1.9 billion, and we run a regular program. Yes, there can be some restrictions around trading. We try to put irrevocables in place, but we are on track with the goal for the year. The absolute gross number nets down because of options exercise, which typically do happen in the first part of the year and that's not an atypical pattern. Tony, on Brilinta and resourcing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. The selling resource within Brilinta in the U.S., is certainly something that has been an area that we continue to focus on. We want to maintain a strong share of voice presence, but we also recognize that this is in a hospital dynamic, and so we have our CV specialty teams are focused on Brilinta in the U.S. We have 300 hospital reps, we have another 250 CV specialty reps and this is their focus. As you know, we also have a great partner on board with the medicines company who bring a hundred specialists that have very deep knowledge of the <mark type="ph" /> interventional space, (70:27) and so, we are quite confident in what we are looking at from a resource perspective for penetration of Brilinta in the U.S. marketplace. I won't go into the total A&amp;P spend, for obvious reasons, but we have a look at these things every quarter. We intend to look at all of our brands. We want to know exactly the value that we are creating with our investment, and if we need to make changes we do so, both up and down, and that's something that we discuss actively as the senior team across the organization.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon, thank you very much for the opportunity. I just wanted to follow up on something. I think you have been quoted on, regarding business development and M&amp;A, saying, we should think of deals this year as being representative of acquisition hopes to do in the future. And I was just wondering if you could kind of provide some color around that. Is that in sense of the size you are talking about? Is that in sense of the mix between pipeline and currently marketed products you are talking about? Just anything on more on that please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay, well thanks for the question. Yes, I think &#x2013; I mean our business development priorities, I touched on this a little bit earlier, are to strengthen our pipeline, late stage pipeline, and our own market portfolio. That's the primary focus for the business development effort and where we are putting in the majority of our effort and likely is where the investment will be concentrated. Having said that, and I think Martin made this clear, there is an enormous amount of collaboration and externalization going on &#x2013; and investment going on earlier in the pipeline, but that tends to be below the sort of radar screen of you guys. I'll then talk about priorities in late stage pipeline in our market portfolio where we are looking at opportunities that are clearly benefit from our global late stage development regulatory access pricing commercialization capability, particularly that capability in primary care and sort of specialty care led sectors, and that's certainly what you saw with the gout program, with the collaboration with BMS in diabetes.</p>
          <p>We are also looking at opportunities that are strongly synergistic with our areas of priority, research and development, and I think inflammation is an area that we see huge unmet need, and we've got some real capability, and we saw a great value in a combination with Amgen. So, fit with that sort of global development commercialization capability, primary specialty care led, and also links into our areas of therapeutic and disease expertise in research and development. And in terms of structures that we'd look at &#x2013; I mean, the &#x2013; in the first part of the year you saw a collaboration with a peer in Amgen. You saw an outright acquisition of a Phase III asset. You saw an expansion of existing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We've got &#x2013; think about the things we've got in our late stage pipeline much more traditional in-licensing deals at Rigel and Nektar. So we will look at different mechanisms to support that business development effort. And I think genuinely that portfolio is representative of the sorts of opportunities that we're looking at as we move forward. So I hope that that gives you a sense of clarity about our programs. Okay. Thanks for the question. Now I'm going to turn to Damien Conover at the Morningstar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the negative European pricing environment. Just want to see what kind of strategies that could be implemented over the next one to two years if the pricing remains challenging. Any strategies either directly or potentially indirectly by trying to take more price increases outside of Europe, perhaps in the U.S. and select emerging markets. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, Damien, thanks for the question. We've said before and I'll repeat that we've always experienced low to mid single-digit price declines in Europe. That's been a regular feature of our business for many years. I think, as Tony indicated, what we've experienced given the very significant economic challenges in Europe is price reductions which are now really testing the upper limit of that in the mid single-digit. And I think our first and foremost priority within Europe is to ensure that our medicines get to the patients that need them, and we are working with governments to ensure that that happens, and we're making our contribution as a sector to addressing the current sort of economic challenges.</p>
          <p>But having said that, we clearly need to see pricing that over the mid-term properly rewards innovation, properly rewards value in our medicines, and we're working at multiple levels to ensure that that happens through industry bodies, with regulators, with policymakers in each and every market. And in addition to that, obviously, we're very focused on research and development in bringing through medicines that bring real value to patients in these markets. And finally, of course ,we are operating an efficient business. We've been working very hard in ensuring that we can bring valued medicines to patients at a lower cost and therefore can manage in an environment with those sort of pricing pressures. But I think it is important to say that we need to see an environment within Europe that properly rewards innovation, and we're working actively to ensure that happens. Tony, anything that you'd like to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only point or two I might add, Simon, is that we also have a responsibility to go to our payers with very clear value propositions, and I think often times we look at the government interventions and recognize what they are trying to manage. They are managing increased volume consumption of healthcare, but they have to do so within a restricted budget. And I think the onus of responsibility falls back to us as organizations to make sure that we are bringing forward very compelling and clear value propositions. And that for us translates into having to have very strong working relationships with R&amp;D. We now will not accept the dossiers that are coming through our R&amp;D organization unless Martin and I have also signed off on the value proposition and the reimbursement dossier that will describe to these governments how we can extract and they can extract value from the brand. So I think that's an important aspect.</p>
          <p>We also are very conscious of what we do within, but as well outside Europe where we do chose to contract. We really study these markets quite well. We don't chase poor business. In fact, we've been able to realize higher net prices per average in the U.S. marketplace for our brands than many of our competitors because we are very discerning as to where in fact we chose the contract and I think Nexium is a good example of that. Even this late in its lifecycle, we are seeing a price positive variance because we are choosing not to pursue certain books of business. And so I think that's something that we will continue to look at and when we talk about the strong partnership with R&amp;D, we took that very seriously as we were bringing Brilinta forward into all of our global markets. And we believe that we did have a compelling, not just safety and efficacy, story, but a value proposition that then enabled us to translate into a price premium of almost 20%. And so you have to start this game very early, but don't blame the governments later if you don't have that value proposition.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my calls, my questions, sorry. I've got two questions. Firstly, on European pricing. Sorry, Tony, can I push you on this? What was the, on Western Europe, what was the actual price decline? There seems to be bit of a divergence with Glaxo claiming they had a 8% price cut and Roche only having a 2% price cut in Europe. Could you tell us where you are? And then secondly, Tony, you mentioned that when you come to look at Crestor pricing, if Medicare, Medicaid you can't get a sensible price, you may not sell into those channels. Could you give us a sense of how likely that is and what the potential impacts might be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'll give you my sense of what's happening within Western Europe. We have seen around the mid single-digit price erosion is what we've seen in our Western European markets in total. There have been a few markets that are slightly above that, as I had mentioned in Southern Europe, but in total it's mid single-digits for us in Western Europe. Relative to Crestor and the impact of the Medicaid business that we wouldn't pursue, it's a very small percentage of the business, it's like less than a half a percent of the overall business and so it would have a very small impact on volume but have an even more positive effect on net price per tablet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say actually just one to add to your point on Western Europe pricing, Tony, this is heavily dependent, this is not about a constant or sort of an average price by all markets, this could be very different between different markets and therefore what we are stating and what we have seen of sort of mid single-digits is an average of a range of markets and therefore individual peers in any one period is going to be heavily influenced by their geographic mix, so just an important caveat for you as you are interpreting these numbers. Question, I think, penultimate question if I may given the time, to Steve Scala at Cowen. Steve.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much, I have two questions, I understand that EPS guidance always anticipated the tax benefit realized this quarter, but why did the tax rate guidance not anticipate this. And second, AstraZeneca previously stated it planned to exercise AZLP option 2 at the earliest opportunity, so the question is what changed? Was it simply that you couldn't agree on valuation or do you now have doubts about the sustainability of the assets maybe particularly Nexium that you didn't have before? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Steve, thanks for that two questions. On Merck we had an original construct which allowed for exercise in 2012 or in 2017. In discussion with Merck, we arrived at an option to exercise in 2014, and in doing so at a method under a value which removed uncertainty for both parties and also gave to us what we deem to be and saw as a very favorable economic construct and so I think both sides felt that represented the optimal path forward. So it was more about an approach which removed uncertainty for both sides and, in fact, in doing that gave us a good economic outcome. That was on 2014. In terms of the tax rate, I think, Julie, you touched on this, we're talking about we'd taken a risk-adjusted view and the settlement essentially crystallized that on the positive. Steve, it could equally have been negative against us, these matters are, so they're quite volatile. That really captures it, doesn't it Julie?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Simon. Just to say, for both naloxegol and fostamatinib we're on track with the programs and on budget. Some more specifics, as you know, the naloxegol program's a KODIAC studies we've got two pivotal 12-week studies and those will read out in the last quarter of this year. You will also remember we have a 52-week long-term safety study and that will read out in quarter one of 2013. So that's naloxegol. In terms of fostamatinib, this is the OSKIRA program. The Phase III studies will read out in the first half of 2013, but we also have a Phase II monotherapy study and that will read out late in 2012.</p>

We also have four other antibodies. I won't go through the names of them all at this stage, but updates will be at later dates.</p>

          <p>Martin, thanks very much indeed, and Timothy thanks very much for the question. So we have now I think reached the end of the allotted time. Listen, thank you very much indeed for joining us and for your questions particularly on what I know is a very, very busy reporting day. So thanks again. Our revenue &#x2013; as I said, just closing remarks &#x2013; our revenue profile for the year, we expected it to be shaped by the loss of exclusivity on some key products and a challenging environment, but despite those challenges, we continue to drive performance, for brands and in regions that respond to the commercial investment we can put behind them. As we've talked about on this call, we're controlling costs, we're delivering productivity savings to ensure our long term competitiveness. We are investing hard in research and development to renew our pipeline for the future and in business development through our collaboration with Amgen, the acquisition of Ardea, the expansion of our diabetes alliance with BMS and well that's playing it's role also to bolster both our pipeline and our on-market portfolio. So, with that let me bid you all a very good day. Thank you.</p>
