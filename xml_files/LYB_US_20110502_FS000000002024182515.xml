        <plist>
          <p>Hello and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Vicky. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's first quarter 2011 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Kent Potter, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.</p>

And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com.</p>
          <p>Now finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on June 2nd, by calling 800-964-3620 in the United States and 203-369-3425 outside the United States and the pass code for both numbers is 5674.</p>
          <p>During today's call, we'll focus on first quarter 2011 performance, the current environment and the near-term outlook.</p>
          <p>With that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompany this call and are available on our website. Let's begin by turning to Page 4 to review a few financial highlights. The first quarter was a strong start to the year demonstrating significant improvement over the seasonally slower fourth quarter. During the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of EBITDA, a $640 million increase versus the fourth quarter and more than doubling the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Net income for the quarter was $606 million &#x2013; $660 million or $1.15 per share. Every segment showed improved financial performance over the fourth quarter. Improved margins in our Olefins &amp; Polyolefins products as well as in the Refining &amp; Oxyfuels areas we're the principal drivers. We will discuss this in greater detail later in the call.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to the next slide, I want to call your attention to the graph on the bottom of the page which visually indicates both the overall upward trend in our performance as well as a typical seasonality in our results. The fourth and first quarters are normally seasonally weaker than the second and third quarters. The first quarter of this year was stronger than expected despite rising energy prices, margins and volumes are generally unseasonably strong. As we will comment later, this trend continued into April.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to page 5 and speak to our safety performance. As you can see our safety statistics are excellent and continued the improving trend demonstrated in the later portion of last year. I'm proud to say that this performance is recognized within the industry as evidenced by our Bayport polypropylene plant being the sole recipient of the coveted 2010 NPRA Distinguished Safety Award. This was the only chemical plant or refinery in the United States to be so honored.</p>
          <p>While speaking of progress and accomplishments, I'd like to expand the conversation beyond safety. We have been very active in further improving our overall performance and planning for our future. I would like to present a few highlights to highlight our progress. Over half of our plants have set new production records in the last year. Given the advantages of ethane cracking in the United States we have also pushed hard to expand our ability to crack lighter feeds.</p>
          <p>Over the last couple of years, we have more than doubled our ethane cracking at both our Channelview and Corpus Christi crackers, the heavy crackers in our U.S. systems. The modest capital that was spent had extremely good payouts. Our Morris, Illinois and Clinton, Iowa plants are among the assets setting new production records. This is important as both crackers benefit from recent Midwest ethane/propane blend prices that averaged $0.15 per gallon less than Gulf Coast prices.</p>
          <p>We continue to actively work on other opportunities to expand both ethane supply, consumption and ethylene production. At Channelview we're working on projects which would further lighten the plant's feed slate over the next 18 months. We should be able to shift the mix toward producing an additional 500 million pounds of ethylene from ethane.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we're currently exploring opportunities to further increase capacity at Channelview and La Porte. While engineering is at the early stages, it appears that we could increase our ethane based ethylene production by 500 million pounds or more. These are opportunities that would require several years to realize, but are expected to have robust economics.</p>
          <p>We are also setting records in our polyolefin facilities. For example, we have already increased dramatic order and Victoria site production capabilities by approximately 10%. This has been accomplished through attention to details and implementation of small capital projects.</p>
          <p>Our ethylene oxide operations represent another success story. During fourth quarter maintenance, we upgraded the catalysts and have benefited from increased production. We achieved a daily rate increase of 10%, also a new record. You will hear later that our timing was excellent as the market for these products is strong.</p>
          <p>Our new joint venture propylene oxide styrene monomer plant in China is running effectively. It's time for us to ask, what's next in the propylene oxide business as the market continues to grow? Progress at the Houston refinery also has been good. Upgrades implemented during the recent fluid catalytic cracking unit turnaround have increased unit throughput by approximately 10%. At expected market conditions this should increase EBITDA by $25 million annually, a very nice payout project. By the way we have recently run our crude units at approximately 280,000 barrels a day against a nameplate of 268,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Our international operations are also progressing. A significant dividend from our Saudi SEPC joint venture and recent strong operations at the Al-Waha joint venture are two examples. We expect our dividend flow from our joint ventures to continue to improve as world markets improve.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to mention energy efficiency which has been another success story across the company. Over the past five years, we have reduced energy consumption by approximately 2% per annum. This equates to more than $150 million in annual savings. The projects that we're working on today can double this savings over the next five years. Most of the savings will come from projects with better than a two-year pay back.</p>
          <p>We continue to find ways to improve our cost structure and efficiencies throughout our system. All of these accomplishments are not often visible by themselves, but as you review our financials you see they add to our bottom line quickly. We're a company that works every detail from safety performance to cost reduction, production growth, to value enhancements for our customers and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the call over to Kent to discuss our financial performance. Kent?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Thanks to all of you on the phone for joining us this morning. I'll be brief this quarter as our strong results speak for themselves. However, there are a few items that I want to highlight and explain more fully.</p>
          <p>First on page six, we show our segment EBITDA for the quarter in the last 12 months. Combined our last 12 months' EBITDA was $4.8 billion. The combined Olefins and Polyolefins segments generated $2.9 billion over this period, but all segments performed well.</p>
          <p>In the Intermediates and Derivatives, we benefit from our proprietary technologies coupled with improved variable goods demand. Refining &amp; Oxyfuels reflects the strength of our asset position and beneficial raw material situations in both the Houston refinery and Oxyfuels. Overall, our business is already well positioned in the current environment of high crude oil and low natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>Let's page forward to slide seven to see our cash &#x2013; and how the cash position has developed. During the first quarter, we increased our cash balance by approximately $160 million.</p>
          <p>At first glance this may seem less than expected, especially in relation to an EBITDA result of $1.4 billion, but the first quarter is a period of heavy cash demands. Included amongst the annual or one-time payments were property tax payments of approximately $90 million, employee bonus payments of approximately $110 million, customer rebates of approximately $100 million and $175 million payment to our pension plans. In total, almost $500 million of payments were made which were unique to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>You'll also note that working capital was a significant consumer of cash. I'll provide additional detail on working capital movements in just a minute. But first I want to summarize the chart on the right, by pointing out that in 11 months since our emergence we have generated nearly $3 billion of excess cash and used approximately $1.2 billion of this to reduce our debt.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to slide number eight and take a look at the working capital changes. Indeed, our working capital increased materially during the quarter. First, I'd like to highlight that our payables increased $400 million more than our receivables, primarily due to the timing of crude oil and other raw material purchases.</p>
          <p>However, inventory values increased by $900 million, which is especially significant given that we utilized LIFO accounting. The increase was driven by three factors. First, higher crude oil prices, as Brent crude rose by more than $20 per barrel versus the fourth-quarter average. Second, we purposely increased inventory volumes in part as part of our planning for facility maintenance. And finally, dislocations in the crude oil markets enabled us to secure discounted crudes, leading to an inventory volume increase.</p>
          <p>Our strong balance sheet enabled us to pursue these opportunities, an action which we would not have deemed feasible in the past. In the chart on the right, you can see that despite these cash uses we held our liquidity at greater than $6 billion while slightly reducing net debt. Given the nature of the working capital increase, we expect that a large portion of the increase will be converted back to cash as we reduce inventories over the coming months.</p>
          <p>On the financing front, we are in the process of redeeming 10% of the outstanding 2017 bonds. These are the 8% coupon bonds, and the amount redeemed will be approximately $250 million bringing the outstanding balance of these notes to near $2.25 billion. Regarding the balance of our debt, we continue to explore further actions. However, at this time we don't believe that the economics support any action on our part. We will continuously monitor and evaluate opportunities and we will take action when beneficial to shareholder return.</p>
          <p>Thanks. I'll turn the call back to Jim now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kent. Let's quickly step through a summary of first quarter results for each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Page 9 addresses the key results for the Olefins and Polyolefins, Americas segment. First quarter continued a stream of strong quarterly results. EBITDA of $484 million was approximately $140 million more than the corresponding fourth quarter result. Within this segment, olefins EBITDA improved by approximately $70 million. Merchant ethylene sales volumes increased by approximately 75 million pounds, while margins grew by approximately $0.05 per pound, the latter being a combination of increased sales price and lower cost of ethylene production. Co-product values outpaced raw material cost increases, leading to the lower cost of production. These improvements were achieved despite the disruption caused by the Enterprise fire at Mont Belvieu.</p>
          <p>The quarter also benefited from improved polyethylene results. EBITDA increased by approximately $30 million as volumes grew by approximately 6% and the average selling price increased by $0.04 per pound. Polypropylene EBITDA also increased despite a 4% sales volume decline and significant raw material cost increases. Price increases outpaced raw material costs but pressured sales in some lower-end less sophisticated applications. Overall the O&amp;P American segment results also benefited from lower fixed costs following the somewhat elevated fourth quarter spending.</p>
          <p>To help you appreciate how far we and the industry have progressed, I want to provide a quick perspective versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Compared to this period, EBITDA increased by approximately $210 million or 75%. The majority of this increase came from the ethylene chain margin. Thus far, second quarter industry conditions have continued to be favorable. However, our second quarter results will be impacted by turnaround activity at our Channelview site, where we have one of the olefin plants in turnaround for approximately half of the quarter and will also perform scheduled maintenance on some of the related processes there. We estimate that this downtime could negatively impact second quarter EBITDA by approximately $75 million.</p>
          <p>Let's page forward to Slide 10 and turn our attention to Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International. First quarter EBITDA was $333 million; a $218 million increase versus the fourth quarter. Included in these results are JV dividends of $96 million, the majority of which come from our Saudi Arabian ethylene/polyethylene joint venture. The situation in European olefins reversed itself versus the fourth quarter, when margins were squeezed by increased raw material costs. Price increases were implemented throughout the quarter, while the cost of ethylene production remained relatively unchanged. Co-product price increases offset raw material cost increases. As a result, margins expanded by approximately $0.10 per pound of ethylene, leading to an EBITDA improvement of approximately $100 million as compared to the loss incurred in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The polyethylene and polypropylene results were relatively unchanged versus the fourth quarter. Polypropylene compounding results remained strong as EBITDA increased by approximately $10 million, benefiting from a 7% sales volume increase. This segment also benefited from lower fixed cost. The second quarter has started out quite well as March industry conditions generally continued into April. The benchmark margins plotted on the bottom of the page provide a perspective into industry conditions.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 11 for a discussion of the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $270 million, $59 million greater than the fourth quarter results, which included a year-end LIFO inventory charge. Within the segment, the propylene oxide and derivatives area represented slightly less than half of the improvement. Substantial propylene cost increases were passed through to the market with some delay, but lower variable and fixed costs more than offset this pressure. Strong demand partially related to aircraft deicer sales led to an increase in volumes.</p>
          <p>EBITDA increased for all of the major intermediate chemical products. Ethylene oxide results were particularly strong due to both favorable industry conditions and improvements implemented during the late 2010 turnaround. The latter enabled us to set production records during the quarter and is a good example of the opportunities we're realizing within our system. TBA intermediates improved on previous strong results as both volumes and margins increased. As you know, this segment has been a strong steady performer and is expected to remain so in the near future.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to page 12, I'd like to begin to discuss Refining &amp; Oxyfuels segment. First quarter EBITDA was $210 million, a $131 million increase versus the fourth quarter. As Houston refinery benefited from both increased industry margins and throughput, which together more than offset an estimated $75 million EBITDA impact related to the fluid catalytic cracker turnaround. The Maya 211 benchmark spread improved by $5 per barrel, and our corresponding spread improved it somewhat more.</p>
          <p>First quarter crude throughput averaged 258,000 barrels per day despite having the cat cracker unit down for turnaround. During the maintenance, we were able to profitably sell cat cracker unit feedstock, enabling us to maximize crude throughput. Refinery also benefited from a $34 million insurance claim. In total, refinery EBITDA improved by approximately $80 million.</p>
          <p>The Berre refinery continued to post a loss as results declined by approximately $10 million. Naphtha prices lagged increased crude costs, placing pressure on margins.</p>
          <p>Oxyfuel results improved by approximately $40 million this quarter. This is attributed to improved margins as the benchmark that we follow and report improved by approximately $0.30 per gallon. This is consistent with normal seasonal trends, but is somewhat more pronounced due to higher gasoline prices relative to natural gas based raw materials we use in production.</p>
          <p>I would also like to mention that our shipments of ETBE to Japan have not been interrupted by the earthquake and subsequent events. As you can see from the industry benchmarks on this slide, conditions in this segment remain strong. The Houston refinery has been operating at full capacity and we believe that we're well positioned to take advantage of the environment.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Slide 13 and the Technology segment. This segment posted first quarter EBITDA of $91 million, essentially doubling fourth quarter results. Catalyst results improved by approximately $25 million, of which approximately $10 million represented underlying business improvement while the balance relates to a fourth quarter LIFO inventory charge.</p>
          <p>Licensing results also improved by approximately $10 million. Ongoing payments from earlier activities represented the bulk of the licensing income as new opportunities remain subdued.</p>
          <p>Let's step back from the details and summarize environment on page 14. Overall, the first quarter was very strong and businesses recovered from the seasonably slower fourth quarter. Despite significant raw material cost pressures, most product margins expanded. We generally operated reliably and our financial results reflect this.</p>
          <p>The second quarter is shaping up well. In our slide package we've plotted a number of industry benchmarks, which indicates generally strong April industry conditions. Remember, however, that we'll be conducting maintenance activity at our Channelview site, another step toward improving our assets and positioning ourselves for what we believe is a very bright future.</p>
          <p>Later this week we'll hold our annual shareholder meeting, the outcome of which we believe will result in an expanded and balanced board with six independent Directors and we hope to receive shareholder endorsement to begin paying dividends. This first step is modest, but you should regard this as beginning of a process. We intend to return cash to our shareholders through a competitive dividend. We have also taken another step toward improving our capital structure as we're paying down 10% of our 2017 bonds.</p>
          <p>Today, we celebrated our one-year anniversary ringing the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange. Through March 31, our last 12 months EBITDA was $4.8 billion and since becoming a public company we have generated $2.9 billion of cash. Our stock has responded more than doubling from $17.61 per share to a recent high over $45 and today of course the price is higher yet. We are a new company and I hope that we've been able to convey a sense of our progress, potential and commitment. The cover of our Annual Report suggests that we may be the busiest chemical company on the planet, I personally believe that we are, and we promise to maintain that level of intensity. We have much to prove as we advance the company's performance and explore internal and external opportunities. We have completed a strong first year, but the best is yet to come. On behalf of 14,000 LyondellBasell employees I thank you for the past and future support.</p>
          <p>Vicky, we'll be happy to take questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMC. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you assess the current state of the propylene and butadiene market, how you see conditions and inventories now and how you expect these markets to evolve in the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jeff let me take that question. Obviously propylene prices have been very elevated. As a result of that we've seen sales volumes of polypropylene fall somewhat for the less sophisticated applications. I think as a result of that we've also seen propylene become more competitive. We expect that trend to continue in the near term. Butadiene prices have continued to rise, have been very positive for our European operations positive for our U.S. operations and I think will continue to demonstrate nice earnings potential.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondly, I think you were interviewed this morning and you spoke of studying possible condo crackers. Can you elaborate on your thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as I said in the earnings call a few minutes ago the first thing that we're studying is de-bottleneck at La Porte, de-bottleneck at Channelview. We think that makes the most sense. Typically those call those brownfield, de-bottleneck investments have the most significant payouts. We're going to pursue that. We're at the early engineering stage and so far those projects look very nice. We think that we could add 0.5 billion pounds of <mark type="ph" /> extra (24:47) production, potentially more than that. You've seen several announcements from our competitors about new worldscale crackers in the United States, thanks to the ethane advantage that we're enjoying at present and expect to continue to enjoy for at least the near-term future. We also will study that. We are not ready to announce that we'll participate in something of that sort. But what we did say is if a new cracker gets built, if that's something that we decide is a viable part of our future, it might make sense to participate in a joint cracker, and we call that a condo cracker, so that's what that story was about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of BB&amp;T Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes thank you. Nice job ringing the bell this morning. I was wondering if you could just offer some comments on what you thought the overall impact of the Enterprise fire was. And then also, as you look at your Channelview turnaround, you said it's one line. I guess one line is going to be down for half the quarter. What would your overall volume impact in Q2 be, just specifically related to Channelview for the O&amp;P Americas business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Left me kind of start off with that, Frank. This is Doug. The Enterprise impact impacted us in two spots primarily. One at Channelview, where we needed to quickly adjust the feed slates and go heavier because of the reduced light feeds. The other was at La Porte, where the disruption caused us to reduce rates significantly and balance between ethane and propane. And therefore, we lost production there. All told, probably the impact of that is in the $10 million, $15 million range as a rough estimate. So really our people were able to quickly react and keep it very much to a minimum.</p>
          <p>As far as the turnaround and the impact of the turnaround, the olefins plant that will be down is about 1.9 billion pound plan. So if you think of the timeframe, that'll tell you how much ethylene is impacted. Now it's a significant piece of work our people are doing and we're also working on some of the downstream units and timing the turnarounds with that, so there'll be some impacts there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. And then on the Intermediates and Derivatives business, you mentioned it's a strong, steady performer. You talked a little bit about some margin compression in Q1. How did April look in that business in terms of your margins, and what's your expectation in Q2 relative to Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we'd say that the business continued to be pretty strong. We've had some propylene price pressure, but have been able to move those price increases through to the market in a pretty positive way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Jim, we've talked a little bit about a path to a super cycle given the unique conditions here, and then maybe some changes in the Middle East. I'm wondering if you can answer two things for me. First, do you worry at all about availability of ethane as everybody starts planning projects over the next four or five years, and how do you make sure you lock up that volume and/or price? And then secondly, given your exposure to some of the JVs in the Middle East, can you talk about the threat of Middle East capacity or lesser threat as some of that associated gas starts to go away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think in terms of super cycle, as we see things today there seems to be a nice balance between natural gas liquid supply and demand. That can change from moment to moment as we experienced during the Enterprise fire, but overall there's reasonable balance. We know that there's additional fractionation capacity coming on. Enterprise has a 40,000-barrel-per-day extra supply of ethylene online in December, Targa had a 40,000 early in Q2, some smaller incremental volumes, and then we expect maybe next year another 100,000 barrels per day of ethane. As the shale plays continue to develop, the economics here have been reasonably strong. Extra fractionation capacity comes off. We have had some dialogue with some of these processing companies, and they assure us that the ethane will be available should additional capacity be added. It doesn't seem to be a concern at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Now, on the Middle East, I would comment that in terms of new capacity being added, as we've surveyed opportunities there, we expect that the capacity will be naphtha-based in most locations instead of ethylene and propane. That will change the dynamics and the economics of those projects. They'll be potentially less competitive. As we see things today, the Middle East has the best cost structure with assets on the ground today &#x2013; I'm not talking about the new assets &#x2013; and then the United States with the cheap ethane. Newer projects in the Middle East may not be as competitive as some of the new projects in the U.S., depending upon the availability of that feed, but...</p>

          <p>Well, can you talk about your plans for propylene? I know Dow has announced a new plant for on-purpose propylene. I think you guys have considered that. Is there something on the horizon we can expect there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we continue to look at de-bottleneck opportunities. And as a result of that, we could have additional propylene supplies available, too. There are some things &#x2013; as you know, we have a flex unit at Channelview, and we'll look at the economics of de-bottlenecking that as we look at the other things that are opportunities in our portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Jim, two questions, one on the refining side. You talked about a $25 million benefit from the FCC turnaround, but at the same time you also mentioned that you've been running at 280,000 barrels a day recently. Are you ready to sort of re-rate that refinery, and what drove the higher production rate? Was it some of the work you did on the FCC unit, or was it something else? And then secondly, what's your view on the current high margins that we're seeing in WTI-Maya? How long do you think that might be sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In terms of the capacity of the crude units, those crude units could always do 280,000. We rated the units at 265,000 because we had constraints further downstream, just makes sense to run that way. What we are doing now is besides the FCC turnaround that has allowed us to move up the volumes there by about 10%, we're also taking &#x2013; we're in a sense de-bottlenecking or hydro-treating running those at less severity. We're moving some of the bottom of the barrel out of the crude unit into someone else's hydrocracker.</p>
          <p>And as a result of that, we're seeing the refinery generally perform much better throughout, we're getting a nice margin for that hydrocracker feedstock, and overall the refinery is now getting to be a unit more like it should have been in the past.</p>
          <p>The other question on WTI, obviously there's been a significant spread between WTI and Brent. That has happened before. The Midwest refineries benefit from that. The Seaway pipeline could be turned around and could fix that. There has been some discussion by enterprise of a new pipeline, that's several years away probably. It remains to be seen whether ConocoPhillips would reverse that pipeline and flow. But for now, as long as we see all the tankage at Oklahoma toll, we're going to see that spread for a little while.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that the Brent heavy differential remains pretty strong. It's just that differential between WTI and heavy crude seems to be more compressed. Our company has been opportunistically buying crude, taking advantage of that dislocation in the markets that's why we built some inventories, and I think you're seeing some nice returns now as a result of those actions we've taken.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. I mean, we'll have normal turnaround and activities in a company this size, but really the olefins turnaround in the second quarter is really the next biggest piece.

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Thank you. I guess then secondly, just and this is a recurring philosophical issue, as you think about your balance sheet's potential leverage targets and you see more competitors moving to lock in sort of access to U.S. ethane supplies, how is that changing your thinking, if any, on the urgency of evaluating potential projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think it changes our sense of urgency. We want to be thoughtful in the way that we expand. As I said, the debottlenecks seem to have the highest return based on our early engineering and we do study the availability of ethane. As you know, lot of that ethane clears at Mont Belvieu for the Gulf Coast and as best we know in discussions with third parties nobody is taking long-term contracts, they're just expecting to trade "off the grid". So we're studying, we're working very hard like everybody else and we'll see how the opportunities shape up.</p>

          <p>Jim, I'm looking at your propylene, propylene oxide chain. Do you want to go further down the chain into polyurethanes or maybe add other propylene derivatives as you try to fully integrate the propylene chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>PJ, one of the things that we've been able to do through long-term contracts is make sure that we have the uptake of our units, that's turned out to be a good model for us. As we've expanded for instance in Asia, we've been able to put contracts together very nicely given that we're second largest in that market space. I'm pleased to say that the joint venture POSM plant that we started up in Asia was sold out almost immediately and that's why we're beginning to study what's next.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, PJ, I'd remind people too that we are integrated downstream and some other chemicals with the glycol ethers, which have been very strong in the solvent industry and electronics, butanediol has been a very good business to be in for the past year with demand out of automotive and also the apparel industries have been very strong.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And Jim, second question on European ethylene margins, there was some improvement in the quarter. What is your outlook for that chain in Europe for next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Europe will continue to see some pressure frankly. Naphtha prices have caused Europe to have very high ethylene and thus polyethylene prices as one of the high prices in the world. So probably we've been able to push those price increases through to the market. But as we have said we expect Europe to be a tougher marketplace than the U.S. and we'll just see how the market develops.</p>
          <p>Now I do want to say that utilization rates are generally lower for most companies, but since we're &#x2013; our integration is such that we're long polymer and short monomer in Europe, that hasn't been the same pressure on us. Our operating rates in Europe for our crackers has been around 95%, which is very positive. Over time, as the world economy improves, we expect all places in the world, Asia, Europe, as well as United States, Middle East, all have better returns going forward, but of those regions obviously Europe will have more pressure than other places.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the call. Jim, I have asked this before, but things keep changing. You do hear your competitors, as was mentioned, announcing new olefins projects in North America. How do you think the transportation or utilization of shale, Marcellus Shale, natural gas liquids will ensue over the next few years? Pipelining it, shipping it, using it in the Northeast, I think <mark type="ph" /> Sonia (39:15) has been mentioned. What's your current thinking on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That one is a very difficult one to answer. I think as we study that, most people expect those liquids will come down to the Gulf Coast. There could be some move up into Canada. We've heard some discussion of that. And it's even possible there could be a plant in the Northeast. I would like to point out that if you have a plant in the Northeast, they don't have the advantage of the grid. If your cracker goes down and if you lose your monomer, you lose your polymer whatever the derivatives are downstream, and so there is a bit of an advantage to being in the Gulf Coast for all of these facilities. And we'll look at that possibility there on the East Coast, but my guess at this point of time is that would be favorable to build in brownfield sites; existing facilities with all the infrastructure, utilities, pipelines, grid in the Gulf Coast versus on the East Coast.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, how much threat do you believe the environmental issues related to deep fracturing is in the shale gas areas, using those fracking fluids?</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:30) some of those wells <mark type="ph" /> for (40:33) years ago and those wells can be drilled in a very sound environmental fashion. I have a feeling that there's a few operators who may have cut a corner or two, but that should not keep those fields from developing. There's no reason that water should be contaminated if wells are drilled properly. The industry needs to police itself and do a good job of that, and I know that the API is studying recommendations on what to do next to make sure that wells are drilled in an environmentally sound way. I don't think that should derail anything. Those wells can be drilled efficiently.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Jim. A question around the earnings strength at your Saudi joint ventures. Obviously margins for both polyethylene and polypropylene improved sequentially. But what I'm trying to get a sense for is, did you also see improvement in operating rates? Now I do realize that both Al-Waha and SEPC are relatively new facilities. So just trying to get a sense that are these sort of relatively new Saudi facilities now running at optimal operating rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me first comment on Al-Waha. When that unit started up we had some issues with our propane to hydro unit, a little bit of issues and teething problems around the polypropylene unit. We put in the new plant manager from our company at that site. We've gone down and done some additional training and I'm very, very happy to tell you that that unit is running extremely well right now. And so those operational teething issues that we started with I think are behind us, and we should see better operations going forward.</p>
          <p>SEPC has already been running for a while. You saw a very nice dividend in the first quarter. We expect continued dividends from those sites and we think the Middle East assets that we have, have a very bright future. More to come on that. I would like to comment that a lot of those assets do not take advantage of being on a grid. And so again, if you lose the cracker, then you lose your downstream units with a little bit of flexibility here and there in Jubail.</p>
          <p>One of the things that I think the entire industry is looking at is how do we cooperate a little better among all of the plants and move product around, and that will be an initiative that I think that we'll study with the Saudi government and all the other producers there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim, when you took over as CEO, you highlighted quite a bit of earnings upside from operating your units more reliably and more efficiently over time. We heard more about that this morning. If I look at the first quarter results, are you yet at a point where you would consider the operations of LyondellBasell normalized relative to arguably a dislocated state during the bankruptcy, or is there a lot more to go there? How would you characterize that broadly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we still have a work in progress. I think approximately 60% of our plants set new production records last year, and that's something we're very, very proud of. That's the attention to detail I was speaking about. But we just finished a turnaround at our refinery, and you're seeing that run better. We have a big turnaround at Channelview. We're doing a lot of work on our convection sections to reduce energy, improve yields. I think overall our gap closure plans are progressing as we expect, but we still continue to take costs out of the operation to improve the volumes. On the polymer side, we suggested that in some of these plans do very small capital projects, but mostly attention to detail. We've been able to increase volumes by 10%. This is an ongoing thing as we get to be a better company, and I think more to come.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the second question if I may, on polypropylene resin, given the price premium that that product now commands, I guess I would have expected to see some switching into other polymers. It looks like if I add up Americas and your international results, you're actually up 6% to 7% year-over-year. Are you seeing that sort of switching?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there other factors perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there has been some switching in the United States. The polypropylene resin has been more expensive than, say, high-density or some of the others potential substitute resins, and in some of the lower value applications we've had some loss of sales. In Europe that has not been as pronounced. Remember after base cracking, still a significant amount of propylene being produced and so the prices there are not that different on a comparative basis. So I think regardless of which way that goes, we're also very large in the United States in high density, so if there is a switch to that, we are well positioned. And we are a leading propylene producer. And so what we try to do is move our product up into higher-value applications.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be probably the same, Kevin. We've got &#x2013; as we'll say in the Q here in a couple days, our book or effective tax rate is slightly below the U.S. 35% rate, because of some operations and lower statutory tax jurisdictions, the untaxed nature of our dividends coming out of our joint ventures. We also &#x2013; but there are some offsets to that, but I think it'll stay just about where it is now. For book purposes, cash purposes, we'll see that we will be paying taxes this year in the U.S. but maybe not at the rate we thought because of the change in the tax law.</p>

          <p>Congratulations on that. Just a couple of questions. One, just if we could maybe compare and contrast your situation in shale gas, your plans, Dow is trying to create &#x2013; they are creating some optionality for ethane by joining hands in a contractual way with Range up in the Marcellus. I'm just curious, if you guys are looking at something like that where you would have a choice of cheap ethane from the Gulf Coast or cheap ethane from Marcellus, is that something that you think you might be following in that direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the discussions I've had with some of the fractionation companies, I don't think it's necessary to take decision like that at this moment. I think that there will be significant ethane available. One of the things I would point out that for instance at Corpus Christi, our geography is exceptionally good. That's down there very close to one of the best plays, that's going on right now, the Eagle Ford. And so people are coming to us and saying, could you use more ethane, please? I'd also point out that Morris, Illinois and the Clinton, Iowa were extremely well positioned being Midwest consumers of that ethane. So, we'll watch that, but at this point in time I don't think you have to do a marriage with a producer like that. If we do need to do that having grown up in the E&amp;P business, we have lots of friends and we can get into those discussions very quickly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Just if I could another question on your exports, could you talk a little bit about how the export markets are doing? Is it a big percentage of your production today, and what have the trends done?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, one of the things that we've uniquely done in our polyethylene business is repatriate a lot of the volumes. We find that we can achieve better margins generally in the United States instead of sending it to Asia right now. And so we're exporting 10% to 15% at any moment of time. When we do that now, it's generally South America it's higher value markets. We don't find it necessary to export to Asia at this point and I always talk about selling up, that's an example. We repatriated those volumes not selling that through traders in the Asian markets and more selling that at home for much better margins.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. I was just wondering, if oil was flat for the rest of the year as you guys were looking out &#x2013; I know you're not making any forecasts &#x2013; but if oil was flat, would you see working capital being much of a use from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think the main thing that you've got to recognize with us in &#x2013; first of all, we are on LIFO. That means if prices go up we generally expense it. The only reason you're seeing such a large increased inventories now is the reasons we've talked about, a very, very large another opportunistic buying at this time coupled with our shutdown schedule. So as inventories come off, in some cases they will stay a little higher to support higher sales especially in our polymer business. But I think oil price, you tell me where oil prices are going, I'll tell you what will happen with our cash, but we'd like to see some come out as I said as the volumes come down in inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one other thing. You noted that the cost of ethylene production came down a few cents per pound. Can you talk a little bit about that? Is that internal projects that you guys completed that's making the process more efficient?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Mike this is Doug, I think comments on the cost of ethylene really go to the fact that the strength of the co-products, that was mentioned earlier in some questions. So the strength, the co-product pricing really has offset the movement in the naphtha and crude oil pricing to ultimately lower our cost of ethylene in the quarter. Now, of course, these are things that are always moving around and prices of all these raw materials are moving around. So it's a constant optimization for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one last, was there a tax refund of $250 million in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not yet received. IRS is busy. I guess they were a little worried about whether or not they were going to take a furlough. So, we are still anticipating significant refund along those lines first half, as soon as they can get it through their bureaucracy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yeah, I mean, could you quickly talk about what you are seeing in terms of inventories in the U.S., Europe and in Asia? I was just coming back from the Middle East, and a lot of the Middle Eastern companies were a little concerned about high levels of inventory in Asia. And so given they export most of their volumes to Asia, where would you expect them to ship them to if they can't ship them into Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First let me comment that we're shipping a lot less to Asia as I commented earlier from the United States. Product from the Middle East still goes to Asia. We have not seen any issues in moving any of our polymers. We also would point out that there is a recent announcement that the Chinese crackers would cut back about 10%, I believe and so if there was a little length in inventories, we expect that to correct itself there out soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that you are anticipating six independent board members after this. Do you see a potential for this triggering a debt upgrade, and what would you think the timing on that might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you've probably read in our &#x2013; in S&amp;P's recent announcement, they're clearly interested in seeing an independent board. We hope that we'll have a &#x2013; I guess three more independents this time...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes three more at this election period and then we'll add another independent before October...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're required to by NYSE requirements. So anticipate having a majority independent board before October.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're working on that extra Board member as we speak, we're being very thoughtful in who we put on to the Board. And I think you'll see that the Board that we've constituted so far is really outstanding. We're very proud of the individuals that have accepted our invitation to join us and one more to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question. In your remarks, I believe you mentioned PO is running hard, getting tight. And what are you considering for potential expansion options in propylene oxide, and what technology potentially would be your next plant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's a possibility that the next plant could be PO/TBA; we're at the early stages of engineering that opportunity. But as we look at the oxyfuels market, there looks to be enough opportunity there to move significant oxyfuels if we decided to go that route.</p>
          <p>The geography has not yet settled. We have significant number of people who would like a joint venture with us in propylene oxide and so we're studying what would be the ideal situation for us there but it is being worked hard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could sneak one more question in, your ethane arbitrage you mentioned, Midwest and Mont Belvieu, it was $0.15 a gallon in the year &#x2013; first quarter, and you mentioned the crackers in the Midwest. What is the probability of an expansion of those crackers, and if it was, what percentage of capacity do you think you could get out of those crackers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll look and see what we could do. If we did something, there would probably be a de-bottleneck, but I'd like to tell you that both those crackers have set production records last year, and Morris after this de-bottleneck has never run better, I think we have &#xA3;1.3 billion a year and we were monomer short and now we're monomer long. We have a very nice inexpensive de-bottleneck we can do at Morris and so more to come on that story as well.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Jim, regarding the $82 million dividend from SEPC in the quarter, how much was one-time versus &#x2013; make up dividend versus dividend related to cash actually generated in the quarter or in the recent past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roger, this is Kent. There was clearly some catch-up. I think we've talked about earlier that dividend was scheduled to come in earlier, but as joint venture settles down now at normal operating rates depending on their cash generation which will, of course, fluctuate with their spreads. We anticipate a steady flow. We'll have another dividend later this year, we believe, I'd like not to talk about the amount at this time.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. Can you give us a sense of how much your Q1 European olefins EBITDA was based on butadiene versus other olefins and co-products? Just a sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think I have really good split off the top of my head on that, Roger, but I think what you can is cost on raw materials move, the co-products move more so and that's what lowered the cost of ethylene. Now well, will the co-product moves? Those propylene, butadiene and those items. So, and the co-products remain a key piece of the European profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could ballpark the timing on some of those de-bottlenecking and Brownfield expansions that you mentioned in your prepared remarks? Will we see some additional capacity after the Channelview turnaround this year, or will it be more of a 2012 kind of event? And then could you also provide an update on your current feed slate and how much capability you have to use ethane and where you think that has the potential to go after these de-bottleneckings and expansions are done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're running 70% to 75% U.S. NGLs at this point in time. We have been able to already use more ethane at Corpus. In essence, we double the amount of ethane we're cracking there and running to push test as we speak, to see how much more we can run. Channelview, over the last couple of years, has more than doubled the amount of ethane we're cracking there.</p>
          <p>We're looking at some de-bottlenecks, some are near-term, some are little longer term, we're at an engineering stage of the de-bottlenecks, you know, La Porte was made, the de-bottleneck, if you look at the configuration of the plant, there is space right next to a traditional furnaces and the back end, but it's ready set, go on that. We just need to do some engineering, but remember that in all of this there has to be permits done. And everybody in the industry will face a question of how quickly you can get permits to expand the production?</p>
          <p>That remains a question mark for all of us. So timing is somewhat dependent upon permits, but we're talking at least a couple of years away before we start seeing the benefits of that de-bottleneck, but we are advancing the engineering as quickly as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a second question. Can you provide an update on some of the work Bob Patel has been doing over in Europe in trying to improve the operations over there? Was it a good quarter? You mentioned some of the co-product credits contributed to that, but any early signs or early takeaways from his work over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but right now in Europe, we're working on a cost structure, we're in discussions with our works councils. We have previously indicated that the cost structure is higher than we liked it to be, a lot work to be done and we're at a stage now we're beginning that dialog we'd like to advance it as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>In the rest of the operations, I would comment that just like we do everywhere else in our company, we do studies the best possible and developed gap closure plants around that. Europe has had a number of plant records as well. They've been improving their cost structure, and overall, we know that Europe will be a more difficult market than other places and so our intention is to get our cost structure positioned to be extremely competitive there.</p>
