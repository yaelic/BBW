          <p>Good afternoon. This is Heather Miner from Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our Fixed Income Investor Conference Call. Today we will take you through a Fixed Income Investor presentation, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website www.GS.com.</p>
          <p>yes</p>
          <p>Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2011.</p>
          <p>I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk weighted assets and global core excess and you should also read information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Heather. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give a brief overview of the firm's results for the first half of 2012 and speak about our risk management and then turn to Liz for an overview of the firm's credit profile. We'd be happy to take your questions at the end.</p>
          <p>On slide 2 of the presentation, you can see our reported year-to-date net revenues of $16.6 billion and net earnings of $3.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $5.72 and our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%.</p>
          <p>The first quarter macroeconomic environment showed signs of improvement relative to 2011 and asset prices and client activity levels increased as a result. During the second quarter, however, questions surrounding the stability of the global economy and its future prospects resurfaced. The sovereign situation in Europe remains a primary concern and the outlook for the global economy was further clouded by concerns about slowing economic conditions in the United States and China. The accumulation of these various macroeconomic concerns increased market uncertainty and reduced client activity during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 3, you can see an outline of our risk management philosophy and oversight structure. The firm takes a broad approach to risk management with a focus on risks including liquidity, market, credit, operational, legal, compliance and reputational.</p>
          <p>Risk management is embedded in our culture and remains a primary daily focus across both the revenue and control sides of the firm, especially as the market and regulatory environment continues to evolve. To ensure effective risk management, we have a culture that promotes accountability and senior management is actively engaged in the dialogue and decision-making around material risks.</p>
          <p>Another important tenet of risk management is independence and as such, our control functions are completely separate from the business units, including those that report independently to me. The final critical component is the engagement of a number of firm committees including our risk committee and active oversight by our board of directors.</p>
          <p>A critical aspect of good risk management is good risk measurement. We've built a robust technology risk infrastructure that produces metrics that enable our people to monitor market, credit, and liquidity risks.</p>
          <p>In addition to VAR, we use multiple stress-based methodologies to quantify tail risks including jump to default analysis. We evaluate credit metrics including current and potential exposure. We review both gross and net exposure given the potential for basis risk and we aim to mitigate risks through our diligent daily marking process, the use of high-quality collateral and effective heading strategies.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity risk modeling systems dynamically track firm cash flows and run scenario analysis of the impact of potential market moves on our liquidity position. While metrics and quantitative measures are an important part of risk management, the judgment and experience of our people that overlay these models is a key component. And although we work to manage risk conservatively, facilitating clients' needs requires the firm to take risks. And therefore, we will realize losses from time-to-time.</p>
          <p>The market has understandably been focused on market and credit risks to peripheral European countries including Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. We've been prudently managing these exposures for a number of years as reflected by the relatively modest credit market exposures on slide 4. As you would expect, we actively run scenarios analyses to measure and size our risks under a variety of potential political and economic events in Europe. Given our low absolute level of risk and our robust capital and liquidity position, we feel appropriately positioned.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm going to turn it to Liz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. I'm going to review key attributes of our credit profile including our balance sheet, capital, liquidity and funding.</p>
          <p>Beginning on slide 5, our balance sheet was $949 billion at the end of the second quarter which is roughly where it has been running over the last few years. The balance sheet is largely comprised of liquid assets. Our excess liquidity pool and other cash together represent 19% of our total asset base. And secured client financing, which captures lower-risk collateralized activities like margin loans, short covering, and matchbook activities represents 27%.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, Institutional Client Services at 46% is the largest user of our balance sheet given the amount of inventory the firm needs to support our customer market-making activity. Approximately 5% of our balance sheet consists of assets from our Investing and Lending segment including private equity, loans, and credit investments.</p>
          <p>It is important to remember that the vast majority of our balance sheet is marked-to-market daily. This enables us to have an accurate view of our risk and capitalization. It also facilitates any balance sheet reductions we might choose to make as it creates greater indifference between holding and selling positions.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have aged inventory limits to encourage balance sheet turnover and limits on the use of unsecured debt to ensure efficient use of the firms funding capacity. Since the first quarter of 2008, we have reduced the size of our balance sheet by 20% with the vast majority of the reduction happening in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. This reduction was disproportionately weighted towards harder to fund and riskier assets, as demonstrated by an over 50% decline in Level 3 assets during that period. Less liquid assets are appropriately funded with long-term debt, equity and term deposits.</p>
          <p>Moving to the firm's equity on slide 6, we have a strong capital base comprised largely of common equity. Our estimated current Basel III Tier 1 common ratio is nearly 8%, including the impact of the final Basel 2.5 market risk capital rule and the international rules for Basel III. It is estimated that it would be nearly 10% by the end of 2013, based on the impact of a number of assumptions, primarily consensus net earnings and the continued passive roll off of our mortgage securitization and credit correlation portfolios. To be clear, this is not a forecast or a target, but rather a mathematical roll forward, based on these assumptions. While we won't know our final Basel III ratio targets until SIFI surcharges and other regulatory requirements are determined, we intend to continue to run the firm with capital ratios at or near the top of our industry.</p>
          <p>Turning now to page 7, we view liquidity as the single most important risk management discipline for financial institutions. To mitigate liquidity risk, the firm has followed two main principles for many years. First, hold enough liquidity to pre-fund our near-term cash and collateral needs in a stressed environment, and second, maintain a liquid balance sheet that is appropriately funded by longer-term liabilities. Our liquidity pool is large, over $170 billion at the end of the second quarter and is comprised of only the most highly-liquid assets: cash, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, and U.K., German, French and Japanese government bonds.</p>
          <p>To mitigate credit risk, the vast majority of our liquidity is executed through overnight reverse repurchase agreements that unwind to reduce cash to us. We also ensure that all liquidity is prudently allocated between our holding company and our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries on a global basis.</p>
          <p>The size of the liquidity pool reflects an internal model called the model liquidity outflow. We believe our model takes a conservative approach to measuring liquidity risk, estimating both contractual and contingent risks in a stressed scenario. We pre-fund potential outflows of cash and collateral in three main categories: first, contractual outflows, such as debt maturities, or collateral outflows upon ratings downgrade; second, stressed customer behavior, such as deposit outflows; and third, market-related outflows, such as additional collateral required in the event of a market move.</p>
          <p>We also factor in an assessment of required intra-day liquidity coverage and a cushion that is appropriate for the operating environment. The size of our global core excess, or GCE, continues to represent a significant surplus over our internally modeled requirements.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide 8, I'm going to address our liabilities, starting first with secured funding. On this slide, you can see our total repo book of roughly $200 billion. The majority of our secured funding is on liquid government and federal agency obligations that mainly comprise the liability side of our matched book. At the end of the quarter, the firm had approximately $65 billion of nongovernment repo in our principal broker dealer entities. We believe the repo markets provide an appropriate and stable source of collateralized financing for these assets. Given our focus on long-term contractual maturities and diversified funding counterparties we have also conservatively managed the underlying collateral, including through appropriate haircuts, third-party mark-to-market of asset values and regular margining.</p>
          <p>On slide 9, we have provided further information on the term of our secured funding. The weighted average maturity of the funding for assets that are not eligible for our global core excess has been above 100 days since the 2008 crisis and has increased more than 50% over the last three years. We are particularly focused on extending the term of funding for less-liquid assets. In addition to terming out our book, we have incremental protection against maturing trades that comes from our secured funding excess. We acquired secured funding capacity in an amount that exceeds our existing inventory requirements. That funding is deployed in the most liquid asset classes, such as U.S. Treasuries, but is available to finance harder-to-fund inventory if our balance sheet grows or other funding rolls off.</p>
          <p>Finally, unsecured funding, slide 10, highlights the significant improvements we have made in counterparty diversification in our book in recent years. This is true, both in terms of geography, where we have reduced our dependence on European counterparties, and sector, where we have reduced our reliance on banks.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11, as part of our ongoing efforts to diversify our funding base, deposits have become a more meaningful share of overall funding, more than doubling to $57 billion since the end of 2008. In particular, GS Bank U.S.A. has been actively growing its deposit base, with an emphasis on contractually longer-duration funding. The bank has been issuing long-term broker CDs with a weighted average life of three years and a cost that is roughly 200 basis points cheaper than parent company debt of the same maturity. The bank is also raising deposits through contractually long-term relationships with broker-dealer aggregators who treat their client cash to an FDIC insured deposit at our bank. Together these term deposits are being used to fund a portion of the roughly $100 billion of assets in our U.S. bank including loans and interest rate derivatives.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 presents our long-term unsecured funding, where we continue to focus on ensuring stability and reducing refinancing requirements through appropriately spaced maturities. We actively manage maturity concentrations to avoid a large amount of debt coming due during any period, and as a result our long-term debt currently has a weighted average maturity of eight years. We also focus on diversification by market and currency. On the short-term side, the vast majority of debt outstanding is formerly long-term debt with less than one year remaining to maturity. Our hybrid debt consists of structured products, many of which have a stated term of greater than one year, but some of which we classify as short-term debt due to significant market-making activity.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 presents highlights of our current long-term debt issuance strategy. Year-to-date, we've executed a total of $13.7 billion of long-term unsecured funding of which $12 billion was in U.S. dollars and $1.7 billion was in Japanese yen, compared to approximately $15.1 billion that came due during the first half of the year. We may choose not to match new issuance with maturities for the remainder of the year depending on markets and the environment. We are comfortable that we have a number of levers to pull including raising more deposits, reducing the GCE or shrinking funding intensive parts of the balance sheet if that tradeoff is appropriate.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me briefly discuss our credit ratings as covered on slide 14. GS Group is currently rated A-, A3, A and A-high by S&amp;P, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS respectively. As you know, Moody's finalized its rating review of global capital market intermediaries in June, which resulted in the downgrade of a number of firms including Goldman Sachs. Our parent company long-term rating was downgraded two notches to A3 and our short-term rating to P2, which was in line with guidance provided by Moody's to the markets. The long-term rating for GS Bank USA was downgraded two notches to A2 and the short-term ratings for both GS Bank and GS &amp; Co. remain at the P1 level. There was no impact to our unsecured or secured funding and the collateral outflows in our derivatives portfolio were less than $100 million.</p>
          <p>The current macroeconomic environment continues to present a number of challenges for the firm and our industry. We are committed to striking the appropriate balance between serving the needs of our global client bank and remaining conservatively positioned from a credit perspective. With a liquid balance sheet, robust capitalization, conservative funding and a strong risk management infrastructure, we feel very good about our current positioning.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and David and I are now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>David and Liz, good morning. Thank you very much for holding this call, it's very helpful. I have two questions. One I think is pretty straightforward, the other perhaps a little bit less so. So first on the bank, and I did listen to your comments on the earnings call, but what are your plans for growing the bank over time from let's say basically about $60 billion in deposits? There was a $100 billion figure thrown out there, we can talk about that, but also your plans for growing the corporate loan book? I think the commitments are around $70 billion of commitments. What are your thoughts about that over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ryan, first, good morning. And look, you heard me talk about this a little bit on the earnings call last week. So I'll kind of repeat what I said. There's a couple of pieces of our lending, one is to high net worth and one is to corporates. The lending to high net worth has always been part of our business. The high net worth business is an important part of our business. We've always lent money to high net worth individuals. Having the bank on the margin, given the cost of deposits, makes that a more efficient business.</p>
          <p>As far as corporate lending, we &#x2013; again it's now a little bit more efficient because we can do some of it out of the bank and we have cheaper deposits. And so we are opportunistically looking for places where we have clients who are in need of funding that we have where it is well-structured, as safe as possible, and profitable. And that's really what we're doing. It's not a change in strategy. It's just looking for opportunistic ways to grow our deposits where we can, and therefore, grow our loans on top of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second one, which I'll admit is more complicated, you have been very clear that you've got a pretty muted outlook for the FICC business industry-wide because of all the macro factors. So if we were to look at FICC revenues back in 2010 relative to now, they're down about 30%. Could you talk a bit about what you have done or not to right-size the platform? I mean you've got levers. You've got comp or you've got staffing levels. I don't think what I've heard out of you is some of the noises that have come out of other firms like Credit Suisse, for example. So if you could just talk a little bit about how you think about the shape of your platform on a going-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So this is a tough question because we, of course, very much think that the business within FICC are largely very good businesses. We think that we are at somewhat cyclical lows in those businesses. You've seen a couple of instances over the last few years where there's been a little bit of pickup in the views of the macroeconomic environment. And of course that business has done significantly better in those periods. So we're not, in any way, negative on that FICC business. In fact, we're quite positive on the business going forward. As I said, we think it is &#x2013; we know it's a cyclical business. And I've been through a lot of cycles and it always &#x2013; when you're in them, it always feels like it's never going to get better and it always does. You just never know when.</p>
          <p>In the meantime though, we are in some ways in cyclical lows in some of those businesses. And so, we have to do what we can. We announced last year across the firm, not just in FICC, $1.4 billion of expense reductions which were part people and part non-comp expenses. And we &#x2013; on a run rate basis executed all of that last year. We announced last week that we expect to have approximately $500 million more of expense reductions over the course of this year. So you add those up it's nearly $2 billion of expense reductions. And so, I think that's what we're doing to try and right-size this business without giving up all of our business &#x2013; without giving up the upside that we think will invariably come.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David. Hi, Liz. Thanks for doing the call. I think that all of us on the fixed income side find this very helpful. Just to follow-up on, first of all on your comments on slide 7, on the excess liquidity, Liz you'd said that there's a surplus over the requirements here. Could you talk about how much that surplus is as a multiple of what the requirements are? How that changes over time? Because the figure seems to keep &#x2013; to be pretty constant over the past several quarters but there's obviously some variation there in the requirement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're correct that our GCE has been running around roughly this level for some period of time. And then, look, that's consistent with our view that this is one of our most important liquidity policies to protect us in a crisis. And as we talked about on the slide, it's based on a number of factors including the model that looks at the various potential outflows of cash and collateral in a crisis, looking at intra-day requirements, and then a cushion. And the cushion is probably the hardest and most intangible feature there. I'd say that cushion is meant to serve both a defensive position and an offensive position. Clearly, in this environment we're very happy to have that excess be a relatively large number. But we also feel good knowing that in a period of growth we'll have the ability to deploy some of that excess into growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>We haven't released the size of the aggregate of our requirements and I don't think we intend to do so today. But we feel very comfortable with the size of the overall GCE relative to the sum of those requirements. And, in fact, probably could argue it's slightly bigger than it needs to be even in this difficult environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second point, and it's a larger issue, for those of us in fixed income, we're looking at your equity price which has been pretty constant around where it is for a while. And our biggest concern is that the company will somehow in the near-term make an attempt to unlock some more shareholder value either by issuing debt and doing a large buyback, or changing the corporate structure, or some other type of event. Can you give us some comfort that, that's not in the cards for Goldman?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Here's the one thing I will tell you. You've heard us say this over and over again, when we look at financial institutions, the single biggest risk that a financial institution has is liquidity. I think if you talk to any senior person at Goldman Sachs when you said, what is the single thing you focus on the most, you would hear liquidity, liquidity, liquidity, and then we get to page 2 of our list of things. And so I think the chances that you're going to see us do anything that hurts our liquidity or that puts us in a position where we are not very, very comfortable with our liquidity is very small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Satish Pulle with ECM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I had a quick question about your Level 3 assets, please. When I look at your 10-K for December 2011 compared to, let's say, December 2010 it's about $45 billion altogether Level 3 assets. I guess my question really is what can you tell us about the age of the assets in that Level 3 group? Is there a lot of churn in them? Or are you basically carrying four, five year old assets in that group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are obviously very focused on our balance sheet and the liquidity of our balance sheet overall. The mark-to-market discipline, as we talked about, is an important one for risk management and for facilitating turnover on our balance sheet. We do focus on the turnover. We generally have very high velocity of our assets and high turnover of our assets, especially relative to a more traditional bank. Each of our businesses is subject to aged inventory limits and associated fines, frankly, when they're over those limits. And we would note that just 20% of our inventory, both the flow and investing side of the business is held greater than 180 days.</p>
          <p>And so when we look at the Level 3 assets there are some of them that are stickier and are there for a longer period of time, but we think when sized relative to our overall balance sheet relative to the funding quality that we have in term against the term of those assets and the capitalization we have in place, we're very comfortable with our balance of Level 3 assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And the only thing I'll add is that there are some assets that by their terms are longer-term assets and are Level 3 so for example, all private equity investments by definition are Level 3 assets and those would be on our balance sheet for three to five years. So you'll see some portion of the Level 3 assets would be longer-term assets but that's by design and that's the only thing I'd add to what Liz said.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hello, David. Hello, Liz. I wanted to ask you guys just to discuss briefly how you're thinking about the coming collateral requirements as OTC derivatives are put up onto clearinghouses? How do you expect this to go? Some of the numbers I've seen are very big. I think the OCC and the ISDA are out there with a range of somewhere between $1 trillion and $3 trillion and Risk Magazine is out there with a number closer to $7 trillion and it just seems to me there's not enough general collateral in the market to satisfy this sort of demand. Do think those numbers are even close to right? How are you thinking about the collateral requirements that you guys are going to face? Will you be posting securities or cash? And how does this affect the way you think about the global core excess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, look. I think there's a lot of change going on around central clearing. We are certainly supportive of moving to more central counterparties if that's structured correctly and structured thoughtfully. As you've said, I think there's still a lot of unknowns here and I think in many ways two soon to evaluate exactly what the impact is going to be.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we have seen some of those same numbers that you have, that those numbers could be very big. Look, we have had a very active derivatives business for a long time. Collateral is a very important part of that business so we're very experienced in posting different forms of collateral. But beyond that, again, I think we've come back to the fact that we're very conservatively positioned and have lots of dry powder and an ability to handle whatever comes our way. But other than that, I think really too soon to know what the details are going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll be interested to see how that goes. I also wanted to ask you a follow-up question about the fungibility of your capital within the firm? You've got about &#x2013; what is it? Like $63 billion of TCE? I know we're all supposed to think in terms of Basel III these days, but it does always help to sort of go back to the well with the traditional measures. $20 billion of that sits at the bank and from what I can tell, another $20 billion sits at Goldman Sachs International and another roughly $12.5 billion sits at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., that's what I've been able to figure out from your Q. I just wonder how fungible those capital buckets are between units? And if I've missed any other big units or big pools of capital within the firm, where do they sit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think you've probably got a handful of the biggest ones, although there are probably a number of others around the globe as well and I'd say a couple things. First, the regulatory requirements for a lot of our subsidiaries in various regions around the world also continue to evolve, as they do on a global basis. We have long had the practice of ensuring that we have appropriate amounts of capital, as well as liquidity, at all of our subsidiaries, in addition to keeping an appropriate cushion at the parent company. And the fact that we're running such a large capital and liquidity position has enabled us to do that over the years and that's where we are today.</p>
          <p>I do think the capital rules may make the capital and liquidity, for that matter, less fungible across legal entities going forward. But again, I think, one, those rules are still evolving, and two, we will continue to make sure we keep an excess in various places to enable us to have as much flexibility as we can, as those entities evolve and the rules evolve.</p>

          <p>Your next question's from the line of Dave Knutson with Legal &amp; General.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thanks &#x2013; I'll &#x2013; I want to thank you for the call and I look forward to future calls. Quick question on the deposit level of the bank, it has grown a lot, as you noted in the slide deck. Where do you think it actually ultimately ends up? Is it &#x2013; is this something we should see growing by another 100% over the next year or two? Or is this kind of the right size at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the way I think about deposits is that they are a very interesting funding source for us to tap, both in terms of the diversity, so it's a new source of funding for us, as well as the term we've been able to access, and a term that we think is relatively attractive for the assets that we have in the bank. As you know, that number is in the mid-50s now. I do think there's room for it to grow. We've raised about $11 billion of deposits year-to-date, so I think to really continue to focus on the quality of those deposits, I would not expect the pace at which we issue them to increase materially from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you mentioned that you would be opportunistic on unsecured funding for the second half. I was wondering, is there a particular kind of scope that you would think would fit you well if market conditions present &#x2013; is it in the $5-ish billion or $10-ish billion or $20 billion range? Or is &#x2013; could be a bit more &#x2013; give maybe a bit more information on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So just to review what we've done year to date, we've issued $13.7 billion year-to-date versus about $15 billion maturing, and as you know, our view on funding has always been to raise debt opportunistically when we see attractive opportunities in the market and again, attractive for us around funding means term and diversity.</p>
          <p>When you look at where we are today, we have about $9.4 billion of long-term debt maturing over the remainder of the year. Looking at the other factors, we have a strong liquidity position, I think we're very happy with the term and the amount funding we have, relative to the demands on the balance sheet. And so I think what you'll see us do is continue to review the environment and the opportunities that we see in the markets.</p>
          <p>Obviously the market is a little bit more challenging today that it's been in the past. And as I said before, I think we have a number of levers that we can pull, whether that's reducing the GCE a little bit, using some of the deposit growth to funds some assets, or perhaps even reducing some funding-intensive assets. But again, the gap that we're talking about is really just $9 billion that's maturing in the latter half of the year and I think we certainly will issue something against that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a quick question, that would be out of the holding company, never out of the bank, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To date, the vast majority of our unsecured debt issuance has been out of the parent company. We've done a little bit out of a broker dealer. We have not yet done anything out of the bank, so I would expect that virtually everything, if not everything we do in the latter half, will be out of the parent company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then one last question on the liquidity portfolio, $174 billion, when you say it's convertible into cash in a matter of days so this portfolio is somewhere in the high 90's comprised of Treasuries or GSE type, a little more detail maybe on the liquidity portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So about 30% of that is cash and that's not all of the cash on the balance sheet but it's cash that we have in entities or accounts where we think it's operationally appropriate to assume we could access that cash. Another 45% of it is U.S. governments and agencies, and then the rest is between again U.K., German, French, and Japanese government with the largest part of that being the German government portion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And all relatively short duration I would imagine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All relatively short duration. As I said, a good portion of those are actually just reversed in overnight so if you do nothing the following day that reverse unwinds and we get cash back.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I just wanted to echo Dave's comments as well, we really appreciate the call and the color. And actually, Dave asked one of my questions so I'm just going to have one final one for Liz. Now when you were talking about your model liquidity model that you use for allocating your liquidity pool among the subs, I was just wondering if it's &#x2013; if it, I know you specified that it has to do with kind pre-funding or for anticipating funding but does it also involve some kind of value at risk estimates? And what I'm trying to get at is, to an earlier question about the flow between subsidiaries and the ability to move that liquidity pool among subsidiaries, I was just wondering how much value at risk calculation goes into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question. So the first thing I'd note is we do hold portions of that GCE at the various key entities around the firm including the parent company. But the parent &#x2013; it's across the parent company in our major international banks and broker-dealers. And each one of those entities runs a similar calculation to the MLO to help size what they need in their entities. We think that's appropriate both for prudent risk management and making sure we're focused on all of our counterparties and regulators around the world.</p>
          <p>In terms of whether there's some sort of a VAR in there, I guess the closest thing I'd say we have to that is something we've been working on that essentially looks at the sensitivity of liquidity, our liquidity to moves in the market.</p>
          <p>And so if you think about, for example, if equity markets move, we could have to post additional collateral to exchanges or to counterparties as part of repo transactions. And so, we're able to measure an impact from market moves again on collateral and cash requirements. That is a portion of the model. Again, the other parts of the models look to customer behavior, counterparty behavior, and to contractual outflows. But I think that last piece is probably the closest thing we do to what it sounds like you're describing.</p>
