          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen. My name is Tom and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV Group's Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed in a mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer period.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you operator, and thanks everyone, for joining us for our second quarter 2008 financial results and outlook conference call. With me on the call today are Chase Carey, our President and CEO, Pat Doyle, our CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America, and Larry Hunter, our General Counsel.</p>
          <p>In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Chase and Pat for some introductory remarks, but first I'll read to you the following. On this call, we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>
          <p>These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in each of the DIRECTV reports &#x2013; annual reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures, to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>These schedules are attached to our earnings release and are posted on our website at directv.com. With that, I'm pleased to introduce Chase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon, and thank you, everybody, for being with us today. The second quarter for us was another solid one. The headline result in the quarter was probably a doubling of cash flow before interest and taxes from a year ago, which reflects our progress in driving our cash flow to the level that begins to reflect the true value of DIRECTV.</p>
          <p>Our revenue and profit growth also continued to meet or exceed our targets. In fact, most of our key performance measures were in line or ahead of our targets. A look at the U.S. first, our gross adds were strong as we largely mitigated the ending of our BellSouth bundling agreement on April 1. Equally importantly, we continue to attract quality subscribers with our brand and constant leadership. Churn continued to improve from a year ago, although we are seeing increased competitive pressure in the market as our competitors spend more on marketing and offers. Our ARPU growth was also strong, driven first and foremost by ongoing strong demand for advanced products for new customers as well as existing ones. Most of our costs were either in line or at least trending in the right direction. Upgrade spending was one area in particular where we really began to get on top of that investment. SAC was also on target, although we are incurring higher sales costs as we target the right customers and increasingly competitive market. However, we've been successful in finding savings in other areas of SAC to keep the overall costs in line.</p>
          <p>One expense that appears out of line on a year-to-year basis is G&amp;A. That variance is skewed by a onetime $25 million positive last year, related today a hurricane &#x2013; hurricane Katrina insurance settlement, and a onetime expense of about $15 million this year related to taking control of one of our major field service companies one called Premiere. Excluding these items, G&amp;A was in line.</p>
          <p>Again, overall a good quarter in the U.S. That's not to say we don't have plenty of areas needing improvement. Service levels are not where they need to be. Our dollars being spent on acquiring or saving customers can be targeted more efficiently, and we're certainly working on that. There are market segments like MDU, where we are still underperforming. But we're at least making headway in all these areas.</p>
          <p>Turning to Latin America for a minute. The quarter can be summarized probably in one word. Growth. Every key financial measure from revenue to profit to cash displayed excellent growth. Key metrics like subscribers and ARPU also had outstanding growth. Our costs were well managed too which contribute to our bottom line success. The one Q2 metric that looks problematic was churn. What were two items skewed the year-on-year comparison. First, we had a onetime event related to the completion of merger of Sky and DIRECTV in Brazil that led to the elimination of 20,000 subs. Second, our prepaid business expanded in the region. The prepaid business, which we described in depth at the Investor Day, operates on different principles in the core business. The net SAC is under $100. The consumer proposition is geared to allow the customer to go in and out of service on a regular basis, leading to a higher churn based on our accounting rules. Since our SAC is low and there's no cost reactivating the customers, this is a very good business for us even if the customer churns in and out regularly.</p>
          <p>Excluding the onetime event in Brazil and the prepaid business, churn in the region was actually down a touch from the first quarter. That being said, Latin American churn is running above our expectations for the year. Market disruptions like strikes in Argentina in the last quarter were a factor in higher churn. Increased competition in certain areas from the like of TelMex and Telefonica are also a market reality we deal with. We do feel we're dealing with all those factors.</p>
          <p>The political situation in Venezuela related to getting cash out, or boxes in, continues to be an issue, it ebbs and flows. But nonetheless, all the things considered, we feel great about the momentum of our Latin American business and its future. In Latin American business, we don't consolidate Mexico, but just a quick comment on Mexico. It really continues to be a juggernaut and certainly growth in subs, revenue profit really across the board continues to be essentially the story about our Mexican business. In sum, a solid quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll ask Pat to make a few more in depth comments about Q2, then I will be back to make a couple of closing comments on the rest of the year before questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Chase. Like Chase I also believe we had a very good quarter both in the U.S. and Latin America, particularly considering the numbers we've seen from some of our competitors, and the slower economy, we thought DIRECTV's numbers were solid. Then moving to the first quarter, the highlights from Q2 were the strong churn and ARPU results combined with discipline and cost control drove significant cash flow growth. But at the same time, we still have areas of our business that need improvement, and I'll touch on those in a moment.</p>
          <p>Starting with DIRECTV U.S. subscriber growth, our net additions of 129,000 were consistent with prior year results and our expectations. We were pleased that our gross additions were essentially flat with last year, particularly considering that we lost the 70 to 90,000 subscribers that came through the BellSouth distribution channel each quarter. Although we fell a bit short of our target in the former BellSouth territories, we more than made up for that shortfall with strong results in the rest of the country. In fact, all of our key channels had year-over-year growth except those through our telco partnerships. Our direct sales channel was particularly strong as it contributed almost half of our gross adds.</p>
          <p>And we also saw solid growth from our independent and national dealers as well as from our commercial business. Some of this growth was related to the increase in direct sales marketing expenses and dealer incentives in the quarter, which help explain why our cash SAC of $707 was a bit higher than the prior year. We feel comfortable making these investments, because these marketing and dealer expenses are directly linked to the acquisition of customers with higher credit scores and advanced products.</p>
          <p>Regarding churn, a majority of the improvement came from lower involuntary churn. As we've talked about on previous earnings calls, our ongoing efforts to tighten credit policies have resulted in a higher quality subscriber base, which in turn drives lower churn. The primary driver of the improvement is lower first year churn, which is a particularly important metric to focus on in a slowing economy where a company may be more vulnerable to unfavorable trends.</p>
          <p>Although we are pleased with the progress made in reducing churn for shorter tenured customers, we think we can do a better job in reducing churn for longer tenured customers. This will be a focus for our company in the second half of the year as we introduce new loyalty programs for our most valued subscribers.</p>
          <p>Investors often ask how much more can we lower DIRECTV's churn rate, or what is the optimal level of churn. This is a difficult question to answer in isolation, because the answer depends on many variables, including ones beyond our control, such as the competition and the economy. Having said that, we're comfortable with monthly churn on an annual basis in the 1.5% range. But as we showed in the first half, we're constantly analyzing opportunities to improve both voluntary and involuntary churn.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we're on track to meet that goal in 2008. However, as Chase mentioned, churn will be seasonally higher in the second half and will probably look a lot like the absolute levels we saw in the second half of 2007.</p>
          <p>The solid subscriber growth combined with a 7% increase in ARPU drove revenues up 13% to 4.2 billion. Consistent with recent quarters, the ARPU growth was driven by price increases and strong growth in HD and DVR services. We now have more than 7.5 million subscribers with advanced services, or 40% more than we had a year ago. And they're paying us about $100 per month.</p>
          <p>I might also point out that we added three to four times as many HD and DVR subscribers as Comcast added in the quarter. Although we've recently had quarters with 8% ARPU growth, we're happy with 7% growth, because if you recall at our Investor Day, we mentioned that our longer term ARPU target was more in the 5-plus range.</p>
          <p>Similar to our competitors, we booked less Pay Per View and event revenue in the quarter. We're also starting to see some trends that will continue in the second half and into next year. For example, we're collecting less upfront equipment fees from our customers. Our practice has been to pass along the set-top box cost savings to our customers via lower upfront equipment fees. As a result, any ARPU decline related to lower upfront fees is essentially cash neutral, because it will be mostly offset by lower CapEx for set-top boxes. Another trend we're starting to see relates to the smaller favorable impact resulting from our HD and DVR growth as our base gets larger and larger. In other words, assuming that we don't increase our pricing or penetration rates, each incremental point of HD and DVR penetration has a smaller impact on our ARPU growth. All of these trends were predictable and consistent with the longer term ARPU outlook provided earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to profitability and cash flow. I thought we had another solid quarter in terms of managing costs and generating cash flow. We mentioned in the earnings release that excluding a couple of onetime items, OPBDA margin increased 153 basis points to over 29%. This margin expansion is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter and what we expect for the full year. And like the first quarter, most of the benefit came from lower subscriber services costs, while we continue to hold the line on our programming margin.</p>
          <p>Unlike the first quarter, however, our G&amp;A costs were higher than the prior year due to the $25 million benefit that Chase mentioned last year, along with the $15 million charge related to the shutdown of one of our larger home service providers.</p>
          <p>You may recall that last month we completed the acquisition of 180 Connect, which serviced approximately 15 to 20% of our orders. We now have integrated their more than 3,000 employees into DIRECTV. In that same timeframe, we terminated an agreement with another HSP due to performance issues. The $15 million charge reported in the quarter covered the costs incurred to ensure an orderly transition of the work performed by the terminated HSP, including the write-off of receivables and other miscellaneous expenses. Excluding this charge, our G&amp;A costs as a percent of revenue were relatively flat year-over-year at around 5%, which is consistent with our full year target. But perhaps the most notable trend in the quarter was the 35% decline in DIRECTV U.S. CapEx reflecting almost a $200 million reduction in costs from a year ago. This decline in CapEx can be explained by three main trends.</p>
          <p>First, the rapid decline in set-top box costs combined with increased usage of refurbished boxes. Second, a leveling off in demand for advanced services from our existing customers. And finally, the winding down and nearing completion of our HD and satellite expansion plan that we began about three years ago. The reduced CapEx, combined with our higher OPBDA, drove up more than doubling of cash flow before interest and taxes for DIRECTV U.S. to over 600 million.</p>
          <p>At the consolidated level for the first six months of this year, our total free cash flow, which includes Latin America, taxes and interest, is 729 million, or three times last year's free cash flow. This number includes our first ever dividend from Sky Mexico of 32 million, and a roughly $65 million tax benefit related to the economic stimulus package. We didn't recognize a benefit in the first quarter, so this amount represents about half of what we intend to realize for the full year.</p>
          <p>Also in the quarter, but not included in our free cash flow number, was over half a billion dollars of stock repurchases. Through today, we have repurchased over 6 billion in stock in the past two and a half years.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we're very excited about the financial results at DIRECTV, both in the U.S. and Latin America. We expect to take this company to a whole new level in terms of profitability and cash flow growth, and we think the first half results are entirely consistent with this bullish outlook.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Chase for some closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pat. Looking for a minute beyond the numbers, we continue to make progress in an array of key operating initiatives. We launched our on-demand product at the end of last quarter, at the end of Q2, and that will be an expanding part of our story going forward. Our newest satellite went into operation last week, giving us significantly more capacity, and before year-end we'll move to over 130 HD channels, that should be well before that. And about 120 local HD markets, representing well over 85% of the United States.</p>
          <p>We continue to bring new and exciting content to our customers, like expanded Olympic or PGA, U.S. Open Tennis coverage all in the next month, or exclusive premiere of the TV series, Friday Night Lights, in about two months. As Pat touched on, we've taken ownership now of actually about a third of our field service organization in just the last couple of months, and that will enable us to more efficiently and effectively really build that service as a unique strength.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial outlook for the second half of the year. We're comfortably on track with the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year. The problems with the general economy, continue to have a limited impact on us. I would not say no impact, but it's certainly limited. More significant, our competitors have clearly stepped up their spending. We're competing quite successfully in this more competitive environment, but it does mean we will spend a bit more in areas like offers and sales to do so. We expect revenue, OPBDA and cash to continue to be strong. Subscriber growth should continue to be solid, and we expect second half sub growth to be around the first half level. As Pat touched on, second half churn should be sustained at about the level it was a year ago. We should continue to make progress in improving efficiency and effectiveness and managing key costs like upgrades, service, and programming. ARPU will be impacted a bit by increased spending on offers, but will still be north of 5%. I mean, really, overall, we feel very good about our business and the momentum we have in the marketplace. We feel good about our competitive position, and we're really on pace to hit our targets.</p>
          <p>A quick comment on two additional topics before turning it back to Jon, regarding our buyback. As of today, we purchased about $1 billion of our stock. And finally, on Liberty, there's really nothing new to say about our relationship, essentially it's status quo.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it back to Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And quickly, before moving on to Q&amp;A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call, in a listen only mode. I'd like to remind the media they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call, either directly or in substance, other than representatives of the DIRECTV Group. In addition, we're webcasting this call live on the internet, and an archived copy will be kept on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, I guess to you. Chase, if I could just ask two questions on some of your prepared remarks. One on the retention spend, which you're, as you pointed out, really seeing now come down on a year-on-year basis. How much of that is cost savings on the box side, efficiencies you've captured in the labor involved &#x2013; in rolling trucks or is unit deployment declining a bit on the advance service side into the base? Just trying to get a sense of those levers. And second, you talked about competitors stepping up spending. Is that just across the board, telco, cable, DISH, any more color there would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On retention, it's probably all of that, so it is both. Clearly we are benefiting from harbor costs. We're benefiting from the leasing plan as we've said I think we've come &#x2013; you know &#x2013; it's become a more meaningful part as it rolled out. I think there are efficiencies we've got are more effective. Just some of the &#x2013; we've made headway now where we need to be on the service costs, on the sort of truck rolls, things like that. We're making headway on all of that. But there is certainly a part of it is also really getting on top of it. I think we talked about it, that we had a pent-up demand. We obviously had the MPEC-2 and we I think had said in '06 and '07, we maintained higher box prices and others didn't, we were rolling out boxes. And probably at a point in time we had a block of customers that we had to upgrade and work through. And I do think we got on top of that demand, and that demand obviously continues.</p>
          <p>I mean, realistically, these are products that I think, looking out, have more growth penetration. More in front of it than behind it in both HD and DVRs. But that being said, I think we've really caught up with the pending demand, and it's helped stabilize this. But it is both sides of it. And on the competition, it's pretty general. I mean, I guess you'd say, certainly I'd say it's general. There are probably exceptions to that. I think actually Verizon spent a little less on trials in Q2, and they come back, I mean they're giving away free TVs in the first quarter, and then they go and do it the second quarter, and then they come back with them again in the third quarter. But certainly cable and EchoStar which has a core really pretty much across the board, whether it's just discounting to new customer, saving customer, balance these vis-&#xE0;-vis satellite, that they're being more aggressive. And again, I think we have a lot of strengths to compete with it. But it is &#x2013; we're in a competitive market, and it is a part of what we what we deal with.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse the long preamble here, but if you sort of look at the model that I'm sure everyone is running and the gross adds sort of stay in the range they've been at for the last few years, and churn comes in around the one five range, just mathematically, the net adds just continue to sort of tick down. And looking at your valuation, it seems like the Street is sort of grappling with the long term durability of the business. And so my question is this, if I had to sort of simplify the segmentation in the space right now and sort of the bundle customer goes to cable and value customer goes to DISH and you guys go after the high end customer. And I was just wondering, is there any thought internally of sort of launching another brand or doing something to compete for the value segment to try and get the gross add number up more materially? Is that not in sort of the thought process at all in senior management team? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's certainly not sort of something we're launching in the next month or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean in all honesty, we're not doing our job if we're not thinking about everything. So, I do, I probably &#x2013; a little bit of your perspective, I would probably differ with, because I think you seem to imply probably more of a slowing than I think is appropriate. We did say going into the year we expect net subs to be down a touch, but realistically, we've got great momentum in the market. I mean right now, I very much like our competitive position. I think we've got a lot of wind at our back on a lot of fronts. For all the things about HD, we've got &#x2013; that demand continues to be great. We've got more stuff coming. We're not realistically, we're certainly not in the place where we're struggling to find &#x2013; to hit our growth targets. Again, that being &#x2013; and again, being said, we're not just sort of blindly pursuing growth. Realistically, our ultimate goal is to build long term cash flow in the business. As I said before, that's how you build value.</p>
          <p>But we're quite comfortable with sort of the growth side of the business today and the competitive things we have that fuel that growth. So I think it would probably be more opportunistic as opposed to we wanted today look at something, is there something opportunistic to do, as opposed to sort of trying to need to offset some maturing that is imminent. I think that side of it, that's a tough &#x2013; it's a tough place to be, to not just sort of &#x2013; because you're really talking down there with, competing on price, and that's the challenges I think some in broadband and other, telephony have today, and there are a lot of dynamics. It doesn't mean, again, we don't continue to study the value &#x2013; the low end &#x2013; look at all segments of the market. But I think we like what is the sweet spot for us. I think there's a lot of things &#x2013; the real opportunities for us are to continue to take advantage of the strengths we've got, do a better job on some of the areas we're not doing a good enough job today, and there's a lot we can do now there. So that certainly is &#x2013; and a longwinded back answer &#x2013; answer back &#x2013; clear our focuses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Chase, last I heard, I think the penetration of broadband, wired broadband among your subscribers was not that different than the national average, at around 60 some odd percent, about 50%. But as I recall, it was overwhelmingly skewed toward DSL. Is that still the case? And given the very big share shift that we've seen in the broadband market from DSL to cable, how is that impacting your business? Are you successfully co-existing in those cable homes? Has it turned into a tailwind for you to have more cable availability that's sort of separate from cable video, and how do you see that playing out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess your &#x2013; I think your basic proposition of broadband penetration of our customers, it's generally true, the various numbers, but I think that's a generally true one. And I probably would also say that, I guess your supposition is that DSL, it certainly would be the &#x2013; sort of segmented, where do they get that broadband, DSL would be the largest single segment. Though actually cable is a decent segment, and the one that's grown the most recently is cable. So I was going to say where's the largest growth coming, sort of where our customers are getting broadband, it's cable. I do think DSL is meaningful to us. And in some ways I'd like &#x2013; and sort of saw the same second quarter numbers you did. The competition with those guys ebbs and flows.</p>
          <p>I do think the phone guys have not &#x2013; we'd like to see them focus a bit better on their DSL initiatives. I think Verizon has been a little sort of overly focused, and they even acknowledged it, sort of singularly focused on FiOS, and have said they've got a &#x2013; and I think they will and I think we have a good relationship, and talk about it, I think AT&amp;T likewise. They sort of &#x2013; they didn't compete that effectively back in '04 and '05, and like cable they came back and competed effectively. I think now they've got up, and I would like to see them come back again. That doesn't mean we can't compete in the marketplace. I think it would be a positive for us if they sort of stepped up their game a bit on the DSL side. And I think they &#x2013; I think that's a matter of focus and, focus, discipline and energy, not that I'm saying it's my job to tell them what to do. But we actually are getting broadband, and it is a mix. And as I said, we're getting to an array of places, and I think the core for us continues to be have a great video product and people will find &#x2013; there are enough customers there who want that video product, it's a rich enough product, they care about it and they'll find the broadband solutions in other places. So that probably is how we continue to go at it. I think the strength of it is probably reinforcement of fact that we have grown as much as we have in terms of our customers having cable &#x2013; cable broadband, yet our video.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So first question on the VOD service. I know it's early days still. But I was just wondering if there's anything you could tell us about how many customers are using it, and what their usage patterns look like. And then separately, I know you've spoken in the past about how you've been doing some things together with DISH. I was just wondering if there are incremental ways you can work together with DISH, and what those things are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On VOD, it's early days, and probably we're not &#x2013; try not to put any specifics out there. You know, we just launched it in the last month. And I would say customers &#x2013; it's so small at this point. We've got to get customers hooked up to broadband, and we're doing it. I just got handed some results and they're great. But it's small. I mean it'll grow &#x2013; VOD, I mean VOD is still a portion of the market is nowhere near. I mean it's sort of not something that is high on the list what is driving the marketplace today. HD DVR does really continue to be the things that drive it. VOD matters to a segment, but it's still a modest segment. And I think we'll grow to meet that demand as it evolves, helps it get better product. But it is really something that will grow over a period of the next couple of years, not the next couple of weeks or months. As far as the DISH, there's nothing new. I probably talked about this a lot, I think we will continue to look at things, but from top to bottom, I said there's not a whole lot new to say about what we &#x2013; what we can do or would do with DISH. We do things that make sense. If we can find them today, they've been reasonably modest and that probably still continues to be the perspective. I mean, there are really larger things you could do with satellite, but they get to be pretty complicated, and as such, there are a fair number of issues around them. But we want to make sure we're opportunistic and continue to sort of at least try and aggressively find areas that we could together create value for both of us.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. You had some commentary about your competitors being more intense in promoting more heavily, but it seems like DISH was relatively conservative in the second quarter, and seems to be ramping up now, heading into the third and fourth, and we're seeing more advertising from DISH's standpoint. Is there any sense that their posture helped you guys in the second quarter, and are you seeing any increased competition specifically from them as we head into the third quarter that may give some -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I guess first I track it more. I do get studies. I can't decide off the top of my head so that's my anecdotal reaction is if the customer who watches TV and reads newspapers, right. I certainly would have said, DISH in the first half was spending on a combination of marketing and offers, to get more than they had, I mean they're on TV with ads, things they hadn't really done significantly before, and every time I pick up USA Today, I don't know what their buy is there, but they have got a page in USA Today, and there are places that certainly going in the past would not have been things that they had, so I do think they've actually been spending more, certainly had offers in the market, I mean offers of free programming. I was told a comment was made by Charlie that the free programming may not have been the best offer, but they had an offer there in the first half that was months of free programming. So I think they've had offers. Can they have more aggressive offers? I think my assumption is our industry is going to continue to get more competitive. I think that's the reality. We've said it all along. Whether it's cable or DISH, I think our assumption is it will continue to be more competitive, and I it's right incumbent on us to continue to raise our game. You know, to continue to build competitive strengths and continue to operate as efficiently as we can. So I think DISH will step &#x2013; I expect DISH and I expect cable to continue to be more aggressive. I don't think &#x2013; but I think there's some sort of step function that's changing from one of the guys. I think it's &#x2013; I think they are more aggressive, and I think everybody will continue to get more aggressive in terms of competition. But I think we like our competitive &#x2013; competitive position against all of them. And we will certainly be incumbent upon us to take advantage of it.</p>

          <p>One quick follow up. You said in your prepared marks you could do better on the MDU space. Can you elaborate on that a little more? How big of an opportunity is that, and what do you need to do to capture that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's a big opportunity. I mean, you hear numbers, you know, from people that took 20%, you know, sort of multi-dwelling units. You know, and clearly it's an area we have &#x2013; you know, way under &#x2013; you know, under-penetrated. And there's some like Manhattan high rises are that challenging &#x2013; around the country, and, you know, they're an entire mix. We are clearly not where we should be. We probably didn't have the focus and the organization in place to go after it. It is different. You can't go after it the way you go after a single family home. We've built that organization over the last, you know, 12 months. We also did not have a technological solution that really worked in terms of putting the right cost efficient hardware in place to deliver the right mix content, including HD, if the customers in the building want it. We now have had that for the last six months. So it is really &#x2013; you know it, is a combination of having the &#x2013; you know, the right proposition, you know, the right &#x2013; the right hardware and technology for it. And then an organization that can execute. Really all of that has been in place now. We're not going &#x2013; the definition, it's not something you tackle in a quarter or two, but it's an area of looking out over the next couple of years that clearly there is an opportunity because we are so underrepresented in our market share in any shape or form.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Chase, the Latin America results are just terrific. And so, I think any metric you look at there, is pretty exceptional. I have to believe it's pretty wildly undervalued within your public valuation. Do you have any ideas as to how to unlock the value at Latin America? And then secondly, you mentioned you're up to now $1 billion through the share purchase plan, so I think that implies an acceleration in the pace as this quarter started. Should we be looking for a more aggressive share repurchase pace in 3Q and beyond? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm probably not going to make &#x2013; I probably don't want to make comments on the share repurchase. I think we believe our shares are more than we have. We believe our shares are undervalued. We certainly &#x2013; we have the share repurchase in place to take advantage of that. We're continue to do so. And I guess as I said, we don't really have &#x2013; we haven't changed our approach, our philosophy about that. We do want to be opportunistic and smart about it, but we do think that our shares are undervalued and it's an opportunity for us, given the liquidity that we have. In terms of Latin America, I mean, don't really have any sort of, certainly don't have a specific plan. I guess realistically, what we're trying to do is tell the story better and great more visibility around it, which I think we acknowledged as we were going through the mergers and the like up to '07, at the Investor Day we had &#x2013; in some degree by intent because we knew it was tough to do with the mergers going on. We had not really created the appropriate visibility and understanding around Latin America, and I think we are doing a better job. I still think obviously we can do &#x2013; we continue to do more, continue to provide better visibility to it. But I think that's the primary focus. I'm not a big fan of sort of people ask sort of about spinning it off, sort of financial engineering to create values, I'm not a big fan, unless you have a better reason than that. And I think the entities that sort of try to do that, financial engineering to clarify values, more often seem to be &#x2013; seem to have the reverse effect than the positive effect. So I think our focus will continue to be to try to create the visibility and create an understanding of what is the real value and opportunity there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guy, it's James Radcliffe for Vijay. A couple of questions. First of all, it appears that DISH is pretty close to close the gap in the raw volume of HD channels. So how does that affect your HD marketing going forward, if at least for some time you may not able to claim a clear absolute channel count advantage? And do you think that the 1080p channel that they're offering is the differentiator and something you're going to need to match? And secondly, how important is the debate going on about network neutrality to your on demand platform, and do you foresee any risk of that being dependent on third parties for their broadband access could end up constraining that product? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In HD, and I don't know enough, because all I see is the press releases from DISH, so I don't want to get too far into what they've announced, other than I think an awful lot of people have been making, ever since we sort of established its leadership position, claims of what they've got in HD and how they define channels. I mean, some of them define &#x2013; define a game a week as a channel. Some define a Pay Per View event as a channel. There are an awful lot of sort of press releases to muddy the waters. So I'm probably more a believer when we see it in ways that are clear. I think we've got a great position in HD. I think we continue to add dimensions when we do things like our sports packages all in HD. When we have HD &#x2013; when we have regional sports networks, like YES and NESN, we have 24 hour ones, not just a few games a week. I think we've got great strength in that, and I think strength we can continue to drive, including brand strength in it. We obviously have more local, we're going to be in the high 80% penetration.</p>
          <p>Yeah, so I think we've got &#x2013; I think we do still have a position of real leadership, and both in terms of having been there first, having created that leadership position, having created that brand position around it, continuing to add dimensions to it. We do have &#x2013; we announced we're doing 1080p, so it's not &#x2013; I think we are very comfortable with sort of the leadership position we have and we'll continue to be able to drive in the space. The net neutrality, yeah, again, you have to see where that ebbs and flows. It obviously ties in some manner, though, I don't think you get &#x2013; you know, I think it depends on the guys &#x2013; when the cable and phone guys push back on net neutrality, I think which is true, they can't manipulate &#x2013; or there are limits to what you can manipulate to frustrate customers. So I mean net neutrality is relevant and there's certainly going to be I think a lot of discussions and a lot of issues around it. I think customers clearly are going to demand a level of service. So I think as broadband shakes out, I think we do believe that it'll be a good viable part of sort of our ability to lever a full service to a customer. But we'll have to see where all these things shake out in the coming year or years.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. First question is on the former BellSouth territories. Chase, I was wondering how many of those &#x2013; how many former BellSouth DTV subscribers have churned? What have you seen there with those subscribers? And when, if at all, do you expect AT&amp;T may get back to you as to when they're going to make a decision about their partnership in '09? And then following, Pat, I think you said about churn, second half '08 churn, that would be at the total absolute level of second half '07, did you mean the 1.5 million subscribers that churned off in the second half of '07? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On BellSouth, probably &#x2013; I mean, I think the question probably gets into what I consider, probably more specific data than would be &#x2013; we publicly would put out there. It is &#x2013; within BellSouth there's churn just like there is elsewhere, BellSouth's not allowed to target our old customers for it. And so, as with all these places, there is a level of churn, we can beat it back but they have to be generally in the market. They're not allowed to target things there.</p>

          <p>In all honesty, it's a question they have to answer on what their timeframe is. I mean their timeframe seems to be, at this point, the end of the year. I mean, most of it is public. That seems to be the notice &#x2013; the termination notice they gave to DISH on the existing agreement. So that seems to be the time. There's some lead time into that, which they have to deal with. But really that's a question they've got to answer on sort of what's the lead time for their comfort to address it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. So now that the telco channel is going away, and as you look at the mix of all the other channels, clearly you're gaining a lot more traction to direct sales channel. So the question there is, how do you see that mix evolving over time? And where &#x2013; what's your preferred mix over time in terms of the other channels, the independent dealers and the commercial business?</p>
          <p>And separately, I was also looking to get some thoughts, Chase, now that &#x2013; I'm sure this question has been asked over and over, but it seems to be an opportune time to get an update on your thoughts about possible satellite television merger between you guys and DISH, given the satellite radio closing. So now, it seems like the environment has changed substantially, it would appear, since 2002. How do you see that possibility evolving, and are you &#x2013; would you be constructive on such an idea?</p>
          <p>And lastly, any quick thoughts on the possible spin of Liberty Entertainment to merge with DIRECTV? I know that idea has been out there, so I'd love to get your thoughts on that as well.</p>

          <p>On the channels...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we said, I mean direct sales has clearly become our large channel by a large margin, as Pat said, around half our business. We've actually had some nice help in terms of the dealer side of it, and we're supporting it. Actually that has increased a bit. So part of it, I think the telco side has moderated a bit. We'd like every channel to be as healthy as it can. We're going to be opportunistic, the commercial channel is one that actually we &#x2013; a good growth opportunity for us. I think it's up this year be but we still actually &#x2013; I think it's a segment that really with our support and leadership, we should do great. And there's clearly upside for us in sort of driving that. So we're making every channel what it can be. Direct sales is going to be, and is &#x2013; it is the largest. But we are certainly working hard with things like the independent dealer side to create a very healthy relationship with them. And I think we've made nice strides in that regard. In terms of the merger with EchoStar, it's easy to fill a page, or what. But it's nothing. It was really nothing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean don't you feel that the scenario is more &#x2013; I mean, the environment given the satellite radio is now more at least on the table kind of?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think satellite radio is probably, is not irrelevant. I think it's probably, in the theory of it is probably a minor positive, not a major positive, and there are a lot of differences between the businesses. But I don't think it's certainly &#x2013; it certainly doesn't change the world from black to white. So, I don't &#x2013; I think you're overplaying what that &#x2013; the meaning of that decision is. And then the third &#x2013; spin merge. Not a lot. In Liberty, which I think they've said, they have till the end of August, their current status is with News Corp, for tax structures, and so there's really nothing, as I said, in the opening comments.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, anything has to have specifics attached. I think at this point to say you have got a Liberty entity, that we're, I don't know, 80% something of the value of and us, is probably not anybody's ideal scenario to have two public entities that are by and large, or 100% of one and 80% of the other, is probably not what you logically go out and say, "that's a great construct". But presently it's where we are, but clearly there would be opportunities to create a more rational one. You have got to deal with the issues that come out of it. And we can't deal with them now because we're in a tax situation. So we'll deal with them as we can get there.</p>

          <p>Could you give us some color as to how many subs are coming from cable, how many are coming from DISH? And then can you also give the outline as to the VOD offering? How many hours you have in total, how much are the HD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Probably I would &#x2013; we haven't done is I probably would not give sort of a specific breakdown. They do really come from a broad mix. More cable, more add cable, and we &#x2013; certainly take a meaningful number comes from DISH. Probably, the telcos are so new. There are probably less coming at this point than going, because they're just launching. But, cable and it's a mix of digital and analog, and so the biggest segment would be there, but certainly it really is &#x2013; it's spread across it. In terms of &#x2013; in terms of VOD, I have &#x2013; it's a lot of hours, I think it's in the thousands, 3 or 4,000 on the titles or hours, it's a combination of movies and TV. We are pushing selected events to the DVR, so there's a push component &#x2013; a pull component, through broadband really pushing event movies to the customer. And then we're letting them pull the long tail. But it's a large volume. I think the HD piece of that still is probably &#x2013; we certainly have it, but it's probably small and the HD will grow as, again, it's very early. The numbers on the VOD side of it for us today are not large because we just launched it. We've got customers calling and asking and we're putting the appropriate equipment in a home to hook up your box to a broadband connection.
