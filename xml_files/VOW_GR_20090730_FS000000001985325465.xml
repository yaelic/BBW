          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Volkswagen AG half year 2009 results conference call. For your information, this conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Ms. Christine Ritz, Group Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volkswagen's conference call for the results of the first half of 2009. I am joined today by Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Finance and Controlling; and by Detlef Wittig, Executive Vice President, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Group Sales and Marketing.</p>
          <p>As usual, you can also follow the webcast and download the chart from our website www.volkswagenag.com/ir. Questions can be sent by email or called in. Before we start, I would like to mention that after the speech of Mr. P&#xF6;tsch and Mr. Wittig, we will first respond to the questions of analysts and later answer those of journalists.</p>
          <p>I would now like to ask Mr. P&#xF6;tsch to give a few comments before Mr. Wittig goes into detail of the delivering to customers. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you frau Ritz, ladies and gentlemen, also a warm welcome from my side to this conference call. As you all know, the Supervisory Boards of both Volkswagen and Porsche have agreed upon the creation of an integrated automotive group of Volkswagen and Porsche. This will build on the achievement and history of both companies leading to a stronger, more competitive, integrated automotive group. We fully respect the traditions and history of the iconic Porsche brand.  Together with Volkswagen, Porsche has great potential and will become even more successful creating new jobs in the process. Porsche's independence within the Group is assured. Together we are now working on the final concept covering topics such as the detailed evaluations to take the next steps forward. We anticipate a progressive participation of Volkswagen in Porsche AG, the operating company; leading to a merger of Volkswagen and Porsche SE at a future date.</p>
          <p>Much work needs to be done to achieve these objectives and I would ask for a little patience from your side while we work through the detail. What I can assure you is that we will at all times keep you informed as and when decisions are made. Speaking for Volkswagen, I want to make it absolutely clear that the decisions taken will help to make Volkswagen stronger and more profitable. In addition, we know how important our strong financial position is in securing funding for our financial services activities and we will do all that we can to hold on to our competitiveness in this field.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our report on the first six months. The worldwide financial crisis has continued to impact the global auto industry in particular. The Volkswagen Group performed significantly better than the overall market posting deliveries down 4.4% for the first six months supported by the scrapping incentive here in Germany and positive government actions in China and Brazil in particular. While, of course, we welcome these actions, they hint to a weaker underlying demand, which will be evidenced as we move into 2010.  Operating profit for the first six months proved resilient and came in at &#x20AC;1.2 billion despite the tough market environment.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, which for seasonality reasons is typically our strongest quarter, the operating profit was &#x20AC;928 million. The financial result of negative 437 million reflects in part a lower contribution from the companies we consolidate at equity, plus the impact of lower interest rates on firstly, the returns on our cash balance and also the discounting of long-term provisions. With a negative financial result, profit before tax came in at &#x20AC;803 million.</p>
          <p>The current uncertain global environment -- cash remains king and we have worked hard to reduce stocks further to improve working capital. Automotive net cash flow was strongly positive and automotive liquidity improved to &#x20AC;12.3 billion. Now, I would like to hand over to Mr. Wittig, who will take you through our sales development. Mr. Wittig, over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, welcome also from my side. Ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, developments on the global financial markets clearly impacted negatively the world car markets starting in the second half of 2008 and still continuing in the first half of this year. On this chart here, the world car market, you can see the development of the market this year, by months and also by quarter, in comparison to the previous year.  After a monumental loss of 21% in the first quarter, cumulative, the world car market shows statistically the first signs of relief falling only by minus 14% in the second quarter. And you can see on the chart, June, with a minus of only 9% compared with last year. This leads to a decline of 17% or 18% in the first half year. But I have to add a note of caution here however. As the car market started to decline from May last year.  Statistically, the comparison with last year's figures will show signs of improvement, while in reality the markets continue on a low level result really recovering.  However, on a positive side, we also take note that there are first and strong signals of recovery in China; the mark went up by plus 30% in India and also in Brazil.</p>
          <p>On the next chart we can compare our performance, our deliveries to customers with the trend of the world car market, and in contrast to the total car market our Group deliveries to customers recorded a visible upturn. Under these circumstances we clearly continued to performance comparatively well.  For the first time this year, in May deliveries to customers showed a positive year-on-year performance and growth accelerated in June. In last month we sold 6.5% more cars than the months of the previous year and which led to a positive result for the second quarter, you can see this on the chart, in the second quarter we recorded 1.4% more sales than last year.</p>
          <p>All in all, in the first half year, our deliveries to customers with a minus of 4% were better than the car market. Car market at minus 17, minus 18%, clearly supported by the scrappage incentive in the German market, our sales went up by 19% in Germany as well as by the positive developments in China and also in Brazil. As a result, we are gaining market share globally.</p>
          <p>The next chart demonstrates our global performance by area and it is obvious that we outperform the total car market in all world areas. To the left on the chart you can see North America and to the right, up to the right, Central and Eastern Europe, these markets were hit most. And the total markets there contracted by 33% in North America and 45% in Central and Eastern Europe. While our deliveries to customers decreased by only 12% in North America and 28% in Eastern Europe. We did especially well in Russia, where the market is cut by half actually, and we improved to a position number four, to rank number four in the Russian car market by now.</p>
          <p>The Western European markets in the center, up there. The market shows a downturn of minus 9.8, minus 10% and our deliveries were down by minus 8% suffering mainly from short supply and particularly due to the Polo model generation change. However, with this performance we are also gaining market share in Western Europe. And with the startup of production of the new Polo, our supply situation has improved considerably and we will be able to further improve in the second half of the year. In the two regions Asia Pacific and South America, the Volkswagen Group performed very successfully, expanded sales by 18.9% in Asia Pacific and with 0.1% in South America and this was certainly driven in those areas by China on the one hand and Brazil on the other hand.</p>
          <p>Now turning once more to the deliveries by market areas. Again, as the total result tells us compared to previous year the deliveries to customers of our Group decreased by minus 4.4%, down to 3.1 million cars and with 3.1 million cars sold we continue to get closer to our next targeted competitor, General Motors. They published their sales figures, their deliveries to customers at 3.5 million units, and also closer to Toyota and Toyota recorded 3.6 million cars.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, our deliveries declined by 8%. In contrast, deliveries in Germany were up 18.5% supported, as mentioned before, by the government's scrapping incentive program.  In Eastern Europe and in North America and in South America, we saw two-digit numbers of decline of our sales volume explained in the previous chart already. And finally, in both South America and in Asia Pacific we were able to increase our sales over previous year's results.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the individual brands of the Group. First of all, all our volume passenger car brands did better than the car growth market. And first of all, Volkswagen Passenger Car is our strongest brand, rebounded and sold 2.2% more cars than last year with a number up to 1,949,000 units driven by strong demand in Germany and France, and also in Russia and Poland, and naturally as mentioned before in Brazil and in China. And out of the Volkswagen range of models Golf, Tiguan and the Brazilian Lavida and the Chinese Lavida enjoyed a great acceptance in the public. So the Volkswagen brand enjoyed a rather favorable product mix and at the same time a rather favorable market mix.</p>
          <p>Audi's deliveries were down by minus 9.7%, down to 466,000 cars. This is certainly due to the downsizing impact on the premium segment. However, Audi did comparatively well and outperformed the direct premium competitors and gained market position in that segment substantially. And certainly the addition of the Q5 to the Audi range also helped to achieve this result.</p>
          <p>&#x160;koda's deliveries did decrease by 10%, down to 329,000 cars. Due to weak Central and Eastern European markets, &#x160;koda, for instance in the Eastern European markets went down by 31% while the market was down by 45%. So the Eastern markets is the home ground of &#x160;koda being rather weak and also certainly due to the strong Czech corona.</p>
          <p>SEAT suffered a decline of 15%, considering that the Spanish market was down by more than 38%, this is still a reasonable good performance. SEAT bus is also gaining market share in Europe and recaptured the number one position in the Spanish market.  Bentley was down 52% in the first half year due to the weak luxuries segments, especially in the United States and also in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles deliveries to customers declined by 31% down to 179,000 units in a very weak light commercial market in Europe, the market in Europe is down by 30%. We have to consider, when we look at the Commercial Vehicles sales numbers here, we have to consider that last year the truck and bus business, which we sold in the meantime to MAN, was included in the figures, the 263,000 cars last year included 30,000 cars in the truck and bus area.</p>
          <p>I would like to show you also the development of our total new car stocks worldwide because of the importance of the inventory management and its financial impact on stock development. At the end of 2008 our actual stock, which includes both new car inventory at factory and wholesale level, plus at those at dealer level. So the actual stock was at a level of 1.2 million cars then, nearly a quarter above our ideal stock level. Due to the cut of product in the first quarter and further sales activities to reduce inventory, we achieved a balance situation already by the end of the first quarter, we reduced the stock level by 140,000 cars and since then we managed to lower even further the actual stock situation down to a level of roughly 900,000 cars. And regarding our closely monitored sales and production planning process we will be able to maintain this level during the remainder of the year 2009.</p>
          <p>Now to finish a few highlights on some of our new models which we launched just recently. Those models have contributed to the Group sales success in the first half of this year and provides a strong basis also for our second half year sales performance. On top to the left, the new Polo; internally the A05, the fifth generation of Polo offers the best combination of quality and driving pleasure. In this segment the excellent feedback from our customers was affirmed by close to 40,000 customer orders that we received in Germany so far, exceeding our expectations by far. And in the second half, by the end of the second half of this year in November we will add to the Polo range the three-door version as well. The Audi A5 Sportback is our new five door coupe, was recently shown on the occasion of the 100 anniversary of Audi. It is a new beautiful design, fusing the emotionality of a coupe with the functionality of a five-door car; market introduction will be in September.</p>
          <p>Next &#x160;koda, the &#x160;koda Yeti, here we can simply say this Yeti is compact, likeable, and strong, and had an exceptional positive feedback of, at both press and dealer presentations. We expect the Yeti to become very successful with market introduction starting in August next month. Finally SEAT, the SEAT Exeo ST, sports tour wagon, derivative, complements the Exeo limousine and this is SEAT's first entry to the B-class car segment offering high quality, proven technology, with style and performance, and this SEAT Exeo version has started already early this month. So far for the market presentation, I'd like to return to Mrs. Ritz, please.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Wittig. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, can you take us through the financials please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course I can and let's get started with sales. Revenue, sales revenue, which as you know excludes our Chinese joint ventures which we report at equity in the financial results fell by 9.4% to &#x20AC;51 billion. Scania, by the way, contributed &#x20AC;3.1 billion to sales revenues, meaning that on a like-for-like basis the reduction in revenue was even greater, highlighting the dramatic impact of weak global markets.</p>
          <p>Looking at the details, the drop in sales volume translated into a negative impact of &#x20AC;8.1 billion on sales revenue.  Price was positive at 0.3 billion, while strong sales in Germany only partially compensated for deterioration in the overall mix for a net minus &#x20AC;0.5 billion. The U.K. pound and Brazilian real in particular, led to a net negative of &#x20AC;0.8 billion on currency. Our Financial Services division reported an improvement of &#x20AC;0.7 billion owing to higher sales of leased vehicles.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to operating profit. Operating profit declined to &#x20AC;1.2 billion, that's down 2.2 billion on the first six months of 2008. Unsurprisingly, given the sales figures we have reported, volume, price, and mix had a significantly negative impact with currency proving a further break on our performance of a combined &#x20AC;3.3 billion. Our intense focus on costs continues both with respect to our products but also with our overheads, which led to a combined improvement of &#x20AC;0.9 billion.  Now that we no longer include the earnings from Volkswagen heavy trucks in Brazil, as we sold our facility in Resende, the net positive impact is &#x20AC;0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Showing resilience in the face of a dramatic slowdown in the heavy truck market, Scania came in with a small positive result before the purchase price accounting adjustments resulted in a small loss. And to complete this chart, Financial Services reported a declined of &#x20AC;0.2 billion.</p>
          <p>The next two charts focus on the cash flow and liquidity of the Automotive Division. Operating cash flow improved 27.2% to &#x20AC;6.5 billion. This positive performance is substantially related to a dramatic improvement in working capital of &#x20AC;3 billion related in particular to the reduction in our inventories as Mr. Wittig earlier explained. Our CapEx ratio stands at 5.6%, while the lower revenue impacts the calculation here, it is more significantly also an indication of how we have continued to invest in our new plants in the U.S., in India, and Russia as well as in our multi-award winning powertrain, not to forget exciting new models such as the new Polo, launched on the market this year and next.</p>
          <p>The world will emerge from recession and we are determined to continue to invest in the future.  Investments we are making now will pay off when economy does start recovering. For the first six months of 2009, our reported cash flow from investing activities stood at a net &#x20AC;2.2 billion.  Together, net cash flow for the Automotive Division was a positive &#x20AC;4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to liquidity. The improvement in operating cash flow together with lower cash flows from investing activities due to the inflow of funds relating to the sale of our Brazilian truck business, resulted in a further improvement in the liquidity of the Automotive Division. As at June 30, automotive net liquidity stood at &#x20AC;12.3 billion. That's up over &#x20AC;4 billion versus year-end 2008.</p>
          <p>Gross liquidity for the Group stood at &#x20AC;28 billion at the end of the first half. This strong financial base will ensure that we have the ability to face the challenge of uncertain capital and sales markets while we continue to invest in our future.</p>
          <p>Now, moving on now to the financial performance of our nine brands. Earnings declined across all of our brands with the exception of commercial vehicles, which benefited from the sale of our activities in Resende resulting in a net plus of &#x20AC;463 million. Volkswagen Cars turned around the loss in the first quarter to a positive situation and reported a six-month profit of &#x20AC;260 million benefiting in particular from the pick up in sales in Germany and Brazil.</p>
          <p>Audi's operating result was very impressive; &#x20AC;823 million with a strong margin of 5.7% for the first half, and so far demonstrating the robustness of their business model, the strength of their product portfolio, and the ingenuity of their modular engineering systems. Similarly, &#x160;koda posted a strong margin of 5.8% in the second quarter for an average of 4.1% for the first six months, equating to a positive operating result of &#x20AC;135 million. Good sales performance and higher margin markets were important contributors to this performance. SEAT continues to suffer from the collapse in demand in their home market and showed a loss in this period.</p>
          <p>Given the exceptionally tough heavy truck market, Scania showed a remarkable positive of &#x20AC;48 million and as I said before that's the number before purchase price allocation. Financial Services reported &#x20AC;321 million, that's down 200 million on first half of 2008. And finally, our sales in China grew robustly in the first half such that our joint ventures recorded a proportional operating profit of &#x20AC;294 million, that's up 60% on the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now this leads me to our 2009 outlook, which you can read in detail in the interim report. And as I said at the Q1 call, with our strong brands and young fuel-efficient model range, the Volkswagen Group is clearly demonstrating that it is well prepared for the current economic and market situation. For this reason, we believe that the Volkswagen Group will perform better than the market as a whole and will be able to gain market share during the crisis.</p>
          <p>The Group's sales revenue in 2009 will be lower than in the previous year and rising refinancing costs and worsening mix will serve as an additional drag on earnings. We'll counter this trend in particular, through disciplined cost and investment management and to continue the optimization of our processes within our 18 plus strategy.</p>
          <p>The high volatility of market development does not commit any reliable forecast to be made for the rest of fiscal year 2009. However, based on the extremely weak business in the first six months of 2009, we continue to expect that our earnings will not reach the level of previous years. In the face of these challenges we expect the Volkswagen Group to close 2009 with a profit.</p>
          <p>Allow me here to make a short comment on 2010. While we anticipate that some markets will show growth, this will be balanced by others, where amongst other issues, government support schemes will end, leading us to expect no significant increase in demand in 2010. Ladies and gentlemen, we continue to face unprecedented challenges in the markets. However, I strongly believe that the results I have discussed with you today clearly demonstrate; firstly, the success of our brand strategy; secondly, that the excellent diversity of our global sales is enabling us to balance our geographic exposure; and thirdly, that the improving efficiency of our business is delivering profitable results in the face of an enduring global recession. We know that we have more to do but we believe we are on the right path. As we continue to invest, we will emerge from the recession stronger with exciting new cars married to ever more efficient powertrains ready to meet the challenges of the future.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Group, together with Porsche, is on the path to a sustainable profitable future. I am convinced that with our solid financial foundation we have the right strategies for the challenges of today, but more importantly, also of tomorrow. We believe we can build our company into the most profitable and successful integrated automotive group, Volkswagen and Porsche, together on the path to continued success.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Let's have the first question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our first question is from Gregor Claussen from Commerzbank.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I have three if I may. The first was regarding free cash flow development. Do you think that positive free cash flow in H2 is possible or do you think a negative free cash flow is more likely as destocking in H1 seems to be completed, if I got that right?</p>
          <p>The second question is maybe a few words on the liquidity in the Auto Division, especially the amount of credit lines and how much is drawn, if you can say that, and can you tell us anything about your refinancing needs in 2009 and 2010?</p>
          <p>And the third question if possible, if you just mentioned something regarding the end of scrapping incentives beginning next year.  Did I understand this right that you forecast zero percent growth in 2010 compared to 2009?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  So, we have three questions from Gregor. So the first question is, if we can give some more information about the cash flow development in H2, if we can expect a free cash flow, a positive free cash flow in the second half of this year. Then the second question you are asking if we can give some details on the liquidity and our credit line and our refinancing needs in 2009 and 10. And the last question is about the scrapping incentive, what do we expect for 2010. Will these incentives continue or not. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you permit, I will start with answering or trying to answer the third question, zero growth in 2010?  We do know that the scrappage incentives schemes will have an end, some by the end of this year, some by middle of next year, some going till the end of next year. But in any case, the major push that we have seen, especially in the European markets, will end some time early next year.</p>
          <p>So just as an example, what we do expect that the German market, the German car market will arrive at a level this year of some, say 3.7 million cars. The earlier expectation before we started into this year was 2.7 million, 2.8 million cars. And given that, we can simply say that the German market will return to a level of 2.6, 2.7, maybe 2.8 million cars next year. So we will see a drop in the German market of close to one million cars next year.</p>
          <p>Overall, taking the two years into consideration, Germany will in any case benefit and the German car market will benefit from the incentive scheme, but next year the German market will go down.  Similar trends we will see in France and maybe in the U.K. So as far as the European market is concerned, we expect a lower total market next year as compared with this year.  This may be balanced off by the positive trends in China for instance, and in Brazil, if also Brazil continues the incentive program. So, all in all, we expect more or less a zero growth as far as the world market is concerned next year. Europe, especially Germany going down, other emerging markets are sort of recovering, all in all a zero growth, which does not indicate our expectations as to our growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I would like to continue with the question on free cash flow and clearly our goal is to generate a significant positive net cash flow for the full year, of course. And also referring to our unspecified, let me put it that way, outlook statements on for the profit development. We also have to admit there is some uncertainty on the cash flow side. It should, however, be clear that we are continuing on with our significant movements in terms of bringing the investment level to a level which is more adequate to the sales volume and of course also by continuing our efforts to create a better efficiency for the company. We're also supporting a positive cash flow development and clearly the stock levels are one important element, but there are other areas also, so there is, it is still possible to release further amount out of working capital for the remainder of this year.</p>
          <p>Then I would like to continue with the question on liquidity and credit lines. In this context I should say that we are having credit lines available of more than &#x20AC;20 billion and most of these lines are undrawn</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that was very clear. Thank you very much for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Horst Schneider from HSBC. Three questions if I may. The first one is again a follow up question on the outlook for H2 2009, just to get a better feeling where we are in the next two quarters, would it be right to assume that the second quarter in 2009 was probably the strongest quarter in terms of profitability, or is there any chance that Q4 will be even stronger?</p>
          <p>Then, second question is regarding the PPA depreciation resulting from Scania, you are not showing that in your quarterly report and I would be interested if you could give any indication what was the PPA depreciation in the first half of 2009 and maybe you could provide also an update on the outlook of the depreciation issue?</p>
          <p>And third question is regarding your production plans for the third quarter; you should have by now pretty detailed plans for the Q3 production. So I would be interested if there are any planned shut downs in Q3 and maybe you could provide also an outlook for the fourth quarter on production volumes, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Horst has three questions for us. The first question relates to the outlook 2009, if we can explain or if we can give some more information, if the second quarter is our strongest quarter, what do we have to expect in the upcoming quarters. Second question is the PPA for Scania, if you can given some more information what &#x2013; how much is the PPA effect in the first half of this year and probably we can give an outlook for the full year. The third question refers to our production plans for the third quarter and for the rest of this year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to the question whether the second quarter was the strongest quarter. I think in principle terms, first of all, if were talking a normal year then as the term says normally the second quarter is indeed the strongest quarter, purely the seasonally and normally also on the basis of a higher number of working days.  So, in principle terms this also should hold true in this year of course. Saying that means that that's always on the basis of a very cautious economical outlook and I think from today's point of view we clearly have to say there are only very little, more weaker than stronger signs, that we might see any mentionable recovery through the remainder of the year. So that should mean that the second quarter indeed also for 2009 should remain the strongest quarter profit wise.</p>
          <p>Second question as far as the PPA effect is concerned in rough terms, we would assume anything around 200 million for the full year, as the PPA effect and the number for next year should be in the same category. And while I am talking about the number this is an after-tax number.</p>
          <p>Now, to the third question on production schemes; you certainly have recognized that the relative development of production in the first six months compared with the year 2008 development was much more pronounced than, for example, deliveries to customers, as an example. And this of course means as we have brought stock levels to a more ideal situation that we have to step up production in a certain way. Already in the third quarter and also the relative development should also be less pronounced in the fourth quarter compared with the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Let me just remind you that as we were a little bit overstocked at the end of 2008, we took a few very significant cuts in terms of production capacity in the first quarter, so that's something, of course, on a cumulative basis we are carrying through the year. It also means that as stock levels are more normalized now, we have to bring production on to a level which is more consistent with the deliveries we execute to the customers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's have the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Thierry Huon from Exane BNP Paribas.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. This is Thierry Huon speaking from Exane BNP Paribas. One question about the preferred shares.  I think it's not possible at this stage to make any right issue without having the approval of extraordinary shareholders' meeting; could you confirm this point? And to indicate if you need to have the approval of the shareholders of the pref or it could be voted, should be voted well, from the shareholders of the ordinary shares. This is my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one is about the impact of the scrapping measures in Germany. Do you have any ideas of the number of cars that you have sold during the first half thanks to this scheme? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Thierry. You have two questions for us. The first question is if we can comment on a possible capital increase and you would like to know if the preferred shareholders have to approve such an approach, such a decision. The next question is about the impact of the scrapping incentives in Germany if we can give some more details here.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the last question first. I think it's better to compare order entry volume rather than delivery to customer volume because, as I mentioned earlier, with the demand going up so quickly in Germany no one of the manufacturers really was able to follow this immediately. So when I look at the order entry numbers that we had in the first half year in Germany on Group level, we had roughly, say 800,000 orders taken of which were half of them based on the scrappage incentive program. So 50% of the orders came in based on the scrappage incentive. And this is certainly a high number but quite obviously customers saw a chance to make their dream come true and now being able to buy instead of a used car a new Volkswagen, or a new &#x160;koda, or a new SEAT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me refer to your question of capital increasing. I should say at the beginning that the answer is, and you allow me to say the question is on a pure hypothetical basis because we'll not give the impression that there is anything concrete because there is no decisions made on any of these points. But essentially based on our current articles of association, the Board of Management is authorized, of course with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital and that's possible until early 2011, by the issue of new ordinary bearer shares against cash, and respectively, or non-cash contributions on one or even several occasions and that's what we have available currently. Any other change of Volkswagen's capital structure, which means additional shares, ordinary and/or preferred shares would require the approval of a shareholder meeting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I may, I would like to know if for the preferred shares you need the approval of the general assembly of the ordinary shareholders or also from the preferred shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will try to consult with the lawyers to give you an answer if it's not possible during this meeting, we'll give you a call on this. As you recognize, it's obviously an issue we don't deal with currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Our next question is from Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim Research. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim. I have a question regarding the financing needs when you take over the Porsche AG. You said that keeping a good credit rating is critical for you. First of all, do you mean to say that you want to keep your current credit rating for sure, or would it be enough for you just to keep an investment grade credit rating? And secondly, what would be kind of the minimum net liquidity that you would see as a requirement for Volkswagen to retain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you very much, Christian. Christian has one question for us, whether we can update our financing needs when we would like to take over or to take a stake in Porsche AG. Christian wants to know if we want to keep our current credit rating and what is our minimum net liquidity, which we have in our mind. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think I was asking for a little patience until we of course will be very willing to talk about also a number of details of any transaction structure. But I do not want to talk about any single details as long as we're not able to present a clear complete transaction model. But in principle terms, answering your question, it is very clear, we think we cannot compromise on the rating issue and that's a very fundamental point.</p>
          <p>And your question on the liquidity. I think if you, if I can remind you to that. If we go back a number of months or two or three years when Volkswagen was sitting on, I think it was somewhere around four or five billion automotive liquidity, you and your friends were always asking me on what the hell we would do with the money. Now, surprisingly in the last period I didn't receive too many questions on that, and that's exactly why I think we should be very cautious in analytically identifying or trying to identify any number which might be on certain premises, the appropriate number as long as nobody can tell us on whether the reality just follows the premises.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's have the next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from John Lawson from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I would like first to follow up Thierry's question to Mr. Wittig about the orders under the scrapping scheme in Germany. Mr. Wittig, can you actually tell us how many of the 400,000 orders that you took have actually been delivered and how many are sitting in a bank waiting to be delivered? And we've heard from some of your peers of a little pricing pressure developing perhaps in the second half. I wondered whether your experience had shown any signs of softening prices as far as the second half is concerned.</p>
          <p>And then I'd like to come to the VW Bank direct deposit business, which I noticed, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, had soared to 19 billion of deposits in the quarter. I guess that one or more of your German peers has also recorded some pretty spectacular growth in this area. It's beginning to look like the German car companies are basically competing with each other for the available pool of deposits. I see a bit of it's beyond one year. I just wondered whether you could update us on the strategy here, since everything seems to have been a bit fast moving. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, John. You have two questions for us, one is for Mr. Wittig. You would like to have some more information about the impact of the scrapping scheme on our deliveries in Germany. So, how many cars of the total number of roughly 400,000 are already delivered and you would be happy if we can give some more information about our pricing policy. The next question is for Mr. P&#xF6;tsch about the business at our VW Bank and the direct deposit business, if we can give an update on our strategy here. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of the order taking volume of 400,000, we have delivered in the first half here, 50 to 60% of it, which simply says that we are going into the second half of the high order bank. And as you know, as we call it internally, the incentive pot in Germany will certainly come to an end, will be exhausted by the end of September. We expect then that we can take a high number of orders out of this incentive pot into next year, into 2009. In any case, we'll have sufficient orders in our system in order to go through the second half of the year of 2009 and even into 2010, as the cars have to be registered only until June 2010.</p>
          <p>As far as pricing policy is concerned, this is certainly a question, you may understand, I cannot answer and I am not in a position to answer, what about the pricing in the second half year. But in any case, when the incentive schemes, the government incentive schemes runs out, certainly this pot will then go away and the question being what will be the mentality, the customer mentality in the market by then. The customers ask for continuing high supports and this is something we will have to watch and monitor closely and we will then by September, October make up our mind as far as the situation in the market is concerned.</p>
          <p>You know, just as one example that we have reduced the manufacturer support on the Volkswagen side when we had the switch from the old model, the previous model generation Polo to the new one. We've reduced the support down from 2000 to &#x20AC;500 and we will have to see whether we can do something similar in any case with new model entries in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the Volkswagen Bank strategy, first of all I think it is important to recognize that over a number of years we were able to create an extremely positive profile of Volkswagen Bank, which made it possible to access very different sources in terms of funding. And customer deposits is just one of these sources and by the strategy we're executing there is room for anything between, roughly speaking, 20 to 30% of the overall funding to be supported by customer deposits. So, I am saying there is very clear strategy. It's of course, not at all the intent to maximize on this but to very carefully compare on an all costs included basis what's the cost on refinancing and capital markets and what's the overall situation with regards to customer deposits.</p>
          <p>And I think looking at, and we are running a lot of service there, looking at the image Volkswagen Bank has with the customers, on the basis of the policy we're executing, and I am clearly not putting this in an arrogant manner but the feedback we are receiving is obviously the perception, the brand perception of Volkswagen and in this respect, of course, also the Volkswagen Bank is extremely positive. And I think it's the fact that we are able to operate very successfully on this basis is just reflecting the situation that this positive image might differ from the image of the one and the other bank in this situation. And that's why I think it's well thought through that we are using and identifying this area as one of the sources for the Volkswagen Bank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you very much, Philipe.  So, one question is, if we understood it correctly, how much earnings came from kurzarbeit, or short time worker, is that correct Philipe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well how much savings were you able to achieve on your labor cost by being able to use kurzarbeit in Germany?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay then let's continue with the next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Michael Punzet from DZ Bank.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Michael Punzet, good afternoon. I have two questions first one is relating in terms of Chinese market. You mentioned earlier that the markets also benefited from a government aid program. Maybe you can given us an update of what the effect on your figures and maybe some more information of when this government aid will run out and what do you expect after this?</p>
          <p>And the second question is with regard to your tax rate, you showed a very high tax in Q2. I think that's mainly related to regional effect and maybe you can provide us with update for the full year tax rate. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Michael has two questions for us. I guess the first question is something for Mr. Wittig about the market in China and our expectations and the government support there.  And the next question is if we can give an outlook for the tax rate for the full year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as China is concerned, you know that the Chinese incentive program is first of all targeted at cars below an engine capacity of 1.6 liter. So, from that point of view it is clearly directed to supporting the Chinese, the domestic car industry, while we in general have only 20% of our range is equipped with engines below 1.6 liter. From that point of view, yes, we are taking advantage to a certain extent of that government scheme, but most of our sales increase in the Chinese market is based on new model entry and that is especially, as I mentioned earlier, the Lavida and the new Jetta. The two versions are driving our sales success in the two joint ventures that we do have. So from our point of view, the Chinese market, to a certain extent, is driven by the Chinese incentive program but it is directed towards supporting the domestic Chinese industry while our sales increase is mostly due to new model entries in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me continue with the question on the tax rate and I would assume that you are referring to the very much different situation in the first quarter versus the second quarter, and while in the first quarter the impact of deferred taxes played a very key roles, because that influence was higher than the pre-tax profit. Of course, this situation as the operating profit increased in the second quarter showed us a play back and the almost complete tax effect is now booked in the second quarter where we had to refer to the currently calculated rate for the full year 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me give a little point, I would make a little point here. It is still too early just to give a detailed number on the full year rate. This can change, in a certain way, the next quarters to come.</p>
          <p>Maybe at this point I can also give a little answer at least to the influence of short working in the second quarter. As I think you might be well aware, there was very limited short working throughout the Group in the second quarter. So there is no mentionable influence on the bottom line by this scheme.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Max Warburton from Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I've got two questions, please, but before I ask them can I just refer to the question from Thierry Huon about the pref capital issue. You said that you might contact him directly with an answer. It would be very helpful for all of us if you could publish that. If there is a view from your lawyers about how a meeting might work and whether ordinary shareholders can outvote preference shareholders, it would be very helpful if you could put that in some sort of press release, please.</p>
          <p>Just my two questions, the first one really is on the profitability of VW, question for Dr. P&#xF6;tsch. The profitability is pretty extraordinary for a company that is talking about extremely difficult end markets and does suggest a lot of cost reduction. And the question really is do you think the profit potential of Volkswagen in a strong economy has stepped up a gear? If the company can make 3.5% margins in this environment, I mean, is it fair to say that sort of high-single digit margins may be possible for VW in a better economy? Maybe it's premature to talk about that, but it would be interesting to have your view.</p>
          <p>And then the second question just on pricing, a number of your competitors are saying that your pricing strategy has stepped up a level of aggression that you have competitors talking about new Golfs being sold in the retail channel in Germany at less than &#x20AC;10,000. Would you disagree with that, or would you concur, would you agree that you certainly decided to get more assertive on pricing in this stage of economic cycle? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Max. So, we have three questions again. First of all, this is again for Mr. Wittig about our pricing strategy. If you can add something, we had this question already. The second question is about our profitability of Volkswagen, does that suggest any significant cost reductions or if you can give here some more information. And the last question is again about a possible capital increase and our view on asking, on approval by shareholders or by a shareholder meeting. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, once more the question as far as pricing is concerned. First of all, we have not changed our pricing strategy.  I think we offer value cars at value prices and we haven't changed that. I am listening to you and I am hearing that some of the, of our competitors are complaining as far as our pricing situation in Germany is concerned. First of all, it has nothing to do with pricing. It is the result of the scrappage incentives, both the combined incentive of government to &#x20AC;2,500 plus the manufacturers' incentives. Our incentives are known, they vary from &#x20AC;500 up to &#x20AC;2,500. I can't see any of our competitors who does not have at least a manufacturing incentive scheme of &#x20AC;2,000 or even more. Most in the average of our competitors has an incentive scheme on the manufacturer side that is above Volkswagen. So, from that point of view it is interesting for us to see, to listen to these complaints but again and may I summarize this again: our pricing strategy hasn't changed. In Germany especially, the price level, difference action price level as we call it, is very much influenced by the government incentive plus the manufacturer incentive. The level of the manufacturer incentive on the Volkswagen side is, in any case, not higher than the level of competitors. It's rather below and from that point of view it's interesting to listen to these comments. And I don't want to add more to that.</p>

          <p>Okay, let me continue. First of all, again a question related to any hypothetical capital increase and the foundation there in our articles of association. That's very clear, once we produce an answer we will make sure that it's available to everybody, that it's absolutely clear.</p>
          <p>The other question on potentially higher margin once the economy is a little bit more supportive. I mean, obviously I could take pretty long on this, as this is an issue, which we are dealing with every day, but I'll cut a long story short. First of all, I think the performance is very much related to the fact that the Volkswagen Group and the respective brands of Volkswagen were able to introduce very convincing, cars to the market and that's, in our view, the foundation to anything else. It stands for a reasonably stable situation with regard to residuals and an increasing number of customers, of course, are smart enough to take this into consideration once they take a decision to buy a new car.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that by all the initiatives we have launched years ago, while we never took back and we're still every day fighting on getting costs out of the system, trying to control investments. By all these initiatives, we reached and we're able to establish a significant improvement of profitability of the smaller cars. And in this respect very clearly, Golf is a pretty profitable car and the Polo specifically the new Polo, which got just recently introduced, is not only a great car, beautiful car, it's a very profitable car. And that's one of the core element &#x2013; a few of the core elements which we definitely will also support in the future. The only area where last year and clearly also this year we will have only limited room to maneuver, is the investment side of the business, because as you're well aware we are building new plants in India, in Russia, in the U.S., we have to step up capacities in China. And of course, in spite of the fact that we're trying to create a real lean approach there, but still a plant is a plant. If it has to produce the quality of cars which we think we can't compromise on, it asks for a decent investment. That's why we, of course, are sort of limited but to cut a long story again, I think there are all elements in place to maintain a very robust situation of the Group even in these very difficult times and I think that goes without saying. If there is only a slight recovery of the economy, it means that the company will, in a short period of time, move to another level of profitability.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. One question, just on China, you're clearly showing some pretty strong, healthy <mark type="inaudible" /> profits there. Can you just clarify, are you seeing any cash returns yet or will we basically be seeing that through higher value in your joint venture, were there were any cash dividends in H1?  And then maybe just a yes-no answer on the Audi; are there any one-off asset write backs or anything else of a one-off nature in Q2 results at Audi? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Adam had two questions for us.  So the first question was again about China. If you're seeing any cash dividends or if you have seen any cash dividends in H1.  The second question is about Audi and if there are any one-off asset write backs. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the first question on dividends out of China. Yes, quite normally there was a cash contribution out of the Chinese joint ventures in the, the first half of the year. And to the second question, were there are any asset write backs at Audi, no.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from John Bucklin from MS Global. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I am allowed one.  Can we talk about you're saying you expect zero growth for the market. But you didn't really say what your &#x2013; how you respect to perform in that market. Now, given the fact that you've perform very well due to incentives this year, does it mean that you are expecting sort of underperform a little bit next year? And what measures are you taking to sort of guard against any, is there a financial provisions or whatever to help you make a profit next year?  What about this level of inventory? Is the inventories is in line with expectations given current sale rate, but do you need to think about cutting inventory further if sales do have to fall when the German incentives come to an end for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  So, John has a question about 2010, what is our expectation with regard to our growth if we can give here some more information and if we take any measures to prepare us for 2010, if we have to reduce the level of inventories or similar measures.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as our expectation for 2010 is concerned, I earlier explained that as far as the market conditions are concerned, the total market worldwide is concerned, we expect more or less a zero growth situation. There will be growth in China, in India, there will be continued growth most probably in Brazil, but we will see difficult times, as mentioned earlier, with the running out of the incentive programs in Europe.</p>
          <p>As far as our expectation is concerned, as we have done better this year than most of our competitors and as we will continue to launching new model in all our brands, I think we will be able to at least maintain our present position, market position, so that with a total market next year that will be more or less same this year but different market structure. Markets in where we are strong, market leader like in China, we will certainly be able to look at similar volumes next year that we achieve this year. So we don't expect a downturn of our sales volume. But this is all based on uncertainty as far as the total world market is concerned. And as far as the last question is concerned, if we can continue with the present sales rate, then I think the stock situation that we have achieved now is more or less a clean and stable one. We have a very intensive monthly, partly weekly monitoring of our sales and production programming, and if there is a need, for whatever reason, to reduce further inventory we will do so.  We are prepared to doing this but actually we don't see the need for it as we have a very balanced situation, we have arrived at a very balanced situation.</p>

          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch have you been able to, do you need to make any financial provisions against the <mark type="inaudible" /> in 2010?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Our last question is from Christian Hesner from Reuters.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, are you in the line?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Could you answer the following questions?  First of all, what do you value Porsche AG at? Is this roughly the eight billion that has been going through in the press? Would you be interested in Porsche Holding? Should the families be looking for a way to contribute cash to their capital increase if they cannot, since some of the banks apparently are not interested in the contribution in kind? Could you also give us some indication about when Qatar would finally receive the 17% stake that everyone is expecting? And just as far as your credit ratings are concerned, do I understand this correctly that you do not want to compromise at all, that means any sort of decrease from A- to A would be unacceptable? Not even one tiny, little notch? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Christian has a couple of questions about the Porsche issue for us. So, I guess I don't have to repeat it. Value of Porsche, a key interest in Porsche Holding, if we can say something about Qatar's interest and last question again about our rating, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, unfortunately, I can't give you a different answer as I gave to the analyst side, which is that we are in a certain process where it potentially could be damaging if we start talking about any details of something which is still in the process of creation. And therefore, most of the questions you are putting on me, unfortunately, I cannot answer it at this point in time.</p>
          <p>There are two exceptions, one is as far as Qatar is concerned, very clearly Volkswagen welcomes Qatar as long-term oriented investor, as a new investor to our Group, and I think clearly Qatar should be attracted by the concept of an integrated automotive group. And to the second point, I can answer to a certain extent that again the question on the rating side as I said before we cannot compromise on the rating issue. We, of course, we have been undertaking all necessary measures to defend the existing rating and that's exactly what we will continue to do also in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you just be very clear about this Qatar issue; the question was more sort of when you expect them to finally become a shareholder since the time points are not exactly clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I should clearly state about this question, we are not part of the negotiation, that's a negotiation which is to take place between Qatar and Porsche and that's obviously the basis why I cannot comment on this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we have one last question from a journalist.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Daniel Sch&#xE4;fer from Financial Times. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I would like to ask several questions, several of them referring to Qatar and Porsche as well. Firstly, when do you expect to complete due diligence on the Porsche AG? Will it be before August 13 or will it take longer? And as you said, you are not part of the negotiations with Qatar but it's Qatar and Porsche. But when do you expect to first talk, or did you already have any preliminary talks, with Qatar about their future role in the combined group?  And I mean since they will become a shareholder of VW at one point you will have to start talking to them. And when do you -- will you make a formal offer for the Porsche AG and in what kind of steps will you take over Porsche AG? Will it be just one step or will it be several steps as in your press release and how many steps will it be? Will it be just 49% in the first time and then the reminder at the later stage?</p>
          <p>And the last question, once again referring to your credit rating, as you said, you don't want to compromise on that, how do you want to finance the take over of Porsche AG then without endangering your credit rating? Do you want, do you want to do a &#x2013; are you thinking about a capital increase or if you're not thinking about a capital increase, if you want to rule that out, do you want to make any divestments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you very much Daniel, you have a lot of questions, unfortunately I guess, we cannot answer these questions in detail as discussed earlier. So, but nevertheless, I will ask Mr. P&#xF6;tsch if he can add something to that, what we had already discussed and said today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I am a little bit sad about this but unfortunately I think it would really potentially harm the situation. That's why, as I said before, I have to ask for a little bit of patience, again, be rest assured that once there is anything concrete we can tell you, we will clearly invite you for another call or whatever the organization then is to take place. But currently we are working on the final concept, I think I said we have to cover a lot of topics which are pretty complex ones. The valuation is of course one part of this and as far as the transaction scheme is concerned, I gave the hints I can give at this point in time which is that we anticipate a progressive participation of Volkswagen in Porsche AG, which is the operating company as you know, and the whole thing should lead to a merger of Volkswagen and Porsche SE at a future date.  Again, though I am potentially disappointing you, but I can't say more than this at this point in time and again let me say that to your last question, of course once we're able to talk about anything concrete, financing is one important part of that, very clearly, and again, Volkswagen views the rating as a very important element in whatever scheme we would be involved or we would embark on. To maintain the rating is one of the top priorities.</p>
