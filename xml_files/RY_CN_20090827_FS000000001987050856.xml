        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the RBC 2009 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Marcia Moffat, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Moffat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us everyone. Presenting to you today are Gord Nixon, our CEO; Morten Friis, our Chief Risk Officer; and Janice Fukakusa, our Chief Administrative Officer and CFO. Following their comments, we will open up the call for questions from analysts. The call will be one hour long, and we will post management's remarks on our website shortly after the call.</p>
          <p>Joining us for your questions are Barb Stymiest, Head of Strategy, Treasury and Corporate Services; Dave McKay, Head of Canadian Banking; George Lewis, Head of Wealth Management; Jim Westlake, Head of International Banking and Insurance; Doug McGregor, Chairman and Co-CEO, RBC Capital Markets; and Mark Standish, President and Co-CEO, Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>As noted on slide two, our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which involve applying assumptions and have inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these statements.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Gord Nixon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcia, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, I just highlight that we've moved this call &#x2013; this quarterly call earlier to give us the opportunity to discuss results with investors and analysts before the markets open, and of course it is webcast so that people will have the opportunity to hear it later in the day. We think this is a good approach. We think it's best practices. But we would appreciate feedback particularly from the analyst community, as to whether or not they feel it's the right direction to go. So, I would just start out with that.</p>
          <p>With respect to our earnings, I'm of course pleased to report that RBC has delivered record results this quarter. We earned $1.6 billion for our shareholders with revenue of over $7.8 billion and a return of equity of 19.5% and earnings per share of $1.05.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide five, you can see items that impacted our earnings, namely market-related losses and a general provision. Together these reduced our net income by $190 million and earnings per share by $0.13. As you can see our market-related losses continue to subside. Global capital markets continued to improve from last quarter, and we have seen some signs of recovery in the general economy. Of course higher unemployment levels have had an impact on loan portfolios, and the low interest rate environment is keeping pressure on retail margins.</p>
          <p>I believe that our diverse business mix is a key differentiator for our organization. We had strong results from Capital Markets and continue to see very solid performance from our Canadian Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance operations. We continue to take advantage of market opportunities to build on our competitive positions and to drive efficiencies across our businesses.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide six, our capital ratios are extremely strong, both in absolute terms and relative to our peers around the globe. Our Tier 1 ratio is 12.9%; this represents an excess of $10.7 billion over our medium term objective of 8.5% plus. Our tangible common equity is 9.1%. While these levels are high, I firmly believe we should only deploy capital on opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Over the next two to five years I believe there will be plenty of restructuring in the financial services industry. With this restructuring comes significant opportunity. Our strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in our businesses and to grow our asset base at a time when banks around the world will be shrinking theirs.</p>
          <p>With respect to acquisitions, as I have said in the past, we remain disciplined in our approach and are focused on exploring any options that complement our existing businesses and our existing growth strategies. Our priority with any acquisition is to enhance our platform in markets where we have an existing franchise and where we have the ability to generate a strong and reasonable return.</p>
          <p>We are maintaining our quarterly dividend at $0.50 per common share. Our dividend payout ratio in the quarter was 47%, well within the target range of our medium-term objective. A stable and growing dividend, supported by long-term earnings power of our company, is an important component and driver of both short-term and long-term shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>Before I spend some time on each segment of our business, I would like to remind you that we require each of our reported segments to fully absorb the costs of running its business. I touched on this last quarter. We believe this provides a more accurate picture of each segment's performance and incents the appropriate business decisions to be made.</p>
          <p>Just three examples. First, each of our reported segments fully absorbs the impact of interest rate environment on their respective businesses. In other words, our Corporate Support segment does not absorb margin compression. This quarter we began to see stability in interest rates, and we would expect to see rates eventually rise. Mortgage securitization activity is a funding decision at the RBC consolidated level. Thus any earnings impact in our &#x2013; remains in our Corporate Support segment and do not factor into individual sector performance. And third, we fully attribute specific provisions for credit losses to the relevant business segments.</p>
          <p>Banks treat these areas differently, which results in significant variance in segment revenue, net interest margins and earnings across the banks. This variance has been amplified by the shifting interest rate and economic environment, which has made it difficult for investors to properly compare performance of particularly of Canadian retail operations of the various banks.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Canadian Banking segment. This segment again delivered extremely strong results. We continue to grow volumes and profitably gain market share across our business by leveraging our distribution strength and scale. As you can see on slides seven and eight, we grew balances by 11% over last year and have good market share momentum.</p>
          <p>What is equally impressive is that we have been able to support this double digit growth operationally without increasing costs. Over the first three quarters of 2009, our Canadian Banking segment has held non-interest expense flat from the prior year, reflecting our strong cost discipline. This platform delivered operating leverage of 3.1% and an efficiency ratio of 48.1% year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Margins continue to be affected by the low interest rate environment. However, we are seeing stability, and as I said would expect that to eventually turn around. In terms of credit performance, our provisioning levels are within our expectations and consistent with the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>Our Wealth Management segment performed well. We started to see asset values recover and investor confidence return to the market. We had industry leading long-term fund sales in Canada and added over 100 experienced advisors across the platform. Our focus on containing costs in reflected in the decline in non-interest expense from last quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Insurance segment made a solid contribution to our diversified earnings stream and complements our retail product offering. We continue to grow across all businesses and expand our distribution network.</p>
          <p>In International Banking, our retail operations again had a loss in the quarter. However, the credit profile is showing signs of improvement as the rate of deterioration in our loan portfolios has slowed. We remain committed to refining our U.S. banking operating model and to become more efficient and competitive. Our Caribbean banking business continued to perform well.</p>
          <p>Our Capital Markets segment again displayed the benefits of its robust and diverse platform. Our equity, fixed income, money market and foreign exchange businesses all performed extremely well. As Canada's only global investment bank, we are positioned to take advantage of market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 10, we were voted Best Investment Bank in Canada by Euromoney, winning all three categories: debt, equity and mergers and acquisitions. RBC Capital Markets continued to rank number one or two domestically in virtually all our key business.</p>
          <p>Outside of Canada, we have a tremendous opportunity to increase market share and build our client base across our businesses. We retained the number one global ranking for Canadian dollars in the 2009 Euromoney FX poll and our overall market share in FX moved two places in the global league table to number 17.</p>
          <p>As an example of our global fixed income strength, it was highlighted by Credit magazine's 2009 European Credit Awards. Clients voted us top overall and top in a number of individual categories. We won the best overall credit house ahead of JPMorgan. In terms of individual categories, we won the Best Bank for Sterling Bonds ahead of Barclay's; Best Bank for Non-Core Currency Bonds, again ahead of JPMorgan; and Best Bank for Electronic Trading, ahead of Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>I point these out, I know there are many rankings out there, but I point these out to highlight the strength and diversity of our client-based Capital Markets businesses, which we have as you know been building over the last number of years. We continue to hire talent and extend our balance sheet in a disciplined manner and build our customer base.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, our results this quarter demonstrate the strength of our franchise, the value of our diversified business model and our commitment to serving clients. We remain focused on helping clients create confidence for their future by leveraging our expertise and global capabilities. This focus has resulted in greater sales volume and deeper client relationships. Our financial stability and our reputation for prudent management have helped us take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace to attract both new customers and new employees.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, RBC is well positioned for the future. I would like to recognize our employees around the world whose commitment to RBC and our goals continues to be very strong. Their success with our clients certainly gives me confidence that we'll continue our story of growth.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn it over to Morten.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gord. Turning to credit on slides 12 to 15, overall provision for credit losses declined $204 million over last quarter with specific provision for credit losses decreasing by $42 million. This quarter we added $61 million to the general provision relating to our U.S. banking operations. This compares to $223 million last quarter, largely in U.S. banking.</p>
          <p>Let me make a couple of observations about where we are in the credit cycle. As I said last quarter, our homebuilding business was among the first portfolios impacted when the housing market turned downward and economic conditions slowed. Residential builder finance portfolios in the U.S., including ours, were at the front end of the credit deterioration and were impacted earlier than other areas.</p>
          <p>This quarter we had lower provisions in this portfolio as compared to the second quarter. Looking beyond residential builder finance, credit losses typically come off the peak one year after the trough of the economic cycle. This quarter the pace of economic decline in the U.S. slowed, reflecting some signs of stabilization. However, our U.S. banking portfolios will continue to be under pressure until the economy shows the same improvements.</p>
          <p>At this point in the credit cycle, I believe the areas that remain most vulnerable are U.S. consumer credit and commercial banking, including commercial real estate. We have relatively small exposure to both of these areas when viewed in the context of overall RBC loans. In Canada, the high level of unemployment will likely continue to impact credit card and retail unsecured lending portfolios despite the fact that signs of economic recovery emerged during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to credit performance on a business segment basis. In International Banking, provisions decreased by $59 million from last quarter as a result of lower provisions in U.S. banking and the impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar. We had lower provisions in residential builder finance, as well as residential mortgages and lot loans. These factors were partially offset by higher provisions in our U.S. commercial portfolio, including commercial real estate loans.</p>
          <p>Our Caribbean portfolios have not been immune to the economic downturn, particularly in tourism-dependent economies, as seen by the increased impaired loans in our RBTT wholesale portfolio. However, overall provisions remained flat compared to last quarter. As a reminder, our Caribbean portfolio is small and is primarily retail and commercial.</p>
          <p>In our Canadian Banking segment, the decrease of $11 million in provisions from last quarter is mainly due to lower provisions in business loans, partially offset by higher loss rates in unsecured retail portfolios, including credit cards. Credit card specific provisions as a percentage of average loans increased 30 basis points to 467 basis points. This is within what we believe is an acceptable range in light of the sustained recessionary conditions and increased personal bankruptcies.</p>
          <p>Our credit card business is highly profitable. The underwriting and pricing of the portfolio is designed to deliver an appropriate balance of risk and reward through the entire credit cycle, including downturn.</p>
          <p>Canadian residential mortgage provisions remained stable, consistent with historical performance. Despite an increase in impaired loans, we believe losses will remain low. Capital Markets specific divisions increased $32 million primarily related to a single loan as well three other impaired loans, mainly in our Canadian corporate lending portfolio.</p>
          <p>Turning to market risk, we had three days of net trading losses, none of which exceeded VaR. We also had one day of large net trading gains, which arose primarily from credit valuation adjustments. Our daily trading revenue and VaR 0:14:30.3 over the quarter as shown on pages 27 and 28 of our third-quarter report to shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the presentation over to Janice Fukakusa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Morten. Before discussing our segment results, I'll touch on three topics, mainly capital ratios, the market environment and securitization activity. As Gord mentioned, our Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.9%, up 150 basis points from last quarter. This was primarily due to lower risk adjusted assets and internal capital generation from earnings. Risk adjusted assets were down by $22.6 billion from last quarter, largely attributable to the stronger Canadian dollar and continued management of our balance sheet and a reduction in wholesale credit exposures.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital was up by $1.1 billion from last quarter. Largely due to higher retained earnings, partially offset by a higher unrealized foreign currency translation loss relating to our equity investments in foreign subsidiaries. Note that we decided in recent quarters to hedge more of our investments in U.S. subsidiaries, which mitigated the impact of the subsequent strengthening of the Canadian dollar on this component of our capital.</p>
          <p>As you know, Capital Markets began to stabilize in our second quarter, and this trend continued through the third quarter. As a result, market environment-related losses continued to subside and net unrealized losses in our available-for-sale portfolios narrowed. Over the third quarter, credit spreads for us and many issuers have continued to tighten, reflecting both improved funding markets and increased investor confidence.</p>
          <p>As I've mentioned in the past, credit spread movements have both positive and negative impact for us. We had negative adjustments on RBC debt designated as held for trading and on credit default swaps used to economically hedge our corporate loans. Positive credit valuation adjustments on derivative trading activities partially offset these amounts. Our credit spread is now close to pre-crisis levels.</p>
          <p>Also, our securitization activity this quarter was significantly lower than the first two quarters of the year. During the first half of the year, we securitized a large number of mortgages through the government of Canada's Insured Mortgage Purchase Program or IMPP, in addition to our regular participation in the traditional Canada Mortgage Bond Program. This provided a cost effective alternative to unsecured debt and allowed us to further improve our liquidity position over that timeframe.</p>
          <p>This quarter, the cost differential between securitization and unsecured debt narrowed considerably, and access to funding markets also improved. This development, combined with our strong liquidity position, reduced our appetite for securitization compared to the previous two quarters. The IMPP auctions are scheduled to end by September 30, 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to slides 17 and 18 for a look at the performance of all five of our business segments. Net income for Canadian Banking was down 6% from last year related to higher provision for credit losses and spread compressions. Compared to last quarter, earnings were up 15%, primarily reflecting seasonal factors, continued volume growth and higher mutual fund distribution fees due to capital appreciation.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 19, you can see we experienced some margin compression from last quarter. The decline in interest rates was a key factor here. Recall that the Bank of Canada overnight rate was 25 basis points throughout the third quarter as compared to an average of 64 basis points in the second quarter. And this decline impacted spreads on demand deposits, which in turn put pressure on net interest margins. The prime/BA spread was also lower on average by six basis points causing spread compression on our prime-based products. As Gord mentioned, we base transfer pricing on external market costs, and each segment fully absorbs the costs of running their business.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management net income was down 10% over last year, mainly reflecting the impact of the market decline. As market conditions improved over the last quarter, net income this quarter rose 33% on higher transaction volumes and fee-based client assets.</p>
          <p>Insurance net income was 22% higher over last year, reflecting growth in all businesses and lower funding charges. Net income was up 48% from last quarter due to favorable actuarial adjustments and claims experience, business growth and the impact of a new UK reinsurance annuity arrangement.</p>
          <p>International Banking net loss of $95 million compares to a net loss of $16 million last year, relating to higher PCL, largely in U.S. banking and reduced revenue at RBC Dexia IS. The change from last quarter is largely attributable to a goodwill impairment charge of $1 billion taken in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Net income for Capital Markets was $562 million, up $293 million from a year ago, due to stronger trading revenue particularly in most of our global fixed income and money market businesses and U.S.-based equity businesses and lower market environment-related losses. Compared to last quarter, net income was up $142 million on higher trading revenue in our U.S.-based equity and fixed income businesses and lower market environment-related losses.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 illustrates RBC's total trading revenue. We continued to have strong trading revenue in traditional, less structured fixed income products such as bonds, money markets and interest rate derivatives, as well as equity products, driven by favorable market conditions, increasing client activity and narrowing credit spreads.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin questions and answers. Please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Ian de Verteuil from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I guess I'm the only one up this morning. Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hope not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, can you talk a little bit to the improvement in Tier 1? It looks to be largely driven by sort of the way Basel II is dealing with risk weighting. It typically looked as if the &#x2013; I mean the corporate book and the resemblance &#x2013; by the way, I'm looking at page 21 of the sup pack &#x2013; obviously the reduction in the business loan book and the EADs there are explaining the reduction in the RWAs associated with the business loans, but the other asset segment is down quite a bit. I'm just sort of trying &#x2013; grappling to understand on how you're getting as much relief as you are, as we move through a cycle, where I would have thought credit migration would have worked against you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, it's Morten. Just on your last point, in terms of credit migration, I would say, I mean if you look at quarter-over-quarter, the degree of credit migration in the book and asset effects, the capital allocation is actually quite low this quarter. We were just looking at those numbers yesterday. So, while we continue to see some degree of migration, I think we've had on a total book level enough of it earlier that from a capital standpoint, the impact of credit migration is actually very small for this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Ian, generally I think that if you look at the migration of the risk adjusted assets over the quarter, it is due to FX and also very active balance sheet metrics. In terms of the other asset metric, we're going to have to get back to you on a decomposition of what's in that other assets. So, why don't we take that section of this offline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I guess the second question follows on from that. I mean, Gord, are you sufficiently confident in the way Basel II is working that you sit there, you know what, at night, say I really do have a 12.9% Tier 1, or do you more think of it as, well, it's probably more like an 11 in the old days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think of it very much in the former, Ian, that it's a 12.9. And again Janice will come back with those details, but when I look at the increase, it's really a combination of pretty aggressive balance sheet management, which as you know has been a trend over the last year, really since the credit crisis began or before. And again you saw a reduction of risk-adjusted assets in the quarter, while at the same time very strong earnings and good capital generation. So, no, it is very real, and we're very comfortable with that. And so to answer your question specifically, we think very much of it as being in the range that it is presented, very comfortable with Basel II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Darko Mihelic from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I'm looking at page 11 of your supplemental, the Insurance business. And I guess maybe just to make a long question short, I'm trying to look at the earnings of 167 and trying to relate it to whether or not there were any reserve releases in the quarter in your Insurance? And again if you can just walk me through how it evolved to have the jump to 167 million of earnings. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Darko, it's Jim Westlake here. Yeah, there were some positive actuarial evaluations, and the other one-time that was in that was exceeding commission on a UK annuity book. But the vast majority of the earnings were just very solid business, very good creditor results, and that follows really the good loan and mortgage volumes that we've had. Plus more of our customers are taking insurance with their loan and mortgage purchases. We had positive results from all businesses and really good control of expenses. Our NIE was down 8% from Q3 last year, despite the strong revenue growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so could you maybe quantify what the impact was of the U.K....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know the exact number in that or if we would talk about one particular piece of business, but I would think that all of those adjustments would be less than $20 million on the actuarial side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Less than 20 million on actuarial. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Okay, I mean, my only question, other question, Gord, is when you look at slide seven of your sup pack -- not your sup pack, sorry of your presentation -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where is this recession in Canada? You've got tremendous loan growth happening here. Are you tracking statistics with your customers? Are you concerned that personal loans are up 22%, and what is that you're selling out there that's growing at 22%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I &#x2013; actually turn it over to Dave McKay, because I think your question is really related very much to our retail business. So, Dave, do you want to...? I might add something afterwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Darko. We're gaining market share particularly in the mortgage market. When you look at our consumer loan growth, it is predominantly secured loan growth rather than unsecured. So, led by mortgages, also very strong auto indirect secured volume growth. Now from the mortgage side, we've expanded our mortgage sales force, our commission sales force that we talked about. We've got very strong distribution strength. We've expanded our branch network and it's, again, the teamwork and the collaboration across our channels is really driving strong results.</p>
          <p>On the indirect lending side, we're participating in channels that we didn't participate previously, and we're driving high double-digit loan growth on a secured basis with very, very solid customer risk, great, great customer risk. So, that's where our consumer loan growth is coming from, predominantly secured.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, how should we think about that as we come out of a recession into a recovery? Should we be looking for much, I mean a very high double digit growth rates in many of these product lines? What will your sense be in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the Canadian economy has come through a, I would say almost surprisingly robust spring mortgage season across the country, driven by good value for consumers, lower rates and somewhat lower housing prices, but stable house prices. So, great value for first time home buyers drove a lot of demand across the country in all markets. So, I think as long as unemployment trends stabilize and Canadians get back to work, you should see relatively strong growth.</p>
          <p>You have to remember that Canadian consumers' not nearly as levered as the U.S. consumer. We're in very strong financial shape on average across the country as you can see from Canadian loss rates compared to U.S. loss rates. So, the Canadian consumer's in a good position to lead out of this.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Michael Goldberg from Desjardins Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Had a few questions. First of all, could you give us some idea how much the steepness of yield curves in Canada and the U.S. helped your net interest revenue excluding trading-related net interest revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's Janice. You're saying excluding the traded &#x2013; trading-related revenue, so in our structural books, like in our banking books, in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't generally position. We're &#x2013; when we look at the structural books, we're actually hedging to not have that part of the open exposure. So I would say to you that of course with all the hedging that's involved, it wouldn't be significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact you saw what happened in margins in the quarter; it's actually the other way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And as you said, you generally transfer price based on external market cost, presumably on a matched basis, so if there is any of the impact of gapping, I presume it would be taking place in Corporate Services, so it's there that I'm asking the question. And as I said, excluding the net interest revenue that's included in total trading revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Michael, as I said that we do run fairly matched books for our retail structural balance sheet, and as Gord said and I said, we do put all of the impacts of our interest rate risk management back into the segment, so we do hedge the structural book. Now, that could be the interest rate position, of course, is a different story in Capital Markets, but that's the nature of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's not held in corporate treasury, just to reiterate, it's passed on to the business units, so if you actually look at &#x2013; to sort of reverse your question, how much benefit have you derived if you actually look at the margins in the businesses, you almost flip your question around, it's the opposite is that because of the decline in interest rates there's actually been compression because we do run a matched book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's just that I'm finding with the adjustments that I make to your net interest revenue that it's up very significantly on an adjusted basis, but perhaps I can follow up offline. I did want to ask another question about the point that you made about transfer pricing, Janice, but it's based on external market cost. And I'm wondering for RBC Capital Markets, does this mean that the overall market cost for RBC is used? Or is the cost used, what the cost of funding would be for Capital Markets without the benefit of the parent bank covenant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just, Stan's going to respond in the sending in the detail, but for total bank, of course, for costs like liquidity, our term debt, those sorts of things, there's the benefit of the RBC covenant, and we fully overlay those costs into all of the segments because they're part of RBC, and Stan will talk about though the wholesale funding that is undertaken specifically in Capital Markets to fund their own activities. Both Stan 0:32:41), why don't you talk about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Michael, Mark Standish. Yeah in terms of the Capital Markets business, we do fund that at the wholesale rate, and obviously we take into account duration and liquidity around that, but the large bulk of our balance sheet is actually highly liquid securities that are funded on a secured basis either via tri-party arrangements or repo. But, no, it's not the blended rate; it is the wholesale rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question, you still have an undersized U.S. banking franchise with a number of opportunities that you said may merge over time. So the question that's lingered is whether Royal is going to go big or go home? Could you give us some color on your thoughts on this issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, I mean I don't think my response is any different than it has been over the last few quarters. The U.S. banking market continues to be a market where I do believe there will be opportunities going forward, but it continues to be quite stressed, and you've seen that reflected in a lot of the regional and loan-loss numbers that have come out of banks across the U.S. And so, we're taking, as I say, a very measured approach.</p>
          <p>The top priority for Jim Westlake, clearly, is to get our RBC Bank operating and performing at metrics, which puts them in the top category in terms of relative performance. And there's a tremendous amount of focus and energy going into that. There's been a major restructuring of our U.S. bank, which we talked about last quarter. There's been a significant cost initiative underway, and you're going to continue to see that from an operational perspective.</p>
          <p>In terms of acquisitions, we're going to continue to be very cautious because we want to make sure that if we deploy capital in that business that we're earning returns that are as attractive as they are elsewhere. And just as an example of that, which I'll give, is if you look at some of the banks that have traded, and there's actually been very few in our region, but when we look at them, one of the challenges that you continue to see in that U.S. market is the tremendous amount of real estate exposure that is on the balance sheets of banks in the region. We manage very aggressively to industry limits in a sector like that, and we sit back and we look at our ability to allocate capital and deploy capital.</p>
          <p>In a sector like real estate, in businesses like Canadian Banking and in our wholesale and Capital Markets businesses, and we measure those up against the return opportunities, and in an area like U.S. retail banking. And it's a tough &#x2013; it's a tough argument to make that you want to deploy capital at rates of return that are lower than are available elsewhere. And so that's the approach we're taking. And as I've said in the past, we would rather continue to build a strong and stable and good small bank and be positioned to take advantage of a good opportunity if it arises than to try to do something actively or aggressively simply because we have excess capital. So, we're going to continue to maintain that approach.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Sumit Malhotra from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Question on the trading side to start. Some of the commentary we received earlier in the year, not only from Royal but from investment banks globally on interest rate, credit, fixed income trading spoke to wider bid-ask spreads, less competition, less liquidity in the market. Almost somewhat perversely, I've been thinking that as credit spreads begin to heal and the world feels a little bit better, perhaps liquidity returns to the market, competition comes back, the ability to garner those wider spreads on plain vanilla business, wouldn't be quite as robust as they were earlier in the year. Can you comment a little bit on your view on that statement, and how it's affecting your trading business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi Sumit, it's Mark Standish. I mean we've enjoyed obviously very, very strong trading results globally, and that's all products in not only Canada but in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and what we've see is tremendous client share gains. We've been attracting new clients globally; we're doing more business with existing clients. We've obviously been hiring extremely good people with very, very solid client relationships.</p>
          <p>So, what we've seen, I think, is quite a significant improvement in market share in all of our trading businesses. And if you look at the balance sheet numbers that we put out, obviously our balance sheet is continuing to be managed with a very disciplined eye. But within that, we're seeing very, very high turnover of positions, very active trading with our clients and it's not just limited to Canada.</p>
          <p>The other thing we're seeing is because we have this global platform, we're able to service all of our clients much better in this market. So, opposed to just servicing a client in a single market, having the ability to go beyond that market to other geographies is also something that we're seeing a lot of benefit from right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly appreciate the fact there's been a structural build or advancement in your business, but maybe just &#x2013; and nonspecific as it relates to your revenue, just in terms of a market commentary. As credit spreads have improved, as liquidity has returned, has that put somewhat of dampening effect on the ability to garner wider spreads in the business, or is it there where it was earlier this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for us it's more a question of client activity, and I said, we're seeing tremendously strong client activity. If you look at our VaR, if you look at the, as I said, parts of the balance sheet, we're not positioned, we don't &#x2013; we haven't seen any shift, if you like, between how much of our money we make in proprietary trading versus client revenues. So, for us it's just a very broad global strong improvement in general client flows and activity levels, irrespective of credit spreads coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the one comment I'd make generally though is that there's no question as you've started to see more stability in the market, you're seeing some of &#x2013; you're seeing people come back into the marketplace. I mean there's been some recent announcements in the U.S. with some of the U.S. banks that were really withdrawing from the markets who are starting to deploy capital back into that sector because they were so aggressively withdrawing capital.</p>
          <p>So there will be, there'll certainly be some stability, I think, in terms of the overall &#x2013; in terms of the overall competition in that sector, but I think the point that Mark is making is that it's not a question of huge bid/ask spreads, I mean a lot of markets, whether it's FX or sterling or treasuries or Canadas or whatever, there's been a lot of volatility, but I don't think a tremendous amount of increase gains from wide bid/ask spreads has changed very dramatically. We also have seen credit spreads actually widen out again I guess over the last few weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that color. Last one for you, Gord, just following up on the question on the U.S. regional banking strategy. As you think through the different options for that business, how important is it for you to main control of the franchise? Is the possibility of joint ventures, minority stakes something that the bank is open to in the right situation, or is that something that just given the importance of asset quality and management decisions around lending, something that wouldn't work in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that we're certainly not wedded to one way to continue to grow our franchise in the United States. I wouldn't suggest that what &#x2013; that a joint venture is necessarily a priority for the organization. I would certainly not want to lead you in that direction. Having said that, I've made it very clear that in terms of growing and expanding our franchise and our business in the United States, we are certainly very open to options and alternatives in the U.S. banking side.</p>
          <p>And I would also &#x2013; I'd be neglectful if I also didn't reiterate we're continuing to look at ways to expand and grow all of our businesses in the United States, not just the U.S. banking side. And so there's a lot of activity going on across all of our businesses, because our platform in the United States continues to be quite significant, quite broad and generally highly profitable, of course the U.S. bank is the one exception. But in terms of that, a particular franchise, as I say, priority number one is the &#x2013; is getting the performance strong in that business, and that will have the most immediate impact in terms of turning around our International Banking earnings. And priority number two is, of course, how do we continue to build and grow a strong franchise, and I think all options are open with respect to that alternative.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question is from Jim Bantis from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, two questions. Just focusing a little bit back on the trading side, I think the old days, which wasn't that long ago, Chuck Winograd would have been very pleased with 500 million of trading, and clearly we're doing three times that amount. And Stan, I know, you talked about some of the structural changes in terms of the global platform that you have, but to what extent is the block trading business contributing to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Jim. As I said earlier, it's in the same sort of range and ratio that we've seen in many prior quarters and many prior years. For us, this has been a very broad global improvement in sales and trading, not specific to any one area. Going back to Gord's comments, we've seen tremendous activity in the UK, and if you of back to the credit awards, those were tremendous wins for us which were votes made by clients. Obviously in the &#x2013; our primary dealer designation from the New York Fed in the U.S. is going to be very significant there. So, I think to sum it up, all of our businesses on the sales and trading side are performing well, and proprietary trading is the same sort of proportion that it's been for quite a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, thank you. So, when you think of the significant out performance versus past levels, do you attribute most of it to the platform in Europe and Asia? I'm just trying to get a sense of perhaps the contributions coming from a geographic perceptive that's leading to this strength?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the geographic breakdown is approximately just slightly over 30% in Canada. It's around just over 40% in the U.S. Asia is, I think, 6% with the balance being in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. Thanks very much, Stan. My next question is with respect to Canadian retail banking. Dave, we've talked about the very strong asset growth and deposit growth, yet revenue is flat year-over-year, and I know NIM compression is a large part of that, but is there anything else that's playing against you with respect to revenue momentum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's it, Jim, you've got it. I mean with the spreads that we're earning on the loan growth, whether it's the mortgage growth or the indirect lending growth, are very, very strong. So, that the new business coming on the books and the re-pricing activity continues to reflect the costs of credit are strong, so the NIM compression is due to that overall lower interest rate environment and the significant impact it has on our deposit business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, when you're managing your business for the next year ahead and you think of this kind of deflationary environment, low interest rate environment, what type of management actions can you do or should we just in our own mind think of another kind of flat NIM year, and just see how revenue grows from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Jim, as we've talked about for the last year, and I think what we've delivered is we're very focused on operating leverage and managing our revenue stream and our cost base. So we've been able to grow our business significantly, as Gordon mentioned, by maintaining our zero percent NIE growth. And we maintained or we're maintaining our commitment to really focusing on those two items. So, we're going to watch our costs, we're going to watch our revenue growth. But at some point as we come through the year-over-year compression and things do stabilize, then what happens is your revenue growth starts to proxy your volume growth much more closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that right now we're &#x2013; our volume growth is being suppressed in revenue growth because of the compression in the &#x2013; of the overall interest rate environment, but stability will allow revenue growth to transfer from the volume growth, so that is something that we're counting on going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That coupled with cost control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And then my last question a quick one for Gord. So, we've seen a couple of quarters back-to-back with respect to trading revenue being north of 20% of the bank's aggregate revenue, and some would say Royal Bank's become the Goldman Sachs of the north. And but that leads to valuation issues and other concerns. What's a comfortable range, Gord, that you feel that the trading revenue will kind of gravitate towards in terms of aggregate revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would firstly point out that we did make $1 billion excluding all of our wholesale lending and Capital Markets activities. So, I wouldn't characterize it as the Goldman Sachs of the north. I think that the range that we have targeted in the past really hasn't changed, and although you're correct in suggesting that if you look at the sort of 20 to 30% metric, we're certainly not only at the high end of the range, we're slightly through that. I mean if you look at earnings as an example, we're about a third in the wholesale lending and Capital Markets activities.</p>
          <p>We continue to maintain our range, and the way I tend to look at it is if you normalize our International Banking earnings, today even, based on what we believe we can and should be doing, then we continue to be in that range, clearly at the high end of that 20 to 30% range, but we're not going to move off that. As I've said many times, we're going to continue to invest and grow our Capital Markets business. But it's going to be in conjunction with growth in businesses like Wealth Management and Insurance and Canadian Banking and International Banking as well.</p>
          <p>And if we're able to manage the bank as we would like to manage it and effectively grow all of those businesses, we think we'll be able to continue to have a very globally competitive significant major Capital Markets business, but in the context of a bank that where 70% of our capital, our earnings, our revenues, et cetera comes from ancillary businesses. Because we think that business mix is the right one, given who we want to &#x2013; how we want to position our organization, maintaining our credit rating, managing volatility, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, I don't think &#x2013; I mean yes, there has been an increase, and I would also highlight that we have always said that as we start to come out of this recessionary period and the financial crisis, that you are going to see the Capital Markets business experience the more positive turnaround first. I mean if you look at previous cycles you generally get a more dramatic improvement in the wholesale businesses before you start to see that filter through into other businesses, whether it be Wealth Management or retail, et cetera. And that is the way this one is playing out, and so our expectation is that you'll start to see down the road improvement in some of these other businesses, and as I say particularly if you sort of take a more normalized approach to the International Banking business, which is obviously a big swing factor in those percentages that you mentioned.</p>

          <p>Good morning. I understand all the comments you made about segmented margins and why or even segmented results and why they're not comparable across banks. And I certainly understand the concepts you've articulated about those segments being transfer priced, their actual costs having to sort of carry their own weight. What I'd really &#x2013; I try to understand going forward because these segments are not quite helpful anymore, at least in terms of comparison, is understanding that consolidated margin.</p>
          <p>And what I &#x2013; what would be helpful for me would be to understand the increase in NII, and again excluding anything to do with trading NII, that's up about 12% year-over-year. If you look at things like average earning assets, they're down about 4%, loans are up only about 4%. So clearly the balance sheet as a whole has benefited from something to cause these margins to improve. So it would be helpful for me is to understand what is it that's causing the global margin, the consolidated margin, to improve so much year-over-year, and can this continue?</p>

          <p>Mario, I'll give a stab at the answer to that question, and you're right that you need to exclude all the trading positions, because it really &#x2013; if you just look at the straight enterprise NII, it does move around just depending on where the positions are, if they're physical or derivative in Capital Markets.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've removed all of that stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're absolutely right, and I've made all of those adjustments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, I think that if you look at the composition of our spreads, while Canadian Banking is the bulk of what's happening there, we also have very positive spreads in our International Banking businesses, for example in the Caribbean. And with the insertion too of RBTT, the spreads are quite a bit wider in those markets. And we have seen some spread up-tick in the U.S. banking business to the extent there is revenue in business there. We have also some spread income in our Wealth Management businesses, which would sort of offset the &#x2013; would be sort of similar to the Canadian Banking.</p>
          <p>So, there &#x2013; those are &#x2013; that's what's happening in the global spread. What we will do is, we'll look at our -- all of our disclosures on an enterprise basis. We never look at NIM that way of course, because we manage at the segment level and manage performance in that way, but we'll look at it that way and get back to you to see if there's a more helpful way. We just aggregate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you the source of the confusion for me is because Canadian Banking is such an enormous part of this overall Bank, and with margins down in Canadian Banking, I think it's something like 24 basis points year-over-year, it's interesting that the overall margin, the Bank, the overall margin is up so much, and it appears that it's coming mostly from the corporate segment and from wholesale. So, anything you can provide going forward about why it is that corporate and wholesale would benefit so significantly in terms of improving margins in this environment would be helpful.</p>

          <p>Hey, Mario, it's Doug McGregor. One of the things that you have to take into consideration is that the spreads in the wholesale loan book are significantly wider than they would have been a year and a half ago. So that loan book has a duration of approximately two years, and so we have re-priced a good portion of that book at significantly better spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as David McKay mentioned, the new business on the retail business is being priced at much more attractive margins, but you cannot re-price the retail business nearly as quickly as you'd see in the wholesale side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there any gapping from a global basis like the entire balance sheet structurally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not &#x2013; no, there isn't, not from that basis. So, I think that the critical piece is more segmented information, Mario. So, why don't we work on that?</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, a quick question likely for Janice. If we look at the Corporate segment and adjust for the general provision and a portion of the market-related charges this quarter, looks like one of the strongest contributions we've seen in quite an age are the Corporate segment upwards of a couple of hundred million. I would have thought that would be with securitization down, I know securitization is mentioned in the report to shareholders, but it looked to me like the contribution from securitization was down sequentially. So, can you expand a bit on what's going on in that line, and could you quantify the tax and accounting related adjustments that are mentioned also in the report to shareholders? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. So, in the Corporate segment you've identified the material elements of the what's in there, and that's why we don't really do sequential analysis so the securitization revenues, although down, are significant. The general reserve flows through there and then also the impacts of our corporate treasury available-for-sale portfolio and the market environment.</p>
          <p>With respect to all of the other adjustments, they basically are there from a quarter-to-quarter basis. Sometimes they net, other times they don't, and they're all well below our materiality threshold, and that's why we don't disclose the items individually. There &#x2013; also going through the Corporate segment are things like our &#x2013; the impact of our mark-to-market on our funding derivatives that we used to hedge some of our funding programs. So, that creates a lot of volatility. That's why you see volatility in the Corporate segment and why we, rather than looking at trend analysis, identify the key components.</p>
