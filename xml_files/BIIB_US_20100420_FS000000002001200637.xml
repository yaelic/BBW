          <p>Thank you, Kia, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. During first quarter of 2010 we continued to execute on our business strategy and position the company for growth over the long-term. Total revenue increased 7% on a year-over-year basis to 1.1 billion, driven by 32% year-over-year TYSABRI revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Two items negatively impacted first quarter earnings: A 13 million dollar increase in rebates mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act, and a $14 million write-down on our investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals. Taken together these items reduced EPS by $0.07. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter 2010 was $1.08, an increase of 3% on a year-over-year basis. The company generated 337 million in cash flow from operations and ended the quarter with a $2.2 billion dollar cash balance.</p>
          <p>And as of the end of March 2010, we estimate that we now have more than 50,000 patients in commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy. On an operational basis in the first quarter, we launched three new TYSABRI trials, SURPASS, a head-to-head comparative trial to determine the effect of switching from COPAXONE to REBIF to TYSABRI &#x2013; from COPAXONE or REBIF to TYSABRI and STRATIFY 1 and 2 to test the utility of a JC virus antibody assay for risk stratification. These studies are the latest in a series of investments we've made to clarify the benefits and risks of TYSABRI.</p>
          <p>We completed a share repurchase program announced in October of last year, which returned $1 billion in cash to our shareholders and received Board approval to purchase an additional 1.5 billion of shares. We continue to make significant strides in the development of our late stage clinical pipeline. Last week we updated the medical community on our progress of our neurology pipeline at the annual American Academy of Neurology meeting where we presented 38 posters on our broad and deep MS pipeline. For more detail on our pipeline and the information we presented at AAN I will now hand the call over to Dr. Evan Beckman, our Senior Vice President of Immunology Research and Development. Evan?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. I'd like to begin with an update of our registrational trials. We continue to make good progress on advancing and developing our late stage clinical pipeline and expect data on some of these programs as early as next year.</p>
          <p>Preparations are underway to initiate the Phase 3 trial of Daclizumab. The DECIDE trial is a two-year study of Daclizumab in RRMS patients with AVONEX as the comparator. We look forward to updating you with further details of this study.</p>
          <p>As previously announced, both BG-12 registrational studies, DEFINE and CONFIRM have completed patient enrollment and the trials continue on plan. We expect data from DEFINE during the first half of 2011 and from CONFIRM during the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>We continue enrolling patients in the ADVANCE study of PEGylated interferon beta-1a and in a Phase 3 study of GA101 for front line chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with chlorambucil. Enrollment for a second registrational trial in RITUXAN refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients is planned to start during the second quarter of 2010. Patient enrollment B-LONG, which is the registrational trial for our long-acting recombinant Factor IX candidate in hemophilia B continues to progress well.</p>
          <p>Last week we shared important data on our neurology franchise at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting where we demonstrated the strength and quality of our neurology pipeline with 38 company sponsored platform and poster presentations.</p>
          <p>Nearly four years after its reintroduction in the U.S. and initial launch in the EU we continue to demonstrate the powerful efficacy that TYSABRI offers relapsing multiple sclerosis patients. Key data presentations reinforce the growing body of evidence that TYSABRI is an important therapeutic option for patients. And may lead to overall improved quality of life for MS patients from improvements in physical function, cognition, and visual function to reduced fatigue.</p>
          <p>We take the issue of PML very seriously. With each case of PML there is the potential to learn something new about this rare, but serious adverse event. To this point, Dr. Rick Rudick presented data from a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in the STRATA trial, which showed that TYSABRI does not lead to substantial changes in the presence of JC viral DNA in blood or urine samples of MS patients.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter we initiated three important trials related to TYSABRI, STRATIFY 1 and 2 and SURPASS. As discussed during a platform presentation at AAN we have developed a blood test that detects antibodies to the JC virus, the virus that causes PML. The presence of the antibody to the virus suggests that a patient has been previously exposed to the JC virus. While the data are still preliminary this assay may provide a tool for physicians to stratify the risk of PML in their MS patients.</p>
          <p>To recap what we know to date, for 13 TYSABRI-treated PML patients, where we have baseline plasma samples, all 13 of them were antibody positive for 1 to 3 years before developing PML. If antibody status was not a factor for developing PML, we would only have expected 6 or 7 to be positive, based on our data that 54% of MS patients have been exposed to the virus previously. So, our hypothesis is that there may be a lower risk for developing PML in TYSABRI-treated MS patients who are antibody negative.</p>
          <p>To confirm this hypothesis, we have initiated two clinical trials. STRATIFY 1 is designed to determine the percentage of the MS patient population that's positive for JC virus antibodies, as well as the false negative rate for the blood test. We expect to enroll 1,000 patients in this trial. Inclusion criteria are current TYSABRI patients enrolled in TOUCH, or patients who are not currently on TYSABRI, but are considering beginning TYSABRI treatment. For this trial, we'll be testing for JC virus antibody in the blood and testing for the presence of JC virus DNA in the urine every six months for two years from the time of enrollment.</p>
          <p>STRATIFY 2 is designed to evaluate whether the incidence of PML in TYSABRI patients who are negative for the JC virus antibodies is less than the incidence among TYSABRI patients who are positive for antibodies to JC virus. STRATIFY 2 is expected to enroll a minimum of 8,000 patients, and is open to TOUCH prescribers. In this trial, we'll be testing for the JC virus antibody only in the blood and on an annual basis for two years from their time of enrollment. Our goal is to ultimately provide neurologists and MS patients with tools to stratify risk.</p>
          <p>Our thinking here is that within the context of a clinical trial, where there's prospective analysis of the data, we have the best opportunity to validate and determine the clinical utility of this assay. Our hope is that over the long-term, the JC virus assay may help physicians make better treatment decisions for MS patients.</p>
          <p>Moving on to SURPASS, our objective with this study is to provide a new model for making optimal treatment decisions in order to improve the outcomes of patients with MS. SURPASS will be the largest prospective study to provide comparator data regarding the management of breakthrough disease in MS. Amongst MS specialists, there is an evolving standard of care that when a patient on first-line MS therapy presents with either clinical or MRI evidence of disease activity, modification of treatment needs to be considered. Yet, there is no evidence confirming whether switching MS therapies results in improved outcomes.</p>
          <p>In the SURPASS trial, we're enrolling MS patients initially treated with REBIF or COPAXONE for at least 6 months, who subsequently experience either a clinical attack or 2 or more new MRI lesions. Patients will then be randomized to 1 of 3 arms. The first is to continue on the initial therapy. The second, converting to the other first-line therapy, or third converting to TYSABRI. SURPASS has a target enrollment of 1,800 patients at 230 sites worldwide. We expect that it will provide important data on whether early identification of breakthrough disease and subsequent modification of therapy improves patient outcomes. We expect the study to be completed in 2013. Our goal with SURPASS and the STRATIFY trials is that, combined, these studies will provide physicians with powerful tools for informed treatment decisions, such as improved techniques for stratifying the risk of PML in MS patients on TYSABRI.</p>
          <p>Now, an update on the rest of our pipeline. During the first quarter, we along with our partner Roche decided to suspend treatment of patients in the Ocrelizumab rheumatoid arthritis program. This decision followed the recommendation of the independent Ocrelizumab RA &amp; Lupus Data Safety Monitoring Board, based on their assessment that the safety risks outweighed the benefits observed in these specific patient populations.</p>
          <p>We recently announced that the primary end point was met in the Phase 3 SCRIPT study of Ocrelizumab in the TNF IR RA patients. The future of the Ocrelizumab RA clinical program is currently under review, as we and our partner will have to consider these recent results along with the complete safety data set.</p>
          <p>The Ocrelizumab program in relapsing, remitting MS remains ongoing at this time. However, the MS Data Safety Monitoring Board will be reviewing the safety data from the RA Lupus and MS trials. We previously announced that the MS study achieved its primary end point, and we continue to discuss the next steps for Ocrelizumab MS program with our partner Roche.</p>
          <p>Turning to oncology. As you may recall, during our third quarter earnings last year, we announced that we had stopped patient recruitment in the lumiliximab LUCID trial. We recently reviewed the data for the lumiliximab trials in both relapsed and the front-line CLL and determined that the results do not support continuing the program.</p>
          <p>Next, an update on our blood factor programs. As we announced in January the global registrational trial for our long-acting recombinant Factor IX in hemophilia B continues to enroll patients. We plan to present results of the Phase 1/2 Factor IX study in July at the World Federation of Hemophilia meeting in Buenos Aires. Additionally, the Phase 1/2 study of our long-acting recombinant Factor VIII program is progressing well and we expect a read out from this study later this year.</p>
          <p>Recombinant Factor IX FC is the first major blood factor innovation since the development of recombinant drugs in the 1990s. We believe that our long-acting blood factor programs have the potential to significantly improve the lives of people with hemophilia and as a result, expand the hemophilia market opportunity. Recombinant Factor IX FC offers the hope of less frequent injections and prolonged protection from bleeding, compared to existing therapies.</p>
          <p>Our goal in developing the long-acting blood factor candidates is to change the treatment paradigm in hemophilia with more prophylactic usage. Current short-acting treatments requiring 2 to 3 infusions per week for hemophilia B and 3 to 4 infusions for hemophilia A, don't lend themselves to easy prophylactic usage. Most children with severe hemophilia are already on prophylactic regimens, based on the compelling outcome studies, giving frequent IV infusions to children places a significant burden on parents. For young children, prophylactic dosing also frequently requires placement of a central catheter or port, which introduces a risk of serious infection.</p>
          <p>For adults with hemophilia, episodic or on-demand treatment is more common, despite the clinical benefits of prophylactics. Recombinant Factor IX FC has the potential to lower the hurdle for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia B in both the pediatric and adult populations.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we expect to announce data read outs in 7 clinical studies throughout the remainder of this year, as well as data presentations at several medical meetings. We expect a read out from the TARGET study, which is the Phase 2 trial of galiximab in combination with RITUXAN in follicular NHL during the fourth quarter of this year at a medical meeting.</p>
          <p>We've completed enrollment in 2 out of 3 pivotal studies for Lixivaptan in hyponatremia. These multinational studies include the BALANCE trial, a 650 patient study that enrolled patients with heart failure, and the LIBRA trial, a study of inpatients with the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hypersecretion or SIADH. Top line data read out for these two studies is expected during the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>We continue to make advances on our other pipeline programs, with read outs for the Phase 2 trials of AVONEX in ulcerative colitis and BG-12 in rheumatoid arthritis both expected during the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>We expect to present data from 4 of the Phase 3 studies of Ocrelizumab in RA at the American College of Rheumatology annual meeting. These include data from the STAGE, FEATURE, FILM and SCRIPT trials.</p>
          <p>For the Ocrelizumab MS program we previously announced positive top-line data from this trial in Q4 2009 and in October of this year we plan to present data at ECTRIMS. Data announcement from the Phase 3 PRIMA study of RITUXAN as a maintenance therapy for indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is planned in an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO annual meeting. Last September we announced that this study met its primary end point of progression free survival during a pre-planned interim analysis.</p>
          <p>We, along with our partner, Roche, also plan data presentations at upcoming medical meetings on our Anti-CD Monoclonal Antibody designed specifically for use in oncology, GA101. Specifically we expect data presentation from the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 study of GA101 in indolent NHL in June at the European Hematology Association meeting in Barcelona. Also, we plan to present data from the Phase 2 portion in NHL and CLL patients at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December.</p>
          <p>Along with advancements on clinical programs, we continue to make progress on our regulatory efforts. Recall that earlier in Q1, we received FDA approval for RITUXAN in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for previously treated and untreated CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We continue efforts aimed at expanding the RITUXAN label with additional indications. Last month, we submitted Supplemental License Biologics Applications to the FDA and EMA to expand the RITUXAN label in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to include maintenance treatment for previously untreated patients with advanced follicular lymphomas. We-based our submissions on Phase 3 PRIMA study data. The U.S. regulatory filing for RITUXAN in ANCA-associated vasculitis also remains on track for the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>We continue to expand on our regulatory efforts with prolonged release fampridine outside of the U.S. We have filed for approval in the EU, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand and expect to have more filings. We are excited for the anticipated ex-U.S. launch of prolonged release fampridine. Data presentations at AAN highlighted consistent improvements in average walking speeds for MS patients last week.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we continue to make progress on our pipeline and our R&amp;D organization continues to perform well. We're currently supporting 76 trials with more than 4,700 patients across more than 1,200 sites worldwide. Our efforts position us well for future growth and we look forward to providing you updates on new developments in the quarters ahead.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now pass the call over to Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Evan. In the first quarter AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue to Biogen Idec of 1.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, with continued growth in our core MS business more than offsetting a decline in RITUXAN royalty revenue. As Jim mentioned TYSABRI exceeded 50,000 patients. While TYSABRI continued to add patients during the quarter, patient growth during the first half was modest. We saw a rebound in March when we added more than 190 patients per week.</p>
          <p>Importantly the moderation in patient growth during the first half of the quarter was the result of decrease in new patient starts, not an increase in discontinuations. We've seen this pattern in the past when physicians and patients have taken the time to absorb new information regarding PML risk. In this case we suspect the label change to reflect increased risk of PML with increased duration of therapy may have been the cause. Also we have seen a deceleration in patient growth in Germany where there's still a high level of PML discussion. The safety concern in Germany may have been amplified by "Dear Doctor" letters sent to physicians during the first quarter. We also see evidence of a modest increase in drug suspensions.</p>
          <p>In order to better understand the impact this is having on TYSABRI use we regularly ask our patients and physicians about their dosing preferences, while at the same time, monitoring our TOUCH data on the U.S. compliance and discontinuations. What we have found is that most of the physicians who discuss this option with their patients allow them to make their own decision based on their own unique situation.</p>
          <p>Based on our data from the TOUCH program and from physician and patient interactions we estimate that at the end of March less than 10% of all U.S. TYSABRI patients were on a drug suspension. We plan to continue to follow this trend closely. The impact of this can be seen as z modest decline in net revenue per patient as most physicians in the U.S. do not discontinue their patients from TOUCH during drug suspension.</p>
          <p>Since our relaunch in 2006, we have had questions about the impact of research initiatives on TYSABRI's adoption. Most recently there has been interest in work on the JCV antibody assay. Long term we believe that it is important for neurologists and MS patients have to more information clarifying TYSABRI's benefit and risk for individual doctor/patient benefit risk discussions. So while our net patient growth may moderate to absorb this new information over the short term, we've discipline ourselves to keep perspective on what is best for the long term adoption of the product.</p>
          <p>Now update on AVONEX. The franchise generated 593 million in global revenue during the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 7% year-over-year. AVONEX Q1 sales benefited partially from a 5.5 price increase in U.S. on 26 February. Our new U.S. commercial team is now largely in place and showing renewed energy and focus. The leadership team has assessed our U.S. AVONEX commercial strategy and identified three areas we can address in order to arrest the decline of our AVONEX U.S. market share. The first is sales force effectiveness. We need to reemphasize clinical selling and focus calling programs on key customers. We're examining multiple options to increase our interactions with physicians.</p>
          <p>The second is tactical marketing execution. AVONEX has compelling long term efficacy data, but that message has been lost over the past few years. Our CHAMPIONS 10-year data brought that message back into focus and is starting to resonate with physicians. We need to build on that as we continue to amass evidence of AVONEX' long term efficacy.</p>
          <p>The third area we need to better leverage is our patient services. Biogen Idec has been a pioneer in this area and we need to reestablish the primacy of this as a competitive advantage. We have extremely talented organization and Research Triangle partner in North Carolina that has been some doing great work with therapy support. We know that patient participation in this program increases product compliance. Over the next few months we'll be launching programs to increase patient participation in therapy support.</p>
          <p>Outside the U.S., our sales force has been highly effective and our marketing message has been clear and in step with the local market. We have a strong international leadership team and more than a dozen years of experience selling directly to markets outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Structurally one thing that has facilitated our effectiveness overseas has been our affiliate model. We have a local presence in each direct markets with an experienced sales force and programs tailored to local patients and physicians. In my opinion these are the factors that make AVONEX the number one MS therapy outside the U.S., and in form, our updated strategy within the U.S.</p>
          <p>Next, an update on RITUXAN. RITUXAN Q1 revenues to Biogen Idec were 255 million, down 9% year-over-year. This decline was driven by the continued expiration of royalties on revenues outside the U.S. U.S. RITXUAN profit share was up 12% on a year-over-year basis and 4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis driven by increased demand in the hematology and oncology settings and some restocking in the channels.</p>
          <p>Finally, a quick update on prolonged release fampridine, marketed as AMPYRA in the U.S. by Acorda Therapeutics. Our plan for launching outside of the U.S. continues on schedule. During the first quarter we assembled an International Prolonged Release Fampridine Advisory Board of neurologists from 14 countries.</p>
          <p>This Advisory Board provides scientific input into the potential prolonged release fampridine launch and subsequent product lifecycle management. The Advisory Board held their first meeting in January. In parallel our supply chain team continues preparation to enable appropriate compassionate use programs and named patient supplies. We look forward to upcoming discussions with the regulators now that a launch is potentially less than a year away. With that I will now turn the call over to Mr. Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. I'll review our 2010 first quarter financial performance. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were $49 million, related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, 40 million for the contingent consolidation payment associated with the Syntonix acquisition, 12 million for employee stock option expense and 5 million for severance and restructuring; all of these offset by a $27 million tax impact on these items. Our GAAP diluted EPS was $0.80 in Q1 2010.</p>
          <p>Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&amp;L operating performance of Biogen Idec, which we believe better reflects the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally and set operational goals. Our Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.08.</p>
          <p>The quarter was negatively impacted by two items. First we incurred a $14 million charge resulting from the impairment of our strategic investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals following their initial public offering in March. Second, we were impacted by U.S. healthcare reform. Specifically revenues were reduced by $13 million due to the recently approved Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.</p>
          <p>In the quarter we specifically incurred additional discounts from three changes. First, the change in the minimum Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% which took effect retroactive to January 1. Second, the extension of Medicaid rebates to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries which took effect on March 23 as the law was enacted. And third, the expansion of 340B, Public Health Service's Drug Pricing Program, which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates to include certain hospitals, clinics and healthcare centers. This was effective retroactive to January 1. These additional discounts impacted each of our products as noted on a slide in the earnings presentation. The AVEO impairment combined with impacts of healthcare reform unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.07.</p>
          <p>Now let's move through the first quarter results in a bit more detail starting with revenue. Total revenue for first quarter of 2010 was 1.1 billion, a 7% growth over the first quarter of 2009. Q1 product revenue grew double-digits to 824 million, a 12% growth over Q1 2009.</p>
          <p>I'll start now going through our product revenue with AVONEX. Q1 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was 593 million, a 7% increase over Q1 2009. U.S. AVONEX product revenue in the first quarter was 350 million, a 3% increase versus prior year. U.S. AVONEX inventory in the channel ended about 2.25 weeks in the first quarter. In Q1, units sold in the U.S. declined approximately 9%, as compared to Q1 2009. This was offset as Bob noted by price increases. Unemployment continued to impact our U.S. AVONEX trends as free goods once again increased. Q1 international AVONEX product sales were 243 million, a 13% increase over Q1 2009. In Q1 2010 units sold outside the U.S. increased approximately 4%, as compared to prior year.</p>
          <p>Q1 TYSABRI worldwide product sales were 219 million for Biogen Idec, a 32% increase over Q1 2009. As Bob mentioned TYSABRI patient growth moderated in the quarter, likely the lagged effect of label discussions with both FDA and EMEA. Nevertheless, we're encouraged by the trajectory we saw in the last month of Q1, specifically we estimate our net patient adds in the month of March picked back up to average approximately 190 per week.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., end user TYSABRI sales totaled 135 million for the first quarter, a 17% increase over Q1 2009. Biogen Idec booked $60 million of revenue of this amount. Q1 international TYSABRI product revenue was $158 million, a 42% increase over Q1 2009. Q1 Fumaderm revenue was $13 million.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues, referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $255 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 9% on a year-over-year basis. Our RITUXAN revenues are broken down into three components, first our share of the net U.S. RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were 687 million in the first quarter of 2010, up 7% versus prior year, benefiting from demand and channel restocking. Our Q1 2010 profit share from that business was 200 million, up 12% versus prior year.</p>
          <p>Second, we receive revenue on sales of RITUXIMAB outside the U.S., and in Q1 this was $38 million down 54% versus prior year as royalties from individual countries have expired. Third in the first quarter we were reimbursed $16 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. Royalties were 26 million for the first quarter of 2010, an 8% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&amp;L, which includes the adjustments that I described earlier. Q1 COGs were $97 million, or 9% of revenues, benefiting from fewer inventory write-offs. Q1 R&amp;D expense was $303 million, or 27% of revenues. This represents a 9% increase over the prior quarter and a 10% increase over the prior year due primarily to an additional $19 million in expense we assumed as a result of a restructured collaboration agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum for our blood factor programs. In essence we're now bearing the full development and manufacturing expenses for the Factor IX and Factor VIII programs, in exchange for more favorable downstream economics in streamlined roles.</p>
          <p>Additionally, at our large scale facility in RTP, we redeployed manufacturing activity to clinical programs, away from commercial production which reduced the amount of expense that is normally capitalized to the balance sheet. This added an additional 13 million of R&amp;D expense during the quarter. These two impacts were somewhat offset by favorability from recent program decisions.</p>
          <p>I'd also note that during the second quarter of this year we anticipate that we may make a $30 million milestone payment to Facet Biotech, our partner on Daclizumab due upon initiation of the Phase 3 DECIDE trial.</p>
          <p>Q1 SG&amp;A expense was $234 million, or 21% of revenues. As mentioned during our last call our SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenues may average 22% in total for 2010 as we prepare to defend our MS franchise against potential new competitors.</p>
          <p>Continuing down the P&amp;L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled 64 million expense for the quarter, representing our payment of profits outside the U.S. to Elan and the reimbursement of third party royalties incurred by Elan outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Other income and expense for the quarter was a loss of $8 million driven by the $14 million charge from the impairment of our investment in AVEO Pharmaceuticals as previously mentioned. Our cash and marketable securities position ended the quarter at 2.2 billion, down from year-end mostly due to purchase of Treasury stock. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%. The Q1 tax includes a 6 million one-time benefit related to restructuring of an international entity. This brings us to our Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.08.</p>
          <p>Now let me share the progress we've made with respect to our share repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2010 we repurchased and retired 10.5 million shares at total cost of $578 million. As a result, we completed the billion dollar share repurchase program announced during the fourth quarter of 2009. In total, since the October authorization, we've purchased 25.3 million shares for a total cost of $1.3 billion, including approximately 6 million shares earmarked for share stabilization.</p>
          <p>Biogen Idec's average diluted shares outstanding were approximately 273 million for the first quarter. Last week the Board approved an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program with the objective of returning excess cash to shareholders. The authorization is open-ended and our intention is to execute the program in the open market at more likely a more deliberate pace. Our decision to repurchase more shares is influenced by a number of factors, including the continued improvement in the credit markets, our outlook in the cash flow generation of the enterprise and the potential for our product initiatives and pipeline maturation. We continue to have the flexibility and capacity to pursue meaningful strategic investments.</p>
          <p>Turning to the full year outlook, we're leaving financial guidance unchanged from previous communication. We estimate healthcare legislation will reduce our revenue by approximately 70 to 90 million for the year, or about 2%. These reductions are due to the increase in Medicaid rebates, the expansion of hospitals eligible for 340B pricing and the extension of Medicaid rebates to managed care organizations.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the longer term impact on our business can be less unfavorable as expansion of patients who are currently uninsured and prescription drug coverage for patients in Medicare Part D donut hole takes effect in future years. And biosimilar legislation, including the12-year data exclusivity on biologic therapies can be quite positive.</p>
          <p>The balance of year market impact of both potential new competition and data provided in the context of our JCV antibody assay trial is equivocal. We'll monitor closely the TYSABRI trends over the next few months as patients and physicians adjust to new information. Regardless, we believe that our initiatives to provide more clinical data on the benefit/risk equation can poise TYSABRI for strong growth over the long term.</p>
          <p>In conclusion our core business delivered a solid quarter. Total product sales grew by 12%, we're marking progress on late stage pipeline and we continue to generate strong free cash flow. We face new headwinds this quarter, yet we'll continue to keep our focus on the long term. From that perspective we're in an enviable position. Our pipeline features 6 products in registrational trials, we have several intriguing TYSABRI initiatives underway and we generate sound cash flow allowing us to return capital to shareholders. I'll now hand the call over to Jim for his closing comments.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Paul. In summary, the first quarter introduced some top-line pressure that we were working aggressively to counter. But we continued to deliver bottom line growth and strong cash flow. We're focusing on advancing our enviable late stage pipeline with 6 programs in registrational trials. Overall we made progress in a number of strategic initiatives intended to position the company for long term growth. With that, Kia, we'll now open up the call for Q&amp;A.</p>

In I think the trend in the United States does owe partly to continued pressure from unemployment.

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just wondering about share repurchase plan, it's quite substantial. What should we read into that if anything regarding strategic alternatives, kind of broader use of cash, et cetera? And then, Paul, if you could provide the share count at the end of Q1 that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the average, I'll start with the back end of the question Eric, the average share was shares outstanding on a diluted basis was approximately 273 million. We're probably about 4 or 5 million shares underneath that as of March 31, 2010.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't read too much into it with respect to the strategic agenda. We continue to work earnestly at alternatives for the strategic agenda. I would just point you to the comments I made we still have adequate financing capacity. I think our confidence in the credit markets whether that's right or wrong is certainly much better than it was a year ago. So, you still want to judge us in terms of our capability with respect to financing capacity, as well and I really just you point to the fact that it does underscore the strong free cash flow generation for the enterprise.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I had a question about the TYSABRI drug suspensions. I'm just a little confused here because clearly the &#x2013; what you said about the new patient adds in March shows a trend upward, but yet if I compare what you said about drug suspensions now versus last quarter it looks like they're up. I think, my notes from last quarter said there was about 5% of patients on drug suspension and now it's about 10. So, can you help us reconcile that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, this is Bob Hamm. What we saw beginning in the fourth quarter with the duration story unfolding was a slight increase in the suspension story. I don't believe we said 5%, we were looking at single-digits at the time, high single-digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we look at that closely. The issue is we only have data for the U.S., which is now only half the patients. So, what we're seeing is what we can glean from the U.S. data only. So, that's about all we can say on it at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>The other thing, Joel, I'd just add is that many of those patients that we &#x2013; that Bob referred to as in drug suspension can stay in our patient database in the United States, so the reconciliation between the two is really more made up in the average price per patient.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, I appreciate it. We will as a matter of course, always try to update the best estimate, even when we look backwards in the patient database. In the United States that rarely results in any change. What you would note, though, is that in our international patient database we made a change to correct for our best estimate. And that is just simply a function of the fact that internationally the patient estimates are just that, it's estimates that are a little bit triangulated with the most important piece of data is the shipments going out.</p>
          <p>I would note, as it relates to that, that those changes that we made which brought down the patient numbers in international at the year-end 2009, were largely owing to Germany; which Bob had pointed out which we actually see as the one market outside of the United States that is relatively flat. If you take the trends outside of Germany, a number of the major countries are doing quite well in continuing to add patients.</p>

They have been active in the search and interviewing candidates. I think they are &#x2013; they are certainly very cognizant of the June date, and working towards that. If there is not somebody in place by June, that will be another conversation with the Board, but there's not a specific plan for that.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. A question for you on the PML rate, we're above 1 in 1,000 in patients on drug for over a year. And just curious what the strategy is when the overall post-marketing rate exceeds this? And is there an active dialogue with FDA or EMEA ahead of it?</p>

          <p>This is Rick Munschauer, Geoff. Thank you. We've been monitoring the overall incidence, both by duration of therapy and by effect quite carefully. These are very small numbers. We really, at this point don't think that there's been a variability there that's outside the expected variability on a month-by-month basis given the relative rarity of the events. And certainly, we're in constant communication with the FDA about this. This information widely available and discussed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up to an earlier question on the JC virus assay. Do you guys feel post-AAN that you have more validation work to do on the assay, or is it now a matter of just accumulating data on as many patients as possible? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're very encouraged in our preliminary studies, that 13 out of 13 patients for which we had samples stored away who went on to develop PML were indeed positive by that assay.</p>
          <p>That has led us to the STRATIFY 1 and STRATIFY 2 trials, which will formally test that hypothesis over time. A total of about 9,000 patients will be entered into that trial, and we do feel that trial will give us the bottom line information about the value of this assay in stratifying the risk for PML.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. This is Nick calling in for Jim. With respect to the STRATIFY 1 and 2 trials, I can't remember if on the call did you say that the patients and physicians would receive the data in a real-time fashion back and STRATIFY 1? And I guess we heard at AAN that that was not going to happen now. On then on the STRATIFY 2, I think I've heard you just say, around 9,000 patients, but I've also heard you say 28,000 patients, or all of the patients who are receiving TYSABRI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With response to your first question, yes, the protocol as it's written now does share the information with the doctor and the doctor can share it with the patient when you're enrolled in the STRATIFY 1 or STRATIFY 2 trials. We have been in active discussion with the FDA about this. And at this point, the information is still that the information will be shared going forward, with that.</p>
          <p>And you had a &#x2013; in terms of the study size, STRATIFY 1 is 1,000 patients, that is designed to determine the false negative rate of our assay. STRATIFY 2, we project, will be about 8,000 patients. We'll see in terms of that trial as it progresses whether we're obtaining the appropriate amount of information to achieve our overall end point, and that is establish the validity of this assay in stratifying risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what will you send back to the physician, it will be just a yes/ no, will it have a level, and then the physician and the patient scratch their heads and say, well what do we do now? Will you provide any guidance? You can't provide any guidance as to what they should do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good questions. The report back to the physician will be either positive or negative. And it is a yes/no kind of response. There is an intermediate zone where we do a confirmatory assay. So, the physicians will know, yes, an intermediate test was done, and this was positive or negative in those patients that are borderline. There is obviously no guidance from the company and this is a protocol. What a particular physician does with this information will be done in concert with his discussion with the patient.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">

There's always a pressure to discussions from various countries based on the mix of activities in the MS space. But right now, other than the German announcement, we don't see a major impact there coming this year.</p>
          <p>And the growth, again, it varies from country to country so much, but we certainly see growth based on our ability to expand our reach into countries we currently are moderately engaged in or accruing patients in. So, we see that as a real opportunity going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'm just a little bit confused when you talk about drug suspensions versus drug discontinuations for TYSABRI? I think I caught both of those turns of phrase in the earlier discussion. And I'm just wondering how does the definition differ between the two?</p>

          <p>In the United States, where all TYSABRI-treated patients are entered into the TOUCH program, the physician has the opportunity to re-begin therapy at any time. So in a way, it's a bit difficult for us to determine the difference between a drug suspension and a drug discontinuation. However, those kinds of statistics can only be had when you look at the TOUCH program going forward. We have incomplete data on that.</p>

          <p>Thanks. I was wondering what's a realistic timeline for completion of STRATIFY 2? And is there any interim analysis for STRATIFY 2 focused on JCV prevalence that could augment the data from STRATIFY 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, STRATIFY 2 is intended to go out for two years. It will depend a little bit upon enrollment, and I &#x2013; at this point, the power calculations are done and we generally don't share that kind of information. However, we do really feel that the study is powered to achieve its desired result at about 8,000 patients for 2 years.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to circle back on the, I think Eric's stock buyback question. Paul, you mentioned that you will look to identify this and take advantage of excess cash, can you maybe give a range of where you feel that the optimum net cash level would be, and at what threshold do you have excess cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good question. It's something we debate for years, and I'd hate to &#x2013; the optimal capital structure, you really can't look at in a vacuum, because it's so tied to the business development and corporate development plans that you have underway. We have, I mean, I did want to just emphasize that we certainly love this business. We think there's great returns in this business, and we continue to look for business development and corporate development opportunities.</p>
          <p>But what we're influenced by is that that can come; over the last number of years, you've seen that come in business development opportunities with a relatively modest use of capital in terms of adding value and bringing in-licensing collaborations and business development opportunities into the pipeline.</p>
          <p>We will look at larger uses, as every company in our space does, and we'll also kind of tie that up vis-&#xE0;-vis the credit markets and the financing capacity that is available to us. Which I think at this point in time we'd call it as more favorable than a year ago. So I think it's still a balanced approach, but should there be excess capital in the business which we've largely concluded very recently, we will look to return it to shareholders in the most efficient manner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have a question with regard to the 190 per week new patient adds. So next phase, out March average, do you &#x2013; can you provide more? Is that higher at the end of March it was at the beginning of March or is it too early to have real number for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, gosh, I actually don't have it in it my head discerned on the four-week basis within March. I don't think it's materially different week to week to week in March. And even if it was, I don't know if that's incredibly telling. I think the broader trend that we've seen in the business is that, subsequent to the label discussions, and there is a lag effect here, right?</p>
          <p>Because patients and physicians decide, and then it takes 4 to 5 or 6 weeks to put them on therapy, and get their first infusion. So subsequent to those discussions that were happening in the fourth quarter, we did see a modest slowdown in the net patient adds on a gross basis as well. We've seen that largely pick up, and that kind of trends back into the 4 to 5 weeks since the label discussions were largely finished. So, I think it is, I'd just keep it at the full month of March basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And because for the quarter it is about 120, I am just wondering, so this new patient add, really is not either going down or going up gradually. They really kind of drop or rise up pretty significantly, can you explain that, why one month could be so different than the month before or the month after?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I think it's owing &#x2013; what we think is it's owing to physicians digesting new information. And most meaningful new information was the label discussions in the back end of the year. We're largely past that, and we feel little bit heartened by the trajectory that we're seeing in March.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the follow-up. It's Nick again for Jim. I'm interested in your thoughts on primary infection for JCV while patients are taking TYSABRI. And my thoughts really &#x2013; my concerns are driven by the preclinical SV40 data which are worrying. And as you know, SV40 has 67% homology to JCV, so perhaps not a perfect model. I think you quoted a 2% per annum primary conversion rate to JCV positivity. And as you know, I'm wondering on your level of confidence of this because the published data comparing JCV alliza to a more elegant piece of that assay suggests that alliza 56:00 underestimates the true exposure, previous exposure to the JC virus. So how confident are you in that 2% primary conversion number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Nick, this is Jim. We decided to do a jump ball on that question. And we appointed the least qualified person to answer. That became me.</p>
          <p>And I'll let Rick or Evan add into it, but the data we have on the primary infection is not only the data we've seen from our own collection of samples over a couple year period of time, but what else is out there in the literature. And it appears to be in the range of 1% per year. Maybe I'll let Evan and Rick maybe add onto that a little bit of color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Evan. Obviously, the assays and other things that you use are really important in determining all of this. When we first started looking into PML several years ago, there were numbers all over the place about the incidence of latent or prior exposure to JC virus. We think that we've gotten better assays and we believe that our data and the program that we have going forward, will give better answers to that question.</p>
          <p>At the moment, the 1 to 2% we think is pretty reasonable. I don't think that you describe maybe more sensitive techniques or other things, I just don't think that that number is going to be wildly off, to a point where it's really going to matter. Whether it's 1.2 or 2.3, I think we're in the range and the program we have going forward, will help better define that.</p>
          <p>Obviously we think that's something important and as we put this program together going forward, to help stratify risk for patients and physicians, obviously the new conversion rate that happens, whatever that is, is going to be, an element of the pieces of information they need to use and monitor to make good decisions. So we have an interest in trying to get that right over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can I just ask from the other 13 or so cases of PML, do you have any baseline data that you can go back to, to try and ask that question if primary conversion connotes a higher risk for developing PML?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the data that we've given you, those 13 cases represents to date the patient base that we have with the right data to be able to go back and ask those questions. If we had more, we'd be sharing more. We'd like to get the numbers up as well. So as new cases come up, sometimes there is that opportunity, but that is probably where most of those cases are going to come from, new numbers.</p>
