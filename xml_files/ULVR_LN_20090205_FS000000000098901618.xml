          <p>Good morning. Life is not that bad. Okay, good to see some familiar faces. We will start right away. I am lucky we didn't get snowed in this morning. The London is very unpredictable, if there is less than one inch of snow it panics. I am glad we don't have our headquarters in Moscow. We'd never meet anybody.</p>
          <p>Good morning everyone and obviously welcome to the 2008 full year results and then the fourth quarter results presentation as well. I am joined this morning by Jim Lawrence, our Chief Financial Officer, James Allison, our Senior Vice President for Investor Relations, and in the audience we have some of our fellow colleagues with us, perhaps you want to quickly stand up if I start with Harish, who runs all of our developing markets basically. We have Doug sitting next to him. Doug runs Western Europe. Vindi, good morning. Vindi runs all of our categories, Genevi&#xE8;ve, our R&amp;D Director, and then we have Steve Williams, our Legal Counsel, always take him with you. We have Richard Rivers and then we have Mike Polk, who runs the Americas. Good morning guys.</p>
          <p>Well, this is my first address to the investors as CEO of Unilever and I am both pleased and excited to be doing this despite the difficult economic environment. I am convinced that the actions that we've already taken to make this business simpler and more efficient will help us to weather the impact of what has become a global downturn. More importantly there is scope to build on the strong foundations which have been laid by Patrick and to make Unilever more competitive still. Later in the presentations I will share with you some of my thinking moving forward but first I would like Jim to run us through some of the assessments of our business performance in 2008 and well as quarter four. So let me hand it over to Jim first. Jim.</p>

          <p>Thank you Paul and let me add my welcome to all of you and in particular welcome to this room which is being used for the first time for an investors meeting and delighted to have all of you with us. As per normal practice I draw your attention please to the disclaimer relating to forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures and I note that this disclaimer is included here and will also be posted with the text of this presentation on Unilever's website.</p>
          <p>In 2008 we have been confronted with unprecedented levels of commodity price inflation and an unpredictable and, through the course of the year, a generally deteriorating economic environment. Against this challenging background we've delivered underlying sales growth well in excess of our 3 to 5% guidance and a better underlying operating margin for the year. We characterize this as solid performance and a continuation of the good performance which Unilever has been showing in recent years. The actions that we've taken have made us sharper, faster, more efficient and more able to win. Certainly there is further to travel but the progress thus far is clear and encouraging.</p>
          <p>So, let me now turn to the specifics of our performance in 2008. 2008 was our fourth consecutive year of accelerating organic sales growth to 7.4% for the year, and in this year driven strongly by price increases, volumes were flat. At the same time we've improved underlying operating margin by 10 basis points and this is despite rapidly escalating input costs which added &#x20AC;2.7 billion to our cost base. And that is the equivalent of 640 basis points of margin compression, truly unprecedented, truly exceptional. Nonetheless in 2008, cash flow from operating activities was &#x20AC;5.3 billion which is &#x20AC;100 million up on last year and particularly satisfying, I should say, was the improvement in cash flow generation in the second half of 2008 after a weaker first half. 3.6 billion of cash was returned to shareholders during the course of the year through share buybacks and dividend payments and today we're announcing a total dividend increase of some 3% for NV and 19% for PLC both in respect of the fiscal year 2008.</p>
          <p>The completion of the sale of our Bertolli olive oil business in December brought total disposals in the year to approaching &#x20AC;1.6 billion of turnover. And, in so doing, we have raised the long-term growth profile of Unilever and we've generated returns which are well in excess of the retention value of the businesses that we've sold. After-tax profit on the disposals for the year was &#x20AC;1.6 billion, the after-tax cash proceeds from these disposals were &#x20AC;1.9 billion and we believe this brings to a conclusion that part of the transformation program specifically associated with disposals. Some of the brands which we originally identified are performing well and there is no longer a compelling economic case for exit. That said, a number of minor disposals will certainly be progressed and we'll continue to keep our whole portfolio under active review.</p>
          <p>Now, at the same time, we've acquired businesses which are more in line with our strategy. Inmarko, the leading ice cream business in Russia, was acquired in April and I'm pleased to report that that business is progressing ahead of our plan. And last week, we announced the acquisition of the premium salon care brands of TIGI and this will strengthen our personal care portfolio.</p>
          <p>Let me now look at the numbers in a little bit more detail. Turnover for the full year was &#x20AC;40.5 billion, which is 0.8% ahead of 2007. Currency, of course, adversely impacted the full year turnover by 4.8%, while disposals, net of acquisitions, further reduced the turnover by 1.4%. The former reflects the strength of our reporting currency, that is the currency translation. Our reporting currency is euro and it was strong during the year against a wide range of currencies including, of course, the US dollar and sterling. Sales in quarter four were &#x20AC;10.2 billion which is 2.6% ahead of last year. This, again, after a 2.7% reduction from disposals, net of acquisitions, and after an adverse currency affect of 1.6%.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales growth was 7.3% in the quarter, and 7.4% for the year as a whole. Growth was increasingly driven by price as the year progressed, and this reflects the strong and concerted pricing action that we took to protect the business in the face of the commodity cost increase, which I mentioned earlier. These actions have negatively impacted volume growth; as a number of markets have gone into recession and consumers have adjusted their spending, the effect on volume has been more pronounced. Trade de-stocking in quarter four has also been a drag on volume. Price growth for the year as a whole was 7.2% and volume growth was slightly positive. Volume declined by 1.6% in quarter four as our pricing peaked at over 9% in the quarter. We are taking action to address volume growth and we'll come back to this later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at regional performance and we start with Western Europe. And we're going to go through this under the new line of reporting. This is the Western Europe which reports to Doug Baillie; and there we saw underlying sales growth in Western Europe of 1.3% in both the quarter and the full year. Volume was down 1.7% in the quarter, but for the full year volume was down 2.4%. Market growth in Western Europe continued to slow and was roughly 2% in the quarter. The growth of private label continues to put pressure on branded players and this is particularly the case in Southern Europe. In Northern Europe, private label shares are flat. Our performance in the UK and Netherlands continues to be strong, up close to 4 and 6% respectively for the full year, and both are up by more than 7% in the fourth quarter. Germany and France remained challenging markets as does Spain where the economic situation has deteriorated faster and further than elsewhere in Europe.</p>
          <p>The transformation program in Western Europe has been more intense than any other part of Unilever. And excellent progress is being made despite the challenges faced in what are very competitive markets in the year we've just seen. First, the completion of the move to a single harmonized IT system. This has been described by Accenture as one of the most rapid, sizable and successful ERP rollouts which they've been involved. And it is a keen enabler for supply chain optimization and simplification and is a significant contributor to substantial costs, substantial savings and IT costs in the region.</p>
          <p>Second, the disposal of Boursin and the Bertolli olive oil business and the move of Lipton ready-to- drink tea into the Pepsi-Lipton joint venture took place in the year.</p>
          <p>And third, we made further progress in the Unilever organizations which operate across country boundaries. Belgium is now performing well within the Benelux cluster and UK, Ireland is now setting new benchmarks for cost efficiency. We have announced the closure, we're streamlining, of some 24 factories in Western Europe and 12 have already been closed or disposed. Once again progress is clear and the impact on performance is becoming more obvious. The underlying operating margin of Western Europe increased during the year by 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now we'll turn to Mike Polk's Americas. The Americas grew by 6.5% in the year and by 6.6% in the fourth quarter. Volume growth was about 80 basis points for the full year and was negative 3.1 in the fourth quarter. In the US we grew by 3.8% for the full year, 3.1% in the quarter, both in line with the market and both price driven. While market volumes in food have remained flat, personal care markets are down, reflecting the consumer de-stocking and reduced consumption. However, our shares have held up well. We also experienced some trade de-stocking in the fourth quarter which further held back volume. Private label have gained share particularly in foods but I am pleased to say for the most part not at our expense.</p>
          <p>Turning to Latin America, Latin America grew by around 12% in both the quarter and the year Volume was positive for the year but negative in the fourth quarter with weaker economies and weaker currencies impacting consumer confidence and again we also saw some significant trade de-stocking in Brazil.</p>
          <p>The transformation program continued to progress well and I would cite the disposals of our North American laundry brands during the year as well as the close of the Lawry's seasonings sale. They were both completed in quarter three. The Bertolli olive oil disposal was completed in quarter four. Our Ice Cream business was integrated into a single head office for the US based in Englewood Cliffs. And more recently, we announced that the US, Canada, and the Caribbean would be managed together as a North American multi-country organization. So again, we see clear and pleasing progress on our transformation agenda.</p>
          <p>Underlying operating margin was flat for the year with pricing and cost savings offsetting sharply higher input costs. Unrecovered overheads from disposals and the lower volumes were also absorbed.</p>
          <p>I turn now to the expanded Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe under Harish. And growth there in this region was 14.2% for the year and 13.5% in the fourth quarter. Encouragingly, growth was broad based with continued strong growth in India and Indonesia, which are both powerhouse businesses where Unilever has great scale. Indeed our top five countries grew by upwards of 18% for the full year. Across the region, volumes were up 3.5% in the year, but flat in the quarter with some of the countries in the region seeing signs of slowdown in consumption and others such as Russia and China being impacted by trade de-stocking. Despite this, China continued to post strong volume growth.</p>
          <p>The one Unilever organization is in place throughout the region, supply chain management for Asia, Africa is being centralized in Singapore and the move to a single SAP system is progressing to plan. And Indonesia we started up with that at the beginning of January. Underlying operating margin declined by 20 basis points in the year reflecting increased investment in building our capabilities to drive growth, and reflecting the sharp increases in input costs which were partially offset by the benefits of our savings programs.</p>
          <p>Now, let's spend a few moments on the category performance. Savory, Dressings and Spreads grew by over 7% in the year and over 6% in the quarter driven by vitality focused innovation. I'd sight examples such as the launch of Knorr Stock Pots, Bertolli frozen meals, Rama margarine which offers better taste and less fat and is supported by the goodness of margarine campaign.</p>
          <p>The Ice Cream and Beverages category grew by close to 6% in both the fourth quarter and for the year with our premium range of Magnum Temptations and Ben &amp; Jerry's performing well as consumer's desire for indulgent treats continued despite the recession. And Lipton delivered another strong year particularly in Asia, Africa, CEE, as consumers up-traded from loose tea to regular tea bags and then again to Pyramid tea bags.</p>
          <p>Home Care performed well again with close to 10% underlying sales growth for the year and 12% growth in the quarter. We continue to rollout margin-enhancing innovation using superior technology, which included the launch of Dirt is Good with long-lasting freshness, and a new premium range of fabric conditioners and household care products such as CIF actifizz and Domestos Grotbuster.</p>
          <p>Personal Care grew by over 6.5% in both the quarter and the year with a good balance between volume and price. Superior technologies deployed to new Personal Care products are benefiting consumers and driving growth. These include Vaseline, new clinical therapy lotion, Signal White Now toothpaste, and Dove and Rexona, hair-minimizing deodorants which were launched last month. And finally, it's been yet another excellent year for Clear Anti-Dandruff shampoo and Axe with its chocolate variant now being the most successful deodorant variant we've ever launched.</p>
          <p>Now that covers what I wanted to say about the drivers of our top line performance. And I will now turn to other aspects of our financial performance and I will start with operating profit. We'll start with the full year and I will do it in absolute money and in constant exchange rates, making the underlying performance easier to read. So for the full year, this chart format we've used before, the combined effect from volume mix and disposals was around &#x20AC;200 million, price increases added &#x20AC;2.9 billion. As I mentioned earlier, commodity increases reduced operating profit by around 2.7 billion and other costs increased by just under 1 billion.</p>
          <p>So while pricing covered commodity cost increases, it was not sufficient to cover the totality of cost increases, still less to maintain gross margins. However, savings programs are on track for the year, delivering 1.1 billion. And in terms of adverting and promotional expenditure, there we increased by &#x20AC;50 million for the year. That's left an underlying increase in operating profit of &#x20AC;370 million which is 6% up on 2007.</p>
          <p>Now we'll take a look at the quarter, again we'll do it in absolute money measured in constant exchange rates. The combined effect here of volume, mix and disposals was to reduce operating profit by around &#x20AC;100 million. Pricing peaked in the quarter, contributed in the quarter &#x20AC;900 million, not enough to cover commodity cost increases of nearly 800 million and the other cost increases of around 400.</p>
          <p>This level of other cost inflation is higher than the average for the year which reflects three things. First, fixed cost under recovery from the reduced volume and from the disposals, the negative impact of currency movements on non-commodity costs, and the phasing of overhead and other costs through the year.</p>
          <p>So in Q4 you can see that despite the significant level of price increases, costs did increase by more. Balancing this, our savings programs continued to accelerate through the course of the year and delivered in the quarter &#x20AC;300 million. Finally, A&amp;P expenditure reduced by about &#x20AC;50 million leaving an underlying reduction in operating profit of about &#x20AC;40 million, 3% lower than the same quarter in 2007. Now, before the loss of profit from the disposed business the underlying profit would have increased or would've been 30 million more in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the development of operating margin. Our full year operating margin was 17.7%, but of course this included just over 900 million of restructuring and impairment charges and disposal profits of 2.2 billion. Put the two together and they added 310 basis points to the operating margin. Excluding RDIs, restructuring disposals impairments, there was an underlying improvement in the operating margin of 10 basis points for the full year. And of course that included that decline of 70 basis points in the fourth quarter, so for the full year 10 basis points up. The lower margin in the fourth quarter reflects the impact of lower volumes, the phasing of overhead costs, negative currency impacts, as mentioned, and of course the sharply higher commodity costs. Short-term under-recoveries arising from the disposals reduced the underlying operating margin by some 30 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at commodity costs and A&amp;P expenditure in a bit more detail. The commodity cost impact on the P&amp;L peaked in quarter three, but remained high in the quarter four, impacting the year by 640 basis points. Underlying reductions in commodity costs were heavily offset by negative currency impacts, particularly the strengthening of the US dollar and weakening of Sterling. We expect to see substantial commodity cost headwinds continuing in our P&amp;L throughout quarter one before beginning to ease in quarter two. At the same time, we'll begin to lap price increases, which we were taken in quarter one of '08, and so the price component of sales growth will reduce as the year unfolds. In combination this will mean that margins in the first half of 2009 are likely to be lower than the corresponding period in 2008 before recovering in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Advertising and promotional expenditure was up &#x20AC;50 million in the year as I mentioned, but down 70 basis points when measured as a percentage of sales. Our share of advertising spend relative to competitors in our markets increased in 2008 in both foods and home and personal care, indicating that we have continued to invest to strengthen our brands. This is something not all competitors have done to the same extent. Further, savings from media efficiency programs have been reinvested and media rates in a number of markets are down most particularly in the fourth quarter. And this has enabled our A&amp;P spend to go further, getting more bang for our buck.</p>
          <p>Now, we turn to earnings per share. Earnings per share grew by 32% in the year, but with 26% of that coming from the net impact of RDIs. Operational drivers together contributed 6% to EPS growth and the 1.5 billion share buyback in the first half of 2008 added a further 2% to the EPS. There was a negative impact of 4% from currency and a further negative 3% from tax, which reflects the substantial favorable settlement of tax audits in the first half of 2007 as a comparator  This left underlying EPS growth of 1% for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>Our financial strategy targets a competitive balance sheet with a strong single A credit rating. And I reiterate that commitment today. We believe it's continued to serve us well. Our strong balance sheet and prudent financial management have enabled us to access low cost debt throughout the financial crisis. This ready access to low cost liquidity is a competitive strength. And in 2008 we issued Swiss bonds to the value of SFR1 billion and a 750 million Eurobond, each at very attractive prices. In addition we've accessed commercial paper throughout the year at very competitive prices substantially below LIBOR.</p>
          <p>Net debt reduced through the course of the year to 8 billion, as at the end of December. And finance costs, net of borrowing, were 1% lower in 2008, reflecting lower borrowing costs on what was a higher average level of net debt through the year. Despite the strong commodity cost driven inflation, our working capital increased by less than 200 million in the year. Cash flow from operating activities was &#x20AC;5.3 billion, and as I mentioned before, with a strong improvement in the second half.</p>
          <p>During the year we invested around 1.1 billion in capital expenditure. I mentioned before pre-tax disposal proceeds were 2.5 billion in 2008 and that was up 2.1 versus 2007. After-tax proceeds from these disposals were 1.9 billion. Our net pension liability at the end of December was 3.4 billion. That is up from the 1.1 billion that was on the books as at the end of 2007. So as I'm sure you are all aware, this reflects a reduction in the asset values in the world markets, partially offset by a reduction in liabilities caused by the increased corporate AA bond rates, which we use for discounting those liabilities and putting it onto the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we expect cash contributions to pension funds to be higher than in 2008, but below the levels of the preceding two years. Return on invested capital in 2008 was 15.7%, boosted of course by the profits from disposals. If we exclude those, the return on invested capital was 11.2%, broadly in line with 2007 on a comparable basis.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to the cash, which we've been returning to shareholders. We're recommending a final dividend of &#x20AC;0.51 per NV ordinary shares and 40.19 pence per PLC share. That will raise our full year dividend by 3% for NV and 19% for PLC respectively. This will bring the total dividend payment for the year to &#x20AC;2.1 billion and the total cash returned to shareholders in the year to 3.6 billion, which of course includes the 1.5 billion of share buybacks. From the chart, which you see displayed, you can see that cash returned to shareholders over the last two years has been in excess of &#x20AC;7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let me just say a few words about quarterly dividends before I conclude. Our current dividend practice we believe to be unnecessarily complex. For example, we have different calendars for final dividends of NV and PLC, which leads to different ex-dividend dates and temporary share price distortions. And different exchange rates are used to determine the dividends for the different listings leading to different dividend amounts when translated to US dollars for NV and PLC in New York. We wish to simplify our dividend practice and we believe that it's best achieved by moving to a quarterly dividend with one dividend calendar and one set of exchange rates for all share listings. This will align dividend payments with the cash flow generation of the business and provide more frequent payment to shareholders.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that the total euro amount of dividend available for shareholders will not be impacted by these changes. It is simply the payment mechanics and the exchange rate conventions will be different. These proposed changes will be brought forward to the Annual General Meetings in May, and, if approved, the new quarterly dividend calendar will become effective from the 1st of January 2010. More details on the dividend proposals can be found on the unilever.com website.</p>
          <p>Now with that I'm happy to pass the button back to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. Let me start my part of the presentation with some initial observations if I may. I believe that Unilever has made good progress in recent years, and is now in a much better and stronger position to compete. 2008 results are certainly a testimony to that. We've been able to hold the volumes despite restructuring the organization and the disruptions associated with the significant disposals that Jim talked about. That we've done so in this environment gives me the confidence that we have a solid foundation from which to grow volume again. And we have delivered at the same time an improvement in underlying margin, the 10 basis points, despite the 2.7 billion additional commodity costs. I've been in this industry for 30 years, and I've certainly never seen increases to that extent.</p>
          <p>I believe that we would not have been able to do this performance a few years ago in this company. However, it is also clear that we are facing a tougher economic environment. In many places around the world we've slipped into recession and the general consensus is that we might not see a significant improvement in the next 18 to 24 months if we like it or not. And we will certainly plan our business on that basis. Better to be proven wrong by being on the conservative side than the other way around.</p>
          <p>Markets have come under pressure, first in developed economies, but now also in the developing markets and we've seen a rapid change in recent months. In developed markets we see consumers trading down, drawing down from their pantry stocks, or simply consuming less. At the same time we see retailers increasingly pushing their own brands and driving efficiencies in the supply chain by reducing their inventories. All of this puts pressure on the system. In developing markets we fortunately still see growth, but demand is slowing down as a result of the rapidly changing economic environment there as well and the impact of cost inflation. With currencies weakening in a number of these developing countries we actually don't see prices coming down significantly in that part of the world in the near future.</p>
          <p>Whilst we are certainly not fully where we want to be as a company, I believe that the changes that Unilever has been making under Patrick's leadership and the team that is represented here has made us certainly a more resilient and more able to compete company in this environment. We now have a more focused portfolio of brands as a result of the selective disposals. In fact, in the last three years alone we have disposed over 3 billion of our turnover. We also have a more competitive cost structure as a result of the restructuring efforts. Firmly on track to deliver the targets originally set out of 1.5 billion savings in 2010 against our 2006 cost base. We've been able to adjust the organizational size in fact from over 200,000 people to about 170,000 currently. And the senior management levels have been halved over that same period of time. We have as a result a leaner, faster organization, significantly reduced the layers, increased the clarity of the roles and accountability at the same time, what I call, better leveraging the scale and the power of one of Unilever.</p>
          <p>The change program in Unilever has been enormous, in fact much bigger than what I thought before I came in. And what has impressed me, that this has been achieved at the same time as the business results have improved as well. You've recognized this, and I appreciate that by putting the firm, putting the company firmly in the middle of the pack in TSR. It's a good achievement, and a bit in my opinion, like driving a car faster whilst changing the engine at the same time. I've not seen many companies, in fact I've not seen any, that have had that scale of change and at the same time able to deliver these results.</p>
          <p>Now, we have many elements in our business model that place us well in the current economic environment. First, we have strong brands and category positions. In fact, 13 of our brands have more than &#x20AC;1 billion in turnover and 70% of our portfolio actually comes from categories or market combinations in which we are leaders. We have the number one position in seven out of the 11 categories in which we operate. With consumers trading down, it also serves us well to be positioned across the spectrum of the market rather than be overly exposed in the premium sector as some of our other companies.</p>
          <p>The fact that we have both food and HPC businesses is also an advantage. Especially with food seeming to hold up better in today's market environment, as Jim was talking about. We're also able to increasingly leverage our technologies across both segments and we shared some examples of that in Port Sunlight with you. Good examples are on the way in which we are, for example, deploying emulsion or extrusion technologies across both food and HPC. We have a balanced D and D&amp;E portfolio, and D&amp;E, as you know, accounts now more or less for half of our business. It is worth pointing out, as I mentioned before, that although growth in D&amp;E has slowed down, there is ample opportunity still for growth in those regions. On top, we have very strong positions in some of these countries that are less affected by the current crisis.</p>
          <p>Our significant restructuring efforts over the last few years are also beginning to pay off. This will provide us with the fuel that we need to reinvest in our business and ensure again that we start growing. We have a strong balance sheet, which has served us well throughout this financial crisis and for the months or years to come. Cash flow generation is particularly strong and Jim has already alluded to that. Cash flow from operational activities was actually 5.3 billion in 2008, although I'd be the first one to say that it still can be stronger.</p>
          <p>Despite the progress we've made in implementing the One Unilever, it is also clear to me that we're not yet where we want to be. We still do have gaps to close. On top of this the environment is changing and, believe me, competitors are not standing still either. In fast moving consumer goods, you simply do not succeed by just closing gaps. You only win by creating gaps versus your competitors. And to do that we simply need to raise our game.</p>
          <p>There are several areas where we will need to set the bar higher. First of all we have to get our volumes growing again. As I said before, you cannot save your way to prosperity. We're definitely in better shape as a result of the restructuring of the organization, but long-term value will only be created, will only be built if we consistently grow our volumes. Whilst we've done reasonably well holding value shares, we have seen pressure on our volume shares. Once more, even allowing for the very strong headwinds that we're facing, I believe that the surest way to build a long-term shareholder value is to get volume growth back firmly on the agenda.</p>
          <p>So now, with the majority of the restructuring program behind us, we need to increasingly focus our energy externally as an organization versus internally. It requires us to put the consumer and the customer firmly back at the heart of all we do. That's why we are here. We will certainly use the current economic pressure, which could not have come as a better time to galvanize faster action so that we can emerge from this recession stronger and more competitive than we've ever been before. I am confident that we can do that just as we've done in previous cycles. Actually don't forget when I was reading up on the history of this company, this company was actually created in the recession of the 30s and has faced several crises since, either in Latin America, Far East or Europe and guess what, each time coming out stronger.</p>
          <p>Whilst we can talk lofty long-term goals, I believe firmly that in the current economic climate we simply stick to 2009 and its priorities. Managing the business real-time, maintaining a high degree of flexibility and reacting fast to the external environment, this will be key. Our priorities are simple. First and foremost we will re-ignite volume growth. And second, we will protect our cash flow and margins whilst we do this, no trade-off, it can be done.</p>
          <p>Let's look at these priorities in more detail. First, I certainly make no apologies to start with volume growth. As I've mentioned we need to re-ignite volume and put everything in place to get to sustainable growth again. To do this, we need to drive down costs faster and reinvest part of that in the business. We need to strengthen our brands.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly share some of the actions we are taking now. The focus will be on improving our brands and portfolios, strengthening our go-to-market capabilities and to continuing to evolve our organization and culture.</p>
          <p>On our brands and portfolios, first priority is staying competitive in this tough environment. It is about basic competitiveness. We're looking more aggressively at where we have gaps in our business versus our competitive sets and correcting them fast. In fast moving consumer goods, there are no such things as holding share. We need to get more of our strategic brands and categories in the mode of growing share and developing plans and support behind that. We have identified those areas in our top 10 countries and categories where we have the outages and we've put 30-day plans in place to fix that.</p>
          <p>The second area is that we need to drive our innovations harder and faster. This includes pulling innovations forward where we can and faster expanding them across multiple countries when we have successful innovations. We certainly know how to do that and we have many examples of that. Dove 'Go Fresh' for example was launched in January in the UK and the Netherlands. With its success it was launched in eight countries by June and in 55 countries in December, it can be done.</p>
          <p>Third, we have to get into the mindset of growing everywhere not only in developing and emerging markets. Around 50% of our business is still in Europe and the US. And there is no good reason why we cannot hold on or grow our volumes in these regions either. After all, some of our biggest inventions, Axe, Magnum, et cetera, were born in Europe.</p>
          <p>Fourthly, we need to strengthen our portfolios again by ensuring that we always have stronger offerings in the value segment. We need to better communicate this inherent value of our products. Play what we call the full price piano to do that offer choice including different formats and variants where needed. And very simply, we need to be where the shoppers are.</p>
          <p>And fifth, some of the developing countries that will, according to the OECD, be more affected by the current crisis actually happen to be countries where we have a relatively weaker market position. That's good news, because I see this as an opportunity that will allow us to invest and strengthen into those countries and drive our portfolio and brands there as well, countries like China and Russia.</p>
          <p>We're also putting in place the elements which will support our longer term growth aspirations. We have to take care of today but also invest in sustainable growth in the future. One example of that is the new single R&amp;D organization which we spoke about in Port Sunlight. Under Genevi&#xE8;ve's leadership this new organization will take effect as of now. And we will see the benefits of that in the years to come, I am convinced of that. Not surprisingly with this agenda there also will be no compromise by the way on A&amp;P and R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Next to strengthening our brands and portfolios we also have to sharpen our go-to-market capabilities. Firstly, with the appointment of David Blanchard as of January, we have appointed a global supply chain leader and integrated all the different supply chain functions from buying, manufacturing and distribution into one organization. That's a huge change. This not only results in more cost efficient supply chain but also will allow us to significantly improve the service levels and consumer and customer satisfaction along the way.</p>
          <p>We will also strengthen our customer development operations putting even sharper focus against our more successful and faster growing customers to be sure that we get our fair share of the growth. And we're putting in place increased capabilities to drive further our shopper knowledge into everything we do. In the US we have just opened our new customer innovation center and the first customers are already coming through.</p>
          <p>Finally the organization and culture, shortly we will announce some of the leadership changes which will strengthen key categories and country operations. We will also increase the focus on the consumer and customer as we move to the next phase in our development. We're simplifying and sharpening our reward structures to further drive a performance culture. We're putting in place clearer responsibilities and accountabilities for all of us to deliver. And finally, we will continue to drive the external focus and speed that we need in this environment.</p>
          <p>Now, let me briefly talk -- two of the other things that I've touched upon, cash flow and margins. Recognizing that the achievement of both are not mutually exclusive, let me start with the cost savings since it actually underpins both. Simply put, I think that it is essential to remove all costs from our systems which consumers are not willing to pay for and no better moment than doing it now. Lots of progress has been made here, but there is still lots more to be done.</p>
          <p>Indeed, there are a number of areas where we still are not cost-competitive. That's great news provided we do something about it. As someone said recently in one of the interviews I was reading, there is nothing better than leveraging a good crisis and we shall use this economic downturn to create a new sense of urgency in our approach to cost and organizational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Now, here are a few examples of what we are doing now. On indirects, we've frozen our salaries, reduced external hiring and cut many parts of our discretionary spending. In our cost structures we will use our scale to accelerate our better buying and the new organization I talked about will help us do that increasingly at a global scale. We also have appointed for this reason Marc Engel as Global Procurement Officer. And we will improve the efficiency of our spending in marketing and sales.</p>
          <p>This all will come on top of the savings we will generate from the existing restructuring programs, which we will try to pull forward. And that ladies and gentlemen will provide the fuel that we need for the growth I was talking about. In short, we will use this economic crisis as a catalyst to act faster, more decisively and come out stronger. And let me be clear. These are changes that are born out of aspiration, not desperation.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow remains strong with cash flow from operations as Jim talked, over &#x20AC;5.3 billion for the full year. A good performance given the input cost headwinds we've had. We do have a reputation for strong cash flow and I'm determined that this will remain so. We've made good progress in working capital over the last years and certainly consider ourselves to be towards the top of our peer group. In 2008, as you will have seen, our working capital increased by about &#x20AC;200 million which actually is not that bad in this tremendous inflationary environment we've seen. But we actually think we can do better. The actions on cost and capital management will provide the opportunity to better support our brands whilst protecting overall cash generation.</p>
          <p>Let me also clarify how we intend to use the cash. Our priorities there, as well, are clear. First, we will use the cash to reinvest in the business to grow. Then we will provide dividend to our shareholders and meet our obligations to fund the pension plans, slightly higher incidentally in 2009 than 2008, but lower than the levels in 2006 and 2007. The final priority will be to look at bolt-on acquisitions, Inmarko ice cream, TIGI hair care. We have no further plans for share buybacks in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>I am certainly excited and energized by the potential we have in Unilever. And frankly otherwise, I wouldn't be here. Since I have arrived I have not seen anything that really concerns me, in fact, just the opposite, lots of opportunities from a very solid base. We can be grateful what the team has put in place and what we are inheriting here. We have the technology, we have the brands, we have the people and the values to succeed, both short-term as well as long-term. The economic outlook is volatile and there certainly will be impacts that are unclear on the consumers, customers, stakeholders but we are ready for that.</p>
          <p>In these exceptional times, I believe that it's certainly is not helpful to provide top and bottom line guidance for 2009 let along 2010. And it is unhelpful for two reasons. First, no one can be clear about the exact extent of the current recession or the speed of recovery. And second, the 2010 targets were set at a time that was actually very different from the current circumstances. We simply need to ensure that we focus on creating the long-term value in today's environment. I firmly believe that the short-term priorities I have set out for the business in terms of growing volume whilst protecting cash flow and margins are very much in the interest, in the long-term interest of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now finally, looking further out, I am confident that Unilever will be able to lift its growth profile of the business while steadily improving margins every year. That is why I joined this business and I hope that you are as excited about it as I am. With that, I'll stop my part of the presentations and we certainly will be more than happy to take questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. I am going to suggest that we take 20 minutes now for questions because we've run over a bit. We will take questions from the floor, also on the telephones and a number of questions have come in online. Let me just explain how it's going to work on the floor and on the telephones. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Alan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alan Erskine from UBS. Just a couple of quick questions. Firstly if possible, could you tell us what the volume growth was in Q4 in Eastern Europe? Trying to triangulate that it looks like Eastern Europe was quite weak. And also the volume growth in Home Care in Q4 if that's possible?</p>
          <p>And then a question for Paul, you said that you more or less maintained value share but not volume share. Is the implication of that that you felt maybe Unilever pushed prices up a little bit too far or maybe didn't move quickly enough into the value end of the price piano?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly I take your point about not wanting to give top line guidance in a very difficult and challenging year, but if you are determined to grow volume and the annualized effect of prices that you've already taken through the second half of '08 would give you a couple of points of pricing, might it not have been possible to say we will be at the bottom of 3 to 5% range or do you think even that is too much of a hostage to fortune?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no I understand Alan, that the more data you have on that one is the better, but in this current environment, I'll start with the last one. As I said before, I'm very clear what the priorities are. But it doesn't serve anything with this fast changing environment to give exact numbers now. And I look at our competitive set and I look at what they are doing and changing that every five minutes, I don't think it's a way to communicate with each other.  We'll manage the business, we'll deliver the results and that is what we get paid for.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; let me talk about the pricing. I think this company has taken the courageous steps and again we see that now versus our competitive set, to reflect these cost increases early in our products. You see that in the last quarter our pricing actually 9%. You see that in some of regions, the one that Harish is leading where actually last quarter pricing was 14%. So it's not surprising to me that we see a little bit of pressure on the volumes and the markets and consumption as a result of that. But it's in a much better position that we're in than if you have to catch up or haven't fully reflected that, which I've seen in some of the results announcements from some of the people we compete with.</p>
          <p>So, I feel comfortable where we are, but it is very clear that we have seen better performance on our value shares than volume shares, and this we need to be sure in this environment as you rightfully say that we provide the right value equations to the consumer. It's not only about price, it's also performance but we have to get the right value equations. And on some of these cases, as my friend Charlie pointed out in his recent report, we might have the equation not totally where we want it to be, but broadly I'm happy about that.</p>
          <p>On Eastern Europe, I don't want to go into any individual region. Our life doesn't depend on Eastern Europe alone. If you look at the last quarter I'm actually fairly positive about that. We see the volume decline in Europe, which is a tough region, slowing down, less decline. I don't like that, I want to see growth. But actually we had a good quarter in a very tough environment, and Doug is doing an outstanding job there to get this business to grow again. In Harish's region it's true that the volume came down but this is 14% pricing and these countries are going through the same economic shocks that we see anywhere else.</p>
          <p>So, I think if you look at the results even in the fourth quarter, with the perspective of the pricing and the volumes, I feel confident that we have a good base for going into next year. And certainly feel more confident about that now that I've seen some of the others coming out with results.</p>

          <p>Okay. The lady here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Celine Pannuti from JPMorgan. Two questions, one coming back on volume, would it be possible to have an idea on what has been the volume lost to de-stocking and what has been the volume lost to maybe market share loss? And I mean it's a bit  continent with you, I think that the category volume should still hold, no, hopefully people still wash themselves and so on. And the follow up on that is on prices, you said you wanted to be value competitive. What does that mean? In an event where you readjust your prices, do you think that volume will be down? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is I would like if you could take us through the margin components because I can see that you have headwinds in '08 that will probably still be there but turn maybe to tailwinds, input costs lowering, I would presume A&amp;P spending will fall in the industry. And therefore you also will follow even if you want to invest, you're going to do these extra measures. And I wonder what is the negative there, and if it's really the volume leverage that is hurting your model for 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we are in a good position with the savings effects of the restructuring program going in. Some of the easing of the input costs that we've seen, and the leverage of the current economic crisis to accelerate some of the cost savings I talked about, to create some breathing room in our cost structures, to invest in our business to grow. That's why I don't think we need to compromise on saying we want to grow our top line and at the same time improve or maintain as a minimum our cash flow and margins. I don't see that as a trade off for the same reason as you mentioned, provided we work the cost structure, we accelerate the restructuring and be on top of that.</p>
          <p>Now to strengthen our value equations in many of the regions, in many of the parts of the world we are, by the way, holding share or in some cases we're actually growing share, but in others we are not, so I am very well aware of that. And &#x2013; but it's not only price, I want to be very clear about that. To get consumers to buy our products it is the right value equation and I deliberately use the word value each time instead of price. It might be a price point, it might be a product that has not all the features, the bells and whistles on performance, or it might be simply a better performing product at the same price. And we look at all of this. A wonderful example of that is our Bertolli frozen business in the US. It's a wonderful frozen meal, if you try Bertolli. And it retails for about 8 or $9 for a whole meal. The reference set of that is the restaurant meal outside of the house. In the current economic climate, you cannot afford to eat out often as you want. Instead of spending $20 on a meal outside, you can get a better quality, often a better quality Bertolli meal at home for $8. That's a great value proposition for the consumer. Not surprisingly, we see our Bertolli business in the US growing and building both volume and value. So those are the things we need to do in all of our key strategic sets.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Julian Hardwick at RBS. I just wondered if you could say a little bit about the overall Unilever portfolio. Are you entirely happy with all the categories that you are in or should we expect that there are going to be any significant changes to the shape of the portfolio going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am happy with any part of the portfolio that builds shareholder value. We have a good portfolio now of brands, to be honest. I alluded to that in my talk, I don't want to repeat that. But 13 brands of &#x20AC;1 billion, yeah, do I like to have 16, 17 yes, I will be working on that. But I like what I have. Strong category positions now. Over the last three or four years, the company has divested about &#x20AC;4 billion, &#x20AC;3 billion of turnover, apologies. So we have done a good job in getting a sharper portfolio. The divestitures that we still have, there might be 1 or 2 billion, but nothing for me to worry about. There will be opportunities to continuously change the portfolio. I think, partly of building shareholder value over time is to successfully weed and feed your garden and get into the higher margin businesses that are faster growing and probably de-consolidating some of the other businesses over time. But any business that performs, it's fine. I absolutely don't see any problem either with having both the food and HPC. It's a very good balance that we have and I think a competitive advantage if we decide to exploit it that way and I see increasingly opportunities to do that.</p>
          <p>Having now one R&amp;D organization versus separate ones is a unique opportunity to really get to more discontinuous products and innovations in the years ahead. So we're going to leverage that to our advantage. Broadly, happy with the portfolio but there are categories obviously you'd like to see better performance and that's what we get paid for.</p>

          <p>Chris?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chris Wickham from MainFirst. Just moving on from that when we talk about weed and feed the garden, we talk about leveraging a good crisis. We know that you are now saying that there aren't going to be any buybacks in 2009. Should we start to infer from that you are thinking about quite a significant acquisition in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is no, you cannot infer from that. You can think what you want, but the -- it is clear that we have ample scope and opportunity to deliver the results by growing our own business and nothing better than shareholder value than creating equity on your own brands. That's very clear to me. I've seen that many times over. So the stronger we make our brands and our portfolios, the better service we provide to value creation for all of us, and more important so in the future to be successful on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>It is also clear that increasingly in this environment there might be opportunities for M&amp;A. And I am happy that we are in a strong position financially to be able to do that and look at that, but we're not going to panic our way into it. But I would suspect that in the coming 6 to 12 months there will be more bolt-on M&amp;A opportunities. And the TIGI acquisition that we just did, which obviously is a smaller one in the whole acquisition arena, slightly over 400 million for a &#x20AC;250 million business, we will see probably some more bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our portfolios where we need them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm just going to take an online question if I may here, Paul. This comes from Michael Steib of Morgan Stanley who asks, can you elaborate please on driving our savings programs even harder? I think he is also asking, what does this mean in terms of restructuring? Any more restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we have a restructuring program which we announced, which was going to be a cost of some &#x20AC;3 billion. We're about half the way through that and we are trying to pull forward as much of that as possible. That's the meaning of the acceleration. We are not identifying further savings from that program to date. We're staying on track with the savings that we identified at the time. But if we can pull them forward we will and that's what our intent is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just want to add to that, in the -- with the appointment of Mark Engel as Global Procurement Officer, we can now better leverage scale in procurement. We want to see some benefit from that, otherwise why do we do it? So Mark has to deliver; I hope he is listening.</p>
          <p>The second thing is, on indirects we can do a lot of things. We've have taken some tough decisions here, and we've taken those, I think, a little bit earlier and rightfully so than some of our competitive set. So we would want to expect some results from that as well.</p>
          <p>And then the last thing we talked was because you always talk on the A&amp;P side, et cetera. You know, this is the time that a lot of people are pulling the plug on media and we are a reliable company building our brands long-term and investing behind our brands long-term. So this is an opportunity also there to drive more efficiencies, as you rightfully said, into those spending items. So we will be able to get more efficiencies in this current economic climate. And the faster we have that, the more opportunity we have to invest it back in our business.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One more online question, then we'll take a couple on the telephone. This comes from Ramesh Nair of KG Financial Services, and he asks how has the slowdown impacted your future CapEx plans? Are you planning any cutdown in CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no it's a good question. We need to grow our businesses and we have a capital spending program in this company that is fairly efficient by any standards, but we need to ensure that we're not only closing plants or restructuring. It will also require us to invest in growth and we will prioritize capital investments that help us grow and accelerate the business. There is no doubt about that. We will, as I mentioned, have an objective of having our cash flow in at least in line ideally better than we had last year. But it will not go at the expense of investing in growth for the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our first question on the telephone line is from the line of Warren Ackerman from Dresdner.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Warren Ackerman here at Dresdner. I've actually got two questions. The first one is, can I go back to cash flow, I mean you've said in your speech that you have a reputation for strong cash flow and one of the cornerstones for Unilever was the un-geared free cash flow of 25 to 30 billion between 2005 and 2010. I calculate at the end of '08 you are at 15 billion so you do need to do 10 billion of additional cash flow in the next two years, just to reach the bottom end of that target. So my question is, are you withdrawing that 25 to 30 billion guidance? And if you're not, what will increase the un-geared free cash flow by 50% in each of the next two years, especially given you've got a higher pension contribution coming through in '09. That's the first one.</p>
          <p>And the second one is regarding emerging market volumes. You've always said that emerging market volumes haven't moved negative in any period over a long period, I think 10 to 20 years. I do know that Asia, Africa volumes were negative in Q4. I was just wondering whether you could talk about which emerging markets have slowed in the quarter? And I also know that in India, Hindustan Lever puts up a chart showing share loss in pretty much all categories. And I am wondering whether you can talk about how that squares with comments earlier in the year that you were seeing broad -based share gains. So the first one on free cash flow and the second one on emerging market volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the emerging market volumes we have Harish here and Harish just came back from India for the Board meeting. So, if you don't mind Harish, it might be good that you address that. Although your assumption that volumes went down there in that region is actually not true, despite the 14% pricing, volume in that region was flat. So, I don't know where you get the data from, but why don't I hand that over to Harish and I'll come back to your first question in a second, Warren.</p>

          <p>Well, absolutely. If you look at volumes for the region, actually Asia increased volumes even in quarter four, so that, if you like, is the volume status. Of course volume growth slowed down, but that, as you can see, because of a very high price growth that came in. And incidentally, volume growth in the region also was well in line with the way the market volumes were going. So, that's number one. We had slowdown. We had considerable slowdown and negative volumes in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>If you now look at Hindustan Unilever, again we had volume growth, as you know, in December quarter, we announced that, albeit, again, at lower rates. But if you look at the totality of our performance in India, where we've grown the business by 20% this year, and if you look at, category-wise, there are categories in which we have grown our market shares, to give you an example take laundry, for example. And on the other hand there were categories like skin cleansing where we had enormous amount of headwind in terms of pricing and as a consequence, a large number of low-cost operators actually increased their market share. And of course our plans as we move forward is to see how we can get back in the competitive zone in terms of pricing, and, as Paul said, value in these markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, then the second point, Warren, was the un-geared free cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me take that question. Warren, first I'd just point out that for the year just closed, we did in fact have substantial cash generation from operations, some 5.3 billion, and after-tax makes it 3.9 billion. So the cash generation from the operating activities of the business were very good. We did see a rise in working capital of some 200 million, but in the face of the sort of inflation that we went through, we are actually quite proud of that. And working capital as a percent of sales, as we look at ourselves compared to our competitors, there may be one or two who are better than that, but we're near the top of the pack in terms of working capital efficiency. So, Paul's comments about being pleased to join a company with this kind of cash-generating capability, is certainly true and we certainly intend to continue that in the year ahead.</p>
          <p>Now, while we have walked away from our guidance for this year, we obviously are still locked into the compensation programs, which do include un-geared free cash flow targets for management through 2010. By our calculations, we got to generate about 7.3 billion to get in the zone over the next two years, and we may or may not be able to do it. I can assure you we'll be doing our best to achieve that. The starting point, which you've calculated, I think is a little bit light and you can discuss the finer details of that with James if you want to call later. But we're very proud of the cash generated this past year. We are going to continue to do that in the upcoming year and management is going to be working against our own comp targets, which include the un-geared free cash flow measure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I had 12 billion of un-geared free cash flow between 2005 and 2007. You've said today another 3.2 billion for '08, so that leaves you at 15.2, so you've still got nearly 10 billion to hit the bottom end of that target, unless I've got the calculation wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, we're in the, the band I think we revised, to 22.5 to 27.5. If you take account of the restructuring and the disposals that we've been doing. But you and I can talk about that in a bit more detail after the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Warren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am going to take one more call from the telephone and then we'll come back to the room.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question on the audio is from the line of Marco Gulpers from ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to you all. I've got two questions if I may. The first is actually on your last acquisition to get a bit more feeling of what your strategic direction is. To me it looks like a little bit of a strategic U-turn as you divested the professional hair care business a couple of years ago. And also, where do you see this business going? Do you still foresee a number two spot in this or a leading position within the professional hair care business? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is I appreciate your lack of guidance, but the question I have is, can you maintain cash flow and margins still if the volumes are declining, and especially if you're comparing that with the current private label trends moving up, and also the prices of private label moving down mid-single digits, how do you foresee to continue maintaining the cash flow and margins in the situation where potentially volumes are dropping? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Marco, thanks. We have Vindi here with us who will talk to the first part, which is the acquisition of TIGI, which I am very pleased to see most of you commented positively on, but I'll have Vindi explain a little bit why we're so happy with this acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you. Well, first and foremost, this acquisition gives us a good position in the fast-growing salon professional hair care business in one of the biggest markets in the world, in the United States. About 40% of TIGI's business is in the US, and we get a good share and more importantly we get an excellent set of brands. They have three brands, very well-positioned and brands that enjoy very strong equity and top of mind recall, amongst the best professional brands in North America. We believe that we can grow this business significantly. We can grow it through increasing salon penetration in North America. We believe our geographic reach around the world should enable us to enter this channel as the channel evolves in other parts of the world. And last but definitely not least we think there are other creative opportunities to drive sub lines off this business.</p>
          <p>Last but definitely not least, I think what we're getting through TIGI, is some very interesting complementary capabilities which will have a spin-off benefit across our hair care business in general, even in our retail hair care business and brands. So, we believe strongly in this acquisition. We think it's a good step forward. It is complementary to our current business and adds capabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I'd like to add to that and I'd like to thank also the Mascolo brothers because what they have built is a quite impressive business in a short period of time, and growing very nicely and continuing to grow. And they've been generous enough in this to continue to offer their services and use then the Unilever network to accelerate the business. So it cannot be a better combination than that and I'm very excited about that. The second part, Marco, let me just hand it over to Jim again for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We achieved in 2008 a substantial cash flow and we held our operating margin, in fact we grew operating margin, despite the fact that in total, volume growth was essentially flat. During the year, we achieved &#x20AC;1.1 billion in savings. Going into 2009, we continue to have a focus on savings. First of all, we have the restructuring program which we began some two years ago, and it's to our good fortune that we did that because we now have in place a master plan to reduce costs and to get ourselves structurally more cost-competitive, and we'll continue that in 2009. And, as I said we'll try to bring it forward if that's possible.</p>
          <p>As Paul said, in addition to that, we have the opportunity for increased leverage from global buying under Mark Engel. We have our focus on indirect cost and managing them and all of that is not withstanding what the volume will do. We are focused on volume growth in 2009 and we expect that will help us relative to cash generation, and we think we're going to be able to achieve both. But one of the reasons that we have dropped the 15% operating margin target for 2010 is we want to be taking the decisions in this year which are both right for this year, and right for the long term and we believe that we can do that balancing both the investment for volume growth, holding -- aiming to hold operating margin and to generate good cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think let's just finish with two quick questions from the floor, let's go to the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we only have had males. I think we should have a female.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Sara Wilford from Merrill Lynch.  Just a couple of questions, first of all, can you quantify the impact of the de-stocking on the business? And secondly, you've said that you're going to look at volume growth and just how are you going to measure your value share, how are you going to look at that? And you've obviously shied away from the 15% margin target for 2010. But on a longer-term perspective, where do you see the right level of margin for Unilever? Broadly speaking, are you still happy with around about 15%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The de-stocking, we -- for example, you take one of the biggest retailers in the world who is located in the US, made the decision to put their stocks in line with the payment terms as all the suppliers. They pay you in ten days, stocks will be ten days or less, and that has been rolled out. That has resulted in adjustments of between, sometimes a week, one or two days depending on what your payment terms were in the inventories. And that comes through in the last quarter of the year since they closed the books, end of January, it probably will also come through in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>So, you see in the big efficient retailers, you see the same here in the UK. An efficiency that is being driven into the supply chain with the current pressure on the financing of operations that many of these companies are under. If you have in a quarter, 60 shipment days, and there is a two day reduction of inventory, you run the percentages yourself. So, it's easy to see your shipments going down by 2 or 3% if the supply chain is one or two days less inventory. Now, can you measure that exactly with all the science that you require, no you cannot, you cannot. But at the same time as we see that, we also see the consumers. We definitely measure very closely consumer behavior and consumers are drawing down their pantry stocks at home. Most consumers have one and a half, two weeks of stock at home. Again, if they postpone by two or three days, you see that. Some of the retailers have gone too far and we see some of that happening in the store when the products are not available. So that will be a correction.</p>
          <p>But there is no doubt that we've seen part of that. I personally think that we'll see some of that also in the first quarter as we all try to be more efficient in this environment and then you'll get a better reflection again of consumption and shipments. We'll sit through that and that's why it's so important that we work closely with the retailers to ensure that our products are there at the point of sale.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margin progress and if 15% margin is reasonable or not, I always, I was at Davos last week and I see Bill Gates sitting there. He believed in 60, 70% margins and he delivered that in his business. If we believe in 5 margins, we'll get 5 margins. If we believe in 10, we'll get 10. I see there's no reason why this business that we have, which is wonderful and we have it on some of us, I see no reason why we cannot get 15% margins. But, the but is, you need to get to that by consistently growing your volume. I can give you 15% margin tomorrow if you want it, but you destroy shareholder value if you don't grow your business. So we will manage our way consistently and steadily towards higher margins, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I don't think we see 15% as a limit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, certainly I don't. Absolutely you don't. Jim is right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question. Lest I be accused of favoritism, Paul, why don't you select?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any women here? No, go ahead. It's a noble profession. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy Fialko, Redburn Partners. Just a question on commodities and that sort of thing. Obviously, we've seen the palm oil prices roughly halve, the crude oil price is massively down, and that should impact your packaging costs quite positively. Yet you're sounding a little bit more cautious on the outlook than perhaps I would have expected. So, can you perhaps give us a bit more detail on how you see the whole commodity picture playing out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that whole thing on commodity cost is not very thoroughly investigated by the outside world when it's being written about. Let's just look at this for a second. The businesses half of it is in developed markets, half of it is in developing markets. In the developing markets again a lot of the materials that you use are being imported. We see currency swings in these markets that are quite substantial. You can do your own calculations. But if a country needs to import materials and the currency devalues by 20% it has to be reflected somewhere. So, there are places in the world, without going into the details of the countries, that you will actually see price increases.</p>
          <p>The second thing is, it is true that prices are decreasing on some materials but nowhere near the levels where they were two years ago. So, we'll talk about decreases with big headlines in the paper but peel the onion for a second and see where it is and I can give you some examples of that.</p>
          <p>The third thing is that we see in some of the materials, agriculturally based materials, fruits and vegetables, things that we also need in our business, we actually don't see prices coming down. A good example of that is, if you want one example, is tea. The tea prices are holding up quite up nicely. And you don't get that benefit. So it is a mixed picture. Broadly on the portfolio there is a little bit of easing of input costs no doubt about that, but not as big as some people are trying to suggest. And that is also why you don't see prices coming down as much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there some sort of aggregate numbers if you take where prices are today, what your raw material costs would be in '09 versus '08, anything....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't have that here, I don't have that here. We can get that, but I don't have that here. I'd be saying something that I'd better get the facts on that. We have it, but I don't have it here. Last one and then we'll stop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon Marshall-Lockyer from Jefferies. I just wondered how you squared your focus on volume growth going forward and as a value creation trend with the decline in A&amp;P spend 70 basis points run rate decline in 2008, 130 basis points decline in the fourth quarter, maybe you could give an indication of whether the promotional side of that is also declining or whether it's only the advertising side and maybe how you square those two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No Simon it's actually, the part of the A&amp;P if you would break that down, because I looked at it, as well. If you break it down actually the P is going down and A is going up. Over the whole year, it's 50 million up, but the A is up much more than that and the P is going down, which you would expect in this inflationary environment that we had to deal with. So we made the right choices there to invest in A, and compromise a little bit in P.</p>
          <p>But there is one thing that needs to be understood here on A&amp;P and we can run many ratios for many years to come. But if you have input costs inflation that we've seen over the year or over the quarter, 9% on the quarter and pricing, 7% more or less over the year. I'm rounding it. Don't expect media to follow that as well. The media inflation has not been that high. Media inflation is a function of many other things and these prices are actually coming down. It's very important, that's why you also have to look more at volume than value because all this pricing stuff has distorted a lot of ratios in our minds, and has paid lot of bonuses to people as well for achieving objectives that aren't real, okay. So in media, that's still a little bit more realistic, you need to look at &#x2013; the prices in media are coming down. We will drive efficiencies in, also next year and I expect media costs to go down more. And we will see our competitors undoubtedly easing off on some of their media spending especially the ones that were late in pricing. And we will be sure that we stay competitive, and invest a little bit more if needed to grow our volumes. And we have obviously increasingly the tools to decide where to do that. Not always calling it right in every sale that we measure or monitor, but broadly we can do that. But don't link in an inflationary environment like this the top line growth with ratios on media and I see everybody writing that, it's not the right way of looking at that, in terms of running the business.</p>
          <p>We'll leave it here. I thank you for your time that you've made available. Most importantly also I thank you for the interest in the company and obviously the support. I hope to see you soon in the near future. Thanks.</p>
