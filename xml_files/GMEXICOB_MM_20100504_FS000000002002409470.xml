        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pamela . Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Grupo M&#xE9;xico's first quarter earnings conference call. I am joined in this conference by Rogelio V&#xE9;lez, Chief Executive Officer of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano; Octavio Ornelas, CFO of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano; and Jorge Pulido, our Head of Investor Relations as well as other executives of the company.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call, I will briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and then address the main issues impacting the company's profitability. Then, I will comment on our Mining Division's most relevant results and then pass on the call to Octavio, who will comment on the financial results of our Transportation Division. Just to conclude, I'll give you an update on the relevant matters related to Cananea.</p>
          <p>For the first straight quarter, copper and many other commodities continued their price appreciation trend based on improving global economic conditions, a perspective of more robust fundamentals that's out there. The LME's average copper price for the first quarter 2010 was $3.28 per pound, 110% higher than the $1.55 for the same quarter 2009 and 9% higher than the fourth quarter '09.</p>
          <p>One of the key drivers of copper during these four months of the year have been a gradual recovery of copper demand outside China. We have seen clear indications of this vertical demand recovery as inventories started to decrease since the end of February. In addition, to this long anticipated demand recovery, we have also seen that China demand continues strong in dependence of potentially local stock piling. We expect demand to remain firm as this country continues its accelerated growth path.</p>
          <p>After reaching the cycle's highs earlier this month, we've seen copper trade down recently tracking other asset classes. These and other external factors will continue to play a roll in copper's price volatility because of the larger investor interest in the metal, but we do not see neither a continuing correction in prices far below current levels, nor long-lasting correction as the concentrate market remains tight and mine supply continues to restrain supply in the short and middle term.</p>
          <p>With respect to molybdenum, which as you know, is our main byproduct, represented about 12% of our Mining Division sales, prices averaged $15.78 per pound, 80% above its average price for the first quarter '09 and 40% higher than the fourth quarter '09. We've seen moly's recent price appreciation as sustainable given the continued recovery of the energy, transportation and infrastructure sectors internationally.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, we expect to see a return to a deficit environment as the economic recovery accelerates and the investment in new mines was delayed through the crisis. Now turning to Grupo M&#xE9;xico's financial highlights, we're happy to report that in the first quarter 2010, our total consolidated revenues were 1.9 billion, an increase of 127% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>This increase is mainly attributable to higher average metal prices and higher production volumes, but also to a significant improvement of 33% in the revenues generated by our Transportation Division. Cost of sales for the first quarter was 996 million, an increase of only 87% on a year-over-year basis. The increase in cost is mainly explained by the incorporation of a cycle and to higher cost in power and fuel.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the first quarter was 920 million, which constitutes a margin of 48%. This figure represents an increase of 221% year-over-year and also an increase of 33% quarter-over-quarter. Net income in the first quarter was 348 million, a significant increase of 17.5 times year-over-year and also an increase of 2% quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter total capital expenditures amounted to 90 million, 79 million were spend in the Mining Division and rest in our Transportation Division. As previously announced the Board of Directors approved a 3.9 billion CapEx program for the next 3 years. Of this amount, the Mining Division will invest 2.9 billion; the Transportation Division, 580 million; and 380 million will be allocated to the Infrastructure Division. For 2010 CapEx investments are estimated at 1 billion, 850 for the Mining Division, 146 for the Transportation and 26 for the Infrastructure Division.</p>
          <p>Now turning to cash and debt management, the total consolidated debt at March 31, 2010 was slightly above 2.9 billion, with the cash balance that totals 1.4 billion. This results in a net debt of 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>The company maintains a comfortable long-term debt amortization schedule and ample financial flexibility going forward. On April Southern Copper issued 1.5 billion in fixed rate senior unsecured notes. The 1.5 billion notes were issued in 2 tranches, 400 million due in 2020 at an interest rate of 5.375 and 1.1 billion due in 2040 at an interest rate of 6.75. The profits of these issues will be used to accelerate the Southern Copper's growth potential, which will further strengthen our position as one of the industries lowest-cost copper producer. With this bond the average life of debt was enhanced to 24 years. In evaluating the timing for addressing the international financial markets, the company considered that longer dated maturities were available at historically low interest rates.</p>
          <p>In affirmation of the company's views the demand for the New Notes was extremely strong, with orders of nearly 9 billion, roughly equally split between the 10 and 30-year notes. During the marketing process secondary trading levels for the company's existing notes tightened considerably and pricing of the new notes came at effectively no new issue premium to its existing issuances. As you might recall we secured a syndicated loan for 1.5 billion last December, which was used for the organization of Asarco.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter of 2010, the company prepaid 300 million for this loan and in addition Asarco prepaid 200 million out of the 280 million promissory note to the asbestos creditors. An additional 40 million was paid in April but the amount outstanding of the Asarco note is only 40 million.</p>
          <p>In 2010, all remaining debt amortization payments amounted to 170 million from the original 478 million at the beginning of the year. Our credit cash position with our cash generation capability will support all operational need and capital expenditures, still leaving room to explore additional value-generating opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividend, on March 12, we pay a quarterly dividend payment of 0.14 peso per share outstanding, which was equivalent to 83 million. For the first quarter 2010 the company's Board approved a quarterly dividend payments of 0.17 peso per share outstanding which would be paid on May 17 and represent a disbursement of approximately 100 million.</p>
          <p>Now turning quick to Asarco, I will give you a real quick overview of the highlights. As mentioned in previous conference call, now that we have regained control of Asarco, we are reengineering its operations to reduce the production costs as much as possible. We're doing everything necessary to generate as much value from Asarco's assets. We are evaluating some expansion projects, investing in exploration to increase the proven reserves, improving mineral recovery and other initiatives. We are very excited about the positive prospects and its proven contribution to our financial results. This is our first full quarter with Asarco consolidating back into Grupo M&#xE9;xico.</p>
          <p>During this quarter Asarco's net sales were 418 million, cost of sales was 291 million, EBITDA was 181 million with an EBITDA margin of 43% and net income was 43 million for the quarter compared to a 7 million loss for the first quarter '09. Asarco's production in the first quarter 2010 was a little south of 50,000 tons, an increase of 8.5% from first quarter '09. This increase is due primarily to better order rates at the Mission mine and stronger recovery at Ray.</p>
          <p>Silver production in the first quarter was 525,000 ounces, 53.5% higher than that for the first quarter '09. Asarco continues to reduce its cash cost, lowering its unit from $1.48 per pound of copper, including byproducts, in the first quarter '09 to $1.16 in the first quarter '10. This improvement is a result of greater productivity and operating efficiencies, in addition to better byproduct prices.</p>
          <p>As mentioned before, Asarco is conducting studies to recover molybdenum, which will further reduce its costs.</p>
          <p>CapEx in the first quarter amounted to nearly 4 million. Asarco expects to invest 50 million in 2010, including close to 10 million in exploration with the intent of improving its reserve base, life of mine, cost competitiveness and efficiency.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the main developments of Southern Copper and will try to keep this brief as Southern Copper had its conference call yesterday. In the first quarter Southern Copper net sales were 1.2 billion, cost of sales was 499 million, EBITDA was 691 million, which brings Southern Copper back to the total EBITDA margin of 57%, and net income was 383 million.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, Southern Copper's mine production of copper was down 8.8% year-over-year. It was due to expected and temporary lower ore grades at some of our mines. However, this was mitigated by higher production of other by-products. Molybdenum production increased 17%, silver was 1% higher and gold was 8% higher year-over-year.</p>
          <p>For the Mining Division, we are maintaining the copper production guidance for 2010 at 720,000 tons, 500,000 tons from Southern Copper and 220,000 tons from Asarco. This number does not include any production of Cananea, which will represent an upside when we restart production. Cash cost after by-products for this quarter decreased to negative $0.14 mainly due to higher by-product credits.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll now pass the call to Octavio Ornelas, who will discuss the main financial highlights of our Transportation Division.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel. Good morning, everybody. Before going to the financial figures, I would like to mention briefly what I consider the 4 most important highlights of the first quarter of the Transportation Division. First, regarding Ferromex the most important phenomena that we will show in this first quarter was an increase in freight. During the first quarter of this year, Ferromex reported an historic record both in the number of railcars transported and in net tons/kilometers. In terms of railcars, Ferromex transported 22.4% more than in the first quarter of last year and 9% above the first quarter of '07, the previous record quarter.</p>
          <p>In tons/kilometer, the first-quarter increase was 21.4% over the last year and 13.2% over the previous record in 2006. The automotive industry showed a strong recovery during the quarter so the number of rail cars moved in this segment were 54% above those from last year.</p>
          <p>In general rail freight, excluding Intermodal, Ferromex was the railroad with the largest volume growth in North America during the first quarter of this year, as it grew 20.4% against the first quarter of last year. U.S. railroads only grew an average of 4% in the same period, while the Canadian railroads Class 1 grew 15.2%.</p>
          <p>Second, we should mention the increased border crossing from Ferromex. For the first time since the privatization of the rail system in Mexico, the boarders assigned to Ferromex exchanged more rail cars with U.S. railroads than those from Kansas City Southern Mexico. In March, Ferromex exchanged, more than 30,000 rail cars through its boarder crossings, representing more than 50% of total rail cars exchanged during the month.</p>
          <p>Third with respect to Ferrosur, the most important feature on the commercial side are the increased volumes from the energy sector. On December 2009, Ferrosur closed a major service agreement with PEMEX and started transporting diesel from Minatitlan, Veracruz, to San Martin Texmelucan, Puebla, at a rate of approximately 750 rail cars per month. Also for the first time in its history, Ferrosur registered sales of over 300 million pesos, representing a 15% increase against the same month of the previous year.</p>
          <p>And fourth and the most important that I should mention is the historic rail road agreement that we achieved with Kansas City Southern on February this year. We reached &#x2013; there were 2 different agreements, 1 between Kansas City Southern and Ferromex, another 1 between Kansas City Southern and Ferrosur.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Kansas City/Ferromex agreement we reached one, to use certain trackage rights, switch and services, and interlink traffic, which include routes through Guadalajara, Monterrey, Altamira, and Aguascalientes, in addition to the fees related to such rights.</p>
          <p>The signing of this agreement ends several longstanding legal disputes between the parties involved. In addition, Kansas City and Ferrosur have signed a pro competitive agreement that expands Kansas City Southern access to the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala, and to the current infrastructure in the port of Veracruz. With this agreement, Kansas City has withdrawn its objections related to the concentration of Ferromex and Ferrosur.</p>
          <p>Now let me go to the financial figures. On the Transportation Division, volume transported during first quarter increased 21.4%, transporting 10.4 billion net tons/kilometers as compared to the 8.6 billion transported during the same period of 2009. The sectors that experienced the strongest recovery were iron and steel sector with 59%, automotive with 39%, intermodal with 36%, agricultural 35%, and mineral ores with 12%.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the Transportation Division increased 33.4% to $265 million in the first quarter of this year, compared to the 198 million of the first quarter of last year. This improvement is explained by the above-mentioned volume increases in addition to more favorable rates and improved traffic mix.</p>
          <p>The operating cost for the first quarter of this year was 171.6 million, which is 27.3 higher than that of the first quarter of last year. This increase is due to the increased freight volume, a 9.5% increase in the peso price of diesel, salary increases, and exchange rate effects.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA for the first quarter of this year was $92.2 million, representing a significant increase of 65.5% compared to the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Finally, some words about Ferrosur, Ferrosur's sales in the first quarter this year were 26% higher than that of the first quarter of last year. The gain was driven by a 4.9% increase in the net tons/kilometer transported.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA for Ferrosur in the first quarter was 17.3 million, 16.2% higher than that of the same period of the last year, representing a margin of 27.3%.</p>
          <p>And now I turn the call to you, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Octavio. Now just to close. In February, as you know, a Mexican federal court ruled in favor of &#x2013; on copper with regard to the Cananea case. And as a consequence, all existing labor contracts, individual and collective were terminated. A final appeal was released on April 21 by the Mexican Supreme Court. And at this point, there are no more legal instances in this process. We expect to regain access to installations in accordance with the law. We are only expecting the Mexican government to enforce this final decision so we can take control of the mine.</p>
          <p>With that, I think, Pamela, we should open up the phone for questions and answers, please.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Victoria Santaella with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Daniel and gentlemen. I have 2 questions. The first one is now that you have been over 4 months in Asarco, can you tell us which has been the positive and the negative surprises in, I don't know, cost, resources, production, respective, whatever you think it might be relevant there?</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding your Railroad Division. If you can give us more color in terms of what this agreement with Kansas City means. I mean in the press release, we read that it says that they've withdrawn its objection related to the concentration of Ferromex and Ferrosur. Does this mean that the merger is now closer? Or this is going to increase significantly your traffic? Can you give us more factual guidance here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Victoria. Thank you. Let me just take on the Asarco question and I'll pass onto my colleagues the Ferromex question.</p>
          <p>Ongoing Asarco, I mean, we can tell you there's a lot of positives. I mean, we are very happy to see the quality of assets. I mean, particularly with cash costs where they are now, we've been able to contain all the costs. Of course, the company had been operating under Chapter 11 mode for many, many years. And prior to the Chapter 11, the company was operating under a very different price and economic environment. And in addition to that, the company had a lot of different sites and different businesses when we acquired it in the first place in 1999.</p>
          <p>Currently, the company has 3 mines, which are great assets. Ray, Silver Bell, and Mission. And it has 2 metallurgical facilities, a refinery and a smelter. So I could say that now we are looking at an Asarco that is lean and mean. And that enable us to take all our expertise in order to try to contain costs and lower costs. So that's the positive.</p>
          <p>I think the negative is, I mean of course, you do have a different environment in the U.S. It's a little bit more costly to operate in the U.S. than it is in Peru and in Mexico. I wouldn't say that that is negative. I mean, that is of course it is what it is. And what we've encountered, which is a challenge arguably is to take control of the company. So we're working on it like we have acquired the company. So we are focusing in all administrative, commercial, et cetera, kind of synergies containment in order to make it even efficient and more aligned with our operations. It was a long time that the company spent in Chapter 11 being operated independently.</p>
          <p>And with that, I can pass the call to Octavio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Victoria. As I mentioned, we signed 2 agreements with Kansas City Southern. The first 1 between Ferromex and Kansas City has 4 different parts. The first part of the Ferromex Kansas City agreement settles and terminates certain existing controversies between the parties, which relate to the scope, definition on applicable rate of certain mandatory trackage rights granted to each in their respective concession titles.</p>
          <p>The second part of the agreement defines trackage right that each party grants to the other as well as the scope thereof. While Ferromex gets trackage rights to Ternium in Monterrey, and a long trackage right from Viborillas-Quer&#xE9;taro to Ramos Arizpe-Coahuila, Kansas City Southern Mexico obtains trackage rights to the industry in the Guadalajara access zone, means signing of Aguascalientes, and certain industries in the Altamira access zone.</p>
          <p>Regarding switching rights, the third part of the Ferromex Kansas City agreement defines switching services that each party must provide to the other. Ferromex gets switching services to Monterrey, while Kansas City gets switching rights to Guadalajara, Altamira, and Aguascalientes.</p>
          <p>And finally, the fourth part of the agreement relates to rates, general trackage rights, and switching rates as well as a matter of interlink rates have been agreed. Also billing, set off, and payment proceedings are put forth.</p>
          <p>On the front of the Ferrosur Kansas City Southern agreement, it also has 4 different parts. The first part of Ferrosur Kansas City agreement settles an certain existing controversy, which relates first to Kansas City objections to the acquisition of Ferromex by ITF, subsidiary of Grupo M&#xE9;xico. And secondly, the claims brought by Minera M&#xE9;xico, seeking the annulment of Kansas City Southern Mexico concession type.</p>
          <p>Second, it's related to trackage rights. Kansas City obtained broader trackage rights to the Veracruz district, subject to space and operating restriction existing at set port. By the same token, trackage rights are granted to the <mark type="inaudible" /> railroad to connect its trackage right &#x2013; its trackage, excuse me, with Kansas City Southern trackage.</p>
          <p>On the switching rights, Kansas City obtained switching rights within Veracruz and what we call the Puebla to Tlaxcala district. Then on Ferroviario, which is a very important part of the agreement, corporate governance changes to Ferroviario the Mexico City Valley railroad and terminal have been agreed. The more relevant of which relates to operating and financial policies and a schedule of decisions, which cannot be passed without the consent of Kansas City and Ferrosur. So those are basically the main features of the agreement that we reached with them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Octavio. But summarizing, do you have any guidance in terms of this is clearly going to be increasing your activity and your routes? Is there any guidance in terms of volume, or pricing, or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I should say first regarding prices, remember that we have all these controversies related to interline traffic, trackage rights, switching services, et cetera. And there were &#x2013; now we are certain about the rates that we are going to pay each other. And we have a billing process that is very expedited. And this has of course been certainty to both companies about the service that we are rendering.</p>
          <p>Second, I should say about the Kansas City Ferrosur it's a very broad, competitive agreement. In terms of the access that we are getting to Veracruz and to the Puebla and Tlaxcala zone to Kansas City Southern, and now there has been an enhancement of competition, for example, in the automotive sector with <mark type="inaudible" />, for example, which is pretty much better for the consumers and our clients. The same is happening right now regarding Veracruz.</p>
          <p>Now with Ferromex, I should say that as of today we haven't used the long trackage rights. They haven't used the Guadalajara trackage right; we haven't used the one from Monterrey. We are preparing to do such things because it involves a lot of negotiations with the union, et cetera. But what we will see is that in the future we will expand our operations, they to Guadalajara, we through the long trackage rights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Rogelio, Victoria. I would add to what Octavio was saying that this adds a lot of certainty now to our rates. Now we know how much it's going to cost us and we can now be much more competitive with our mutual customers. With our entrance to Ternium, for instance, in the city of Monterrey, we were able to provide them with a much better service and on top of that, we have a better rate as a result of this agreement. And that is going to be happening in a lot of other customers because of this certainty that now we have in our cost. Was that clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much, gentlemen.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Tatyana Shumsky with American Metal Market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I just wanted to find out a little bit more about Cananea. If you have any sort of idea as to when you'll be able to physically regain control and also you said that you plan to do quite a lot of investment in Cananea to bring production up to 460,000 tons of copper. Any idea as to which quarter this year we'll see that investment begin? And any sort of, what's the right word, schedule for how much money you plan to invest and how?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you for the question. Well I mean the company is ready to resume operations in Cananea. We are under &#x2013; currently under discussions to enter in a new collective bargaining agreement with a different union. With similar conditions as the one that we have in Caridad, that is our other open pit mine in the northern part of Mexico. And I mean with this new collective bargaining agreement we will increase productivity and competitiveness for this operation, just as we have done with Caridad. I mean, we in Caridad have broken all production records under the current union. This is a different union. So we have done a lot of work outside of that.</p>
          <p>In terms of timing, it's very hard to assess, but we have not budgeted for this year any production for Cananea, but definitely believe that the company should take control of the operations fairly soon. Now, I mean we've taken the long route. And in order to ensure that we have at Cananea without the over cumbersome clauses and agreements that we had in the past, and I think we're ready now to open. Probably the SX/EW facilities will take through &#x2013; less than a quarter to be up and running at full capacity. However, the concentrator part of the mine will take a little bit longer. So we've also made some agreements and compromises with the authorities, with the governance, local and federal, in order not only to invest in the mine and rehabilitate the mine, but also to invest in the region so that we have a lot better environment with our employees.</p>
          <p>So in terms of timing, very hard to predict a date. We are just waiting for an enforcement by the government.</p>

          <p>The miners there have threatened to blow up the mine. Are you concerned that they may actually carry out this threat at all?</p>

          <p>I mean we &#x2013; it's very important to put this into perspective. Cananea had 1,600 employees at Cananea, out of which around 600 have been &#x2013; or 650 have been already paid severance and have left. The guys that obviously have lost the legal &#x2013; I mean the judicial part of the problem are obviously saying and they're uncomfortable with the decision in saying whatever they can say. We are not concerned. We think we live in a country where laws are enforced and they will be. It's just we are waiting for that to happen.</p>
