        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody in the hall. Welcome to our Half Year Results Presentation. And also a warm welcome to all of you out there in the worldwide web sitting behind your screens.</p>
          <p>We did experience another strong half year, primarily helping us was foreign exchange. Our sales momentum has consistently moderated, yet remains positive in all regions. The overall environment, the weak euro versus the U.S. dollar and yen, the relative stability of the Swiss franc versus the euro, more moderate price increases in terms of precious materials and even a certain decline in diamond prices has helped us on the gross margin level. Our channel differential is extremely healthy. Retail is holding its growth pattern month on month and we see a decline in wholesale trend at the moment, but we view that as healthy as well.</p>
          <p>Let's look at some key figures. Our results for the period were driven by organic revenue growth and foreign exchange. Sales were up 21% or 12% at constant currencies. This reflects a positive foreign exchange impact of 9%. We had growth across all businesses and all segments and all regions. Retail continues to outperform wholesale.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit grew by 28%, leading to an all-time half-year record, 27% margin on sales. We continue to enjoy strong pricing power, continued positive foreign exchange and improved gross margins. Our net profit rose by 52%, and this is primarily related to September 30 exchange rates. We did enjoy healthy cash flow operations of &#x20AC;575 million, which was broadly in line with the previous year.</p>
          <p>Let's get into the details of sales now, first in Europe. All of the charts that you see traditionally are in constant currencies. Europe is our second largest region with 28% of group sales. Sales in Western Europe grew by 18%. This rate primarily reflects organic growth. It's driven by tourism, now estimated to account for 60% of Western Europe sales.</p>
          <p>Although it must be said that sales from local domestic consumers, particularly in France, Germany, Benelux and Switzerland continue to grow. Most Maisons improved their performance versus the prior period and jewelry, watches and ready-to-wear were the top performing categories. Sales in Russia grew at a lower pace than Western Europe, primarily relating to the significant high jewelry sales that we saw last year.</p>
          <p>Now on to the Middle East and Africa, this region accounts for 6% of group sales. Most of the sales are done in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, thereafter Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Sales grew by 28% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by locals, tourism and the product categories were geared toward premium watches and jewelry. The active commodity market has certainly helped us in this region.</p>
          <p>Let's more to Asia Pacific, this is Richemont's number one region, approximating 41% of group sales. The 9% increase in sales reflects a contrasted performance among countries and a strong incentive for the Chinese customer to travel to Europe, given the weakness of the euro.</p>
          <p>In terms of markets, Macau, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore grew at double-digits. In terms of channel, retail was more solid, continuing to benefit from our store upgrade and opening program. Product-wise, jewelry and ready-to-wear outperformed.</p>
          <p>Mainland China, with 9% of group sales, is our third largest market now, almost on par with the U.S. and slightly ahead of Japan. Growth was partly driven by Mainland Chinese at-home and in other Asian markets.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Americas. Its growth rate has significantly moderated to reach 4% for the first six months. The performance of Richemont in United States reflects a challenging environment in a region that does not benefit as much from tourism as Europe.</p>
          <p>Must be said, however, a pretty tough comparison base for two years in a row and there is a bit of timing of High Jewelry sales in the first half. And it has to be said that we are seeing a cautious approach from our retail partners. Overall, the region's performance was driven by retail and domestic tourism.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to Japan. It's our fourth largest single market with 9% of group sales. The sales results confirmed again its remarkable resilience. The sales growth was driven primarily by Specialist Watchmakers and Alfred Dunhill. The growth was primarily organic as only maintenance CapEx is allocated to this market.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at sales by network. Retail continues to lead, thanks to good performance at the Maisons directly operated boutiques and also the continued growth of Net-a-Porter, which is above the group average. The growth is pretty much broad-based in all regions and we opened 40 new stores in the first half. This outperformance of retail is moderating.</p>
          <p>Wholesale growth was greater in Europe, Middle East and Africa. The inventory levels in the trade are sound, our wholesale receivables are sound, and this genuinely reflects the cautiousness of both us and the retailer. We've given the instruction to our Maisons not to overstock our wholesale partners. The group now generates 51% of its total sales through our internal boutiques.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at sales by product line. This slide underlines the importance of our watch and jewelry product categories. These two categories generate 75% of our business. The dynamic nature of jewelry is clearly shown in the growth rates, which is our fastest-growing one.</p>
          <p>Jewelry grew by 18% at constant rates, which is well above clothing at 12% or watches at 10%. This also shows the growing importance of our clothing business, which is now our third largest segment. The slowest growing category is, without surprise, writing instruments, hence the reason for the diversification of the Montblanc Maison into watches and leather.</p>
          <p>Now, before I turn it over to Sophie, I'll just go through the Maison highlights for you. Here are the main points to remember about our performance in the first half. We had substantial profits and profitability at the Jewelry Maisons and Specialist Watchmakers. We had reduced, but still solid profitability at Montblanc. We enjoyed stable profitability at Fashion &amp; Accessory Maisons. And we've shown good progress with our Net-a-Porter business during another year of structural expansion.</p>
          <p>And now, I'm going to turn it over to Sophie to go through in detail the segmental activities.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. So as usual we start with the Jewelry Maisons. The Jewelry Maisons enjoyed an outstanding performance fueled by strong demand, up 20%; sales were up 20% at actual rates; favorable currencies and pricing power.</p>
          <p>Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels both generated remarkable results leading to an operating contribution of &#x20AC;958 million, up by 31% over the comparative period. Contribution margin rose to a healthier record of 37% of sales, with Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels both continuing to improve their respective margin.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the main product on network development with the Jewelry Maisons. I'm sorry I went too fast. So first Cartier, Cartier reported sales grew at double-digit rate, driven primarily by Europe, Asia Pacific and the Middle East. High Jewelry performed very well, with the Sortil&#xE8;ge collection as well as iconic bijoux with Love, Trinity and the new Juste un Clou line.</p>
          <p>This is also true for gold, High Jewelry and High Watchmaking watches for men. Tank Anglaise, only available in gold and jewelry, had a good start. Retail sales with its 293 Cartier stores continued to outperform wholesale. Cartier carried out a few but major renovations extensions such as Milan Montenapoleone and Paris Galeries Lafayette. The wholesale network was streamlined further in Europe.</p>
          <p>Cartier is also making substantial investments in watch movement manufacturing, as Gary will detail later. Cartier's initiatives in social media with the Odyss&#xE9;e movie were awarded the Lion d'Or at Cannes festival. This movie generated over 200 million views.</p>
          <p>Another initiative to raise visibility and sales was the launch of the new D&#xE9;paysement High Jewelry collection, which consists of 140 pieces at the Biennale des Antiquaires in Paris, which reasserted Cartier as the king of Jewelries, so did the Royal Style: Qing Dynasty and Western Court Jewelry exhibition at Taiwan.</p>
          <p>Now Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, which enjoyed strong growth driven by jewelry, with Perl&#xE9;e and continuously enriched Alhambra collections and watches across segments. Sales were broad-based geographically with the exception of the U.S., the U.S.A., which have benefited from major High Jewelry sales in H1 of last year.</p>
          <p>Van Cleef &amp; Arpels further expanded its retail network to 97 boutiques with openings notably in the new Sao Paulo Iguatemi in Brazil, and Abu Dhabi, Etihad Towers. There are also ongoing store renovations/extensions, the main ones this half year being Moscow Stolesnikov and Los Angeles in the States.</p>
          <p>Van Cleef &amp; Arpels benefited from high profile launches of the Palais de la Chance High Jewelry collections initially in Paris, initially at the Palais de Tokyo &#x2013; Palais de Tokyo, sorry, for the VIP clients and thereafter at the Biennale des Antiquaires, both in Paris.</p>
          <p>Visibility was also enhanced by the prestigious exhibition at the Arts d&#xE9;coratifs Museum. The Maison now showcases its technical expertise as a master in High Jewelry with its new jewelry school, L'Ecole Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Place Vend&#xF4;me in Paris, which is opened to the public, and actually just recently opened.</p>
          <p>So now let's look at our Specialist Watchmakers. Most Maisons enjoyed substantial growth in sales. As a result, all Specialist Watchmakers, with the exception of Baume &amp; Mercier, saw an improvement in their results. Positive currencies, pricing power and improved channels' profitability, both in our stores and with our third-party retailers, mitigated higher input costs. This led to a 51% increase in profits. In turn, operating contribution reached an all-time half-year high of 32% of sales.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the main product and network developments of the segments. So first Piaget. Piaget's performance was driven by Europe that more than compensated for the stabilization of sales in Asia Pacific. The half year saw confirmation of the success of its iconic products, namely the ultra-thin Altiplano watches, as well as the Possession and Rose bijoux collection. The latter benefited from the comprehensive communication concept, ranging from digital campaign, PR pictures, events to display materials.</p>
          <p>For the second time, Piaget participated to the Paris Biennale des Antiquaires, where it translated 71 pieces of High Jewelry and High Jewelry watches of its new Couture Pr&#xE9;cieuse collection. Its new boutique concept that reflects the emphasis on jewelry was successfully inaugurated at the Hong Kong Mandarin Oriental flagship store.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Vacheron Constantin. The major strong growth was constrained by shortages, hence the reason why a major expansion of manufacturing capacity is in progress. The period was marked by the increased success of the iconic Patrimony line and special orders of Atelier Cabinotiers, as well as the introduction of the new Les Univers Infinis which &#x2013; collection, which enhances Vacheron Constantin reputation as a master craftsman.</p>
          <p>Distribution remains highly selective with further reductions in the number of third-party points of sales and addition of a few boutiques. The excellent start of the recently opened U.S. boutique on Madison Avenue in New York bodes well for the new Hong Kong Prince Building boutique. The Paris flagship is expected to open early 2013.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne. Its significant growth in sales was led by Europe, Asia Pacific and Americas. Its complications and iconic products outperformed, in particular the Lange 1, Saxonia Thin and Saxonia Automatik. Its retail development focused on the Middle East with openings in Abu Dhabi Etihad Towers and Dubai Mall.</p>
          <p>Now Roger Dubuis, which posted solid sales growth, mainly fuelled by China, Japan and Americas, as well as continued demand for Excalibur Double Tourbillon and La Mon&#xE9;gasque. New Excalibur 42, Velvet and Pulsion watches were met with encouraging response from the market. Market presence continually improved with both a new corporate identity, meaning new logo, new boutique concept and new advertising campaign, and an international expansion in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and China.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn to Jaeger-LeCoultre, this Maison enjoyed commendable sales growth balanced among geographies and channels. Product-wise, High Complications, Duom&#xE8;tre Sph&#xE9;rotourbillon, Complications from the Master and Reverso lines, and new feminine line Rendez-Vous, were highly successful. While new stores were opened notably Beijing Parklife, Hong Kong Prince Building, S&#xE3;o Paulo Iguatemi, the Paris Place Vend&#xF4;me benefited from a major extension. This new 500-square meter flagship store introduced the new brand retail concept.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a look at IWC whose sharp increase in sales was led by Europe &#x2013; sorry, was led by retail across geographies. For Portuguese &amp; Portofino lines remain in strong demand while the rejuvenated Pilot line is enjoying a successful debut. The Specialist Watchmaker further invested in retail. New store include Zurich Bahnhofstrasse and Paris rue de la Paix.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Officine Panerai. It's solid &#x2013; it enjoyed solid sales growth especially in Asia Pacific. This reflects a continuous trend of the Manifattura Collection, another collection with in-house movements, notably the Luminor Marina 1950 3 Days, and the success of the vintage Luminor Marina 1950 3 Days. Officine Panerai's ongoing retail expansion included openings in S&#xE3;o Paulo Iguatemi, Macao and Dallas. Finally, its new manufacturing site near Neuch&#xE2;tel should be completed in a year from now.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Baume &amp; Mercier which suffered from a challenging trading environment accentuated by a high exposure to wholesale and caution exerted by retailers. Sales have also been penalized by high exposure to the domestic Western clientele and low exposure to Chinese demand both at home and abroad. This was not offset by the success of the new Capeland 44 millimeter and Hampton Small, which now ranked in the Maisons' top 5 bestsellers. Baume &amp; Mercier will therefore record losses this year.</p>
          <p>Now, Montblanc; let's look at the main developments of Montblanc the past six months. The 10% increase in sales was driven by watches and currencies. Retail had account for about 47% of Montblanc's sales, continued to outperform wholesale. Growth was impacted by the importance of western clientele, lower contribution of tourism and reduced wholesale distribution. Operating contribution at &#x20AC;53 million is in line with the comparative period and reached 14% of sales.</p>
          <p>The numbers we just saw from Montblanc reflect a contrasted performance. On a reported basis, all regions grew at a double-digit rate. At constant rates, sales were driven mainly by China in watches, both enjoying double-digit growth in sales.</p>
          <p>The U.S.A. posted a good performance partially helped by the new E-commerce platform which is now Montblanc's number two stores in the States and was managed to attract new clientele.</p>
          <p>Single-digit growth in writing instruments, despite success of limited editions like Pablo Picasso 91 and the new Starwalker Redgold line, underlined for the more limited potential of this market coupled with a reduced wholesale clientele.</p>
          <p>Double-digit growth in watches reflects the success of Montblanc's diversification strategy, supported by the new slimmer Star Classique, as well as the Nicolas Rieussec and Timewalker Twinfly, premium lines with in-house movements.</p>
          <p>Retail wise, focus remains on upgrades with few openings that included Sanlitun Beijing and Abu Dhabi Etihad Towers.</p>
          <p>The Beauty of a Second digital film celebrating the chronograph's invention by Nicolas Rieussec received several awards at Cannes festival.</p>
          <p>Finally, the other business area; you remember that the segment comprises the Fashion &amp; Accessories Maisons, the Net-a-Porter Group and the facilities involved in the manufacturing of unbranded watch components to third-parties and to our Maisons.</p>
          <p>Fashion &amp; Accessories Maisons recorded double-digit growth in sales and an increase operating contribution of &#x20AC;25 million. The Net-a-Porter group reduced its losses and generated positive operating cash flow. Remember, that results were affected by the &#x20AC;11 million half-year intangible amortization that will disappear after March 2015. It was also affected by investments in U.S. and Hong Kong platforms.</p>
          <p>Losses at the group's unbranded watch components manufacturing facilities were in line with last year &#x2013; sorry, with the comparative period, so in other words H1 of last year. This was due to further investments in vertical integration partially compensated by high volume and improved knowhow. These losses consist of R&amp;D costs and subsidies to the Maisons being the differential in price between in-sourced and outsource.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the main product and developments of these Maisons &#x2013; of these segments, sorry, over the past six months. So we start as usual by with Alfred Dunhill. China represented the biggest source of growth versus prior year for these Fashion &amp; Accessories Maisons. Healthy growth was also gained in the challenging market of Japan. Product-wise, menswear experienced a double-digit growth in sales.</p>
          <p>New stores that included the Las Vegas Caesar's Palace and Shenyang Forum 66 incorporate to the new store concept which is also being rolled out in other existing locations. The new CEO, Eraldo Poletto took ahead of Alfred Dunhill this week. He was previously CEO of Furla and also worked at Brooks Brothers.</p>
          <p>Let us move on to Lancel which saw double-digit growth in sales, driven by Retail and European domestic clientele. Lancel benefited from the impact of the opening of two flagships, one in Paris &#x2013; the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris and the other one in Shanghai. It enjoyed a positive sell-through of the Daligramme collection, which has become one of Lancel's pillars, as well as from exotics and French Flair collections.</p>
          <p>The new CEO, Fabrizio Cardinali was appointed last month. Mr. Cardinali has experience in repositioning brands and driving global presence. He was previously holding the position of global sales and marketing director at Dolce &amp; Gabbana.</p>
          <p>Chlo&#xE9;, Chlo&#xE9; posted double-digit growth in sales driven by Europe, Americas, wholesale and leather. The new Alice bag met good response, while ready-to-wear is showing a resumed momentum with the widely acclaimed <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:48) Fashion Show in about Summer 2013. New directly operated stores included U.S.A Wynn, Las Vegas and China, Shenyang Forum 66. <mark type="ph" /> His Paris show, (26:00) the first ever first exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris celebrating 60 years of creation.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Net-a-Porter group: While its growth rate has normalized, it remained well above group's rate. Europe and Americas were equally strong, likewise Net-a-Porter, MR PORTER, the OUTNET progressed well. Meanwhile into Asia Pacific is expected at the end of calendar 2013 with a subsidiary scheduled to open in Hong Kong first quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>I will now hand up over to Gary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I <mark type="audio gap" /> (27:00 &#x2013; 27:07) out into the presentation to talk about sales, I forgot to introduce my two bosses who are with me, so our good Executive Chairman Mr. Rupert and Mr. Lepeu, the Deputy CEO. Okay, now we go.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our operating profit. You've seen the sales 21% increase in reported, 12% at constant. Our gross profit grew by 24% reflecting our Maisons pricing power and a favorable currency environment. We grow our operating expenses by 21% in line with reported sales. All this adding up leads to an operating profit increasing by 28% to approximately &#x20AC;1.4 billion; and we enjoyed an all-time half year record operating margin of 27%.</p>
          <p>Let's get into the details of gross margin and expenses. The 24% increase in gross margin was generated 160 basis point increase in the rate to 64.8%. 260 basis points of this increase relates exclusively to forex. This has to be offset by 170 basis point decline due to the lack of hedging gains recorded in the gross margin. We also benefited, as Sophie described from pricing power, higher retail prices and lower margins granted to retailers.</p>
          <p>We did enjoy a higher channel mix in terms of retail as well, and we did experienced favorable manufacturing variances. These benefits were mitigated by higher component costs. Let me remind you, once again, and for the last time, that hedging gains, our losses are no longer recorded within gross margin and are recorded within financial costs.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the expenses. Operating expenses grew by 21%, or 14% at constant currencies. The ratio remains stable at 38%. Where were the increases, and once again we've provided the bridge for you on the slide. 7% of the increase relates exclusively to forex. Our boutiques generated 8% of the increase. Net-a-Porter, 1%, primarily the build-up of the Asian operations; Communication cost plus 3% and then all other expenses which are S&amp;D non-boutique S&amp;D and administration added 2%.</p>
          <p>Our S&amp;D cost represented 57% of total OpEx, rose by 23% given the sales and network development. As I said before, we opened 40 new retail stores in the first half. At constant currencies, these expenses grew by 14%.</p>
          <p>Communication costs were up 23%, slightly above the sales growth. The ratio was maintained at 8% of sales. Administration costs grew by 19%, primarily reflecting the development of our Asian backbone, continued investments on our IT and infrastructure. On a constant currency basis, administration costs were also up 14%.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the items below operating profits, and I'll come to finance cost in a minute. We experienced an effective tax rate of approximately 16%. This slightly lower rate anticipates the crystallization of certain deferred tax assets that we expect at year-end specifically relating to inventory. We continue to expect an underlying tax rate of 17% to 19% in the medium-term. Due to lower finance cost, which I'll get to in a minute, net profit for the period rose 52% to approximately &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now some details on the finance costs, thanks to the period ending Swiss franc-euro rate, we incurred a slight non-cash gain on our mark-to-market adjustments relating to our cash balances compared to a significant loss in the prior period.</p>
          <p>Given the positive impact on sales relating to forex which you've seen previously, we incurred &#x20AC;108 million charge relating to our hedging program. Overall, finance costs in total declined to &#x20AC;99 million for the period.</p>
          <p>I would like to now focus on our cash flow from operations. At &#x20AC;575 million generation, it was broadly in line with the prior period. With respect to working capital, the large increase relates primarily to two factors: the cash settlements of maturing foreign exchange contracts accounted for &#x20AC;166 million and the timing related to European supplier payments which this year were executed in September, last year in October.</p>
          <p>From an inventory and accounts receivable absorption point of view, the absorption was consistent with the prior period. Our inventory rotations are similar and our accounts receivable portfolio is similar in terms of aging compared to last year at 94% current.</p>
          <p>Let's move to capital expenditures. As planned, CapEx grew by 51% to &#x20AC;256 million, or 5% of sales. We had increased investments in manufacturing facilities, we had more refurbishments in terms of our stores and we opened up 40 new stores, mostly in growth markets and tourist destinations. We did expand and improve and automate certain distribution platforms. We will continue our investment program in retail, in manufacturing and infrastructure, particularly IT. We expect to open up 60 retail stores in the second half.</p>
          <p>I'll move on to the next slide where we can give you some granularity in terms of the CapEx. Close to half of the increase related to retail, now a 37% of total investments. The most notable project and Sophie mentioned a few of them, our Cartier store in Shenyang, a renovated Cartier Milan boutique and the renovated store in Paris.</p>
          <p>Panerai opened up a mono brand store in Dallas, Vacheron Constantin in the Prince Building in Hong Kong. Jaeger-LeCoultre expanded their Place Vend&#xF4;me location. And a number of our brands opened up in Abu Dhabi and S&#xE3;o Paulo during the period.</p>
          <p>Investments in manufacturing capabilities contributed to closely to &#x2013; close to 30% of the CapEx growth. Where were the major projects and we discussed these before, capacity expansion at our case manufacturer, Donz&#xE9;-Baume, an expansion of Cartier's watch component and assembly factory in Switzerland. We've started work on Panerai's new factory in Neuch&#xE2;tel.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to expand Vacheron Constantin's capacity and capabilities. And we're also looking at Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne for an expansion there in Germany. Investments in other primarily relate to IT, Net-a-Porter Asia and our distribution platform.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at free cash flow. Cash flow from operations financed significant increase in capital expenditures, as you just saw, and our results required us as normal to pay higher taxes. Free cash inflow was &#x20AC;144 million at the end of September.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to our balance sheet. We continue to have a solid balance sheet. 71% is our equity position broadly in line with a year ago. After a cash payment of &#x20AC;164 million in ordinary dividends before withholding taxes, our net cash and investment position amounted to &#x20AC;3 billion. Of this amount 55% is currently held in Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>Before we start with the Q&amp;A session, I will conclude with our October trends and a discussion of certain post-closing events.</p>
          <p>We experienced a moderate &#x2013; a continued moderation of the sales trend in October. October sales grew at 7% on a constant basis in 2012 on a reported basis. Europe leads the pack regionally driven by a continued weak euro and sustained tourism. And America was also quite strong.</p>
          <p>Our directly operated stores continued to outperform wholesale. While our comparatives for the second half are starting to be less challenging, we expect that the foreign exchange gain in terms of the sales will not be a significant second half.</p>
          <p>Given this slower sales growth that we are experiencing, we did take certain steps during May, production was slowed to limit a build-up in inventories in-house. And we instructed all of our Maisons to align their wholesale shipments with their partner's inventories.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we will continue to invest in future growth. Our plans are unchanged. We will continue with our store renovation programs and openings. As I said, we'll open 60 stores in the second half and we'll continue our investments in manufacturing and distribution platforms.</p>
          <p>Let's move to post-closing events before we start with the Q&amp;A. I want to give you some background on the three acquisitions which we've closed in early October. These acquisitions will be detailed in Note 16 of the interim financial statements.</p>
          <p>In order to provide future long-term options for our Maisons on Fifth Avenue in New York, we acquired a retail space of the St. Regis Hotel which is located at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street. The acquisition price was &#x20AC;297 million. This is what I referred to in May as the breaking news. The property is fully occupied until 2019 and we expect on a full year basis, so full year basis, this property to contribute &#x20AC;1 million to operating results.</p>
          <p>We also acquired VVSA which is a Swiss group with expertise in gold refining and metal stamping, key processes associated with our watch and jewelry businesses. This business will continue to operate with existing management and assist to further integrate our manufacturing activities particularly with Cartier.</p>
          <p>Peter Millar is a North Carolina-based sports apparel business. It has superior management, good growth prospects and is nicely profitable already. The consideration for both of these transactions in total was &#x20AC;152 million. We expect on an annual basis, these entities to contribute &#x20AC;13 million to operating results, positively. Although it must be said, we do still have the valuation work ongoing which will firm up at year-end. All three of these acquisitions will be reported in the other segment.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your time. Now, I'm sure we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Three questions, oh, should I repeat that? <mark type="ph" /> Luca Solca (41:03) from Exane BNP Paribas. I have three questions, if I may. Quite a number of changes in the management ranks. I wonder how the committee, the senior management committee is going to work and whether you, Mr. Rupert going to stay involve hands-on as you've done in the past, or if this is going to indicate that you're going to step back from the business? Question, a number of changes also in the management ranks in the Fashion and Leather goods division, I wonder about whether this is coming from  the satisfaction with performance or renewed opportunities especially at Lancel. I was wondering about the appointment of an executive coming from our designer house.</p>
          <p>On demand, I seem to understand that you're experiencing weaker dynamics in the lower price points. If you could explain us what is happening at the various price points and whether this is an indication of things to come in your opinion. And lastly manufacturing and movements manufacturing in particular, whether you anticipate that continuing investment is going to improve your cost position in this space? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>In terms of management, had it not been that Mr. Platt was diagnosed with a mild form of diabetes as it turned out. And he is in much healthier shape than any of us at the moment, because he has been enjoying his retirement. On the other hand, he did go to Germany. So he's probably going to spend all of his money <mark type="ph" /> bailing out (43:07) Greeks and Italians and others. And, but I didn't intend coming back at that stage. I did, but I've said in the past and I repeat, this company is far too complex and too big for one individual to run. Now, some of us like along on the product committee, Richard and myself been involved directly and indirectly since 1975, late 1970s for you, 1978, 1979; Gary, same stuff.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>1988.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>1988 in the States. But you can't remember when we started, it was 24 years ago. Richemont was 66% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:06) and that a minority position in Cartier is taking Piaget and that was about it. It was a holding company. And in essence, it stayed a holding company until we did the changes, Portier at Vend&#xF4;me then, in essence, moved to Geneva.</p>
          <p>And it's far too complex, so what we &#x2013; how we've run it is through verticalization. We did it before anybody else. In fact, Alain coined the phrase, DNA of a brand and that everybody uses and we call it the Maisons. And in fact, Frederick registered it because it's not a brand. It's a Maison. Now, I see everybody's got Maisons. But, it's run by the individuals. George Kern is in Schaffhausen. And he runs it. He's got his own factory. He's got his own sales staff, Bernard until the end of December runs Cartier.</p>
          <p>We have holding company functions. Richard has been in-charge and he is going to remain in-charge and these are critical functions. And it's not only the normal back office. It's where we as Richemont can add value in building goodwill rather than just buying it. So we're talking at the board yesterday when we bought Van Cleef &amp; Arpel. I remember the older one's amongst you and some of our share hold &#x2013; board members, every bloody meeting: so when is Van Cleef going to turn profitable? When is Van Cleef going to turn profitable? And it was like water dripping.</p>
          <p>We knew &#x2013; what we thought at that stage, we knew we're heading in the right direction today. I think it's what, 4 or 5 times more profitable than Gucci. And we bought it, it was not making money. But Frederick Mostert and his intellectual property division cleaned out the whole of the IP, our property division, we've got people here. So it's a very, very important function or series of disciplines and functions that we provide and which makes it possible to buy &#x2013; I mean, Panerai's turnover is now 240, 250 times what we paid for it 12, 14 years ago. I know that was Angelo Bonati and his team, but it's also the back office, distribution, initially Cartier opened doors for them.</p>
          <p>If we take Gary, he challenged one of our companies and said them, what would &#x2013; why don't you take some more capital? Why don't you use capital? Buy more stones. So one of the Maisons bought &#x20AC;60 million worth of stones, well it's going to turn into, what, &#x20AC;240 million, &#x20AC;250 million worth of sales with a healthy margin.</p>
          <p>So nothing much changes. We have three individuals. This company's always really been run as a Troika. We had Joe Kanoui, Richard and Alain Perrin; Joe, finance with Richard, and of course Franco Cologni. There were lots of arguments, lots of creative tension especially when you've got that many French involved and Italians; it's always a casino. So Gary and I just sometimes just sit there and watch and &#x2013; but its creative tension. So in terms of the management, nothing much changes in the sense that we've always worked in the collegial sense at head office. The product committees will still carry on. <mark type="ph" /> It's start and soul of (49:40) how we try to guide the Maisons, and I would say it's the biggest interference in their lives.</p>
          <p>In terms of the management committee, this we announced because of the stock exchange requirement, but it's always been the case. If we make a single adjustment we have to announce it. And people have retired and people have come in. So it's not a radical shift.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margins, whenever &#x2013; or the lower price products, I think you asked, it's not the lower &#x2013; lowest price, but in every time of economic hardship, and we've pointed this out in the past, it's the middle market that gets hurt. It is not the bottom, right at the bottom, and it's not the top, but it is the middle.</p>
          <p>And when you have companies where brand equity does not translate into desirability, true desirability, then those companies suffer. Because landlords don't say, oh, well, we feel a bit sorry for you, you're a bit under pressure, they just say pay more. And there's still an enormous scramble for prime real estate.</p>
          <p>And of course, there's another thing, you've got people like Abercrombie who insist upon being next to Cartier. The landlords, the very smart landlords are saying, where you going to be in 10 years time, or 15 years? We all know of rapid growth big box companies and what happened in 10, 15 years later. But on the other hand, they are there. So if you look at Fifth Avenue, yes, Apple, but Apple is a phenom, it's not &#x2013; but there are more and more non-luxury companies and this is tragedy because you don't find the local bookstore. When I lived in New York, I used to enjoy going to Rizzoli. Today it's Amazon, but Amazon is not Rizzoli, I'm sorry. And you'd find little stationers and you'd find true luxury. Today it's lost a bit of its charm. But unfortunately, the landlords insist.</p>
          <p>And in Asia, if I can use the term Asia, because it's not really obviously homogenous, but wherever you find booming economic conditions, you find this tendency. And the middle of the road companies find it very, very hard to maintain presence and visibility. And it poses a question as to the sustainability of the business model. And that goes across all companies. It's not only luxury goods; it's virtually any company you can think of.</p>
          <p>I see my friend, Karl Lagerfeld, got into trouble by attacking the French president when he &#x2013; and but amongst others he said, who outside of France buys French automobiles? And it's not a very smart thing to say, but if you ask yourself the question, who do buy these cars? Luxury goods, yes, and then he attacks the luxury goods industry or the rich. Was not very smart. But those business models need to be addressed. So it's not only luxury goods.</p>
          <p>And the big overriding concern that I have, in normal free markets when you have excess capacity and prices drop, people disappear, companies disappear, automobile companies disappear, big manufacturers disappear. The central banks now are working together in a combat against deflation and unemployment that they've moved the cost of borrowed capital to zero.</p>
          <p>So the free market is not working. There are lots of industrialists across the world that are in intensive care, all their companies in the ICU unit with a drip from the ECB. And they're not shutting their plants. So guess what? There's still going to be excess capacity. When you've got a lot of excess capacity, that's artificially keeping &#x2013; being kept alive artificially, it's a question of who can keep <mark type="ph" /> see his breath (55:20) the longest.</p>
          <p>We know there will be tears. Maybe they'll avoid the fiscal cliff. I'm not sure. They're behaving like children again. As I said to my son, the Dow Jones dropped by 300 points and Smith &amp; Wesson went up by 10%, okay. That's what happened after the election. The gun manufacturers increased by 9% and the Dow dropped. Does not look to me like a country that's finding a middle road in working together in Congress.</p>
          <p>Europe, I don't need to say anymore. We don't know what's going to happen in China. So you put all of this together then, you know. I don't think we're going to have economic &#x2013; spectacular economic growth. Companies have been kept alive artificially by central banks, because they don't want unemployment. And on that background, one will have to look at companies in your own group that do not have the brand equity. But it's normal, everybody does it. It's part of your business life.</p>
          <p>As will I stay involved? It's one of those very curious things, if you're the controlling shareholder, and you bought the group. I've got to actually get off the board for a few months in order to give these folks a chance and tell the people they're not allowed to call me. Because Norbert will tell you that when he was CEO I never took telephone calls from people working for him without him being involved, because I had had enough when my late father was alive. You'd give somebody an unpleasant decision, not your own decision, but four of us would get together and he'd call my father because you know previous relationships.</p>
          <p>The problem is if you say yes once then you undermine the executive's authority. So therefore we're going to have a difficult one now with Bernard Fornas getting <mark type="ph" /> us in euro (58:17). We're going to have to make sure that Bernard keeps his nose out of Cartier. And Bernard, if you're listening there, you will remember that I did tell you to leave Stanislas alone from the first, if you're watching on the screen. Bernard will leave Stanislas alone; otherwise Stanislas cannot run Cartier.</p>
          <p>But when you've got trust, when Richard and Bernard have been friends for, what, 20 years: It's a complex company. I'm going to get &#x2013; I don't know whether you've heard of the best brothers in Texas. When their dad, late father, stepped down, was before mobile phones and satellite, e-mails and stuff, but none of the executives of the company would listen to Sid and Lee. They always called Mr. Perry Bass. So, he said to his wife, Nancy Lee, he said look, neither you nor I like sailing, but we're going to take a boat and we're going to sail for a year and nobody's going to be able to call us.</p>
          <p>So they forced to call Sid and Lee. And they actually did it. To their absolute astonishment, they quite liked it but they didn't keep it, but they're actually &#x2013; it's got to be at the stage where I say to them look guys, they know in the past I've honored that. When people call, I say sorry. You want to speak &#x2013; somebody works for Richard, you want to speak about something, let's have Richard there. It's amazing how they never call the second time, Richard. It's &#x2013; sorry, well it's &#x2013; let me settle that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I have something to add some color, to feel that, as we said in French, everything change, but nothing change. It's clear that we have one boss, one direction. It's a cultural issue and what is very important for you to understand is that there is a continuity of the management and what we are the most proud of is the succession planning that we are organized.</p>
          <p>Look at Cartier, very important company for us. And one year ago, we announced the arrival of Stanislas who has other, we say, a strong training within the organization because you are seeing he has more than 20 years with us and his deputy <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:00:58) who's taking over from him. And for us is that the most important that we continue to our people sharing the same value, sharing the same cultural issues. And of course, at the end of the day, always having one boss and giving us their direction whatever the title.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, many hundreds of millions for 12 years at 3.1% dollars. Now you know I'm not going to say how much so that you can tell them in May.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But &#x2013; so when you buy something in New York, <mark type="ph" /> at Chapeau (01:02:12), that's what I called <mark type="ph" /> a hedge (1:02:14), okay. You buy something. You borrow on the currency and fixed at 3.1%. I said, please, just get us much as you can, Gary. But that, Gary, just that gives us flexibility beyond. And I can tell you it makes my life easy to have colleagues like that. He also does have succession.</p>
          <p>I think it's more the business model that we've got to look at. It's now the <mark type="ph" /> 25th (1:03:00) year, and assuming reinvestment of dividend, the IRR is just under 15% in dollars and slightly over &#x2013; virtually 15% in Swiss francs over the 24 years.</p>
          <p>And since the last four years, since the split with <mark type="ph" /> BIT (01:03:33) it's been twice that, it's been, oh, I seem to work it out as 34% in dollars and 29% in Swiss francs. So the model works. And I think that is the thing that makes me sleep at night. We seem to have the right business model.</p>
          <p>Will we, like everybody else, suffer if there's a real calamity? Yes, we will. But you know, if you look at the centuries that the Maisons have survived and it's not the Maison, it's the idiots who run it that wreck it. Our job is not to be one of the idiots that wreck the Maisons. If you look at Vacheron, you look at Cartier, you look at 1755, right, Cartier; these companies have survived world wars, famines, depressions, hyperinflations. It's our job to make sure that they survive us, if I can put it like that. And up until now we're okay.</p>
          <p>In any case, you shouldn't worry about me because Richard's been the one that's been doing all the work in any case, so any other questions? Sorry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Jon Cox with Kepler. A couple of questions for you. Just on the sort of sales granularity and what's happening more recently. You're talking about October 7% constant currency growth. You seem to be saying the Americas looks a bit better because obviously if you back out the five months to the six months, it looks like the Americas are actually negative in September. Now there's been &#x2013; appears to be a bit of a rebound in October, if you could just go into that. And then obviously, on the Asia Pacific region, it looks like its mid single-digit declines, local currency in September. I presume that's continuing into October.</p>
          <p>I just want to get a bit more granularity on that and your opinion what may happen next in terms of the election process in China, whether do you think that could lead to a bit more of a pickup in that Greater China region, so a question on the top-line.</p>
          <p>Second question, just on examining brand equity; obviously, you're talking about Baume &amp; Mercier maybe you're having another record loss this year. I wonder what you think about that particular businesses' brand equity.</p>
          <p>And then third question just on the whole expansion of your industrial base in terms of movements and becoming self sufficient. Just wondering where you are in that process? How much more do you think you need to invest in the industrial backbone to become where you want to be in terms of self sufficiency or relying on some people, but not being overly reliant on them? Thank you.</p>

          <p>They're all different. Luckily they all trade with one another because if they had to trade with us, they'd all be bankrupt. I think you've got to look at the intra-Asian trade to get a good idea. But luckily that's picking up dramatically. We have no idea. You can &#x2013; why don't you look at what Goldman Sachs says. They're a bit better than we are and they say next two years, 7.5% to 8.5% in China, okay. I'll back that. If that's the case, we're happy.</p>

          <p>Going back to manufacturing we're fine and <mark type="ph" /> you know that possibly the years will (1:10:33) indicate how we were planning to integrate more manufacturing. It's not only for, of course, having more <mark type="ph" /> total meantime of manufacturable movement (1:11:00). But going forward, the brand we keep seeing require more in-house manufacturing, is that's obviously is true for jewelry, for example, and you always speak about watches but, we're also investing significant amounts in the jewelry business.</p>

          <p>And it's costly, but it's an imperative. You're not going to buy a Ferrari from a Fiat factory. Clients are far too intelligent; both males and females go to the web and they want to know that it's authentic. And in order to be authentic, you've got to have your &#x2013; the correct designers and you could have the right processes and you've could have do it ethically yourself. Don't just outsource and not know where it's done. You've got to respect the environment, obviously, the manufacturing process. And that's costly. And you can turn your eyes and give it somebody else but it's not the way we do business and it's not the way our clients expect us to do business.</p>
          <p>And as far as we are concerned, and our colleagues, it's not a debatable issue, you have to do it. But interestingly you do get rewarded by the clients who feel that it's a necessity. Necessity. I don't want to record and record <mark type="ph" /> again (01:12:40).</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thomas Chauvet, Citigroup. I've got three questions. The first one on pricing, it seems that you've increased prices over the summer in Europe. What was the magnitude of the increase? Has there been increase in other regions and what's expected for the rest of the year, or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not talking about the future prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They did it last year and I had a small little tremor here. When clients know what the prices are they buy just before you increase the prices. So I just want to preempt them from winking or nodding and saying something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the first question. Secondly, could you help us understanding a bit the cost development, Gary, in the second half in particular A&amp;P and admin costs. You had been quite precise in the first half? And finally on for you Mr. Rupert and Richard perhaps on the competitive landscape, there seemed to be two French luxury conglomerates trying to acquire scaling watches and jewelry. I understand your vision about M&amp;A, about value creation. Nevertheless, you've got a big, big cash pile or strong balance sheet. Are there opportunities in the watch and jewelry segment that are necessary for you to offset perhaps a more competitive landscape with acquisition made by some of your peers in recent years and in coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you want to talk about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just say firstly pricing. The probable pricing if you don't &#x2013; with the volatility in foreign exchange. We do not want to have a situation where Japan or China or Taiwan, wherever is a lot more expensive than Europe.</p>
          <p>Firstly, it's not really fair to the clients. But secondly, you get a lot of gray goods moving. On the other hand, when somebody has just bought something, you can drop the prices a week later. They are not overly amused. So it's a science, but it's also an art to make sure that you've got a fair universal pricing for goods.</p>
          <p>It's more difficult to move a car, but a watch or a piece jewelry, if you <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:15:21) especially with the visibility of the Internet, you're going to have movement of goods, high value, small volume. So it's not always that we're going to try and grab margin, it's let's try and keep things fair across the world. Gary? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thomas, you're quite right. I mean, we did take price increases but pretty much just in Europe and it was more of a hard goods thing. So I can't really tell you a number, but you're quite right. On the expenses, you're right, I was clear. I wasn't necessarily clear for the first half. I was clear for the full year, right? And I said on a constant currency basis we expect S&amp;D to grow by 14% and admin to grow by 14% and I'm saying the same thing again.</p>
          <p>On communication, okay, we don't necessarily know where the sales are going to go, but I would &#x2013; so I'd rather be a little less precise and say somewhere between 9% and 9.5% for the full year. So that implies, as normal, an increased spend in the second half. And then...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it's the same every year. The companies you read you would like to buy will never be sold. And we really do have a very big portfolio. If you look at Van Cleef and how it's grown. Cartier was just an amazing, amazing Maison. And Piaget is growing towards a preferred jewelry. We've got to see Maisons watches. We have so many, but I would much rather give a colleague &#x20AC;100 million or &#x20AC;200 million for balance sheet purposes. If they want to buy stones or if they want to do it, then I think it's proven by Gary's giving them &#x20AC;60 million which turned into &#x20AC;240 million in 18 months.</p>
          <p>Yes, they're all coming into our field, but it's called free enterprise. And as we've learned when we've stepped out of our main business, transferability of genius is a rare concept. It doesn't happen very often. People, beautiful, brilliant in banking will go into insurance, suddenly find out the bancassurance model is not that good. So if you want to go from textiles to leather, you suddenly find, but it's not exactly the same business. For watches and jewelry it's not the same business at all, not the same distribution. And when you step out of your field you &#x2013; my Jewish friends call it rabbi <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:19:00), you've got to pay your rabbi a little bit before you learn, okay?</p>
          <p>So we welcome them and we have good relationships with our competitors. Funny enough, a lot of them fight with one another, but we kind of get on with our Swiss and French competitor. Yes?</p>

          <p>Patrik Schwendimann from Z&#xFC;rcher Kantonalbank. Again on China, the new Chinese government, I guess there will be two targets with the new government that they want to increase local consumption and that they want to fight corruption. What implications could this have for Richemont?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They want to increase consumption. So for instance, we've spoken to Capital and Singapore. In order to increase consumption, they're busy building a mall now in Chongqing at the confluence of the two rivers; it's one of their iconic sites like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:20:20) 277,000 square meters, a mall, not a company. They tell me they're going to build a building &#x2013; well, 200 malls will be built in the next four to five years in China, because the Chinese government come to a realization that in order to increase consumption people then buy washing machines from Mom and Pop, Hole in the Wall shops where they can't get a car or &#x2013; so they're going to have to build malls. And I don't think anybody said local consumption. I said it's consumption versus all the capital &#x2013; but they're busy building 200 airports as we speak.</p>
          <p>In London, they're fighting about a third runway and they have been fighting for 20 years about a third runway. Do you think I'm really that concerned about where the growth is going to be? It's going to be in China.</p>
          <p>In terms of corruption, you find corruption all over the world. I would say less in the Nordic countries and in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:21:40) countries, but unfortunately it's all over the world and I'm not going to comment on corruption in China at all.</p>
          <p>The CHF 1 million per day turned over in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:21:40) in Lucerne has got nothing to do with corruption in China. Its people that have worked that have saved &#x2013; that is spending their own money. It's not over CHF 1 million a day in one store in Lucerne. Traveling Chinese are coming and they're spending, if you go to Galeries Lafayette and if you see the people. So I don't think I've read anywhere that it's local consumption. It is consumption. And I think fighting corruption it's a worldwide scourge. It's not only a problem in China.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe even to decrease it to attract the local consumption?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, it's increasing consumption for everybody if the prices should drop in Mainland China, but we have no idea what they plan to do. And I'm not even sure that people are 100% sure who will be on the Politburo by next Thursday. So &#x2013; but you know what, will they grow over the next five years? Yes, they will.</p>
          <p>They study, firstly they're smart; secondly, they work, they study, and they travel. Exactly. And now they travel and they're going to continue to travel. So when I leave, I'm not going to sell my shares, okay, I'll be buying more shares as things go on. And I wouldn't be doing that if I thought that the economics of the luxury goods business is bad economics.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; the other day I read was at Panasonic, $10 billion losses. Not just a little blip. $10 billion, okay? There are so many industries that I'm so glad that I'm not in. Banking, you can start with A and you can probably get to Z with things that are bad businesses today and we're lucky. So our margin drops by 2% and Jon Cox has a nightmare.</p>
          <p>Jon, we're just lucky. We're not that smart. We're very lucky. We're very, very lucky, our dynamics, and we don't owe money. And people travel as Richard says. And as long as we keep our products desirable, we're going to do very well. Thank you. That's our job. That's all we can really do.</p>
          <p>We can't change taxes. We can't change consumption, but we can try to make sure that our &#x2013; from the design right through to the presentation that our products are more desirable than that of our competitors. That's really the goal.</p>

          <p>Thank you, good morning. Thomas Mesmin, Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole Cheuvreux. I've got a few questions, if I may. First one, you mentioned that you've slowed the production recently. Is it for all of your brands and for both watches and jewelry?</p>
          <p>The second one, and some of your competitors and notably the French one let's say, mentioned recently &#x2013; one of your competitors, let's say, in France mentioned recently that they're experiencing the end of de-stocking effect in Mainland China. Are you seeing the same kind of trend in Mainland China?</p>
          <p>The third one is for Gary, if you could just come back on the impact of the new methodology on hedging gains in H2? And a very quick and last one, could you update us regarding your multi-brand store project in Paris? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I mean, certainly, Thomas, I think we've made it clear to all the brands not to over stock, okay? Now whether you call that de-stocking or whatever, but clearly things have slowed. I mean, we're not immune to that but we don't &#x2013; we're more worried about the receivables and we're more worried about returns, right? So we would rather take less upfront, if I may say it that way.</p>
          <p>In the past, and certainly when I was in America, I could be accused of this myself is if your retail is a bit of soft, you get a truck and you open up the wholesale. We specifically told the people not to do to &#x2013; the brands not to do that. So that's why we're still pretty comfortable with the retail/wholesale split.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly they have a demand pull strategy or a push strategy. Problem with the push strategy, with high value, low volume goods, you push it into a market if it doesn't sell. It naturally finds its way to another market where you do have a demand for the product where you're suddenly stuck with an over stocking situation. So it's a global decision you've got to make.

          <p>Well, the music is still playing. I'm just sitting a bit further away from the band at the moment. It's still going well, but it's probably turning to normality. There's still good growth. Amongst Chinese it's moved a little bit in terms of where they're buying. And I doubt that that is going to stop. Locality has joined.</p>
          <p>Well, one of our biggest problems, and I fall into that trap all the time, we're very reluctant to predict a discontinuum of any trend. When things go better, we think this is going to be heaven. When things go worst, very few people actually say, I think we're close to the bottom. And if you really look, things cannot always grow &#x2013; get better and things cannot always get worst. The real &#x2013; I guess, the real issue is when do you call it.</p>
          <p>So you cannot &#x2013; if you take the compounding. There's no way in which we could have grown by &#x2013; let's take firstly the growth rates in Japan. We're staggering, 10, 20 years &#x2013; 20 years ago. So you know that it's going to stop, but when? And in China, we all knew you couldn't grow. China as an economy couldn't grow 12% to 15% continuously. It start &#x2013; there are too many things that can go wrong.</p>
          <p>But you know I try to explain to politicians, especially in Africa, the difference between an economic growth rate of 2%, 4% and 8%. 2% takes you three, six years to double the quality of life of your inhabitants. 4% &#x2013; 8% is nine years, okay? So are you going to do it &#x2013; sorry, not, eight times nine, yeah. Take the law of 72s.</p>
          <p>You want your per capita income to double and you take a generation, is a generation 20 years. You can work it out. Now the per capita income in China, they want to have it doubled. You've read about it, and in the countryside. Now how they manipulate that or make sure that that happens is they just don't give you work permit for the coastal cities.</p>
          <p>So companies move inland. They establish factories inland and they create jobs inland. I think it will carry on. Net-A-Porter, I'm not really involved because they don't keep my size. That's more for men with waist of 32 that &#x2013; so these two gents can buy that. My son, and them.</p>

          <p>Eva, I admit this time last year I was a bit cranky on Net-A-Porter. They're doing fine, they're making their plan. MR PORTER is doing well. It's really becoming a second engine for them and they're cash flow positive. So no complaints at all.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Mario Ortelli, Sanford C. Bernstein. Your business is generating a lot of cash, more than enough to finance organic growth. When you've got special projects you can get loans at a very good rate. You've got a lot of cash and from what we understood, you're not planning acquisition in the short-term. Can we foresee an increase of a dividend or a buyback project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I never said there will be no acquisition. I said I can't see anything. And secondly, if I did, I'm not going to tell you, okay, or anybody else. So I've never said that. But one day when I really &#x2013; I should really know when I &#x2013; I should really publish a list of all the most stupid recommendations made by investment bankers and the analysts about what we should do. The top of the list is you have got a lazy balance sheet. Give the cash to the shareholders, and we will give it back to you when you need it really, okay?</p>
          <p>We've been &#x2013; we with little or no debt managed to grow by 15%, on higher order of 15% and in the last four years with no debt, by 30%. Why the hell if you can have growth rates like that, why? Then we've grown our dividends by 15% per year in euro terms, Swiss franc terms. I don't think there are lot of other companies.</p>
          <p>So we're happy with our business model and we do not buy with equity. We believe that shares should be treated as the scarcest commodity. And in fact when I was in your business in finance and in banking, I was very suspicious of anybody that bought with shares because there was a serious incentive to overstate the value of my shares if I kept on buying good shares. Then there is an incentive to pump it up because that cheapens the currency you're buying with.</p>
          <p>So I am &#x2013; when people treat shares as a scarce commodity and they don't pay with equity, then I have a good look at their company because they're treating their fellow shareholders &#x2013; if you believe in your company the most expensive currency you can buy with these shares, your own shares. So we try to treat it as a scarce commodity.</p>
          <p>And secondly, the real question for any investor is, can the management re-invest the free cash flow at the rate equal to or better than what they've done in the past or what the market can or their competitors do. And that's &#x2013; our challenge is to try to find ways to redeploy the free cash flow.</p>
          <p>If you grade your dividend by 15% &#x2013; give me a competitor. Okay. You've got very big database, who's grown their dividends by 15% per year over the last five years. Please tell me because I'd like to buy some of their shares. I can't find them. So I think whilst our model works, we're happy to redeploy the free cash flow inside the business. There must be more.</p>
          <p>So we have, what, three more questions? Good. I thought there was somebody at the back there, no. Perfect.</p>
          <p>Sorry, I never said we'll never buy anything, okay. What I did say is upon that question is I can't see a watch company or a jewelry company at this stage with a dynamics that's that attractive. And if we buy, we'll buy for cash. We think buying for shares.</p>
          <p>I'd like you to go now and look at all the big trends measures that you witnessed. Inevitably, all these conglomerates, it was somebody who bought for shares and the real common denominator is you could never analyze the company properly because just when you started to get your arms around it, they made another acquisition, a little bit of an accounting change, and you try and reconcile it. Remember, I was in your business, before Excel spreadsheets, that's how long we go back, okay.</p>
          <p>And just when you kind of understand the business, then they make another acquisition. And I just put a red flag, if somebody does that, don't buy the stock because if I can't understand the accounts, and it's simple and it's normally some convoluted merger accounting. And you know what? Have you seen how much cash Apple's got? We don't have that much, okay.</p>
          <p>Jon? Last question, Jon, no forward-looking statements.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're absolutely right, of course. Gary, just what you said on the gross margin, I think you said that the favorable currency had 160 basis points positive impact, you think, on the gross margin in H1. Just based on spot prices, do you think you can maintain that gross margin in the second half of the year? Because this is one thing we don't &#x2013; we can't really see. We can do the &#x2013; what you're going to spend on advertising and all the rest of it, but the gross margin is really the kicker for us. And any sort of best guess for the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Assuming the currencies are as they were as of September, assuming the mix is the same, maybe a slightly less than the first half. Slightly, I would say. I think we did have positive manufacturing variances in the first half and because we've slowed the production a bit, those won't reoccur, I would say, but very slight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to put a bit of damp around this, Jon. As you grow and you open new stores and you increase your manufacturing capabilities, obviously you kept your margin. The more retail you have, the less wholesale you have. You have good operating leverage or gearing. Things turn as those of you that have been around a while will know that operating leverage turns negative, and that's what you really have to watch.</p>
          <p>A 10% growth should, in our business, equate to a 20% increase at the bottom, but a 10% drop may actually be a 30% decline, may, it depends where and how. So it's not that Gary doesn't want to. It's top line. As I think Richard and Gary said, our said our business is top line driven. We've got to sell. If we don't sell, the cost will kill us. And that's what keeps me awake, this operating leverage. And that is why I like cash.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I cautioned you to look for, and not in today's environment where money falls out of the sky and you open &#x2013; Italians run the European Central Bank, Italians that used to work for Goldman. I mean, no. When you have a combination of financial leverage and operating leverage, in good times you make a fortune, in bad times you hand your shirt, your jacket, your keys, you're gone. Never combine financial leverage and operating leverage. You have either of the other two, but not both in the same company. And we do have operating leverage.</p>
          <p>If you have a gold mine, please do not finance it with debt because if the gold price drops, your cost don't drop, you're wiped out, mining, commodity pricing.</p>
          <p>On the other hand if you have a bowling or if you have a tanker, and you lease the tanker out for 19 or 15, 20 years for a fixed contract, you can borrow 100% against it if you've got a very good lessee. Our business has got operating leverage, so I hate combining financial leverage with it, because if you have interest rates moving and your turnover drops, finito. That's why we don't like it.</p>
          <p>Remember, I've been through a few of these things. 1987, naturally cautious. My debt, by the way, stagflation. Have a look at the companies that did well in the 1970s that could withstand stagflation. They're not going to be able to stop inflation. It's not possible with the quantity of easing that's going on across the world, everywhere.</p>
          <p>By the time you turn the taps off, it's going to overshoot. We don't know when, you could have something before, but a year or two or three ago, I didn't know whether we're going to have deflation or inflation. My gut now tells me stagflation. No real growth with inflation. And it's probably the worst combinazione.</p>
          <p>So what happened with when Lyndon Johnson said goodbye and Nixon took over and look at the inflation combined with the oil in the early 1970s, and this carried on until Paul Walker increased the discount rate and really acted. So if we have stagflation, a lot of people are going to be in trouble.</p>
