          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Societe Generale Group First Half 2010 Results Conference Call. The presentation hosted by Mr. Didier Valet, Group Chief Financial Officer, will be followed by a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>And now I would like to hand over to Mr. Valet. Sir, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everyone. So before coming back to the quarter's highlights, I would like just to come back to the environment that characterized the second quarter results. So this environment, which is an environment of an economic recovery, also admittedly fragile, is in our view favorable overall to banking activity as we are continuing to see a limited but positive volume growth, satisfactory margins and a gradual decrease in the cost of risk.</p>
          <p>This environment were disrupted in second quarter 2010 by questions about the sustainability of the public finance imbalances in Europe and the resulting climate of distrust surrounding European sovereign debt, the euro and overall the European banking system.</p>
          <p>However, two major events have recently helped to restore faith and improve visibility in the banking system. First, <mark type="inaudible" /> which confirm the solidity of the major European banks in general and Societe Generale in particular, which as you've seen a Tier 1 ratio in the <mark type="inaudible" /> scenario that would stand at 10.0% at the end of 2011. Second, the announcement of amendments to the Basel III rules with the inclusion by the regulator of a number of adjustments responding to the banks arguments, also it should be noted that further calibration will be needed and we are still somewhere from a final definition of the new rules.</p>
          <p>As a result, we remain confident that the economic and banking environment will gradually improve and that it will continue to positively impact our Group's activity. In second quarter, the Group produced globally satisfactory quarterly results. The Retail Banking businesses posted good commercial growth and a satisfactory financial performance with overall a 3.7% increase in revenues on a like-for-like basis compared to last year.</p>
          <p>CIB performance decreased by 37% on a like-for-like basis, but taking into account the unfavorable market environment and comparison against an exceptional quarter for market activities last year, these results is evidence of the division's strong residence, the diversification of our businesses and the effect of continued prudent management of our market risk.</p>
          <p>Across the board, we've seen an improvement in the cost of risk in the first quarter that continued this quarter with a net cost of risk of 87 basis points. Finally, legacy assets had a limited impact this quarter with positive revenues of &#x20AC;71 million and a negative cost of risk of minus &#x20AC;97 million.</p>
          <p>So overall as you've seen, Group net income amounted to &#x20AC;1.84 billion in the second quarter. In other words, three times its level of the second quarter 2009. These figures would have been &#x20AC;918 million if we excludes the impact of revaluation of financial liability after tax. In the first half of 2010, the Group has announced, mid-June began the transformation. We've made our first portfolio adjustments with the announcement of the French Networks' acquisition of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Marseillaise de Cr&#xE9;dit and the planned disposal of ECS, our IT asset leasing and management subsidiary.</p>
          <p>In addition, various measures to improve operating efficiencies have been started in all the business sites. As a results, the Group's cost income ratio, which totaled 62.5% adjusted from non-economy item in H1 2010 decreased by two percentage points compared to last year, thanks especially to the strong improvements of all the retail banking businesses.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me highlight that the Group has maintained a solid financial structure with a Tier 1 ratio of 10.7% and a Core Tier 1 of 8.5% at the end of June 2010 excluding the floor effect. And as I said in introduction, the strong capital position has been further evidenced by the successful results <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>If I move to page four and look at the full P&amp;L of the Group, as you can see, the net banking income rose by 12.9% compared to last year on a like-for-like basis and its rise is even stronger for the first half, plus 22%. Thanks to good cost control, you've seen that the gross operating income grew by more than 50% on a like-for-like basis for the quarter and by more than 80% for the first half. And as we already commented, the results more than tripled.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide five, and now have a look to the cost of risk, which as I said, confirmed the improvement reported in the first quarter 2010. The levels so for the group as a whole is 87 bps, slightly down compared to 91 bps but lower than what we've seen last year where we were overall above 100 bps on average for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Digging by divisions, the cost of risk of the French Networks amounted to slightly more than 50 bps, slightly down compared to the first quarter in line with our guidance of the cost of risk for the full year of around 50 basis points. Regarding large corporates, the provision declined, the level has remained high for SME customer. And let's say, as already mentioned, this is a key characteristic of the French market. The cost of risk for individual customer is still low because of the large proportion of housing loans.</p>
          <p>Overseas, the cost of risk of international retail banking dropped compared to first quarter 2010 at 192 basis point compared to 225. Let me say a few words on Greece, you remember that in the first quarter we set aside &#x20AC;48 million of specific provisions and &#x20AC;101 million of collective provisions, so totaling &#x20AC;149 million.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, the specific provision linked to Greece amounted to &#x20AC;70 million. Also this quarter in Romania, we've seen a slight increase of the cost of risk regarding to specific provisioning, and we set aside on top of that &#x20AC;20 million of collective provision to discount the future potential deterioration of the macroeconomic situation in link with IMF package.</p>
          <p>However, all that has been reversed by the declines in the Czech Republic and to a lesser degree the progress that we have seen also in Russia, where you may remember that we were at 550 basis points a year ago, 370 in the first quarter and we are up to <mark type="inaudible" /> at 328 basis points for Russia solely. If we move to specialized financing, the cost of risk this quarter stayed at high level at 224 basis points, so a slight decrease compared to previous one. And this reflects the stable level for equipment finance, where we have already seen the decline in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>While in consumer finance, we continue to see a high cost of risk especially in Poland and in Italy. Lastly on the CIB core activities, you're seeing that the cost of risk is low, very low at 10 basis points reflecting the portfolio's strong resilience as already evidenced in the first quarter. And lastly on the legacy assets, the cost of risk amounted to &#x20AC;97 million in terms of provisioning of which 88 linked to the CDOs for RMBS reclassified in October 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me move now to page six and have a look to the financial structure of Societe Generale Group. The financial structure was sound and stable compared to the first quarter with a Tier 1 of 10.7% and a Core Tier 1 of 8.5, you have the detail of the evaluation with each components on the bar chart. The Group risk weighted assets standing at 330 billion at the end of June increased by 1.2% compared to the end of March. This is essentially coming from ForEx impact, which has been &#x20AC;5 billion of increase during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The Group financial study this year is also being confirmed by the good results from the European stress test as you can see on the bar charts and in the appendices, Societe Generale was at its highest level of Tier 1 ratio post stress test among French banks and well positioned among European banks.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide seven regarding funding. Societe Generale remains an issuer sought after by the market. Despite the tension that we've seen overall in the market this quarter, we have been able to continue with our medium and long-term financing program, where appropriate, using secured issues to extend the debt's average maturity. At the end of July, we have issued &#x20AC;16.6 billion, issued after the 5 billion in excess that we raised in 2009. You can see that the financial plan &#x2013; the funding programs are really largely completed. Also in terms of CDS, you've seen that we are among the best European banks regarding the level of CDS and our CDS is now below 100 bps following the improvement of market condition over the last three weeks.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look to page eight, which look at the revenue trends observed in the first and second quarter for each business line. In France, you can see that we have a strong dynamic with revenue increasing by 5.7%. International Retail Banking revenues were stable but when you compare to the first quarter the rebound that we've mentioned at the time of the first quarter results is confirmed with a 2.8% increase Q-on-Q on a like-for-like basis. Specialized Financial Services and Insurance posted a 10.3% increase in revenues despite an environment that is still quite negative.</p>
          <p>And in GIMS' Private Banking, we are still being affected by low level of interest rates and investor risk aversion, which explain the 10% decrease compared to last year. But again there is a strong rebound compared to the first quarter of this year. Finally in CIB as already mentioned, the decline if you adjusted the core activities, the decline is 43% and I will comment on that later on.</p>
          <p>Let's move to page nine, starting with the French Networks. Our three brands Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord and Boursorama, confirmed during the second quarter the strong result they have already achieved in the first quarter of this year. This has been done thanks to a strong commercial dynamism. And just to describe that, you can see that the net new current account so for individual customers have increased in the quarter by 53,000, we were slightly below 57 in the first quarter, so this means that we are likely to be above 200,000 new current account opening for the full year.</p>
          <p>Deposits outstanding were extremely strong with an increase overall of 8.4% compared to last year, 7% for the sight deposits, 23% for the term deposits. Loan deposits on the sight have increased by 2.6% mainly fueled by housing loan, which grew by 5.9% compared to last year. And regarding business customers, we have seen a good trend regarding investment loans, which have increased by 3.3%. The combination of this voluntary, let's say, policy in terms of deposit gathering has led to a strong improvement to foreign deposit ratio, which went down by more than 7 points to 134% as of end of June.</p>
          <p>Regarding off-balance sheet savings, you can see also that the net life insurance inflows have increased by 26% compared to last year. These good commercial indicators have resulted into a revenue increase, as I already mentioned, by 5.7% year-on-year compared to second quarter last year and this is supporting, of course, our annual guidance of a growth of around 3% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Bear in mind that in H2 we will have headwinds coming from the rise in <mark type="inaudible" /> which would cost a little bit more than &#x20AC;60 million in term of revenues for the five months of the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>We have also been able to limit the increase of our operating expenses and so the combination of this wide positive views has led to a reduction of the cost income ratio by 1.8 points compared to last year. I'll remind you that our target is one point for the full year.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to page 10, with the International Retail Banking business. The commercial and financial performances posted by the division confirm the upturn in activity that began at the start of the year in an economic environment that, of course, differed depending on the geographic zone.</p>
          <p>If I start with the Mediterranean Basin, the commercial <mark type="inaudible" /> entities is illustrated by the continuous growth of the franchise and business outstanding. All in all, over one year, international retail banking gained 122,000 customers and opened 52 new branches on a net basis bringing it to more than 700 branches.</p>
          <p>The loan outstandings confirm also this positive trend and posted growth of more than 4% on a like-to-like basis in just one quarter. In the second quarter, the entities in Russia and CE confirm also the business upturn observed at the end of the first quarter. You remember that we mentioned that in March, we've seen some improvement <mark type="inaudible" /> in Russia and you can see that this has been confirmed, overall loan growths are now rising by 2.4% compared to end of March and in a way shifting Russia and this first positive effect of the product transformation of our entities can be seen through the increase of individual customer loans, which are up by 5.1% compared to end of March and also an increase of deposit by 16.2% compared to end of March.</p>
          <p>If revenues are stable compared to last year, the increase is 2.8% on a like-for-line basis compared to the first quarter, OpEx fell by 1.6% compared to last year as a result of the adjustment measures that we have put into place across 2009. As a result, the cost/income ratio rose, improved by nearly 1% versus last year and overall the gross operating income of the division increased to &#x20AC;154 million and the net income to &#x20AC;125 million, that's 8% compared to last year and 11% compared to the first quarter. If I move on to the Specialized Financial Services and insurance, this quarter confirmed the rebound in the results that began in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Insurance activities remain dynamic. I already mentioned the strong performance of the French Retail Network with the net life insurance distributed outside of the network, it also performed well. We have also a good trend in the P&amp;C insurance premium, which increased by 12.8% in term of revenue base. This means that overall the revenues of the Insurance division maintained a steady growth rate at 13.0% versus last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding corporate financing activities, they are also picking up. When we look at the loan outstanding in equipment finance, even if they fell year-on-year by 4.5%, we started to see the recovery with an increase of 1.7% compared to the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Also margins for the new originated business remain high. Regarding the fleet management, the improvement in the second hand car markets has also triggered an improvement in the revenues of this division. So altogether, equipment finance, fleet management and ECS, which is still there, have contributed to the increase of the results of this division. The situation of consumer finance remains more mixed depending on the country. So thanks to the strong resilience of the outstanding and margins and also the combination with a operating expense decline, the business line has been able to grow slightly the operating income preprovisioning by 3.4% but as I said earlier, the cost of risk remain high and so has weighted overall on this sub business line profitability.</p>
          <p>Altogether, you can see that revenues were up by 10.3%, OpEx slightly above and Group net income reached &#x20AC;92 million as compared to last year in which they were &#x20AC;20 million only.</p>
          <p>If I move to Private Banking, Global Investment Management and Services, the division of this &#x2013; or the sub businesses of the divisions has posted satisfactory commercial performances and the results also picked up compared to the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>If I start with the Custody business, it showed its assets under custody and assets under administration increasing by respectively 13 and 5%. We have also continued to deal to the franchise by signing commercial agreements with two main partners, in the U.S. with US Bancorp and in Middle East with National Bank of Abu Dhabi.</p>
          <p>Regarding Newedge, Newedge has benefited from the market's volatility in the second quarter, which led to an increase in transaction volumes by more than 16%, and also it has been to maintain a high market share of 11.5% confirming its top position among the worldwide leader in execution on the future adoption derivatives.</p>
          <p>Private Banking asset grew by 3.2 billion during the quarter with &#x20AC;0.9 billion of inflows equivalent to an unrealized growth rate of 4.8%. Over the second quarter, TCW's activity stabilized with assets under management that increased by 3.5 billion to reach almost &#x20AC;89 billion and the slowdown in the outflows, which were 2.7 billion negative compared to 12.6 in the first quarter. And you can see on the bar chart at the bottom right of the slide that the negative flows linked to the mortgage-backed security activity are declining sharply across the quarter.</p>
          <p>As a result of this commercial <mark type="inaudible" />, the division income rose by 17.5% at the revenue level sequentially benefiting both from <mark type="inaudible" /> effect, but also from the strong performances turned by the securities services and Newedge and as we mentioned that we have seen an impairment of an equity participation within the private banking of around &#x20AC;30 million.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses also grew by 10% sequentially, but with positive jaws. The gross operating income, as you can see, more than doubled compared to the first quarter of 2010. And if you add to that the contribution of Amundi, the net income contribution of this division was &#x20AC;74 million in the second quarter versus 55 in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>If I finish for the businesses with CIB, we can see that it had a satisfactory quarter despite difficult market condition. Overall, revenues amounted to &#x20AC;1,751 million, down 18% compared to the first quarter 2010 and 37 compared to last year. You remember that last year it was a record quarter for co-activities due to extension on market condition and they were also resilient &#x2013; they are currently resilient compared to the first quarter 2010, as already mentioned.</p>
          <p>If I dig into the sub components, we can see that in an adverse environment for equity derivatives activities, our equity revenue, which reached &#x20AC;357 million have decreased by 55% compared to the first quarter of 2010. The sharp rise in volatility, the decrease in dividend forecasts has led to difficulties in managing the current position, which compressed our commercial margin. Specifically, the cost of hedges strongly increased in a market lacking liquidity and it was not offset by the rising <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>If I turn to fixed income, currency and commodities, revenues held up well at &#x20AC;667 million, down 14% compared to the first quarter. Despite an <mark type="inaudible" /> market environment characterized by rising volatility, broadening of credit spreads and decreasing account volumes overall. However, we have delivered a limited decline, which is linked to the strong contribution of our rate activity and also gains in market share, particularly in the ForEx business. As also written in the press release, revenues have benefited from the exercise of our Gaselys option which has contributed roughly &#x20AC;100 million to this subdivision revenues.</p>
          <p>Lastly the Financing and Advisory business had a very good quarter with revenue up 6% at &#x20AC;656 million driven by the continuous growth of structured finance activities of 16% and also the resilient and solidity of our franchise and capital markets, which <mark type="inaudible" /> decreasing volume in term of new issuance but we were number three for European corporate bond issues during the quarter and number one for the French equity issuance.</p>
          <p>Regarding legacy assets, as I said as an introduction, we have seen a positive revenue this quarter by &#x20AC;71 billion and the cost of risk is limited to &#x20AC;97 million, so altogether CIB has produced a gross operating income of slightly below &#x20AC;700 million. The contribution of asset CIB to the Group net income was &#x20AC;410 million for the quarter and for the first half it was &#x20AC;950 million.</p>
          <p>Just to conclude with the Corporate Center before leaving you the floor for the questions. You've seen that the gross operating income of the Corporate Center became positive again this quarter at &#x20AC;164 million. This is essentially linked to a 254 positive impact linked to the mark-to-market of our financial liabilities, which has let's say being influenced <mark type="inaudible" /> CDS that we've seen during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The impact of the mark-to-market across CDS hedging of corporate loan books is extremely limited at only &#x20AC;18 billion and this explains why altogether we've seen this quarter a 71 million positive contribution from the Corporate Center. That's it from me. And now I leave you the floor for the questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mrs. Delphine Lee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning &#x2013; afternoon, sorry. I have four quick questions. The first one relates to structured credit, the legacy assets. It's just to know is it possible to get a break down of the shadow P&amp;L, which I believe is 1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter?</p>
          <p>Secondly, is it possible to get also the NPL ratio and coverage for Russia, Czech Republic and Romania?</p>
          <p>And then the two last questions, on Basel III, I mean now that it has been voted down, what are the issues left from your perspective?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, just on equity derivatives, how concerned are you on the fact that in the U.S. Section 716 might have an impact on equities? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, Delphini. So I will take the first three questions and I will let Michel answer your last one on the equity derivatives. So regarding the shadow P&amp;L, in fact in terms of outstanding, so including the movements in the balance sheet, so as you have the details on page 19. If you wanted to get also the impact of increasing dollar, you can see that from an accounting point of view in the balance sheet, the shadow is altogether 1.5 billion, <mark type="inaudible" /> of the table at the low end of the slide. Then there is 1.3, which are linked to the assets from the CIB and if I pick them, you have roughly 50 &#x2013; well 50% or 50 is roughly the perfect figure, which is linked to the CDO for RMBS, so &#x20AC;660 million and CMBS, RMBS are accounting for almost the rest of the shadow P&amp;L and roughly 60/40 is for the CMBS and 40 for the RMBS for the other half. So that's where we stand and we were at 1.6 billion negative for the sold CIB assets as of end of March where you can see that we have benefited from an reduction of the shadows and improvement of the underlying assets that are in the legacy assets.</p>
          <p>If I turn to the NPL coverage, and so regarding your question on Russia, <mark type="inaudible" /> I don't have Russia right now. But on commercial bank, we have 5.1% of non-performing loans net of guarantee and the coverage ratio is 65%. If we look at BRD, the NPL stands at slightly 8% and the coverage ratio is slightly below 50%, and on Russia altogether so you have Rosbank, but not Russia.</p>
          <p>So Rosbank in fact, the NPL activity 11% and we are covered at more than 100% with including specific and portfolio-based provisioning, it's 130%. So that's it for your second question.</p>
          <p>Regarding the third question on Basel III, <mark type="inaudible" /> pending point I would say from the reform, we would be let's say, well, of course, 6 million <mark type="inaudible" /> final calibration, which still has to be set. But regarding the different subjects, which are still at <mark type="inaudible" /> in our view, there is well the question about the TVA, well, what has been let's say published by the Management Committee 10 days ago now has to be clarified in term of impact because there were some improvement in the methodology but we need to see <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And the second point regarding &#x2013; well, we were disappointed but so were most of the banks, I guess, regarding the definition of liquid assets within the liquidity coverage ratio, which even if it has been extended to covered loans and <mark type="inaudible" /> corporate bonds, we continue to believe that not to include eligible assets in the NPL calculation is in our view something that is not taking into account the real economy. And as I said at the beginning, of course the calibration has still to be a fine-tuning in second half. So that's the two points I would <mark type="inaudible" />. On equity derivatives, I'll now pass it to Michel to answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the U.S. disposition from equity derivative, as far as we can read it will have, we think, a limited impact on our business because it will more concern the issuance of notes related to equity than a pure OTC derivative price. And then regarding the recurring houses development, it will be first more a question for CDS and <mark type="inaudible" />. So overall so far we think that for us it will be limited and then of course was a question of when, and that also will be a fine implementation not in a short future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Mr. Jean Francois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, there. I have three quick questions, if I may. The first have now become a bit more traditional. Would you mind giving us a little bit of color on the beginning of the third quarter trading environment for CIB if you wouldn't mind?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to the insurance subsidiary, you have usually in your buzz, in your <mark type="inaudible" /> report capital of 3.4 billion there. I was just wondering what your solvency for this business is, so your solvency margin?</p>
          <p>And then the Basel II deduction have risen from 2.3 billion at year-end to about 3.2 billion now. I was just trying to understand what was behind this very sharp increase? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will maybe pass to Michel regarding to start of July, but let's say I think that you have seen <mark type="inaudible" /> on your trading flow that there were two different products the first two weeks and the next two weeks, but we have to be extremely cautious at this point regarding the trends which are difficult to read through.</p>
          <p>On the insurance, yes, in the <mark type="inaudible" /> we have 3.4 billion, this is equity and sub debt. So this is all the capital and sub debt that we have injected in let's say life insurance subsidiaries. And regarding the solvency margin, you have to bear in mind that in out, let's say, life internal allocation we do allocate 75% of the solvency margin of our life insurance and non-life insurance subsidiaries as non-material equity.</p>
          <p>So I don't have the figure right now in term of direct reading, but as you have the risk weighted assets in appendices for the financing business. If you make 7% of the financing business and you compare to the equity allocated, the gap will give you three quarter of the solvency margin but I would say you could come through Investor Relation teams. So it should be in fact I get it now, it's slightly less than 1.9 billion for three quarter, so this means that the solvency margin requirements should be in the region of &#x20AC;2.6 billion, something like that and you can make the calculation, Jean Francois.</p>
          <p>Lastly, regarding the deduction Basel II, there'll be three impacts. The first one, which is coming from the increase in the dollar, let's say a big part of the deduction from Basel II is linked to a securitization or fully rated securitization, which are in the dollars denominated so we have an increase on that front. And for the rest, I'd say we've seen also migration of certain securitization, which <mark type="inaudible" /> a slight increase of this deduction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Didier. Brice Vandamme from Deutsche Bank. Just a few question, as I actually <mark type="inaudible" />, two questions on previous guidance that you gave. The first one on legacy assets, you indicated 0.7 to &#x20AC;1 billion of pre-tax impact for this year.</p>
          <p>For the time being, the run rate would highlight normal than the lower range you indicated. Are you updating your guidance on that point?</p>
          <p>Second guidance you gave, which was &#x20AC;8 billion of revenue in CIB for core activities for full year '10. I mean this quarter was probably not normalized, so do you maintain the 8 billion guidance for the full year or is it still no more on the agenda?</p>
          <p>And perhaps just a question on toxic assets, I saw on the slide where we have some <mark type="inaudible" /> that you have a kind of move from hedged to unhedged assets for CDOs. It is a consequence of your commutation agreements you did in Q2? And that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for your question. And I will let Michel answer to the CIB guidance as you see in normalized market environment. I would take the two ones on the legacy. So the guidance on the legacy assets, well, we put in the press release that now we are expecting to be at the low end of the range, so you can see that it's a kind of might update so but we do expect now to be more in the region of 0.7 rather than at 1 billion and regarding the shift that you are seeing yet in the G7 reporting. So regarding the shift of certain CDOs from the monoline exposure into the financial CDO exposure. Yes, and this is linked to a commutation that took place during the second quarter results and now Michel regarding the guidance of CIB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just a quick remark first, the guidance is not 8 billion per year, it's two billion per quarter and it's 2 billion per quarter in a normalized market, as Didier said, we were not in a normalized market in the second quarter. And are we now in a normalized market in the third quarter? Well, it's not really &#x2013; you've seen that the volatility and the long-term volatility on the equity derivatives is still high, it's declining though it's still high and the level of the new issuance on the debt capital market and on <mark type="inaudible" /> are also rather limited.</p>
          <p>This being said, we see signs to be more optimistic. First of all, we are pretty happy with the way we are dealing with our risk management. We've been proactive and discipline. And second, we see that on the capital raising and advisory, we see still a very steady trend of revenues for us. We continue to gain market shares on the fixed income activities <mark type="inaudible" /> and FX. So with the stress test publication and the Basel III communiqu&#xE9;, we see that the market today is improving and the last days of July were showing improvement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, Didier. Three quick questions from me. The first one is on the French Retail, where we've seen a growth quarter-on-quarter over net interest income of 3%, which is great. I'm just wondering whether this is sustainable going forward.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the Financial Services business when the cost of risk was 292 basis points, that was an increase on the previous quarter. I'm just wondering whether these are signs of stabilization and where the trend is going to end?</p>
          <p>Finally the third question is on the residual division. If I look at the underlying operating revenues they should be in the region of close to zero as you have 230 million &#x2013; 250 <mark type="inaudible" />. Now if I normalize the first quarter, you had 100 millions of <mark type="inaudible" /> and the revenues were close to zero. The underlying revenues will be negative for 100 million. So I'm just wondering if you can give us any guidance as to what the revenues underlying for the residual division can be going forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Alessandro, thank you for your three questions. Regarding the French Retail Banking business, well I'm not commenting on that sequentially, let's say, <mark type="inaudible" /> almost 7% in the first quarter. We were at 5.7 in the second quarter. What we said is that in terms of net interest income and you can see that in the appendices, we've seen an improvement on net interest margin to 2.44%. The improvement of the margins has been supported by two major factors, first one was a benefit from the decline in <mark type="inaudible" />, which took place if you remember several times last year, let's say, in the 1st of February 2009, 1st of May 2009, 1st of August 2009 and definitely this has created a favorable base of comparison, H1 compare to H1, and now we understand, as I said during the presentation in kind of a headwind scenario, i.e., there was no cuts in H2 last year and we've seen an increase by 50 bps last week.</p>
          <p>The second one that was also positive was a structural effect of our balance sheet, i.e., we were extremely successful in gathering deposit and as I said we have improved the loan-to-deposit ratio to 134% and definitely reducing our reliance on wholesale funding. So nevertheless, we should see a deterioration of revenues in H2 definitely with a base of comparison that will be more difficult in term also of commercial operation, and with this increase of 50 bps by the <mark type="inaudible" /> as I said it should represent not a gain so a loss of revenues of approximately a little bit more than &#x20AC;50 million for the second half of this year. Your question on financial services was linked to...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say that there we are unlikely to see same type of level, let's say, for the rest of the year I'd say. On the equipment finance, we've seen the decrease already taking place in the first quarter; on consumer lending, let's say, we continue to have high cost of risk in two countries, Poland and Italy. In this I prefer to be, let's say, conservative and to say that we could see something around this level in second half of this year.</p>
          <p>The rest, let's say, when I look to France, Germany, Russia also is doing well in this current environment. Russia, we've seen an improvement across the recent quarters. Your last question was on the corporate center, well, yes, we already said, I think, one or two times that we should have a kind of negative gross operating income on a quarterly basis of something around minus 150, just to make it up, perhaps you could say that it's minus 100 in revenues and minus 50 on the cost side, and you have, let's say, what is the underlying trend of the Corporate Center, excluding any exceptional item into mark-to-market <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Didier. Three follow up question. One, I mean to start off from, you set up a number of targets <mark type="inaudible" />, but two of them were not; I'm taking about &#x2013; international retail banking was a target of 8 to 10% increase in operating profit before provisions.</p>
          <p>And second one regarding private banking, it was part of the businesses where you would &#x2013; you said you would expect net income to grow in 2010 than last years' '09, I guess, it's going to more challenging, so a quick comment on these.</p>
          <p>And third one is on the specialized financing and insurance, it was said that <mark type="inaudible" /> would be close to 10% first half of this year <mark type="inaudible" /> 6.5 to 7%. So do you still maintain, I mean, this target?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding Greece, I mean can you elaborate on the NPL developments coverage ratio, and put into prospect achieve very, very high level of provisions, which were set aside in this second quarter by <mark type="inaudible" />], and then what you would expect for the next two quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Patrick, Thank you for your question. Regarding, the gross operating income increase of the retail banking outside France. Let's say we have already to say some benefits on the cost side, as I mentioned, during my presentation. And we're starting to see sequentially a rebound of the revenues so, let's say, definitely it is a challenge but nevertheless we feel that this increased object to be achievable. On private banking, I would say we were impacted in Q1 and Q2 by two exceptional items, let's say, the first one was a floor that we've seen in Asia, and second one was an impairment of securities. If we split out these two elements, let's say the comparison <mark type="inaudible" /> is relatively positive for the private banking. We have the 4.8% net inflows, and thus this is something positive.</p>
          <p>The margins, we said, should be around 100 basis points, <mark type="inaudible" /> let's say one or two basis points below that underlying in the second quarter. If you strip out the impairment on the security so I would say definitely when we gave a guidance at the beginning of the year we were not expecting these events. So the underlying specimen should be assessed without these two events, and I think that we continue also to be a &#x2013; well, the target is continuing to be achievable.</p>
          <p>Lastly, regarding the financial services, our specialized financial services and insurance, well, I say you, I don't ask you to draw the trend from the Q1 and Q2, but nevertheless we've seen some good signals in term of improvements. Gross operating income is dynamic and thus we feel that I don't know whether it was close to '10 or close to '09 but it was <mark type="inaudible" /> in our view continue to be achievable.</p>
          <p>And on Greece, well, we said also, let's say, in the first quarter that under a kind of stress scenario in which we could see a further collapse or contraction of the Greek economy of around 4%, which now it seems to be the strong half scenario. We said that the provisioning could be &#x20AC;75 million quarter, and let's say, obviously, we almost bank in line with this indication at 70, and thus at this point we continue to say that to have the same order of provisioning for the coming two quarters is maybe &#x2013; has now become a kind of, let's say, most probable scenario. So that's what I can say to answer your questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just, I mean, for the NPLs and coverage ratio, and also rebounding on your answer, 75 million per quarter given that your quarter share of Genuity losses is going to increase both capital increase, I mean what kind of losses has it been now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact we will see the result of the capital increase first of all, Patrick. But I would say you could &#x2013; currently we have, let's say, with &#x20AC;70 million of provisioning, we have a little bit more than &#x20AC;30 million after normalized tax rate in the retail banking of <mark type="inaudible" /> with 54%. So you can make your own calculation what could be the next few months <mark type="inaudible" /> that we could have in Genuity if nobody is following the capital increase, because this seems to be along your assumption. Well, nevertheless increases like &#x2013; the losses are likely to increase, I don't know, by 15 or 20 million more but no more than that.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Robin Down from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yeah, I just have a couple of follow-up questions. First, I think Francois' question about the capital and life subsidiary and 3.4 billion. Could you give us a split there between equity <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And the second question we asked about sort of Greece, et cetera, but in Romania could you give us some thoughts on how you see impairments developing there in the second half? I can see in the Romanian press that the management are expecting impairments to improve in H2 but just wondering if you share that confidence.</p>
          <p>And then the final question is coming back to legacy asset forecasts, you are saying you are going to be at the bottom end of the range down toward 700 million, but you've obviously had a very strong Q2 there in legacy asset side, and if you just extrapolate from the first half, it looks like you're going to be well below that 700 million.</p>
          <p>Is there something that you are expecting to go wrong if you like in H2, or should we just take your sort of maintain guidance of 700 million or so as being just sort of prudence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robin, regarding your first question is between equity and sub debt, you maybe &#x2013; Investor Relations will come back to you after the conference call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Romania, what we have seen &#x2013; so is that the plan, which has been implemented or which is going to be implemented by the government. <mark type="inaudible" />. So nevertheless in this environment, we're now &#x2013; our focus is that GDP could contract between 2 to 2.5% this year. We can say that BRD has been much more resilient than its peers. And this is something that you have already seen last year in term of financial performance, in term of capacity also to limit the increase in non-performing loans. And I would say, when you compare all the ratios of BRD with even its largest PSO or smaller banks, you can see that we undertake the product class, <mark type="inaudible" /> in term of origination we were cautious already 2 1/2 years ago.</p>
          <p>And that also we are being conservative and prudent in term of fluctuation of the credits, which were granted by the company. So where we will continue to have a close high in second half is more on the retail side than on the corporate side. The corporate, there was an increase but we believe that we have a level of <mark type="inaudible" /> and retail is more likely to be impacted by the recent decision by the government.</p>
          <p>Lastly on the legacy asset, let's say no, if I can say I cannot expect to have &#x20AC;170 million in the quarter for the rest of the year. So let's stick to this low end of the guidance and we will update going forward. What we can say that in the trustee report of our <mark type="inaudible" /> CDO for RMBS, we've seen in term of delinquencies a slowdown, an improvement and we prefer to be let's say relatively conservative on them especially because part of that seems to be linked to the plan put into place by the Obama Administration, in term of renegotiation of certain mortgages. And so we would have to see whether in one or two quarters, we could have, let's say, a slight increase in provisioning. It's not a major change, it's just that &#x2013; I'd say we cannot extrapolate one quarter to do a conclusion for the full-year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Four questions, which are the borrowing related to forecast. The first one is, is there any counter price impact in the SSS unit is there something material there or is there any write-down &#x2013; write-back rather on the insurance in terms of equity?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to asset management. There is a big jump quarter-on-quarter in expense and revenues. It's quite material, I was wondering what is the explanation? I mean you gave in the press release some explanation on the revenue side, but I'm wondering why the expenses are jumping so suddenly? And then is there any markdown or depreciation of the equity portfolio in the Corporate Center this quarter? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I will let Jacques Ripoll, Head of GIMS answering to TCW &#x2013; the question on TCW. Regarding the Corporate Center there is no impairments on the equity portfolio this quarter. You've seen that we continue to have a positive unrealized gain. On the insurance side your question Jean Pierre was &#x2013; sorry I didn't catch it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, was there any write-back of equity values &#x2013; equity investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact we need to look at the performance of the life insurance business. The bulk of the revenue growth is explained by the technical results &#x2013; the financial results, that they continue to be relatively stable and there was no either gains or reversal on the equity portfolio. So it's really the underlying performance, which is explaining the strong performance achieved by the life insurance business and this is so for the &#x2013; let's say for the last almost six quarter or so. Let's say there is nothing else to say. I hand over to Jacques regarding the strong revenue increase of TCW and asset management division.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Yes, in terms of revenues at TCW, first it's part of a global stabilization of the franchise and it's rather <mark type="inaudible" /> to certain number of performance fees that we made during the quarter and that has boosted the revenues and of course has its performances, there is still some additional cost linked to that.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say, this quarter is probably not representative of going forward because it's so materially higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While the dollar clearly has impacted results, but on average <mark type="inaudible" /> the quarter. Regarding the performance fees, definitely it's more complicated to forecast and so you could have one quarter, one funds-to-funds, which could trigger important fees and thus it is a little more competitive. But overall, I'd say the performances of the funds managed by TCW and its new team is extremely positive, so this is also positive not maybe for Q3 or Q4, but for the long-term this is a positive sign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Can I just have a quick follow-up question on the market risk-weighted assets? They went down to 9.4 billion, are you still assuming a multiple of three times as you move to the new regulatory environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but <mark type="inaudible" /> because we can hope that we would be in a normalized market environment and in a normalized market environment, let's say, we are expecting <mark type="inaudible" /> to be larger because we will be &#x2013; we will have six or 10 more important opportunities to deal with our clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you can multiply that three times, but I would say what we said and which is still up to date is that overall we should have, including securitization impact, something like &#x20AC;50 billion equivalent of additional risk-weighted assets. Part will be through deduction, part will be through increasing the risk weighted assets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Didier. I have two kinds of questions, one I guess the assets and TCW. TCW, you are taking about stabilization of the outflows. I was reading recently a new important departure within the company market scenario, they were taking of something like $10 billion at risk, do you confirm that situation for TCW and the impact in Q3 or Q4?</p>
          <p>Second on legacy asset, if I'm not wrong your target of &#x20AC;700 million of write-downs was a sum of revenues and provisions. Then could you help us, or me at least, to understand the swing in revenue from Q1 and Q2 and how can we deal with that in the future?</p>
          <p>Other question on legacy assets, the risk-weighted asset of legacy asset, what is the evolution because you have very sharp increase in equity allocated within Q1 and Q2 of 14%, I know this is regarding the assets beginning of the quarter?</p>
          <p>And the last question is maybe, <mark type="inaudible" /> side of the asset and the shadow P&amp;L, you have decrease from 1.6 billion to 1.5 billion negative from Q1 to Q2, but this is mainly through a provision of 100 million, than the underlying asset has not moved at all. When do you think we would see a very positive &#x2013; or positive impact from the parameter on the underlying assets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pascal, I will let Jacques answer to the first question and thus I will be able to gather the figures that you asked for the other one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Jacques, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, there is no departure of assets. In this case, it's a very friendly move that we're making with market energy <mark type="inaudible" /> The idea is that they are currently managing something like 11 billions of assets for TCW. Those assets will stay within TCW in the systems and with the infrastructure of TCW and will be managed or continue to be managed by exactly the same team.</p>
          <p>So there is a complete continuity on those assets. The only evolution is that this group wanted to create a bit of their own franchise. So on the new business that they will bring, they will have it through a question to that capital structure. But the 11 billion of assets have strictly no change in the way they are being run. And as you have seen, it is done in a very constructive mode between the management of TCW and <mark type="inaudible" /> and his team.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Pascal, regarding your question, first on the revenue forecast well, you have on page 24, all the lines which explained the plus 71. So you can see that there is various factors, which moved from mark-to-market of certain portfolios. We have also this quarter a slight positive impact from commutation. We said that in term of shifting assets from hedge to unhedged, but also showing you also the fact that our assets were properly marked.</p>
          <p>We have some positive impact on the commutation and we have also other things like positive mark-to-market on <mark type="inaudible" />. So let's say it's a mixture of all that. So that's why, if I remember well, at the beginning of the year, I said that we have that kind of conservative scenario and <mark type="inaudible" /> revenues which would be between zero to minus 50 a quarter. This quarter is better.</p>
          <p>And if we turn to the question regarding equity allocated, which are up by 14%. Yes, correct. This is <mark type="inaudible" /> essentially linked to the dollar. Definitely, yes we have all these assets and thus all the capital allocated to the legacy assets, which is 30 million let's say in dollar, thus we have this impact.</p>
          <p>As I said also, you've seen that Basel II deduction, which we do take into account in the equity allocation and the two other question of Jean Francois Neuez has slightly increased during the quarter. Lastly, regarding the shadow P&amp;L, so the 1.6 down to 1.5 billion, that you've mentioned. Truly, let's say, could explained by the 100 million provisioning, but I will provide you more granularity, as I started to do with my answer to Delphine at the very beginning of this conference call.</p>
          <p>First the 1.6 and 1.5 is the shadow P&amp;L, but also the shadow OCI. So in that we also did reclassify certain &#x2013; a very good for sale securities into loans and receivable. And definitely we have also an OCI, which has no impact on the P&amp;L. If I speak to that in two pieces, in fact the shadow P&amp;L, so the one which we are trading to banking has decreased from 1.6 to 1.3 billion and it's more, let's say, the widening of the credit spreads on the available-for-sale, which has deteriorated the OCI shadow from zero to almost 200.</p>
          <p>If I dig into more detail on this 1.6 to 1.3 billion, as I said we have stability for the CDO for MBS and a strong decrease for both CMBS, which went down by &#x20AC;250 million, so 550 to 300 and a stability for the RMBS and thus despite the fact that again all these assets are <mark type="inaudible" /> and this means that across the quarter, we've seen an increase end of date to end of date by almost 5% something like that, I don't have the figure in mind, but definitely we've seen a strong impact. So that's why first the shadow P&amp;L saw the big impact of assets that if they are steady in trading then interest rate in banking has decreased by &#x20AC;300 million, but on top of that the decrease is not just linked to 100 million provisioning and 200 million improvement of value. But we are more than that because of the dollar impact, which was a negative contributor for us this quarter.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hi. I just have a follow-up question on international retail. You've given sort of an outlook for Greece and Romania. Would you be kind enough to give us an outlook for the provisions in Russia in the medium-term. And also I'm sure you've said it Q1, but I can't remember the amount of the capital gain you expect on ECS? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Guillaume, you're not sure of the capital gain on ECS, you're not sure just because it has not been disclosed yet. So you will see when it will be in the P&amp;L. Regarding the outlook on provisioning, I will say, if I gave an outlook on Greece I'm not sure I gave an outlook in Romania and I'll say regarding Russia, which is your question we continue to have the same mood and same message then what we've said over the last two quarters, which is that the cost of risk in Russia has started to decline since the second quarter of last year and we do expect it to continue to decline so that, let's say, the breakeven that we have in mind to achieve in fourth quarter, cost of risk would be one off the leverage, one off the <mark type="inaudible" />.

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I have two question regarding the &#x2013; first one regarding the French retail and the second one regarding the leasing business. Regarding the French retail, we've seen a very good production on the mortgages and that this morning Madame Lagarde, the French Finance Minister, has announced some changes regarding tax, which were the deduction of the interests paid on the mortgages and the potentially new restructuring the zero interest payment plus a change of the taxation on the <mark type="inaudible" />. I'd really appreciate to have your first reaction on that one?</p>
          <p>The second point is regarding the leasing, fleet leasing business, is it the pick up of the revenues one off, mainly driven by the end of the premium also by the French government to <mark type="inaudible" /> or this is more structural?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Maxence, good afternoon. First, regarding the French retail question, well I would say let's wait and see to see the final outcome of this tax <mark type="inaudible" /> changes. But nevertheless, we should not forget the even if this measures have been supportive let's say a year ago when the demand was relatively average, what we can say that the current trends we've seen let's say at <mark type="inaudible" /> and overall for the whole French market is <mark type="inaudible" /> two major drivers first each <mark type="inaudible" /> of the mortgage rates, I think it's unique and definitely a lot of households are let's say tempted to use this low level of interest rate for first time ownership or potentially to change houses.</p>
          <p>And also regarding the prices, we have different statistics, let's say, some show still a slight decrease some other are starting to show a slight increase but there was no bubble on the French house market in France. We continue to ask <mark type="inaudible" /> a shortage of new housing on the French market and thus with a kind of stabilization of prices. People combining that with low level of interest rates are definitely tempted to enter again on the housing markets. And thus the fact is, I would say, is the strawberry on the cake but I would say this is not in my view a major driver of <mark type="inaudible" /> especially when it is ownership mortgage related.</p>
          <p>On the leasing, this spot is not driven at all by the <mark type="inaudible" /> so by the current incentive. This is more in the consumer finance side, less about the corporate and corporate financing is linked to two major drivers, one which is really leasing but for the corporate, so this means you have the <mark type="inaudible" /> these type of things, and thus this is more I'd say that revenues coming more from the underlying that's the economic recovery and investment from the corporate.</p>
          <p>The second one, which has &#x2013; and this has been supported by a slight rebound that we had started to see in Q1 of the assets of the outstanding but more importantly by better margins, which have let's say been increased &#x2013; or have increased overall over the last 18 months in a market environment that was more complicated for certain of our competitor.</p>
          <p>The second one, is the fleet management, so there the business is to manage fleets or manage fleet for corporate, so I can <mark type="inaudible" />. And thus, we've said already <mark type="inaudible" /> we had due to the weakness of the second hand car markets last year, we had approximately &#x20AC;250 million of negative revenue impact coming from the residual value. We've said and this was why we have mentioned rebound that we were expecting from this division this year and if you remember we disclosed that at the time of the full year results.</p>
          <p>We were expecting something like less than 100 this year in term of budget, so there was already 150 swing that was almost make a niche, just everything being close, so no improvements on the second hand car market. We've seen some improvement on the second hand car markets, we have to be cautious because it varies depending on the countries, but definitely this has, I would say, accelerated slightly the positive impact that you've seen on the fleet management, so I would say this could play a role still in third quarter and fourth quarter let's say year-on-year comparison, less sequentially, and I would say the bulk of it will be absorbed by this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your comments regarding the leasing on the main for the industrial is quite positive that means your clients are already in the process of reinvesting, and preparing the rebound or which is &#x2013; because on one side, we've seen the French retail very sluggish, sorry for the wording, corporate loan growth.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we are seeing a quite good rebound of the consumer credits, which is usual I'd say very influenced by the cycle and at the same time we're already seeing the leasing also picking up. So do you have the feeling that the level of confidence in France is definitely rising?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the French business, well, for example bear in mind that during the second quarter, we've seen some improvement, obviously not for financial services, this is for the leasing business, which is in the French Networks, but we've seen a slight improvement in the financial lease, <mark type="inaudible" /> okay, since the beginning of the year. And this explains why investment loans have increased year-on-year by 3%. Regarding the financial services, <mark type="inaudible" /> bear in mind that we are in France, yes, but the bulk of...</p>

And so in Norway and Sweden, the business is doing well and also instead of sectors, we've seen a rebound in transport, or let's say we have a &#x2013; this is part of &#x2013; while this is a big part of the activity that <mark type="inaudible" /> and transport is starting to recover.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I just have one question, the others have been answered. Just looking at the total balance sheet, assets at fair value have risen about 15%, year-to-date will be somewhat less so in Q2. Can you just tell us how much of that is related to currency effects and then more broadly are you comfortable now with the shape of the balance sheet particularly related to trading assets in CIB or should we expect any further downsizing perhaps, if you could just talk about that that would be great? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Omar. And so regarding the total balance sheet size, which is &#x20AC;1,134 billion, the increase &#x2013; I don't have the increase Q-on-Q, but for the first half is by 110 and within that &#x20AC;60 billion is linked to currency movements. So this means that excluding we would have only a 5% increase of the balance sheet size.</p>
          <p>And if I look at the &#x2013; or maybe there is some of the accounting but <mark type="inaudible" /> increase of the mark-to-market of derivatives, including exchange rate at 64 billion. So I would say if you just strip out the ForEx movement and if you strip out the evolution of the mark-to-market of the derivatives, I think that the size of the balance sheet was almost stable. So this shows that we are disciplined and of course the discipline has been extremely important in the CIB business, in the first half of this year.</p>

The first is on the cost income ratio or the cost in CIB, I just wondered how much of the increase or &#x2013; and the deterioration of the cost income ratio is due to a one off because of the U.K. bonus tax or how much <mark type="inaudible" /> of compensation from last year might have played a role?</p>
          <p>And then lastly just on the net interest margin in France, I just wondered how sustainable the positive development is especially in light of the increase and <mark type="inaudible" />. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Anke. Regarding the &#x2013; well, we start maybe first with the net interest margin, regarding the net interest margin the 2.44% that you're seeing is sliding 12 months average, and as I said commenting on the trends, we are expecting for the revenues in the French retail and for the second half, and so we are more let's say expecting something stable let's say again of the increase in second half on net interest margin, essentially because of as I said a potential <mark type="inaudible" /> this is one of the explanation of the deterioration that we do expect regarding this line. If I turn to the cost on the CIB side, I would say, we already passed a big part of the U.K. tax in the first quarter and the rest was taken in second half &#x2013; the second quarter, sorry. So this is done.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>So there is no real one off in there in a way?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> what we said, you've seen that overall we've got flexibility on the cost base. Secondly, let's say, we have some investments and let's say we are not in a stop and go strategy. So let's say, when we ideas to expand in the fixed income in the investment banking, let's say we are cautiously but constantly making this recruitment effort, and that's part of the investment but you can see that the let's say the evolution of the cost base has been well under control despite the headwinds that we've seen in term of revenues.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah good afternoon. Sorry if I missed these numbers, but could you give us what the stock of own debt gains is which <mark type="inaudible" />? And secondly just related to this, apart from maybe the reverse of that gain as credit spreads come in and <mark type="inaudible" /> that you pointed earlier, are there any additional headwinds in the second half, which aren't faced, already in the first half? What I'm trying to get at is that you previously indicated that you are happy with analyst consensus for the full year of around maybe a bit more over &#x20AC;3 billion, so just under &#x20AC;4 per share but given that you've done more than two billion in the first half year, hopefully the capital market environment gets a little easier, it's on to 74 per share, is that previous guidance looking extremely conservative now? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Well, regarding your second question, I think Jon, you did the answer so I would not comment more on that. Regarding the stock of our own spread, let's say, first of all it will depend on the evolution of the <mark type="inaudible" /> level, but let's say we have roughly 100 in the first quarter, 250 in second quarter, so let's say part of that <mark type="inaudible" /> more competitive, it will depend on the market evolution in the coming third on which to come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from <mark type="inaudible" /> from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello. You mentioned that there has been some good signals from specialist finance and service businesses but the net allocation to provision in this has increased 6.1% to &#x20AC;311 million, could you please explain how this has happened and my second question is regarding the core Tier 1 capital. The core Tier 1 capital ratio is good, which is 8.5% but it has been flat. Considering the positive earnings, why wasn't there a move to raise the Tier 1 capital ratio considering that there has been a special focus on <mark type="inaudible" /> both from regulators and investors. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So well regarding your second question. You have the detail of this evolution on page six, you can see on page six that while it says the trends in term of Tier 1 and core Tier 1 are relatively similar, you have this 33 bps increase coming from the net income including minority, after let's say <mark type="inaudible" /> subordinating notes, then we have risk weighted asset growth organic which has consumed 13 bps. Provisions for dividends were 9 bps and on the others let's say the 7 bps essentially is the ForEx impact, so let's say we have &#x2013; with the dollar increase, but also to a less extent the ruble, we have this impact on this, which is more important on the risk weighted assets compared to the equity base.</p>
          <p>So that's for the stability of the Tier 1 is more increase of the Tier 1 and stability of the core Tier 1. Regarding your question on the cost of risk for specialized financing services and insurance, and let's say, as I said &#x2013; and I'd say we've seen already in first quarter a strong decrease in equipment finance and <mark type="inaudible" /> level of around 70 bps, which is likely to remain stable let's say in the coming quarter, let's say let's be conservative and we continue to have a high cost of risk in pure consumer finance, which is slightly above 400 bps, and that's why we have let's say relatively low levels in France and Germany, we have seen an improvement in Russia and where we continue to see some high level is Poland and Italy just to give you more granularity.</p>
