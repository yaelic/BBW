        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and if I may add my words of welcome to those of Andrew. And thank you all for joining us at our interim results presentation. It's good to be here and it's great to see so many familiar faces. In fact, my first three months finished yesterday, so my honeymoon period is officially over. In some respects, it hasn't felt very much like a honeymoon period, coming into what is clearly a much more challenging operating environment for the industry globally. But my assessment is that Westpac is strong, Westpac is well positioned, indeed, is well placed for the next stage of growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of an agenda for today, I'm going to start with a brief discussion on the current market conditions, and provide a perspective on how Westpac has responded and how these conditions have affected our first half results. I'll provide a summary of our performance, and then hand over to Phil, who'll take us through the details. I'll then give some insight into my early observations or first impressions since joining Westpac and a summary of our key priority areas going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, I know I don't need to give this audience a synopsis of what's been occurring in the markets. You all are very aware of the challenges, but I would like to discuss some of the issues and how they've impacted on the bank. In a nutshell, we've been experiencing higher funding costs, as short-term markets have re-priced and longer-term funds have been both more difficult and more expensive to source.</p>
          <p>Lower equity markets have impacted our wealth business producing the returns in our funds and on capital invested. We've also experienced more volatility, and this has increased market opportunities and allowed us to better assist customers in managing their financial risks. These conditions have accelerated the current credit cycle. It's highly likely that these conditions will continue for the future -- into the foreseeable future; we really shouldn't expect the market to return to what was considered normal just 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>I have inherited a bank that is in good shape. Westpac has strong businesses, excellent disciplines, a conservative risk profile and deeply experienced people. As a result, Westpac entered the current much more challenging environment from a position of strength. And really importantly, because of the strengths, the Westpac team was quick to recognize that this was a new environment very early on. And it got to grips with the fact that the impacts of liquidity and on funding would not be short term. We anticipated that these impacts would result in a deteriorating credit environment and that customers with high levels of gearing or significant refinancing requirements, or with business models based on continuing strong equity markets, would come under significant pressure.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of this foresight, Westpac has been ahead of the game in its response. One of the things we did earlier this year was to establish a task force, which is being chaired by Phil Coffey and made up of the most senior management drawn from across group. This task force has brought a highly focused and disciplined approach to group-wide management of priority areas such as credit risk and funding, and enabled us to have a dynamic and coordinated response. It's been very effective.</p>
          <p>Throughout this period, we've also been active in supporting our customers across our different business units. In fact it's a great time to be talking to customers about their business and deepening their relationships with us. The two areas where the group has responded particularly well; the areas of funding and credit risk and I thought I'd say a few words about each of these.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the management of our funding and liquidity position has been outstanding. We took decisive and tangible steps to position the group well. These steps have included significantly increasing our liquidity to over 30 billion, providing flexibility and certainty in managing our cash flows. We've given our business units the right signals by quickly transfer pricing the higher funding costs. This first occurred in October, and we've progressively raised our transfer pricing as conditions have become tighter.</p>
          <p>When the funding costs first increased, we continued to exit markets; in fact, we were leading in this. And we now are in an excellent position with over 80% of our 2008 term funding complete. We also led the market in developing an innovative 10 billion internal securitization to provide a further liquidity contingency. And a key strength for us, and one that I've observed firsthand, has been the stability and the experience of our treasury team lead by Curt Zuber.</p>
          <p>Credit risk is the other area of key focus that I wanted to touch on. And as I mentioned earlier, the credit cycle in Australia has been trending higher since 2005. And Westpac has been responding to that trend since then. This included increasing our collections capacity in 2006, and we continue to do that even now, and tightening some of our credit score cards earlier last year. In 2007, we were first to market in establishing an additional economic provision, and we've added to it again this half.</p>
          <p>The risk team has been very active in reviewing sectors that have shown any sign of potential stress. And this has allowed us to take preventative action. A really good example of that would be in our margin lending portfolio. As you can see from the result, we have a small number of exposures that have required additional provisioning. And Phil will talk to this shortly. The point that I want to make is that the detailed reviews we have undertaken since January have given us comfort that we do not have systemic issues in our portfolio. The institutional bank has borne the pain of these handful of exposures, but when you speak to Phil Chronican, he comments that when he looks into his book he expects the next six months to be more about managing existing loan exposures than having to deal with material new ones.</p>
          <p>So let me now turn to the performance itself. And as you may know, one spends time in management meetings actually discussing what's exactly the right word to characterize performance; is it good, is it excellent, is it impressive, is it disappointing, is it poor? And we were quite quick this time to come to the word that we believe is most able to describe the performance and that word for us is robust.</p>
          <p>We think a 10% increase in cash earnings on a 12% uplift in revenue, stacks up very well on both an absolute and a relative basis. And the increase in 8% in cash earnings per share is also pleasing, particularly given the growth in our capital base over the year. The pick up in impairment charges by 11 basis points to 30 basis points, takes us back closer to what we would consider a longer term average.</p>
          <p>Productivity has also improved, with the cost of income ratio declining further to now be below 45%. And as Phil will speak to later, our capital in this new Basel II world is strong.</p>
          <p>Just looking at all of our business units and their performance. I think this result demonstrates the underlying strength and positioning of each of the business units. And we can also see the benefits of having a diverse portfolio. The consumer business has been most impacted as the higher funding costs have not been fully passed on to customers. And as a result we've seen some slowing in the earnings growth in the six months since September. But if you look at the full year, the 10% uplift is not a bad outcome.</p>
          <p>Our small and medium business operations in BFS have performed particularly well, delivering a 13% uplift in earnings over the year, and a very strong 7% over the prior period. Peter Hanlon has applied focus and discipline to this business, and we're seeing the returns from the investments that he's been making.</p>
          <p>Phil Chronican has done an excellent job navigating the institutional bank through these more volatile times and although the bottom line is lower, we're very pleased with the performance, the 24% rise in revenue being a standout.</p>
          <p>As I have discussed, the business has been impacted by a few stressed exposures. The thorough credit reviews, as well as the quality of this franchise, give me comfort in the outlook. BT has been hit by an almost perfect storm of events with lower equity markets and severe weather conditions leading to no growth in revenue over the prior period.</p>
          <p>However, under Rob Coombe's leadership, we've continued to grow share in our core funds under management, and funds under administration platforms. And I believe that the team has actually responded very well to the environment. And the business actually has remarkable strength. It's a real asset to Westpac and is well placed for the longer term.</p>
          <p>The performance of the New Zealand business shows that it's well into its turnaround. This business has been less impacted by higher funding costs, given its lending and deposit mix, and its higher proportion of fixed rate lending. Brad Cooper and his team have made very good progress in their strategy and they're driving a very strong customer focused agenda.</p>
          <p>Despite the more challenging conditions, we've maintained our dividend path. Dividends were increased a further $0.02 over the prior period, which is an 11% uplift over the year. Now, most of all, I think this speaks to the strength of the capital position.</p>
          <p>So, before I hand over to Phil to take us through some of the details, perhaps just three points to sum up. Westpac entered these much more challenging market conditions in good shape. Westpac has responded proactively, comprehensively, and in a collaborative way to meet these challenges, and we've completed detailed reviews and understand our position very well, and that position is robust.</p>
          <p>So, thanks Phil.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thanks Gail and good morning everyone. Quite a lot has changed since we presented six months ago, and as Gail mentioned, higher debt and equity market volatility, higher cost of funds, further stress in the credit environment, and the introduction of Basel II. At the same time, some things haven't changed; our management and risk disciplines, our focus on customer relationships, and a healthy portfolio of businesses, and these are serving us well today.</p>
          <p>So what I'd like to do is outline our overall performance and discuss some of the features of that, and then spend some time on credit quality, on funding, and on capital. What are appropriately the three key topics for this reporting season. I'll then sum up with a look of some of the factors likely to impact the second half. Our reported NPAT of 2.2 billion represented 34% growth over 12 months earlier and it included gains from two material asset sales, the Visa IPO and BTIM IPO. Taking those valuable but one-off transactions out of the result, our cash earnings growth was 10%, a robust result in the current conditions.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, the performance continues to trend of good revenue growth supported by high expenses. This time last year, we were talking about revenue growth of 7%. Today we're reporting 12%, as we've delivered on a number of investments, especially more people on the front line. BFS, New Zealand, and WIB delivered 15% or more growth in core earnings and CFS was up 10% in cash earnings. Offsetting that, we saw a large rise in impairment charges.</p>
          <p>As we indicated last year, we ended 2007 with a very strong second half. So it was not surprising that our sequential earnings growth was somewhat lower. What we hadn't anticipated was the strength of three significant headwinds we've encountered. Specifically on the revenue line, we were on additional $115 million of fund costs that had not been passed on to customers. And we're seen force investment markets that led to a $34 million net reduction in BTs revenue.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we've seen a significant change in the operation of capital markets. And an overall deterioration in credit conditions that led to an uplift in impaired assets. So it's in that context the growth over the past six months has been just 1%.</p>
          <p>When looking at the composition of revenue, the impact of the market conditions becomes apparent. The first impact is in the net interest components, in average interest earning assets, and interest margins. We've recorded very strong average loan growth, up 17%, and this has supported strong interest income growth. But we've also wanted to carry significant additional liquidity and that's had a big impact on margins and I'll spend some more time on margins later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Across the other components of revenue, you can see we achieved a very good increase in markets income and we've managed the higher market volatility well. However, our wealth revenue was only broadly flat, as a result of the decline we saw in equity and other investment markets. We're at a 7% uplift in fee income and that included a better contribution from the specialized capital group in WIB. Our transactional fees were a little softer and we expect continuing pressure on this line.</p>
          <p>Gail has outlined the performance of the various business divisions, but there are two specific areas of performance where there may be questions. That's in the markets related activity and in our group business result and I'll cover those in detail now.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with our markets performance in the half; the benefit of being the leading institutional bank and having a strong treasury team and having strong risk disciplines. Foreign exchange and energy backed up a strong performance in the second half of '07 to deliver another good result in the half. And most of that gain has been in sales, which were up 14% over the last 12 months. Capital markets has also had a solid performance. Now obviously, clearly capital markets distribution activity has been somewhat more subdued. However, we achieved good gains in our credit derivatives area as we are positioned for higher prices on credit protection.</p>
          <p>Equity derivatives, on the other hand, tends to have a naturally long bias in its positions and they recorded a negative result in the half. Treasury delivered another very strong performance. And they've never gathered the higher volatility in markets well.</p>
          <p>Now one feature of our market wide performance has been a pick up in VAR over the year and the increase in historical volatility means that for a given position, we've recorded a rise in our measured VAR. And you can see that outcome in this slide both for our markets and for our treasury activities. And we would expect this measure to see further increases in the second half.</p>
          <p>As is usually the case, our results include a number of smaller one-offs and in this half they all occurred in the group business unit. In particular, we saw a number of management initiatives bear fruit, with a positive contribution to our bottom line from our New Zealand dollar hedging and from the resolution of some outstanding tax issues.</p>
          <p>We achieved further research and development rebates, which we first reported last half, and we recorded the sale of a property, Bedford Park in Adelaide. The gain is in the group, but the extra lease costs that we're wearing on this property are reported in our BT expenses.</p>
          <p>Offsetting those benefits was a further $31 million increase in our group collective provisions, reflecting the worsening in global financial conditions. You'll recall we first took a similar provision for that issue in our September results.</p>
          <p>One of the more prominent features of this reporting season has been the large decline in interest margins over the prior half. So let me give you some of the details behind our result.</p>
          <p>First, up you can see that asset and liability spread and mix movements had just a three basis point impact on margins. Weaker asset spreads from higher funding costs were partially offset by high liability spreads. Treasury contributed seven basis points to the overall declining margins, but that included a 10 basis points impact from holding additional liquidity.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned last half, these liquid assets have little impact on net income, but add to the balance sheet and so they reduce margins. WIB impacted margins by just 1 basis point. Changes in the recognition in markets income between net and non-interest income positively impacted margins, and that was partially offset by the mix impact of stronger asset growth in WIB, which obviously originates at lower margins.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, structural impacts on our margin this half were eight basis points, being 10 basis points from the higher liquidity, partially offset by the two basis points benefit of income recognition in markets.</p>
          <p>And turning to expenses, expense growth was up 8% over the year and 4% over the prior half. And as I mentioned earlier, the majority of the cost growth has been investing in employees. As has been reported across the sector, the entirety of the employment market has picked up underlying employment costs, and 7% of our increase related to higher wages and salaries. Around one-third of the growth related to more people. Incentives were also higher. We also added 8 million in expenses from the acquisition of RAMS, which took place on the 4th of January. Higher occupancy expenses were included from new centers, both branches and business banking centers.</p>
          <p>Over recent periods, we've called out a strategic focus on wealth and business, and that was reflected in strong expense growth in BFS, which was up 10% and in BT, which was up 12%.</p>
          <p>To understand the impairment charge, it's worth highlighting what has occurred in our book, and this chart provides a more granular assessment of both impaired and problem loans. And you can see that our total stressed exposures, the sum of those two, as a percent of total exposures bottomed in 2005. Since then, we've gradually seen an increase in the proportion of total stressed exposures and that's now up to 1%, so we're now back to around 2003 levels.</p>
          <p>Much of the increase had been in earlier cycle watchlist, with impaired loans as a proportion of TCE continuing to fall until 2007. This year, we've seen a rise in both watchlist and impaired exposures. Our impaired increase mostly reflects two WIB loans and a margin loan. We've also seen a small number of impaired business exposures in Australia and New Zealand. The trends in watchlist and impaired that you see here are what we expect at this stage of the cycle. The overall impairment charge aligns to these trends in the portfolio and the increased size our book. Individually assessed provisions represented the largest increase, and this predominantly relates to the increased provisions in the institutional bank including the two corporate and one margin line that I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Write-offs direct are up, and that's from the seasoning in our credit card portfolio, and you may recall we had very strong growth in cards about 18 months ago. And the growth in impaired this half reflects the flow through of that card growth. More recently, our card growth has been below system and that's led to lower new collectively assessed provisions. We also didn't repeat the additional provision in the Pacific that we took last year. In institutional, one downgrade exposure pushed up the collective provision.</p>
          <p>The increase in provisioning has seen a pick up in the impairment charges to total loans to 30 basis points. Now if you want to compare over the long term, and we had to kind of somehow meld with the old  <mark type="inaudible" /> measures, and you need to look back and doing that you need to add back to our current impairment charge the interest caring adjustment, which is expensed through the interest income line. If you do this, our impairment charge was about 35 basis points and I mention that in the context of the previously expected range for impairments being in that 25 to 35 basis points range.</p>
          <p>Our provisions coverage is very good. We have a strong understanding of the facilities that are impaired, and are appropriately provisioned. Our measures of collective and total provision coverage are also solid, whether compared with loans, with non-mortgage loans, or with risk weighted assets.</p>
          <p>I should add at this point that we have thoroughly stress tested our portfolio and although we are seeing an increase in consumer delinquencies, these moves are as expected and reflect a very small part of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>On both liquidity and funding we took a proactive approach, as Gail mentioned, and as a result we're very well positioned. In particular, we acted on the changes in funding and liquidity conditions back in 2007 and we discussed that with you then. As end of April, our term funding is well ahead of plan for the financial year. And our disciplines have ensured that there has not been a marked shortening of our funding profile. The weighted average duration of new term issuance was 2.8 years.</p>
          <p>Given our approach, we do not have concerns for next year and our term funding requirement is expected to be lower in 2009 than that which we have already achieved in 2008.</p>
          <p>The transition to Basel II has had a significant impact on our capital ratios. In particular there's been a sizeable decline, 26%, in the measure of our risk weighted assets, were affecting the quality and the compensation of our portfolio. Offsetting that, our aggregate capital measures also declined due to the adoption of various new regulatory measures, and you can see the impact of the various changes on this slide.</p>
          <p>The net effect has been to increase our pro forma Tier 1 ratio as of September 30th by 147 basis points from 6.55% to 8.02%. Since September, our Tier 1 ratio has declined to 7.38%. A big part of that decline is due to the redemption of our first hybrid issue in December.</p>
          <p>We've also seen rapid growth in our risk weighted assets during the half, due to our strong loan growth, but also from changes in our risk profile, including the increased in impaired assets. We ended the half with strong capital ratios with our Tier 1 at 7.38%, with our total regulatory capital at over 10% and with our ACE ratio at 6%.</p>
          <p>Now the implications of that position are that we are strongly positioned for the current uncertain environment. We have no immediate need for special capital raisings. That said, we have significant capacity to issue hybrids and that will give us options to shape the composition of our capital base.</p>
          <p>There is more sensitivity in capital measures under Basel II, both in risk weighted asset calculations and the impact on capital from the calculation of provisions. Given the more stressed environment, including the high volatility, we think it's appropriate to maintain higher capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Looking at the second half, we expect the tougher operating conditions to continue. Funding costs will roll through at higher levels and the impact of higher interest rates is slowing the pipeline of new business.</p>
          <p>Credit conditions will also continue to show stress given the higher interest rates in New Zealand and Australia. Although, as Gail mentioned, in WIB today at least, we're focused on our existing problems not on emerging ones. We expect competition to remain strong, especially in the deposit space. Offsetting that, we're not expecting a similar fall in investment markets to that we saw in the last six months. Our response to that overall environment will be to continue the focus on risk disciplines that's serving us well, to strengthen our deposit gathering, and to take a harder look at productivity initiatives.</p>
          <p>So, in summing up, this is a robust result in more challenging conditions; strong revenue growth has maintained earnings growth notwithstanding continued investment and a pick up in impairments. Our asset quality is good, although showing signs of expected pressure. Our provisions were increased. We've been proactive in funding and we have strong capital ratios. Heading into the second half of '08, we are well positioned. Let me hand back to Gail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Phil. What I'd like to do now is move away from the results themselves, if I may, and just provide a little bit insight into my early observations since joining Westpac, talk a bit about strategic priority areas that we've identified, and just a little on the next steps.</p>
          <p>As you can imagine in these first three months, my initial focus has been very much on getting to know this organization, getting to know its staff, getting to know its customers, and really getting to grips and to understand its culture. And this is meant spending as much time as possible with people and with customers. I've had the opportunity to visit every single major Australian capital, as well as New Zealand. I've engaged with over 2,000 of our team leaders or people leaders, in workshop style forums, and I have visited a good number of branches, call centers, and operation centers. I've also had contact with a large number of customers in face-to-face ways, as well as by means of the telephone or email. And I think all of this means that it's been really useful for me in getting an end-to-end view of the organization, as well as firsthand insight into both our strengths and our areas of opportunity.</p>
          <p>So, starting with customers, in terms of early observations. It's clear that we have an exceptional customer base across all of our businesses with some very deep and long-standing relationships. The segmentation of the customer base and tailoring solutions to meet needs is perhaps a little more limited than I would have thought. We've got very strong brands, both Westpac and BT, with clear potential to leverage those further. And while we're number one in institutional banking, we are, from an overall customer service point of view, in the middle of the pack as far as consumer and business is concerned, and we've got a way to go in New Zealand as well.</p>
          <p>This last point under the customer section on the slide is particularly relevant. We have very strong align divisions with strong aligned leadership, but they operate quite independently, which doesn't lend itself to an integrated solution for customers. With regard to people, I have noted high levels of engagement, and quite remarkable pride and affiliation for Westpac, its history, and its values. I've also been impressed with the deep skills and experience of the management team. So overall, I see a terrific level of enthusiasm and a drive for a more customer focused agenda, which is quite exciting to see.</p>
          <p>On the distribution front, Westpac obviously has a large footprint. But I would have to say we've undervalued and underinvested in these assets. We're beginning to address this in our business banking business and we're beginning to see the benefits of that. Regarding products, we have impressive strength in a number of product areas; I'd particularly like to call out <mark type="inaudible" />, Super and our suite of payment products.</p>
          <p>I think the recently launched Super for Life product really is first class. In relation to our operations, our systems and processes have been designed to support products rather than customers, and as a result, as both customers and our own people tell me, we're not particularly easy to do business with, and so there is plenty of opportunity there.</p>
          <p>I've already referred to our capability in risk. Overall we have a robust risk and financial framework. We have strong disciplines and an excellent governance and culture and this has clearly stood us in good stead in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Lastly, it's important to note that our sustainability agenda is very real. While Westpac clearly is a leader in this space, I've seen firsthand evidence that sustainability is particularly compelling for our people and increasingly for our customers.</p>
          <p>Against that backdrop, the strategic priority area has become clear. At the heart of it all is a customer focus, driving a much stronger customer culture, really putting customers at the center of the business. We'll be seeking to achieve strong and deep levels of customer advocacy through significantly enhancing the customer experience and really working to earn all of our customers' business.</p>
          <p>Clearly, this is going to involve a lot of things, including that we'll been significantly reducing silos between business units, developing and implementing compelling customer segment strategies and making sure that we integrate wealth in banking at that point of interaction with customers. We're busy prioritizing right now a number of segments in the retail and business banking space.</p>
          <p>On the people front, strengthening capabilities and depth of talent will be a key focus, particularly in our distribution businesses. I am also on a mission, as you might imagine, to encourage some boldness, having a go, breaking down barriers, and getting rid of some of some of the red tape.</p>
          <p>With regard to distribution, we have huge opportunities to transform, because right now power really lies more with product and individual head offices. And our strategy will be to shift this and to run strong local customer facing businesses. And we have started on this journey already.</p>
          <p>In our operations and IT areas, we have a very strong work agenda. As I've indicated, our processes are not designed from a customer point of view; we are not easy to deal with. We are underway with design work and scoping out the required investments here. We're also doing some immediate work to improve productivity right across our business, looking for early wins so as to create headroom for additional investment.</p>
          <p>I should mention here that you shouldn't expect these productivity initiatives to result in improved cost trajectory for the second half of the year; its really more, in essences, creating and establishing a better expense run rate for the 2009 years and going forward.</p>
          <p>On sustainability the strategy is one of further enhancing our leadership position, including continuing to develop risk management as a competitive advantage so that we continue to remain ahead of the game. So in terms of next steps, it's still early days, as you would know. And we'll be back later in the year to provide more detail, particularly on those elements I know you'll be most interested in, which is the financial pathway. We have earmarked the BTIM and the Visa proceeds for this growth agenda. For the moment, let me just say that we're already underway with the planning. Key executives have been appointed, accountability is established, and teams are up and running. And the identified streams include the areas I've called out, work on customer segment planning, work on distribution, driving simplification and enhancing team work and collaboration.</p>
          <p>So just in closing, let me say, I really am excited to be here. I'm excited to be the CEO of Westpac; very proud to be as well. This is a good first result for me to be delivering in what are clearly tough conditions. But it's challenging -- it's a challenging times when differentiation most becomes evident. It's in challenging times where weaknesses are exposed and where strengths are highlighted. And Westpac, in these challenging times, is demonstrating strength. And as a result, we're able to focus on our customers and on this next stage of growth.</p>
          <p>So, thank you very much for joining us this morning. And I'm going to ask Phil to come and join me and we'd be happy to take questions.</p>

          <p>Jarrod Martin, ABN AMRO. Congratulations on the result. No surprise question about provisions and in particular the additional provision around uncertainty. If we look at ANZ, they've raised an additional circa $120 million; NAB, in the utilization of Visa IPO gains saying that they're going to utilize a fair component of that for that type of provision, which is likely be in excess of 150, whereas Westpac today have only increased by $30 million, so it looks a bit light  on when compared to some of the peers. Acknowledging that you had an extra 26 in the previous &#x2013; 28 in the previous result. I just wanted to know how you got to that number and is there a risk of further increases going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod let me kick off the answer, and then Phil if you can...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...pick it up as well, I'd be pleased. Look, from my point of view, the provisions that we have are really solid. We've done a review as I've indicated, and that includes stress testing and what we have is a high quality portfolio and a strong understanding of the loans that we have that are either impaired or on watchlist, so that's a really important point, is that we have a really good understanding of the business that we're actually writing. And so from my point of view, the economic overlay is really about the environment that we're operating in and it's an additional overlay to the one that you mentioned that we raised last year. But Phil, I don't know if you'd like to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I am looking at our orders as I reply to you Jarrod, in that, as you'd understand under the accounting standards, the provisions have to be related to incurred losses. Now, you're able look into your portfolio and model it and say on the basis of that you believe that there are losses in the portfolio, you can't &#x2013; you haven't reported them but you believe they're in there, and you're able to take provisions for that basis, which refers to this economic overlay. But you can't take provisions for things that might happen in the future. And that is the basis for our provisions and they reflect the losses we believe are in our portfolio based upon what's happened.</p>

          <p>Craig Williams from Citi. A beautiful set of risk-weighted asset numbers under Basel II. Can I refer to slide 16 of the investor discussion pack? Can you talk about the reductions that you have seen? It looks like your mortgage book, the risk rates on that are about 17 or 18 basis points compared  with a peer result recently of about 21 basis points, and why the differences might exist, and can you make some broader comments about generally how your book has responded to the shift to Basel II?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when we first set out on the Basel II program, we actually expected to see an even larger reduction in our risk-weighted assets, and it's been really through a process of discussion with our regulator and some imposed factors that we've actually had that reduction come down to 26%. I can't comment in terms of comparisons. I think what we'll -- as an industry, what we'll see is a lot more detail when get to Basel III, and we can really give you the individual component parts.</p>
          <p>My own summation on differences in the mortgage portfolio are probably more around the probability of default, and they're also probably around differences in terms of how much your mortgage portfolio you have in Australia versus New Zealand, because New Zealand also has a higher risk factor imposed by the RBNZ.</p>
          <p>In terms of the total position, as I mentioned in my presentation, Craig, we think this reduction reflects both the composition, that is the high weighting we've got in mortgages, and the quality of the portfolio and that goes to the risk rates that we've got, particularly in our corporate and business lending. And so, we think that these results actually do reflect the quality we've been talking about, getting that benefit when Basel II was introduced, we've been talking about it for 2 or 3 years, Phil, and so we're very pleased to be able to deliver this result and show it to the market today.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>And within the business book, could you provide a bit more color about business banking and institutional book, and what you're sort of saying within different risk weight requirements against lending?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It all goes to the kind of credit risk factors that you apply against those various loans, and the various segments in which those loans are categorized, and as I said, it's difficult to talk in aggregate around those things. We're quite keen to actually have a workshop sometime between now and September when we can kind of go through our Pillar 3 data and give you all of that. If you've got specific question on it, I'll have a crack at that. But if you're looking at what's kind of over arching composition of the book, as I said, I think you'll get a lot more detail, you'll probably get more detail than you probably even want when we do Pillar 3.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles, Morgan Stanley. You mentioned that you're seeing an increase in new consumer delinquencies. That's a slightly different statement from what ANZ made last week. So I'm just wondering if you could expand on that. Tell us what parts of the portfolio are causing most concern, and also the comment in the outlook statement about slowing loan growth expectations. Could you expand on that, in particular talking about your expectations for consumer loan growth, and also for the top end of the business loan portfolio, so within the top end of the business financial services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, let me kick off. We might, Phil, ask you to do deal with the WIB part of that later on in the answer. But there are a number of questions there, but to start off with the first one about the delinquencies. The major area where we've seen an increase in delinquencies has been in the mortgage portfolio. So we're looking there at 35 basis points now, in terms of 90-day delinquencies on that particular portfolio, which remains really very low overall in terms of delinquencies. And if you look at the overall, sort of part of our business, and you want to look at some of the metrics of that particular business, new loans that we're writing at the moment we'd have a loan-to-valuation ratio for new loans of around 69%. If you look at the portfolio as a whole, the loan-to-valuation ratios will be around sort of 46% and that's at market values when the loan was actually taken out, so the value at the time. If you look at it relative to the market value, as we see them potentially now, a conservative approach to that would be down to about 35%. So the business is in overall good shape. Our averages of course distort things, so if you look at the percentage of loans that are 90% or more in loan-to-valuation ratio, you're looking at 2%. Obviously, if you look at that 35, there's certain selected postal codes that we look at and the highest one would, what, around 180 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just make a couple of comments. I mean New South Wales is clearly the state where delinquencies are on average higher and have increased, but when we really drill down into the post codes where there are delinquencies that are higher, I mean, our top 10 suburbs of post codes have average delinquencies somewhere between about 140 basis points and about 300 basis points, but in that -- those 10 suburbs, the total number of properties that are delinquent is 80; that's 80 houses where the mortgage is delinquent. So, I guess what we're trying to call out is that the trends are higher, but it's really effecting a very small part of the overall portfolio and that's why we still feel comfortable about the quality of that consumer book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think they might end up being a little bit higher still, because to get to the second part of your question, because we're in a rising interest rate environment, or we have been in a rising interest rate environment and some of those effects are yet to play their way through for customers. So in those particular postal areas where there's a little bit more stress, those delinquency rates may go a little higher. A delinquency doesn't though necessarily translate to loss and that's part of the point that I was trying to make with regard to the overall, and looking at the loan-to-valuation ratios.</p>
          <p>With regard to growth slowing as a whole, again, I think it connects to the interest rate rises that we've had. Clearly, the economy is beginning to slow; you can see that in a number of sectors and consumer sales in particular. And we're beginning to see that in housing, credit growth; you would have seen the recent data that came out just yesterday. And it would show that housing credit growth annualized just at the moment would be more at these 10% level, than it was year or so ago when it was at the sort of 13% level. So housing growth is slowing and business credit growth is slowing as well. And we've seen that too. And we expect that to continue into the second half, but with regard to the institutional business. Phil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I think, the source -- we've had very strong growth in corporate institutional lending now for two years. But particularly over the last six or nine months, much more of that has come from re-intermediation back into the main Australian banks' balance sheets of funding that had previously been sourced from capital market securitization from offshore. So it's very hard for us to be able to distinguish what constitutes aggregate credit growth as opposed to what we're booking on our balance sheets that's not otherwise being financed. We suspect that that process will pretty much see itself through in the current half. And that what we will see is that the underlying demand for credit is actually a lot weaker than the numbers we're reporting. And therefore as the -- as we get towards the end of this half and into next year, we expect that we'll be back to much more moderate rates of growth in credit for the corporate institutional sector, but we are still in the middle of the process of that shift away from the capital markets and some of the offshore banks back on to the Australian banks' balance sheets.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andrew. It's Jeff Emmanuel from UBS. I've got two questions, one for Phil, but maybe with your comments on the retail bank, I think in the observations on distribution slide 32 you made some observations, just maybe a broader question on where you're at with a review of the retail business. I think you mentioned some sub-par systems and perhaps some more work there in terms of brands. So just perhaps a bit of an update there and then a second question for Phil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Look, clearly we've got a wonderful franchise, that's the first point to make, just a very strong customer base, within Westpac and a very strong brand within Westpac and an excellent footprint, so an extensive footprint within Westpac, although I think there's more we can do with actually the shape and configuration of the footprint as well.</p>
          <p>But my observations are that from a front end point of view, distribution being at the end of the chain. So the business is being run very much from a product-centric point of view. The segmentation approach within our retail business has been quite limited to date. So product centric, quite limited segmentation, and distribution has, as I mentioned earlier, being uninvested in and actually undervalued. So part of our strategy going forward will be to put a lot more weight, power and clout, and authority into our distribution business, really driving much stronger local and power businesses and that means putting additional people, building additional capability, putting in additional tools, putting in additional metrics. Right now our branches, for example, don't have a complete picture of their business in terms of the assets they have and the liabilities that they have. So it makes it quite hard to drive a deposit strategy in terms of encouraging and incentivizing balanced growth in transaction accounts of, if the people at the front line simply don't have that. But wonderful people, so all the right ingredients, just the obvious and sort of quite simple things, simple to say and not so simple to do, of course, that need to be put in place in order to really get that franchise firing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So my question's on disclosure. You've taken 184 mill for two corporate loans that have gone bad. So just perhaps some more detail on what industry they're in, if nothing else. I guess, I understand customer confidentiality, but if someone is not paying you, I guess, that goes out the door.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not quite. As long as we believe that there's a customer relationship that's being involved in the facility, then we think that the promise of client confidentiality holds sway. And that's why we're not into telling people about specific exposures and specific names, or even kind of leading you to the point where you say, I know that must be XYZ. Where that client confidentiality changes is when the client goes from the relationship into your dealing with an administrator or receiver or something like that. Than I think that the situation changes and we're able to give you that information and we will do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you've provided $184 million and that's close to 4% of profit pre-tax. I guess, I'm just surprised you can't tell us any more.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Phil. I am James Freeman, Goldman Sachs JB Were. I just want to get a bit of an explanation around the funding requirements for '09? You're saying it's 20 to 25 billion; I mean that seems to be a little bit less than this year. Is that implying a significant slowdown in lending growth or are we shortening the book? I'm just wondering how we actually get a lower term debt requirement next year, if we do actually have growth in the book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I made those comments because I think that there's been some speculation that everybody has been borrowing out for an '09 maturity and that's all going to scroll in and then you're going to have this quite big bubble of funding needs. And I wanted to explain through the data and through my comments that we don't see that as a risk for us. As Gail mentioned in terms of loan growth and Phil just talked about, we do expect a reduction in loan growth next year compared to this year and so that feeds into that overall funding requirement, but it's a combination of that, it's a combination of how much we expect to raise through our own deposit gathering and out of the wholesale markets. It's not a result of going shorter. We basically think our term funding needs to keep a certain profile to it and so it's a combination of all those things to that, but I wanted to give people some clarity as to what we expected to raise in '09 to deal with that concern around that '09 maturity bubble.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So does this have a lot of retail deposit growth factored in there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking about the wholesale markets here anyway, and it doesn't have any more retail deposit growth than what we've achieved this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ross Brown from Deutsche Bank. You've obviously had a great outcome from Basel II, but at the same time, all the capital targets seem to have gone out of the window. And it looks like, from overseas at least, the new Basel II Tier 1 benchmark is 8%. Is that now your own sort of benchmark going forward? You want to be above the 8% Tier 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's 8%, Ross. I mean I think, in fact, wasn't it a weighting of the day that got them up to 7? I mean it feels to me that the Tier 1 in the capital -- we deliberately kept clear of calling out what the target ranges are, because we've got some more work to do in discussion with ACRA around that. And I think when we kind of get through that &#x2013; and they've wanted to see the whole industry's different ICAP statements and to draw conclusions from that and then to tell us basically a prudential capital ratio that they want us to operate with as a minimum. And when we've got that, I think we'll be much clearer in terms of what we need to keep as a buffer above that, and the kind of target ranges that we would have.</p>
          <p>But I did want to call out that target ranges are ranges, and they're kind of built around an expected market activity and market conditions, and we're in some pretty uncertain times at the moment. And certainly my conversation with investors is that they support the idea of running higher capital ratios, and that's what we're doing.</p>

          <p>Thanks. It's Matt Davison, Merrill Lynch. Question for Gail on, I guess the deposit growth performance the past six months.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the strong sort of industry backdrop in terms of deposit growth, but looking at the BFS division, deposits were flat, and looking at consumer, all the growth was in TD. So I'm just wondering, do you I guess perceive that as more of a reflection of playing a margin game recently, or is it more a reflection of changes needed in terms of systems and the sales process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I would have to say, and there's some detail there that perhaps needs to be clarified. I think Peter Hanlon might have a fit unless we clarify that. So I'll make sure that we do. But with regard to the BFS components, some of it gets caught up and I'll see if there's numbers for reasons of the way in which it's aggregated. So the BFS performance is actually much stronger than it would appear in the data.</p>
          <p>But I would have to say I'm quite disappointed with our performance with regard to deposit growth. And it's not something you turn around in an instant. But it's certainly something that we do intend to focus on. And so there's a fair bit of focus that we're already putting into that. In fact, Peter Hanlon through this task group that I called out earlier, is leading a sort of multi-disciplinary approach to try and -- across the division, across the group, put additional focus on deposit raising and we certainly need to become a better at that. I've already mentioned with regard to our retail distribution system, we tend to measure the wrong thing. We tend to measure accounts opened rather than actual balance growth. So there's some simple things we need to put in place there, in order to drive a greater level of response. But it has been disappointing for me. Peter, do you want to mention the deposits growth in business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, thanks. I think the issue here is just one of the way we organize by business units. We don't have certain specific products for business-like term deposits. So we don't have a business term deposit or a consumer term deposit. We just have term deposits. So what we've seen obviously with increasing interest rates is a flow of deposits into term deposit, sorry, and we obviously capture that in our consumer business. So when we add the two together, it's a slightly better picture more broadly. But I would echo Gail's point, which is we're actually dissatisfied across the group with our deposit growth and that's been a particular focus since the beginning of this calendar year, and in the latter months of the half and certainly through April, the results have been much more encouraging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just tell you a quick sort of anecdote on that. Peter and I were in a lunch in Melbourne a little while ago with our business customers; there were about 25 in the room and we got talking about &#x2013; I got talking about deposits. And it was at the really tough, tough days, sort of eight weeks ago of funding and got to talk about the importance of deposit gathering and I asked these customers, if you have any deposits out there that don't think are working hard enough for you, we'd love to have your deposits. And it was, and Peter stood up and did exactly same thing and by the end of the lunch we'd raised some 200 million, which was a really nice way to have a lunch, but the fascinating thing was a number of the customers said to us, we didn't know you wanted it. So we've often positioned ourselves as a lender, we think about -- and our staff, we often think about what they do as supporting the asset side of the balance sheet. So there's some cultural mindset and signal things that we have work on as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. So just to go back to the capital issue, can you give us an idea, I guess, a bit more clarity around your comments about hybrid capital and the capacity you have there. And then perhaps within that, some context around your expectations on the impact of introducing interest rate risk on 1st of July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So just to start in the second bit first, Tom, so we expect to introduce interest rate risk in the banking book there's a new Basel measure that's about 12 to 13 basis points of capital ratio when it comes on to the books. With regard to the hybrid comment; one of the things we did in the last six months is we actually redeemed our first issue. That and the growth in the book basically means that we've got quite a lot of scope to issue non-innovative hybrid capital and that's something that we think in the right market is a good instrument to issue. And clearly it has a positive impact for earnings per share and it's something that rather than issuing ordinary equity, and so it's something that we will look to do. But it's around, when's the right time to do it. What's the cost that you kind of lock in for five years plus for that instrument and then how best do you kind of match it up against your other capital components? And so I wanted to flag to the growth that that's on our capital management strategy at the moment; we don't have anything that we're announcing today, but it's something that we've got being thought through.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, JPMorgan. I had a question for Phil and one for Curt Zuber, if I may. Phil, just going back to Craig's question on slide 16, on the risk weighted capital -- the risk weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Today, you're flagging that the credit environment will probably get worse rather than better. And we know that under IFRS it's very much about where it is at a point of time. And I know that effort goes through just a few things. But could you run us through what happens to these risk weightings, if we do in fact hit into an environment that's somewhat tougher as far as asset quality &#x2013; do the risk weighted assets increase again as the probability of default and the loss of Basel II actually goes up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the outlook is that risk weighted assets will grow -- will actually grow over and above the growth in the balance sheet assets, just by virtue of the expectation that the credit...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not so much expectation, but as your portfolio is re-graded. Let's say that overall, the credit environment moves to a point where there is a general change in your risk rating, then that risk rate will then feed through into the risk rated asset calculation, regardless of whether there was any loan growth at all, and that will then lead to -- as risk rated assets go up and your capital ratio will go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we're sitting down next to talk about capital, we're going to have some new charges coming through for interest rate risk, presumably for this general deterioration in the credit environment? After you've been writing some stuff about duration risk recently, do you see any more charges that they could hit you with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We called out there's a few areas that they're looking at, and it's not just output, I think globally regulators are looking at how funding is the competition of funding, the use of utilization vehicles, use of conduits et cetera. So we don't have anything specifically that we're talking to them about, but I would think whether it's six or 12 or 18 months down the track, regulators will look at that. And thinking about, well how do they shape the financial institutions in their area to take some of this risk that we've seen in the last six months. And I think that might be through a capital impost or it might be through more prescriptive requirements around your funding. And I don't know the answer to that yet Brian, but I certainly think it will be part of the industry at some point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And question for Curt, who I assume is in the room. If we have to look at slide 23, oh he's obviously out busy raising money. But if we have to look at slide 23, given a lot of detail in the duration of the funding, but the one thing that seems to be mysteriously missing is the duration of the term funding. Could we get a feeling on where that duration of all the stuff over one year is, the average duration? And perhaps more importantly, where it was six months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a graph in there Brian. In the IDP, which shows all our term maturities beyond one year. So I don't have the exact calculation, but that's the actual maturities beyond one year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it lengthened or -- just the term bit, Curt, is it lengthened or shortened over the last six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably shortened a little bit. So we call that as 2.8 years is the average duration of the 25 billion that we've done. That on average, is probably a little bit shorter than what we've seen in the past, but not significantly. Last year, we didn't do as much, so it was very much a short -- a lower year for us. If you look at the last three years, our duration's averaged just above three years on an average year. So a little bit, but I don't think it's been as much as probably some people have considered, and that's why we wanted to point that out. And that's part of the reason why that next year we thought it was important to give people a highlight that on our plans at the moment, we're only looking at 20 to 25. So there isn't a significant amount of, I guess, a bubble that we're looking for in the '09 year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Curt, also could you give us a feeling on the '08 funding plan? Where is the wholesale money coming from? Could you break it up between public and private markets and by geography?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about two-thirds private, one-third public. That was in the first half. So the last three deals that we've done in April have been all public, so that's come a little bit back towards public, and it's been well diversified. So we feed just about every about market, we feed Japan, U.S., Europe, long, short, fixed, floating, retail focused, institutional focused. So I think it's been more the diversification that's a feature of the funding spent.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brett Le Mesurier, Wilson HTM. Gail, you talked about some of your early impressions a little while ago. Could you talk about your impressions of the risk return profile you see in the institutional business and how that compares to the consumer business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, I think what Phil has done over the last little while is obviously, as we've had very, very, very significant demand for additional credit, Phil has been very thoughtful with regard to the quality that he's brining on Board and the pricing in the context of the increased cost of funds. So Phil and his team have been very disciplined on that. And that's why you see in our margin numbers a very, very tiny decline in margin that's actually attributed to the lending that's gone on in the institutional business. So what I see is incredible discipline. I mean, it is the most experienced set of people that we have within our institutional business. They really understand risk and return, second to none. And as they've had increasing demand from corporate and others who can't access capital markets and customers wanting to return to banks for their funding, so our team has really being very rigorous in terms of what's the business they bring on and at what price do they bring it on, and you can see that reflected it in the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you see that there should be a change in the focus of the business more towards the upper end or the lower end relative to how it's position, if you can give your views on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the position of -- the business is positioned particularly well at the moment. It's pretty diversified across a range of industries and segments. It is the number one leading position. We have a shot at almost any element of business that we want within the Australian marketplace. It's got very strong capabilities; in the payment space, we'd like to deepen and strengthen that even further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the relative returns on that business compared to consumer &#x2013; consumer's got an ROE well into the 30s and that business has been falling and down to 13 in the last six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, they're different businesses. And however, we have some benchmarks that we use for pricing, risk return across the whole group. And we're quite rigorous and disciplined in those, but they're different businesses. You don't look at the dollar of business that you bring in through the consumer part of the business in exactly the same lens as we do in the institutional and there's different collateral and additional business that each one brings in. I mean, one of the key focuses for Phil when he brings in business, is not just the actual lending element of the business; it's very significantly all the other elements of the business that actually comes in with that. The payment elements, the transactional elements, the hedging elements, et cetera. So it's a different lens overall.</p>

          <p>It's <mark type="inaudible" /> from Credit Susie. I've got a question on the revenue side and a question on the expenses, if I may. On the revenue side, and the subject is mortgage insurance, in your previous role, mortgage insurance was a material contributor to profits, of course, in George Bank. Westpac is very large in the mortgage space, and yet in terms of this level of activity here, it's immaterial. But would there be any plans going forward to have a substantial lift in having an LMI business that could be material in the context of revenue profit generation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is he stopping? It's actually not an area I've spent a lot of time on in my first three months within Westpac. It's not one that I've spent a lot of time on. And, I mean, Rob, I don't know if you'd like to comment on that at all. But from my own personal point of view it's not something I've come in and said, wow, let's have a look at the mortgage insurance business and let's see what additionally we can do there. I mean one reason for that maybe A) a lot on my agenda early on, the environment to deal with, and getting to grips with the bigger piece of strategic agenda, and secondly, the markets we're in right now, which means that no returns in investment markets have been somewhat diminished anyway. Do you want to say anything? No, nothing in particular?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A just very quick one on expenses. The subject is offshore in particular; we know that BT has gone down this path in the last couple of years and it's something that many of the banks are looking at, would this be one core avenue in terms of your cost focus going forward for the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we do have a number of, as you say, partnering arrangements with a number of different bodies. With regard to off shoring, my whole philosophy is one of partnering with people who best practice what they do, so what do we want to be best practicing within Westpac? We want to be best practice within distribution, within credit management, within sales management, within brand management, marketing management. So everything to do with the customer experience, everything to do with the risk and management of our balance sheet and our position. If there are other players out there who do a better job and that is their business to do operations and IT, and systems, and so on, well, we will look at that. With regards to the announcement that was in all the commentary that was in today's Sydney Morning Herald, and the numbers that they put in there, I mean those are not -- I haven't seen any piece of paper with that kind of number, with that kind of timeframe at all. But will we be increasing our off shoring? Absolutely. Will we be doing it in a careful and thoughtful and moderated way? Absolutely. Will we look after our people while we're doing it? Absolutely.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gail. Well done on the result. I was just wondering, as the new leader of Westpac, given your PE is a little ahead of the peer group, are you actually happy with the organic footprint that Westpac has in Australia, particularly in retail banking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Look, I think there's certainly more that we can do with regard to our footprint in the retail banking, certainly Queensland and Western Australia are areas that we previously called out as part of our strategic agenda, and there's certainly more that we can do there. So there's more in terms of actual physical footprint and then there's more in terms of what we do with the footprint that we have. So it's going to be a discussion point for us internally, I suspect, about it's the first port of call to upgrade, up-weight, and change the model with regard to the distribution footprint we already have. Or is it going to be to go out and actually put in an additional footprint. Maybe it's going to be a bit of both. But your observation is right. There's certainly more that we'd like to achieve with regard to coverage. But there's also more we'd like to do with what we have. In the business banking, we have been increasing our footprint, both in a physical sense and with regard to people. I think over the last period, we put in another eight business banking centers, upgraded two further, and we put in, over the course of the past year, over 400 additional business bankers. So we're ahead of the curve there, that's been a called out strategic priority of the group for some time. It's certainly one that I back.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wondered where you were going with this question actually, Mike. Look I love brands actually, I think brands are such a powerful set of tools in your arsenal. So I love brands. But I think that decision was made for the right reasons at the right time. And it's not the sort of thing that one would reverse.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff Emmanuel from UBS again. So, hopefully a question you'll answer for me. Phil, on slide 25, you've got 87 bps coming off Tier 1 for business application usage. And if you look at your risk rated asset growth, it was up 10% over the half. So, I would have thought that it was up about 60 bps. So just a feel for the difference and I suppose just a better handle for us for the next half. What you're expecting there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it goes a bit to what Brian was talking about, in terms of when you change the risk components in your portfolio, you will also lead to a calculation that leads to higher risk-rated asset growth. And so -- and particularly when you go and your loans go into impaireds, the scale-up factor on risk-rated assets gets to multiples of what the underlying exposure is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that was the 30 bps...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's a lot more than the impaireds, but it's the broad base change in the risk profile in the book that leads to that addition over and above the loan growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess what I'm getting at is the environment is getting tougher, not better, so in the second half, do you potentially have 30 bps plus coming off your Tier 1 before anything else changes on asset growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that would be -- I'm not thinking about it that way in terms of saying, well I have to assume that my portfolio was going to downgrade by 30 bps worth of capital every time for every half. To give you an idea, I think I'm right and I'll just double-check with somebody, but I think -- and I think I invented this so I'll pinch the measure, which was 25% of your portfolio downgraded by one notch, what's that equivalent to? In our numbers, I think it's 80 million, just to give you a sense of kind of how much impact that would be on our capital ratios.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="16">
