          <p>Thank you, Edward.  Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.  Welcome to Teva's third quarter 2008 earnings call.  We hope you had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning.  A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com.  Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call that is also available on our website.</p>
          <p>Today, we are joined by Shlomo Yanai, President and CEO; Eyal Desheh, Chief Financial Officer; Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva North America; and Moshe Manor, Group Vice President of Global Innovative Resources.  Shlomo and Eyal will begin by providing an overview of our results.  We will then open the call for question and answer period.</p>
          <p>Before turning the call over to Shlomo, I would like to remind everyone that Teva's results reported this quarter are adjusted to exclude certain items relating to our ARS [Auction Rate Security] portfolio and acquisition related expenses.  Eyal will provide additional detail on this in his prepared comments.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call and webcast.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Elana.  Welcome, everyone.  Good morning America and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased to report that Q3 was a very good quarter for Teva.  I believe that in many key ways our performance and accomplishments this quarter exemplify the enduring strength of our business and bring Teva's uniqueness into very sharp focus.  In the midst of the ongoing turbulence, sorry, in the market we remained steadily on course with solid financial results and significant strategic achievements in Q3.</p>
          <p>Teva's net sales in Q3 reached a record $2.8 billion, which represents 20% growth year-over-year.  Net income was $599 million up 14% from Q3 '07 and this ultimately brought us to diluted EPS of $0.72.  In addition, and even more important these days, our cash flow from operations was $710 million more than double our cash flow in Q3 '07.</p>
          <p>We experienced once again in Q3 the benefit of Teva's balanced business model, which &#x2013; with robust sales of our generic products particularly in the US and in our International market Copaxone continued global leadership of the MS market, the rapid growth of Azilect and excellent sales of our Pro-Air inhalers, all combining to yield very good results.</p>
          <p>It was an excellent quarter for Teva USA, where despite the loss of exclusivity on risperidone, we enjoyed we enjoyed strong sales of our generics products.  Sales were driven by our launch of lamotrigine and continued strong sales of bupropion and amlodipine benazepril.  We had a record number of launches in Q3, which has brought our total through the end of this third quarter to 26 launches, driving our total prescriptions for the 12 months period to 467 million.  This is an increase of approximately 36 million prescriptions, nearly twice as many as our closest competitor, compared to the same 12 months period a year ago.</p>
          <p>Outside the US, in Europe sales were up 10% over Q3 '07 with the strongest performance coming from France, Spain and Poland.  Overall, however, we felt the impact of changing market conditions throughout Europe, and particularly in the UK and Italy, where we're seeing a more competitive pricing environment.</p>
          <p>We expect our large number of planned launches due next quarter, to positively impact sales.  And I would like to mention, that despite the current challenges in Europe, we are very optimistic about the future of our European business.  Especially in times like this, when governments must find ways to cut spending and especially markets like those of Southern Europe where generic penetration is low, we believe there will be many opportunities for growth in Europe.</p>
          <p>This was an excellent quarter for our international business, which increased sales by 31%, over Q3 '07 supported by especially strong results in Latin America, Russia and Israel.</p>
          <p>Turning to our global respiratory business, the most dramatic development occurred in the US where the conversion from CFC to HFA based inhalers continued to accelerate.  By the end of the third quarter 80% of the market had switched with Teva's Pro-Air capturing 66 of the switchers.  Pro-Air continues to increase its leadership of the HFA market with 59% market share in Q3, growing into 61% by the end of October.  We are pleased that the long awaited conversion is finally nearing completion making us very optimistic about Pro-Air's continued strong performance in the fourth quarter.  To remind all our listeners by the end of the year it will no longer be legal to sell CFC based products in the US and 100% of the market will have converted to HFA.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Teva's innovative business it was a very good quarter for Copaxone both in the US and globally.  Global in-market sales of Copaxone grew to $562 million representing 28% growth over the third quarter of 2007.  In the US in-market sales increased by 25%, and outside the US in-market sales increased by 31%.  Copaxone remains the global leader among all treatments for multiple sclerosis for the first nine months of 2008.  And we expect it to remain the leading therapy for MS and to continue to grow.</p>
          <p>This was also an exciting quarter for Teva's second innovative product Azilect.  Sales of which grew 78% over Q3 '07.  As you will recall, Azilect met all three of the endpoints of the ADAGIO study which was designed to test Azilect's efficacy in slowing the progression of Parkinson's Disease, one of the most critical unmet needs in the treatment of Parkinson's patients.</p>
          <p>In addition, earlier this week we announced the results of the Tiromel study which could lead to Azilect's label being modified and allow it to be more broadly prescribed.  We are working intensively to prepare the submissions of the very promising results of the ADAGIO and Tiromel studies to the FDA and expect strong growth from Azilect in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>As we look towards the future we have much to be excited about.  I would like to share with you some of the highlights of the excellent progress we've made recently towards realizing our long-term strategic goals.</p>
          <p>At the end of Q3, we announced a new strategic partnership with the Kowa Company to create a leading generic pharmaceutical company in Japan, enabling us to further expand our geographic reach and strengthen our global leadership.  As you know, Japan is world's second largest pharmaceutical market and the Japanese government has a made a serious commitment to significantly increase the use of generics.  Their goal is in fact to double the country's usage of generic products by 2012.  And by the way in my recent trip to Japan has made me even more enthusiastic about the opportunities there for generics and especially for Teva.</p>
          <p>I believe that Teva's knowledge and experience as the global generic leader coupled with our reputation for outstanding quality make our brand particularly attractive to the Japanese market.  The combination of Teva and Kowa, a company with deep understanding of the Japanese market, will be a winning one.  We announced that we expect our new company, Teva-Kowa, to begin operations in 2009 and by 2015 to reach sales of $1 billion.  I am very confident that we will reach our targets even earlier.</p>
          <p>We also completed our acquisition of Bentley in Spain during the third quarter.  I am pleased to report that the integration of Bentley into Teva is going very smoothly and we are excited about opportunities for growth in this important market.  And of course we have been moving quickly in preparing for the Barr integration and, to the extent permitted by law, working with our future colleagues at Barr to ensure a smooth and successful integration.</p>
          <p>We are extremely excited about the tremendous value that will be created by the combination.  This is a deal that will significantly enhance our market leadership in the US, strengthen our presence in key global markets and expand our product portfolio and pipeline.  In short this is a deal that will enable us to separate ourselves even further from the pack while generating substantial cost synergies and revenue upside.  As we recently announced we have now secured sufficient funding commitments to complete the acquisition.  We are on tracking our submissions to the regulatory authorities in the US, Europe and in other countries and expect to receive the necessary approvals and close the deal by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>As you can see, Q3 was an intensive, exciting and productive quarter for us.  And before I turn the call over to Eyal, I would like to say a few words about the current global economic conditions as they relate to Teva.</p>
          <p>Throughout Teva's history, we've always focused on maintaining our financial strength responsibly avoiding the temptation to take unnecessary risks.  As a result, Teva today is in a very strong position financially despite the turmoil in the global economy.  We are in equally strong position when it comes to the fundamentals of our business, thanks to our clearly defined strategy in which generics remain at the core of our balanced business model.</p>
          <p>I believe that the financial crisis will create an even more urgent need for high quality generics as government, payers and patients around the world face increased financial pressure.  As the rapidly changing global economy creates more opportunities for generics, Teva will be there and will be uniquely well positioned to serve them and to continue to increase our market share.  Our strong position will not however make us complacent.  We are constantly monitoring the changes in the markets and assessing their potential impact on our business, and I believe that our focus on agility is allowing us to respond quickly and well to events as they unfold.</p>
          <p>All in all, as we look ahead to both the near and long-term future, we feel very optimistic.  You will recall that last quarter we provided guidance in the range of $2.69 to $2.75.  As Elana mentioned earlier, we have adjusted our results to exclude certain items.  Taking these adjustments into account, the guidance we provided last quarter, would now translate to a range of $2.77 to $2.83.  Eyal will provide additional detail about these adjustments in just a moment.  Based on our strong performance during the first three quarters and our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008, we're changing EPS guidance to a higher range of $2.79 to $2.85.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and now I will turn the call over to Eyal.  Eyal?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Shlomo and good day to everyone.  I hope you had an opportunity to review the press release we issued earlier this morning.  This was another strong quarter for Teva and I would like to review with you the results in detail.</p>
          <p>As Shlomo mentioned, we had another quarter of record revenues, with more than $2.8 billion an increase of 20% or approximately $436 million compared to Q3 last year.  Before I delve into the numbers I would like to note briefly, that we're once again presenting adjusted results for the quarter and the first nine months of 2008.</p>
          <p>For Q3 2008, we excluded the following items from our GAAP results.  On the negative side, excluded $33 million of charges related to the acquisition of Bentley and $26 million related to the impairment of financial assets.  On the positive side, we excluded the $100 million strategic settlement payment in connection with our Auction Rate Security portfolio.</p>
          <p>Similarly, for the nine months period, we excluded acquisition related charges and charges related to impairment of our ARS portfolio, which were not adjusted in Q1 and Q2.  As we've told you before, we present adjusted figures to show you how we as management, and our board look at our financial result and we do so even when such adjustment result in more conservative figures than our GAAP results, which is the case this time.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income was $637 million an increase of 21%, from last year, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.77, a 20% increase from last year.  Adjusted net income grew by 14% to $599 million and adjusted EPS was up 13%, to second best $0.72.  For the first nine months of 2008, total sales grew by 21%, to $8.24 billion.  Adjusted net income grew 26%, to $1.74 billion and adjusted EPS was up 24% to $2.1.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange differences again played a major roll this quarter, impacting sales and operating profit as well as our balance sheet.  Compared to Q3 2007, about $92 million were due &#x2013; in sales were due to foreign exchange differences as sales benefited from a weaker US dollar relative to most currency primarily the euro, the Israeli shekel and the Hungarian forint.  At the same time foreign currencies had an $18 million adverse impact on operating income, primarily resulting from the relative strength of the Israeli shekel compared to most currencies and the weakness of the British pound.</p>
          <p>Looking forward from here, changes in the weight of the US dollar against Teva's other currencies compared to the Q3 level could have an impact on sales and on operating profit in both directions.</p>
          <p>As in previous quarters, taking over the distribution activities of Copaxone from Sanofi-aventis in North America also positively affected revenues contributing about $166 million to sales growth.  The remaining $218 million in sales growth were attributable to organic growth.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceutical sales in North America grew to $1.6 billion or 23% over the third quarter last year.  Generic sales in the US topped $1 billion this quarter up 12% compared to the comparable quarter last year.  Pharmaceuticals sales in Europe which includes the sales since August of the recently acquired business of Bentley in Spain grew 10% to $865 million and represented 25% of total pharmaceutical sales.  European generics, in dollar terms grew approximately 8%, while the local currency sales were flat compared to Q3 last year.  International pharmaceutical sales totaled $395 million growing 32% of Q3 last year.  This growth rate is higher than the group average mainly due to strong sales across Latin America as well as in Russia and Israel.</p>
          <p>Copaxone has another excellent quarter, global in-market sales totaled $562 million, matching last quarter's record sales.  This is a 28% increase over the comparable quarter for the world's leading MS treatment.</p>
          <p>Our global respiratory business which is included in the North America, European and International sales figure had sales of $177 million essentially flat compared to Q3 2007 but up 5% compared to Q2 2008 as sales of HFA products in the U.S. began to accelerate.</p>
          <p>Now, let me review the rest of our adjusted P&amp;L results.  Gross profit margin on an adjusted basis which excludes the $5 million of inventory step up recorded in connection with the Bentley acquisition was 52.7% in the reported quarter compared to 52.8% in the comparable quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>The positive contribution Copaxone had on gross margin was offset by two main factors.  First, the adverse effect of currencies, primarily the decline of the British pound compared to the US dollar which hurt our results in the UK as well as the strengthening of the Israeli shekel against all currencies and second our product mix.</p>
          <p>Net R&amp;D expenses increased quarter-over-quarter by 38% to $194 million or 6.8% of total sales.  As previously indicated this increased investment is a direct reflection of the increased effort particularly in the generic and biogeneric R&amp;D and is consistent with our strategic goal to double R&amp;D output by 2012.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A which reached $648 million in the quarter represented 23% of sales compared with 19% in Q3, 2007.  The higher SG&amp;A is in line with our plan and resulted primarily from the termination of our distribution agreement with Sanofi-aventis regarding Copaxone in North America as of March 31, 2008.  The net impact of the termination of the distribution agreement to SG&amp;A totaled $171 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating profit, this quarter amounted to $655 million compared to operating profit of $651 million in Q3, 2007.  As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 23.1% or 4.4% lower than the comparable quarter in fiscal 2007.  Similar to the trend we witnessed in the previous quarter, 1.6% of the difference was attributable to the termination of our distribution agreement with Sanofi-aventis in North America, 1.4% to foreign exchange impact and 1.3% to higher R&amp;D spending and product mix.</p>
          <p>We recorded $63 billion of financial income in our Q3 2008 GAAP results compared with $3 million of financial expenses in the comparable quarter of 2007.  This amount included $19 million charge against our portfolio of auction rate securities.  As in the past two quarters this charge were calculated based on an internally developed model, which evaluated every single security in the portfolio.  The principle amount of our ARS portfolio is $440 million, whereas the net amount of this portfolio as of September 30, 2008 stands at $261 million.  The September 30 balance is after giving effect to a cumulative total $96 million of P&amp;L charges and a cumulative total of $83 million provided in our balance sheet under other comprehensive income.</p>
          <p>We also recorded this quarter a $7 million charges resulting from a failure of a certain financial institution.  These charges were offset this quarter by a $100 million cash payment we received as a settlement from an institution which acted as a broker in our auction rate security portfolio.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we updated our estimated annual tax rate for the whole year of 2008 to 11% of adjusted pre-tax income.  Therefore, our provision for income tax for the third quarter is $47 million, or 7% of adjusted pre-tax income.  The reduction in effective rate from 17% in 2007, to 11% expected in 2008, reflects mainly product launches as well as expected launches in the US generic market during 2008, which to a large extent was developed and produced in Israel.  However, as we've previously indicated, we are not in a position at this point to assure you that this rate is final for the year or sustainable for the future.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our cash flow.  We had another strong quarter in cash generated from operating amounting to $710 million, more than double compared to Q3 last year.  Our free cash flow after capital expenditure of $170 million net and dividend of approximately $97 million amounted to $443 million almost three time Q3 last year's number.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was used primarily to pay for Bentley acquisition and to reduce debt obligation by approximately $90 million.  DSO, days sales outstanding, amounted to 55 days this quarter down from 61 days in Q3 2007.  We have calculated DSO as you always do after netting out from the receivables the sales reserve and allowances, the so-called SR&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Inventory days were 195 days, up from 192 days in June.  We increased inventory levels earlier this year in order to improve service levels to our customers.  The total SR&amp;A at September 30, 2008 amounted to $2.2 billion, an increase of $133 million from June 2008.  About 93% of the total reserves are from the United State up $169 from June 2008, most notably due to provisions for charge back for new product.</p>
          <p>Growth capital expenditure reached $178 million this quarter essentially flat compared to 180 million in Q2 this year.  We expect CapEx to exceed $700 million for the full year, mainly reflecting previously discussed plant capacity expansion to support our strategic growth plan.</p>
          <p>As to our debt $3.9 billion or 83% of our total interest bearing debt at September 30 is long-term debt of which $1.9 billion is in our convertible debenture and $2 billion is in straight, fixed or floating interest debt.  Our leverage, measured debt-to-debt plus equity, at September 30, 2008 stood at 24%, unchanged from the end of June.</p>
          <p>Shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2008 reached $14.8 billion, shareholders' equity is up $1.1 billion from the end of 2007, but down a net $232 million from June 30.  Shareholders' equity was adversely affected by $866 million, further decreased in global net assets, due to exchange rate differences, primarily the strengthening of the US dollar towards the end of quarter, compared to most currencies which took place at the end of September.  As a result of Teva's acquisition of IVAX, Teva holds significant intangible assets and goodwill in currencies other than the US dollar.</p>
          <p>It should be noted, that in the past two years Teva recorded positive currency translation differences, which increased our shareholders' equity level by about $2 billion.  And the current decrease reflects the reverse in non-US dollar currency movement against the US dollar.  In the nine months period, the decline in shareholders' equity due to currency is much smaller, $132 million only.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that when calculating our sales, the exchange rate used is a quarterly average.  But on shareholders' equity the relevant exchange rate is that recorded at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the convenience of our audience, I would once again like to mention three figures relating to our share count so that we're all on the same page.  For the third quarter 2008, our average share count, for purpose of calculating fully diluted earnings per share was 837 million shares.  The share count at the end of the quarter for the purpose of calculating fully diluted EPS going forward is 838 million shares, while the share count for calculating our market cap is approximately 784 million shares.</p>
          <p>Dividend.  Yesterday Teva's board approved third quarter dividend amounting to approximately $97 million.  On a per share basis, our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekels remains 0.45 shekels.  Based on the rate of exchange on November 5, 2008, of the shekel to the US dollar, this translates into approximately $0.12 per share.</p>
          <p>Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to repeat guidance which Shlomo shared with you on this call.  Last quarter we provided guidance in the range of $2.69 to $2.75.  As I mentioned before, we've adjusted our results to exclude certain items.  Most importantly these adjustments exclude the impact of auction rate securities altogether, and results in an increase of our base guidance by $0.08 in order to make it apples-to-apples.  Taking this adjustment into account, the guidance we provided last quarter, would now translate to a range of $2.77 to $2.83.  Now based on our strong performance during the first three quarters, and our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008, we would like to update the earnings per share guidance for the year to a higher range of $2.79, to 2.85..</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your time and attention today.  And now I would like to open the call for questions and have your questions.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  First, just a quick clarification on the EPS guidance, the raise of the guidance to 2.79 to 2.85 includes or excludes those $0.08 that you've been excluding this quarter, that is, is the raise $0.10 versus the pro forma numbers or $0.02 versus your pro forma numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ronny.  We are, as you saw in our report our adjusted non-GAAP for the three quarters is $2.10, and it excludes the $100 million which we received as compensation and it excludes all the auction rate security write-offs for the year for Q1, 2 and the $26 million that were also recorded in Q3 and this are considered what you call the pro forma basis for our guidance which we believe is apples-to-apples with the guidance that we have provided so far.  In order to make the adjusted adjustments accurate on the guiding basis we took the write-off of the auction rate security in Q1 and Q2 which represent approximately $0.08 per shares, an increased the guidance by that amount to create a new base.  From that point on, we increased it by $0.02 as we look at the fourth quarter and that's where we believe the result will be</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That clarifies it, thank you.  And second question regarding the gross margin for the quarter, I understand the impact of currency, but it's your product mix that you mentioned a bit is puzzling, you sold $22.51 million more of branded product this quarter then the sequential quarter, the second quarter of this year and you launched Lamictal, which is obviously a high gross margin product, how does product mix then work against you this quarter?</p>

          <p>Hi, Ron, it's Shlomo.  First of all as you well know the margins are highly sensitive to the products that we are selling, so if there is no big launches that would definitely impact <mark type="inaudible" /> and this quarter there is no actually big ones like we usually have, that's one question &#x2013; that's one part of my answer and I would not take it by quarterly base, if you take in the yearly base that would average by the longest time.  Bill, would you like to add to that?  Bill?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think that, no I think that's correct.  In all, Ronny, we did have a great launch of lamotrigine, we are very happy about that.  We didn't get revenues from risperidone, so that plays into it as well as we lost the exclusivity there and there was of course certainly some charges when that happened and price fell.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks guys.  I guess on the Lamictal question, Bill, was there anything going on with GSK during the launch that maybe clipped pricing, understanding there was no authorized, but maybe you if you could give us a little bit color on how that launch proceeded?</p>
          <p>And then I'm wondering on Pulmicort, if you could give us an update on where the Citizen's Petition stands and if there's been any interaction with the agency.</p>
          <p>And then, just finally last question for Eyal on currency you downplayed it to a certain extent.  Looking forward you're going have about 4 billion in revenues we would gather combined with Barr out of Europe.  So if you could just talk a little bit more detail on how the currencies may impact what is becoming an increasing large line for you all?  Thanks guys.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ken.  With respect to lamotrigine, we have come to be accustomed to the fact that innovators will always try to do creative things to the market, whether they can launch an AG [approved generic] or whatever else they can do or try to launch their product with and use a DAW code in order to use that as a generic.  But GSK did try to do something like that in that market. It was largely unsuccessful and really didn't impact price all that much.  Remember lamotrigine is our own API [active pharmaceutical ingredient] so it is a relatively high margin product.  So I think that you know there was no real issue there.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you book the &#x2013; should we be assuming that Q4 has got lower Lamictal i.e. you booked more here than Q4?  Is that bad assumption?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know again, you're going to be phasing out of your exclusivity.  So one would think as we get towards the end of any exclusivity we'll be a little bit more careful about how much product we put into the pipeline so we do not get hit with adjustments that we don't want to have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Our planning regarding currency, we are not going to plan this at all.  Teva traditionally has a very balanced business model on many aspects that includes currencies.  Now, currencies today, predictability has become a little more complex than in the past but it was never easy to predict.  You can't take anything like this lightly.  We believe that our business model is pretty much immune.  What we have seen over the past two quarters is revenue going up and operating profits going down as a result of changes in currency.  This is rare, we haven't seen much of that in the past.  Hard to predict in the future, but I think the impact of currency on our profit which is the important part is fairly minimal and <mark type="inaudible" /> that in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the year, yes.  From the basis, from, the first and to remind you the first three quarters was $2.10.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so effectively we take that number, deduct just a little over $0.10 and that gives us the Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful and then the second question, the tax rate continues to go down, 11% now is the current full year view and you talked about the reason for that going down being some generic launches that appear to have happened.  Are there any launches factored in that haven't happened that are part of the reduction there in the full year tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our business and business model there are always things that happen and things that don't happen.  But the average is the average.  A lot of our generic products in the US and in Europe and the international are based on the Israeli API and manufacturing, we have deferred tax environment in here and a lot of the profit goes back to where the IP and where the production is originated.  As I said on my part before, we can't guarantee this going forward, it depends on product mix, the product mix is, things happen and things don't happen, it's a little difficult to predict.  It's not going to jump much higher in Q4, probably remain in this area or maybe a little higher, but very, very hard to be precise here.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A bigger picture question for Shlomo and Eyal; in light of the consolidation of Barr next year, the borrowing costs that you're thinking about now and potentially some currency effect, is the $3 or more in EPS for '09 still on the table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shorter answer, yes.  More longer answer I would say that based on the current visibility into our business we remain comfortable with our previously provided expectation.  So, that's based of course on the standalone Teva and after we will get more visibility on Barr definitely we will be come in the mid February when we will discuss the next year guidance with more clarity and more precise on that &#x2013; precise numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then a bigger picture question about Europe as well, Shlomo.  Can you give us a sense of the growth rate that the European generic and branded generic businesses had if you take out acquisitions and currency?  It looks like it was down on that basis.  Can you confirm that that is correct? And secondly, what is going to take to make that region overall, again, generic and branded generic a growth driver for Teva other than longer-term government initiatives to increase generic utilization?  Can that be a growth driver excluding acquisitions in the near to mid-term for Teva?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, first of all if you take the quarterly result in the European region for Teva actually the growth rate was flat.  If you take out the currencies, that's basically neutralize the 9% growth which is currency affected impact on our sales there.</p>
          <p>As per the more longer range than one quarter, as I said in my previous comments I see Europe as a very strategic important region for Teva growth in the future specially those countries where the penetration of generics or the level of generic penetration is very low and I can point out the Southern countries in Europe but also some Center and East European countries as well where the potential for growth is high in one hand and the government's need for reducing the Healthcare budget burden, on the other hand, will both present us with a great potential to grow our business..  So, all in all I believe that Europe will contribute a substantial part of our future growth.</p>
          <p>And as for acquisition, I have to balance what we all know that we acquire Bentley in Spain, but I would like to remind that we have sold also some of our small European business as part of our focusing our business there.  We sold our blood business in Hungary and we sold some minor businesses in other countries as well.  So, all in all, the impact of the acquisition is not part of the....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I turn to Eyal to give you more details, let me first give you where are we heading.  As you know we &#x2013; part of our long-term strategic goal, we are doubling the product portfolio of Teva by increasing our R&amp;D and that would increase our expenses on R&amp;D and we see that as an investment not as an expense, in the coming year or two to the level of seven-ish kind of a number.  It could fluctuate a little bit, but this is part of what we purposely and intentionally are doing in order to increase or double down on our product portfolio.</p>
          <p>As for G&amp;A, G&amp;A went down and we will continue to do whatever is needed to be a more efficient company and the S&amp;M is very &#x2013; depends on the business segments due to the differences between branded and generics as there is a huge different S&amp;M expenses here and I'll turn to Eyal to give a little bit more on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi Rich.  Let me give you some breakdown.  First of all, last year, in Q3 last year, G&amp;A was 6.5% of our total sales, and sales and marketing was 12.8%.  In Q# this year, G&amp;A was 5.5% as we are becoming more efficient and basically growing sales without increasing G&amp;A or maybe even a little down.  Sales and marketing was 17.3% and mostly as a result of the change with the agreement with Sanofi-aventis, that is the entire shift from last year.</p>
          <p>So we are becoming more efficient on G&amp;A, we are not growing our sales and marketing more than sales but we're not forgetting for one second that this is the fuel that is driving sales in many, many areas.  So there is, I believe very efficient and effective management of these line items.  I believe that we'll begin to see a little bit of improvement on the G&amp;A, on the G&amp;A margin, on the sales and marketing probably could expect to keep more or less the same proportion.  Rich?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Yes hi, the question has to do with Europe, can you talk a little bit about some of the countries you mentioned, France and Poland did well, why was that?  Was that market growth or were you guys taking market share or both?</p>
          <p>Can you talk about some of the countries that are weak and, one of the concerns that I guess I have is, when we get into a tough economy and you've got governments in Europe paying for pharmaceuticals, this is more the branded generic markets, that they'll decide to take price cuts or anything to hurt the pharma industry, similar to like maybe what Hungary did a few years ago.  Can you talk about your expectations for any major changes in '09 in some of the important countries in Europe that might affect you?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all even though Europe is not a homogenous region and every country is a different story, but there are some common dominators that we can speak about and one of those I mentioned before, there is a price pressure or pricing pressure in some countries due to the government intervention in that regard for example in UK as it has been done years ago in Hungary that you mentioned.  There are also tender in some countries, that also are pushing the price down, but I would like to remind all of us that this pressure is on all players in the market.  And as far as we can see we have even the advantage of our scale and our know-how, how to operate in different business models.  So, what I'm saying here is that the pressure and the result of our competitors is weaker than ours.</p>
          <p>We believe that we have as I mentioned the know-how, based on what we can learn in different business models and different countries and implement them in the countries we're operating now.  And we see relatively good result in countries where we already manage how to &#x2013; the business situation and I mentioned before France for example.  In France even though the market is a tough one, we are doing okay.  We are growing the business, the same goes for Spain even though that this based on the current acquisition of Bentley but all-in-all we see there very good result as well which is more than just the acquisition.  And Poland that has been mentioned also it also has a good result.  So, what I am saying is that I am optimistic about the future of the European business for Teva.  Governments will push towards generics.  We know how to operate in this environment, and this is why I am optimistic.</p>

          <p>As for Copaxone, I have the confidence on growing the Copaxone mainly because Copaxone has the advantage of being a very safe product and in Multiple Sclerosis where we have so many autoimugenity and other problems that we have to take care of.  Definitely, this is a big advantage and this is why I believe that it's going to see a &#x2013; we are going to see growing sales of Copaxone, and I have some good reason to believe so, because if we measure the growth rate of prescriptions in United States, the number one is Copaxone.  And to give you a little bit more on that I will ask Moshe Manor who is the Head of the Global Innovative business of Teva to say a little bit more on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo.  We see a interesting growth in Copaxone in the last I would say four or five consecutive quarters at above 30%.  It goes actually across the board, and in many markets we are improving the Copaxone position and we are moving in a &#x2013; for example if you take Germany to the second position in the market, in France second position as well and I believe the accumulation of the data that over the last year with all the results of Copaxone the precise data on the early MS and all the head-to-head data this will continue to fuel Copaxone growth.  And we need to remember that in most of the growth is unit growth.  So we are growing in volume and in patients.  And we &#x2013; based on what we have in all the data that we have, and the improving perception of Copaxone both on the frequency and definitely the unmatched safety will continue to fuel Copaxone growth actually across the board in all major European markets.  So we're very optimistic about the growth going forward as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Bill I had a question for you.  The FDA really recently made a ruling on Merck's COSOPT and that sort of nullified a small company's, small generic company's exclusivity.  Does that have an impact on your own COZAAR/HYZAAR filing, another Merck drug?</p>

          <p>Yeah, I don't know that we necessarily agreed with that decision and we did weigh-in on that.  So I don't know if it's going to have an implication on us or not.  We'll deal with it as we get to that point, but we feel that the case law is pretty clear at this point in time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Just a couple of questions, I guess for Eyal on operating cash flow in the quarter, number one, can you tell us whether or not Copaxone had a positive or negative impact on the Op Income line this period?  And then just maybe provide us with a little bit of color behind the strength in operating cash flow?  Just looking at the preliminary balance sheet it certainly doesn't look like working capital moved in your favor and then obviously a very strong number year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Copaxone, I assume you are referring to the change that we had where we ended our agreement with Sanofi-aventis.  It was neutral or maybe a few million dollars lower than before the change.  We are very similar to last quarter, we had $566 million increase in revenues, about $170 million increase in expenses, so you can do the math of the outcome.  This &#x2013; we have commented that this will go away in a couple of quarters, that difference.</p>
          <p>On operating cash flow, yeah I mean you look throughout the year and this is not a one quarter or Q3 event and Q2 was even stronger and we expect Q4 &#x2013; back on the collection of the sale that we had that we made in the third quarter to deliver another strong quarter on operating cash flow, this is coming right out of the business.  I mean if you look at our cash flow statement, I think it's pretty straightforward and detailed enough to understand, we are generating a lot of cash from the business.  The working capital doesn't change by much, and it closely coming out of profit, and you also saw what we did with that.  We acquired two companies so far this year.  We paid down our debt from the beginning of the year by approximately $0.5 billion, and we're paying dividend.  We are investing in capital expenditures.  And we're still growing our total cash which of course most of it is going to be used to close the Barr transaction.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is actually Annabel Samimy with Ricky Goldwasser.  Can you please tell us &#x2013; give us some color around the generic pricing for the base business?  Has there been any pressure there, and also can you quantify the Risperdal impact on the quarter and what was the time of the shelf stock adjustments that had to be taken?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Annabel, your first question was about the base business and pricing and boy, I hate to be really boring on this, but I've got to be.  We haven't really seen a change and I think as we've said this so many quarters in a row that we are down.  We are somewhere in the last 24-months, there hasn't been a real change on the base business, we don't see that.  So, so that's where we are sitting so far on that.</p>
          <p>Your second question on Risperdal was it had to do about the price adjustments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the impact on the quarter and what kind of shelf-stock adjustment had to be taken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean it was very unfortunate that we lost Risperdal at that point in time and you know we still think we're right but that's the way the courts are.  In any case we had to take the adjustment and we did so.  It was not insignificant to the quarter, but it was an adjustment that's out there.  We are still holding our share and doing very well in the market.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Just a more general question as to how you'd characterize the FDA's efficiency these days in approving more ANDAs in the quarter. You've got lots of companies saying that it's dramatically slowing down.  So A: would you agree?  And B: if so is it a function of an increased number of applications or a lack of resources or both and do you see that improving anytime soon?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Corey.  Good morning.  And with respect to the FDA you know we hear a lot of about that right now.  And I take my hat off to the FDA they are doing the best they can with the resources they have, and I hope the new administration is going to help perform them a lot a better. There certainly are a lot of files at the agency.  I don't see it though particularly affecting us in a meaningful way.  I think they are very good at prioritizing and getting first to market products there and Teva is all about first to market products.  So we get a lot of those.  I think you know the 17 file on Atenolol might have some issues and they know how to, they certainly know how to prioritize.  So I think they have done a great job there, but I would say that I would love to see them getting more resources.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see the industry ever funding those resources for the generic division the way that the brand companies do through PDUFA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah and in fact I'm here at the GPhA CEO summit today and I would speak for both as the President and CEO of Teva North America and also the Chairman of the Association that we have always willing to engage in dialogue with the agency with respect to user fees and we've done that before.  Our only issue about user fees is getting a level set with what the brand industry got with PDUFA meaning, we need performance metrics, we need milestones, we need to get something for what we pay, we just don't want to necessarily, just pay without metrics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes just two quick ones on the $0.02 raise for the year, can you give us a better sense qualitatively what drives that increased guidance?</p>
          <p>And the second question is similar to SG&amp;A Eyal, the R&amp;D number in the quarter as I said was low, you did just say 7 to 7.5% of revenues is sort of the target.  Previously I think you said 7.5 so is, there is a big difference on your revenue base, so how should we look at the R&amp;D spending going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich let me apologize if I will ask, if I will answer your first question in a general mode due to the nature of how you answer this kind of questions.  It's based on our confidence on our business and our business in these days when we see strong sales in United States, we see international strong sales, we see Copaxone and Azilect have strong sales.  We see what I've just described in the respiratory inhalers HFA in United Sates, the conversion toward the end of the year. So all in all we believe that  we have the momentum, and we believe that the, that's what behind our decision in this regard.  We believe that the current situation in the marketplace is in a way favoring company with strong financial strength, with business, which I could describe as balanced, what we call the balanced business model of Teva.  And of course with our advantages of having a culture of quick response to changes in the market which definitely is not something that everybody can do.  So we think that in the current competitive environment we have all the strengths to do better and this is actually what is behind our decisions and the numbers that we've provided this conference call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the R&amp;D the target with 7.5% of sales for year-end, we'll see if we get it.  I think the main issue is that our R&amp;D resources and expenses and head count are growing all the time.  We are investing significant amount of resources in three major areas of R&amp;D: the generics, the innovative and biogeneric R&amp;D. The numbers are growing but this is, this is not science this is R&amp;D.  So we will continue to increase this in line with our strategy.</p>
