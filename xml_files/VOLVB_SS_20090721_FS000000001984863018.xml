          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volvo's Conference Call on the Report on the first six months of 2009. It will start with a presentation and thereafter there will be a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. The conference will be chaired by Mr. Leif Johansson, CEO of Volvo. Mr. Johansson, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you. Good afternoon and good morning to all of you. Leif Johansson is here. We are having our second quarter call, but Christer, you &#x2013; we had problems with the technology in the morning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and apologies to everyone who called in this morning at the press conference. The phone line between Gothenburg and Stockholm went down a number of times. But there will be a replay up on our home page in a couple of hours for those of you who missed the beginning of the press conference.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. And I have around the table, as we always have, our CFO and we have our communication people but also our business area leaders, one of them out in the U.S. with Sal Mauro and Volvo Financial Services. We will be running through a number of slides that have been put out on the website and I'm starting with the one that says 'Group Highlights, Second Quarter', slide number two in the pack here. When you look at our sales during the quarter they were dramatically down compared to Q2 '08, so much so that in Swedish &#x2013; in new Swedish crowns you can say they were at 33% down but, adjusted for currency, which is more &#x2013; a better measure perhaps, they were actually down by minus 45%, so very dramatic downturns then across the different business areas on the revenue side.</p>
          <p>It is also important, however, to note that compared to Q1 '09 they were at zero, so they were flat compared to Q1 '09. So normally we would probably have a slight seasonal uptick in Q2 compared to Q1 and we ended up at zero here, but still you can say a much more stable development than we saw with the dramatic downturns in Q4 and Q1 respectively early in the year.</p>
          <p>Operating loss obviously at 6.9 billion, big numbers, we will take those numbers apart for you as we move into the presentation here, 3.2 of them being specified in the different slides that is upcoming.</p>
          <p>Big adjustments of production capacity and we were running at very low utilization capacity rates in the quarter and that's true in all countries and almost all business areas, obviously, with a fairly high &#x2013; big grade of variation across geographies and business areas, but still at very low production capacity.</p>
          <p>The bad thing of that, of course, is &#x2013; translates into uncovered losses, in operating losses; the good news here is that we were able to reduce <mark type="inaudible" /> inventories in orders of magnitude kr5.8 &#x2013; 6 billion, which we feel is good and well on the way of achieving our kr50 billion target for the year. Business environment, and we will be spending more time on this, it's stabilizing on a very low level, somewhat different to our expectations in &#x2013; after Q1; North America is not showing &#x2013; at least not much signs of recovery or slower signs of recovery than what we would have liked to see. We will be speaking to that also, both in terms of construction equipment but also on the truck side.</p>
          <p>Asia, on the other hand, I think we can say we were positive to Asia already in Q1. We are now seeing signs of improvement with China and India being impacted by successful stimulus programs, but also Japan now, so much so that we're turning on production a little in Japan for the markets there.</p>
          <p>Go to slide three, the one that says Volvo Group Second Quarter, there you actually see the geographic breakdown of our sales and now we compare in modern Swedish crowns, here you will see the minus 4, which was minus zero when adjusted and minus 34, which was minus 45 in &#x2013; adjusted for currencies, and there you can see that, with the exception of Asia and other markets, we actually had downturns also in between Q2 '09 and Q1 '09, being 5, 8 percentage there. Asia was up, as was other markets.</p>
          <p>Obviously, if you look at &#x2013; in the operating income there, with sales of about 54 and operating income of 6.8, which takes us into a margin of minus 12% there, driven by significantly lower sales volume and still a big part underabsorption of costs that we have had to reduce, and wanted, for cash flow reasons, to reduce production at a quicker pace than we actually saw the sales downturn coming at us. So they impact negatively but in &#x2013; we think, in a positive way, the UAW agreement that we have spoken about for a couple of quarters here now was finally settled in the quarter. That meant we took a charge to the P&amp;L of 870 million, but we did do away with all past and future retiree health costs in Mack.</p>
          <p>We had bad news of increased credit positioning, especially in BFS, but we will also see a credit loss at Volvo Penta there. And this time around, the adjustment's being made to the reserves positionings for our Western European business. Lay-off costs still at 600 million, directly related then to people whom we are parting with but also for short-time work. And then we have residual values at 550 million when we adjusted the values of our contracts and to some extent the buybacks also. And then negative currency effect of 1.7 billion and some translation into that.</p>
          <p>Going to page four, the one that says, 'Annual Cost Level', this is the slide that we also showed at the Capital Markets Day; it shows the decision of different activities aimed at reducing the cost level annualized by 21 billion. And, obviously, these decisions, once they are made, cannot be completely taken in each quarter because of &#x2013; for financial reasons and also for book-keeping reasons, so it means that we have delivery times on some of these as we progress. This is through different geographies and different business areas, but our ambition there of getting 21 billion of added pace there from a decision and, to some extent, execution point, as described by that slide, remains the same as when we spoke about it at the Capital Market Day.</p>
          <p>With that let me hand over to Mikael Bratt here, our Chief Financial Officer and talk about Volvo Group and cash flow on slide five.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As you can see on the slide here, we have a significant improvement in quarter two compared to Q1 this year and we regard this as a trend break and I will elaborate more on this later on here. And then also if you break the quarter report here, the last two months in the quarter was cash flow positive, both May and June showed positive numbers here. And one big impact here contributing in positive way is, of course, the work that we have been conducting within the working capital side of the business here. Cash flow will, of course, certainly be our priority number one going forward the coming quarters as well.</p>
          <p>So let's then dive into some more details here and move over to page six, Working Capital. And, as you can see on this slide, the main contributor is the release of inventory in the magnitude of 5.8 billion.</p>
          <p>We have given you the items here that for, the year 2009, we should release 15 billion. So we are well on our way to release these numbers here. And we have good traction, I would say, in all our different business areas here. Receivables, 1.6 released. Here we see that the receivables are following the business here and as the business has shrunk throughout the year, also the outstanding receivables have being shrinking here. So, releasing capital and in the quarter, 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, it's the payables that in the quarter accounted for four billion in the negative. It has certainly stabilized, I would say. The major part, or more or less all of it, came in the first month of the quarter and then the following two it has been stabilized. But, with that said, I also would like to remind you here that we have extended shutdown weeks in connection with the vacation here. So there will certainly be some pressure on the payables going forward here, but, overall, I believe we have a more stable situation going forward here.</p>
          <p>So, good traction when it comes to working capital. And we're certainly working on two fronts here, one is, of course, to adjust to the overall lower business demand and customer demand and balancing the balance sheet for that, but also certainly working extensively with process improvements here to further reduce the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Going on to the next slide, page seven, the Net Financial Debt. And here you can see that as the consequence of the overall negative cash flow, we have then moved from 6.3 net debt-to-equity to 80.7 of net debt-to-equity. And you also see the adjustments for pensions, which we include in our net debt-to-equity calculation. But if you look into the change here, of the 5.8, you can see that from operations we had a net effect of 0.8 negative, coming down from the cash flow, 2.9, but on the opposite side, on a positive side, we had the currency effect of 2.9 isolated in the quarter. But, you also should know and remember here that we have year-over-year a negative cash flow effect when you look at the &#x2013; at the change from last year here for the overall increase in the net debt-to-equity level.</p>
          <p>Then we had two extraordinary items affecting the net debt in the quarter, which is the dividend of 4.1, and then we had the UAW agreement of that roughly 900 million affecting the net debt-to-equity here.</p>
          <p>And I would like to say here, when it comes to the UAW agreement here, we have a well structured payment plan of this 900 million, which is over the five year horizon and you have about one-fifth each year here and the first payment is not until Q3 2010. And we, as a group here, are committed to the 40% net debt-to-equity levels that we have communicated to you before here. And that's what we're working on.</p>
          <p>Moving on to page &#x2013; slide eight, the 'Volvo Group Funding'. Just to confirm to you here that we have been working intensively with our net debt-to-equity &#x2013; sorry, our liquidity position here and we have raised a significant amount of money during this quarter, but certainly the first quarter of the year here. And we have now a liquidity reserve of 63.5 billion consisting then of liquid assets of 32.5 and then we have undrawn committed facilities in the magnitude of 31 billion. And the committed facilities here consist of three parts, you could say. One is then a euro facility, expiring 2011, and one U.S. dollar denominated facility, expiring 2013, and then we have &#x2013; and both of those are unutilized completely, and then we have the 775 million euro line that we concluded in April this year, where we have drawn down some, but we have about half left unutilized there.</p>
          <p>And when we also look at the programs that we have available in terms of commercial paper program, EMTM programs and so on, I would say that, as we also there have good amount of room left, and we have certainly a number of tools in the toolbox going forward here as well. Also, the maturity structure is something that we are working with on an ongoing basis. And you can see from this slide, also, that we have a good structure there, and almost none maturing during 2010 here I would say. So, it's really when you are looking into '11, '12, '13 when you will start to talk about some maturity of any magnitude here.</p>
          <p>To summarize the cash flow and the liquidity position here I would like to say that we have good activity levels throughout the group in terms of releasing cash flow, and also both in the quarter and looking forward, and we have a conservative approach when it comes to how we have funded the group here. But, before I stop, I just would like to make a comment on the currency number we presented to you, the 1.7 here and the items related to hedges, in Q1 we stated that we had three billion unrealized hedging &#x2013; in unrealized hedging contracts and that would then be maturing over Q2 and Q3. And just to report back on that is that now at the end of Q2 out of this three billion, and on based the current currency levels here we have about 800 million left to go, which will mature during Q3. So I just wanted to clarify that item and I will stop there. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let's go through the truck slide that starts on slide nine, where we are highlighting the fact that we see a continued depressed demand for new vehicles, we will go into some of the details there. Total sales were down by 46%, but it is interesting to note that we had new vehicle sales down by more than that and actually offset by a better performance in the beginning of the crisis, the downturn also on aftermarket and what we call soft products, but actually towards the end of the quarter a pickup of the part of the truck business that is driven by the population that we have out there.</p>
          <p>And also in this case, we were quite successful in reducing inventories of new trucks by another 16% there. And we have a number of activities also to get sales of used trucks up and were successful in that in that we see higher sales of new trucks in North America, but also the stable sales and reasonable, in fact good sales of used trucks in Europe. Some of course of that is because we have written them down to other values.</p>
          <p>Now rightsizing operations is the headline on &#x2013; in focus as we move into the third quarter. We will have production rates in the third quarter even lower than in the second quarter as we take the opportunity to combine vacation times with extra down weeks, and of course again with the reason the &#x2013; reason for that is cash flow activities. Making sure that cost efficiency and productivity don't &#x2013; doesn't get off our focus here. And of course we are quite interested in getting an even bigger part of the aftermarket and services.</p>
          <p>And I should say fortunately or unfortunately also new emission regulations right now we are battling with US '10. We have good news there later on the report to report that we are ready for US '10 but it's taking its toll in our R&amp;D cost as does the Euro VI, which is coming at us in '12 '13. So we &#x2013; unfortunately we have a big spend in R&amp;D for emission regulations and we are taking the opportunity to also make more attractive products as we come through those cycles.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows heavy-duty truck market &#x2013; Europe, which we are leaving unchanged in the outlook, obviously a fantastic drop by any measures there, but forecast unchanged compared to what we said in quarter two. That's basically the message also on heavy-duty truck market in North America. We note that the half-year result for North America is minus 43 on heavy-duty trucks. We possibly could have said we have a slight taste of disappointment here; we thought that North America would come up quicker than it has, that's still also true on the construction equipment side. And we think that's due to the effect that the different stimulus money that is coming into the different types of markets here are not having, at least in the short-term, much of an effect. We are looking for that to come later on in the year.</p>
          <p>If you go to net order intake, we're taking net order intakes positive trend there. We have given you the raw data and the graph to the side that seems to indicate that off our high levels in Q2 '08 down to an absolute bottom in Q4 '08, we have had now two quarters of consecutive increases compared to the bottom in Q4 '08. I think all words of caution needs to be put here because we are operating at very low numbers. And you remember also that we &#x2013; in Q2, many of the orders that we actually took in Q1 and Q2 in '08, it actually ended up in cancelations and thereby impacting Q3 and Q4 in '08.</p>
          <p>But any which way, the way we assess this is that we have seen a bottoming out, it's too early to call it a turnaround but clearly much more steady ground below our feet when we look across the globe here. If you look at Europe or North America you see upturns there, we had upturns also in the beginning of the year in Q1. South America actually quite reasonably coming back, Asia quite reasonably coming back and other markets also that way. So the total net order intake on a positive trend, but also very low levels then.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 takes a few more words about our different truck, our truck group. We have Volvo trucks there with the big North American and the big European business of course dramatically impacted by the downturn on hard products on new equipments and new trucks, but also with the quite good uptick we think on new products as they were being launched. And obviously we are quite interested in &#x2013; and that's probably true of all the four brands we're highlighting here, building customer relationships as we move into <mark type="inaudible" /> more generated by aftermarket and parts, and obviously cash flow could have been on all four there but doing well.</p>
          <p>Renault Trucks then with mainly a European business and to some extent also impacted by big countries with negative development like Spain, there we have implemented short-term weeks for both blue and white collar employees and with that we have reasonable cost reductions we feel in the short-term you know that we parted with quite a few temporary employees with Renault Trucks in the beginning of the year there. Again, a focus on reduction of inventories and there perhaps we do have markets like Spain and Italy having come down and where we have the inventories that we want to get out through the system. And as a consequence of that we are running in the short-term further reduction there of production rates.</p>
          <p>Mack Trucks, we all know that Dennis [Slagle] spoke about the labor agreement, that's the three-year labor agreement that secures the immediate couple of years here for Mack Trucks. We have EPA '10 program in advanced stages and looking at &#x2013; and we are building the first EPA '10 trucks both at Volvo and Mack as we speak. Sent out a press release on that today, and quite happy with what we see in terms of performance technology solutions but also in terms of fuel efficiency.</p>
          <p>Hybrids are quite important for Mack, and we have begun delivering them to key customers of Mack here in the review segment. And we have customer satisfaction at record highs built on a third-party survey that we have participated, which is the good news. After all the changes we have had at Mack Trucks, especially on the engine and the chassis side, we are happy to note that customers are now happy with the product that had generated off of that.</p>
          <p>Nissan Diesel, slightly best in use perhaps both in &#x2013; in Asia in general, but also that the different incentive programs that have been put in in Japan are working. We see an improving trend in order intake, the scrapping incentives are built around fuel efficiency, we have low inventories and there we are actually beginning to see an upturn &#x2013; so much so there we are increasing production rates in quarter three. So all in all, then, net order intake on the truck side and possibly a positive trend or at least to somewhat more stable development in &#x2013; on the truck side.</p>
          <p>Then as the next presentation, we have construction equipment. We have slide 14. We have our reasonably newly appointed President of Construction Equipment, Olof Persson, to speak today. Olof?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And if we start with the overall market conditions, you can see from the slide that the total world market was down 48% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. And in two of our remaining markets, Europe and North America, they were down respectively 62 and 53%. I would say that despite the very tough market conditions we have kept or actually gained market shares in important markets and product segments. But of course our sales are suffering from this severe downturn in the markets, and our net sales declined by 45%, resulting in a capacity utilization for the quarter at only somewhere between 25 and 30%.</p>
          <p>The low volumes on absorption and negative currency intakes down are the main explanations to the loss of 1.259 billion stake we reported in the second quarter. When it comes to the inventory, I'm glad to report that we were able to reduce the number of units with another 11% in the quarter and all in all this year down more than 20%. And since October 2008, we have been reducing our inventory in &#x2013; measured in units by about 40%.</p>
          <p>If we then look in the focus, we will of course then continue to balance our inventories to match the good customers' demand and thereby also secure a continuous good cash flow. A new strategy for Volvo CE will be rolled out into the organization in the first weeks in September and the new strategy we focus very much on profitability and cash flow. And at the same time we are also working on the break-even level for the company is well on the way to reduce it significantly.</p>
          <p>And finally, a few words on fuel efficiency. We are focusing a lot on fuel efficiency to support our customers and this is our umbrella thinking where we look at the engines, the technology , the design, but also the way operators are operating the machines in order to combine all these technologies into a very fuel efficient company &#x2013; fuel efficient vehicles and that would support the customers' profitability and efficiency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Olof. Thank you. We had slide 15. And buses, and H&#xE5;kan Karlsson there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The bus market continued to have a negative development during the second quarter. The coach segment has, I will say, a low underlying demands because of the lack of tourists. The city segment has still a good underlying demand but financial constraints hampered the city segments also. In U.S., India and China, the governments stimulate purchase of modern clean city buses. So there we can see an upturn in the city bus market. But all in all, we see the total market traveling down.</p>
          <p>Looking for the coach market in North America and South America, it has been extremely low, 50% down compared to last year, and definitely requires some additional restructuring activities from our side. On the positive side, we have had a very good order intake during Q2, plus 38%, mainly driven by Asia and that will naturally have a positive effect in the end of this year and the beginning of 2010.</p>
          <p>We have also strengthened our market position in North America and Asia. On the result side, we managed to have a positive cash flow in the second quarter but the result was a disappointment. The main reason on the result was a big change in markets and product mix from North America to Asia and from coach to city segment. And we also this quarter have a big negative currency effect, but as I see it, it will level off now and we will have a better currency situation the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>The cost reduction activities are following our plans. In focus we have launched an additional cost saving program to further lower our break-even level on the current market mix. And we also have then initiated a restructuring program in Prevost, because there we have a very low market situation.</p>
          <p>In parallel, we have some very important new product launches coming on Eu 5 in Europe going well. The Hybrid field tests are running well in real traffic now and we can see that we overperform on fuel consumption and also the US10 is going well. But all in all these require some high R&amp;D spending and also a lot of resources to secure the introduction.</p>
          <p>So that's all from Buses slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>All right. Flip to slide 16 Volvo Penta and G&#xF6;ran Gummeson.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Leif. The sharp decline in the global demand for marine and industrial engines continued during the second quarter. Both Europe and North America is severely hit by the financing problems and one of the world's actually largest boat building groups, Genmar applied during the quarter for Chapter 11.</p>
          <p>We see no signs of recovery of demand in Europe and North America, but our sales in China, Southeast Asia and some other countries is still holding up relatively well. Our business to consumer sales has been harder impacted by the global recession than our aftermarket and commercial businesses. Sales of industrial engines today represent almost 50% of the total business for us. We had an operating loss during the quarter and this is attributed to the lower sales of course and the restructuring cost under absorption in the production system and also this credit loss connected and to the Genmar situation.</p>
          <p>In focus now moving forward is of course to balance the risk that we see in the customer base of course and also the supply chain as such. We had a positive cash flow during the quarter and we are driving our operating capital with the ambition to continue this positive trend. When it comes to new products, we are right now in a very intensive phase with a number of important launches in key segments both in the marine leisure side and also industrial engine side and this will help us to strengthen our position in these segments. That's all for Volvo Penta, Leif.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, let's go to Volvo Aero and Staffan Zackrisson on slide 17.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. We have for three quarters now a negative trend for air traffic and for the first five months of this year it was minus 8%, which correlates with the world GDP devolvement.</p>
          <p>On the cargo traffic the decline is even tougher, it's minus 21%. This means that airlines are under severe pressure and there is a forecast from the international organization IATA that it will be about $9 billion here. The order intake is very low it's down 83% compared with last year. So the financing of the orders to be taken for '09 and '10 is what Boeing and Airbus is working with right now.</p>
          <p>Boeing has delayed the new aircraft the Dreamliner 787. We have a big investment of a GEnx engine for that aircraft and we were expecting to have revenue coming in the here in '10, but the program is now delayed and we don't know when the program will start to give us revenue.</p>
          <p>We have also done an important contract with the Snecma aerospace group of France for the continuation of the CFM56 engine for the Boeing 737, which give us a very positive future to continue that program. If we look on sales it's positive between the years but it's dollar driven. Volume wise it was a decline with 8% and if we look on the profit it's a small profit just above zero and we have had decrease in our US spare parts sales and also in our American aftermarket business. So on a &#x2013; generally on the aftermarket we are down some 15% which hits our profit levels since it's obviously the spares that generates profits in our business.</p>
          <p>If we look on the what's in focus, we are in the midst of our capacity adjustment laying off for the shop floor workers on the blue collar side; we are also into cost management; we are announcing and are negotiating white collar employees as well. And we're working very intensely with the release of capital except from the inventories we're also looking upgrades in size to refinance ourselves on different items on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In this downturn, we are heavily into new programs and execution of these new contracts are very important for us. It's a number of engines that we are doing product development and that will continue for another couple of quarters. So that concludes Volvo Aero.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Leif. During the second quarter we saw little evidence that the economic downturn is improving. Actually in our major markets in Europe, Eastern Europe and North America, they have actually flattened or even gotten a bit worse. Most notably in Western Europe our customers remain challenged by the substantial reduction of economic activity, which has led to an increase in delinquencies and repossessions. We continue to work with our customers in all VFS regions in restructuring their financings and where necessary we continue to repossess equipment and prepare it for resale. As a result, the need for credit loss provisions increased and it was warranted in the second quarter. Loss provisions of kr663 million were booked noting an increase in Western European provisions.</p>
          <p>This is less than what was provided in quarter one, but substantially higher than quarter two 2008. This has negatively impacted the operating income with a loss of kr296 million for the second quarter and a negative 12 months rolling average ATROE, after-tax return on equity, of 0.5%. While volumes are noticeably lower at kr7.9 billion for the quarter, the good news is our penetration rate has increased to 28% showing good support for the Volvo Group business areas, but at lower retail sales volumes. In focus, of course, risk mitigation activities, they continue to be in focus as we are concentrating on decreasing the frequency of delinquent accounts while mitigating the severity of the losses when we remarket them.</p>
          <p>We have reallocated resources to collection, restructure and remarketing activities across all of the regions of VFS and we are seeing traction and improvement in our ability to handle this challenging economic downturn. The activities of customer finance are critical in the downturn as VFS works even more closely with our buyers and operators of the Volvo Group products and services, risk mitigation as well as working partnerships with customers to weather the downturn ensure that the Volvo Group will build relationships with customers that will be stronger and even more valuable in the future.</p>
          <p>We are addressing our new volume levels by first reallocating resources from front-end sales functions to collection, risk and remarketing activities, but we're also rationalizing personnel where necessary.</p>
          <p>We are hard at work right now in the development of a sound platform for our Asia-Pacific region. We are creating a headquarters in Tokyo, Japan that will be staffed in August to facilitate the integration of VFS Japan; the adding of retail financing to our wholesale finance business in Australia; the expansion of our VFS business in China with the addition of a leasing license to complement our retail financial offer and a separate setup for a leasing company for Lingong.</p>
          <p>We are glad to announce that the commencement on June 1st of VFS Japan supporting the Volvo Group companies in Japan, most notably Nissan Diesel. We purchased the servicing assets of Ace Sogo Lease, a GE Capital company, and hired their employees in order to service GE's liquidating Nissan Diesel finance portfolio while building up the new UD Financial Services portfolio.</p>
          <p>We are looking forward to great cooperation with Nissan Diesel, other Volvo Group companies and our new dealers and customers in Japan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, Sal. Come to, with me on to the Group summary at slide 19. Obviously bad news there with sales 45% lower than in Q2. Perhaps on a little more positive side, flat compared with first quarter of 2009, and if you compare Q1 and Q2 to Q4 '08 in order &#x2013; in net order intake then you actually see a positive development there, significant production cutbacks then. We have been traveling at very low level of production in Q2. We'll continue to do that and the reason of course is to have a &#x2013; to continue what we feel important for successful reduction of inventories, both to improve operating cash flow but also to not have a lingering inventory out there impacting the rest of our different business models. Big operating loss but a big improvement in cash flow compared to Q1, and Mikael made a point, that we have a strong liquidity reserve and very little on the maturity profile there.</p>
          <p>Fairly easy to see what we have in focus aside from the obvious one which is staying close to customers and making sure that we help solving their problems and doing what we can to sell new products and soft products to them, from internal work it's easy to note that we will do what it takes on the Group cost structure to adjust to any level of markets that we see coming. At minus 45% that's difficult to do as on a quick pace as we have had but certainly our intention to show that even if we stay at minus 45 we would be able to deliver a reasonable profitability there. Cash flow, easy to note that that's important and we have a lot of focus on that as we move through the next couple of quarters here.</p>
          <p>Of course, with that let me open up for any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes from Mr. Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everybody. It's Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. I wonder if we can talk a bit about your financial services business and the 92 billion receivables book. We saw the credit loss ratio increasing from 1.1 &#x2013; 1.5% roughly to 1.77, which is almost matching your provisioning of 1.88. So could you share with us your thoughts of how much worse the default rate could go in the course of this year and where you think you would really feel comfortable towards the year-end on the provisioning side of that business as well?</p>
          <p>And then also more generally talking about financial services, could you share with us the spread between your borrowing costs and the rates that you can pass on to your customers right now? I guess you did some pretty expensive refinancing recently, so there must be a negative spread of a couple of hundred basis points in that business.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on used trucks, you're saying in the report that used truck inventory on a global basis is more or less flat versus the first quarter. Could you talk a bit about the trends in the different regions and especially in North America where you see the used truck level, really? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think the first one, should we ask Sal to start that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine, Leif. I'll take the second part of that question first if I could. We don't typically disclose our spread, but I have to say that it's definitely under pressure with the increase in the funding costs, but we've been able to pass on the vast majority of that to our customer base. It seems that the competitors are also increasing rates, so while it's becoming more and more difficult, we are still in a positive spread region, I heard you say negative spread and I know that around the world generally we are not in a negative spread situation, we are still positive and we do a calculation each month called the pro forma atro and it tries to predict over the next three to four years what we'd be earning on that contract and that is still positive and at half-way decent levels, not great but not bad at all. So we're able to pass on the increase in costs so far, while &#x2013; though it is getting more and more challenging.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Can I just step in there -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first part of that question was about reserves and you have correctly noted that our write-off ratio has increased; it is 1.77. I have to remind everyone that's an annualized number so we take the losses either in the quarter or year-to-date and annualize them. We have been taking steps to increase provision over the write-offs so that gives you a net effect of an increase in the level of percentage of reserves that we have, which I think is the right thing to do now and we are continuing looking at that. It's very tricky to try to predict the future when it comes to losses and reserve levels, and I'm not about to do that today. But I have to say we are keeping pace with the losses. We are providing, so far, more than the actual write-offs. There will be a time when we see a flattening or a decreasing trend that would see write-offs probably a bit greater than the provisioning that we have, but we're not in that situation right now.</p>
          <p>Leif, the second or the third part of that question was on used trucks, did you want me to handle some of that or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me have a go first and then you add whatever comments you want to. The way we see used trucks from the business area point of view is that we see improving sales in the U.S. and our ability to remarket trucks &#x2013; used trucks in the U.S. seems to be quite good. And you can say that if you want to call that an improvement whereas &#x2013; as perhaps an early sign of increasing demand, then perhaps so is it. In Europe, in general, we have &#x2013; we are selling at the same rate used trucks that we have coming in and different types of trade-back programs, but we did take a value loss at that. So but as &#x2013; at the prices where we now have them valued, we are actually turning over in Europe as many trucks as we are collecting. Then I think we can say in Asia not an issue at all, really, very few used trucks there. And then, do you want to add something about used trucks VFS and repossession there in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's been increasing and our inventory levels have been increasing with the influx of repossessions that we've been having and most notably in Eastern Europe and in Europe. And while the prices are off from the peak, we are selling a good amount of used trucks in Europe and we are increasing that velocity every day. In the U.S we've been &#x2013; as the units have been coming in we've been selling them; inventory levels are at very reasonable amounts. Our focus now is on Eastern Europe and trying to find the way to liquidate some of that inventory or come up with creative ways to redeploy it.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to be clear. You don't see the used truck market as being a big problem for the hopeful increase of the U.S market next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't. No, I think we can say we have a used truck market which is beginning to operate in what we would call normal ways. Given the age of the fleet I don't think there are enough used trucks around to really have a big impact there.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen's, it's Fredric here from UBS. Could you just tell me how you &#x2013; when you provide for the, or take the charges for the losses on the used trucks, have you taken into consideration expected losses there, or is that just realized losses?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, just one further follow-up really to what I asked on the call this morning. And that is just the outlook for further inventory liquidation. From your guidance you are looking for about the same pace of inventory liquidation in the second half as you saw in the first half. Is there any risk in connection with that, that volume &#x2013; pardon me; price weakness increases as you go through that process, because in fact what you are doing is selling this stuff that's easiest to sell first and you get left with, if you like, a rump of inventory toward the end of the process which is hard to shift. Is there any extent to which that's a risk, and insofar as it is a risk is it represented in the inventory write-downs you've already taken? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Colin, it is clearly a risk there and we have looked at that when our revaluation of the different assets that we have on the balance sheet. I don't think it's a very big risk, but it is still there.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Patric Lindqvist from HQ Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I had a question on the demand side. You said that you are slightly disappointed with the North American, I understand the rest were almost neutral. But you still reiterate the 21 billion ambition, then the question is should we read that as you are saying that the recovery or at least stabilization you are seeing in orders, it will be sufficient so that you don't have to do more than 21 billion? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a difficult question; you are putting many moving parts together there. The &#x2013; what we, I think, were looking for when we last met at the Capital Markets Day and possibly at the Q1 was to see a little more dynamic U.S. market driven by, to some extent, expectations of some pre-buy on the truck side but also the stimulus money coming into the economy.</p>
          <p>Basically our scenario for both remains but obviously pushed into the coming quarters rather than experience that in this quarter. I think on the stimulus money there is just a pace, or a delay in effect, we think most of that will actually happen. On the pre-buy side, I think what seems to be happening here is that we will have '07 technology trucks sold well in to the first quarter beginning of &#x2013; because of the different buildups here of &#x2013; because of the dynamics around the quarter, we have some competitors out there with credits and what have you, so there will be possibly a pre-buy effect if not in quarter four, we may see a little one in quarter one here instead, so even a delay there too.</p>
          <p>Given that, you can say we don't think that that puts any basic difference to our scenario of having the North American market come back in 2010, 2011, and therefore also does not put any pressure on the 21 billion program to further improve that from a structural point of view. But it certainly puts a lot of pressure on the short-term, making sure that we run the efficiency and the productivity that we can at lower production rates in Q3 and Q4 than what we possibly had thought 2 or 3 months ago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two short and simple questions. The used truck pick-up you are seeing in the U.S. that &#x2013; you don't suspect that's a pre-buy of used instead of new ones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I answered that question before. I think there is certainly an element of that but not such that we would say it has a big impact, certainly an element of that but not a big impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Final question; the 10, 15% reduction Q2 to Q3 in production rates that you talked about, 42 million. is that daily production rates you are referring to or is it just to the absolute volumes Q2 to Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I think you can say it's the absolute volumes in Q3, we will be all over the place when it comes to daily production rates.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Ulrich Scholz from Oppenheim Research. I have first a question regarding the sequential unit order improvement Q2 against Q1. Could you give us a feeling in how far a reduced number of cancellations have been triggered here? And second question regarding your capacity utilization in the truck segment for construction equipment you quantify 25 to 30%, if you give us here a figure for your truck operations in North America and in Europe. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the first issue there, which is order intake, the best way to answer that is to say that we had high cancellation rates in Q3 and Q4 but on a declining rate in Q1 and Q2. So obviously the comparison between Q1 and Q2 we don't see any big effects, but if you compare to Q2 and Q3, then you do see big effects. So more, I think, appropriate from that point of view to look at the progression of Q4, Q1, Q2 where there is much less effect of that.</p>
          <p>Your second question there, let me understand that better what you actually asked for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your quarterly report you quantified your current capacity utilization in the construction equipment segment was 25 to 30%, so this indicating that 70% of your capacities are not utilized at the moment, and could you give us here a figure as well for your truck segment, because you just spoke about a weak capacity utilization in trucks without quantifying a detail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would guess that you are very close to the same. If you look at &#x2013; say we are minus 55, 60% down compared to last year's Q2 and then we were running at very close to capacity in some places, so it's somewhere around the same number.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon. I have basically two questions. One, it's good that we are seeing net order intake in positively. The question I have is, in these orders, what kind of pricing trend are we seeing and, in terms of margin also, if you can give some idea, how are the margins probably in these &#x2013; in these new order intakes?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on your annualized savings, which is already mentioned. Can you give me some details on that, how much of that would actually accrue in '09 and which specific areas are these savings related to? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I'll ask Mikael Bratt to comment on the savings development there and on the slide of the 21 billion. On the pricing in general on new products and the net orders that you see there, I would say that the pricing on new products is reasonably disciplined and we have not seen -- we have seen anecdotal low prices on new trucks, mainly not from OEMs, but perhaps from dealers who have sometimes taken on more, but that is more anecdotal. I would say in general the markets on new orders, on new vehicles are behaving quite disciplined and have reduced a lot. So reasonable development there and also from that point of view reasonable margins in that. We have, as we commented before, seen more of a problem, and I have had to address that in the quarter, on the used vehicles and used trucks. Annual savings there, Mikael, do you want to go through that?</p>

          <p>Yes, I think as we have said before here, I mean, the 21 billion consists of number of different activities in order to bring down the cost levels there. The biggest part &#x2013; single part there is the personnel-related costs and there we have said before that we are talking about 8 to 9 billion in P&amp;L effects here throughout the year. When it comes to rest I think it is difficult to give you an absolute guidance there, but this is more to indicate for you activity levels of cost reduction as we are implementing as we speak here and throughout the year here. So the actual P&amp;L effect will be panned out over the next coming quarters there.</p>

          <p>And I think we answered a similar question earlier in the day by saying we are not talking about years of delivery time, we are talking about quarters of delivery time here.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Yann Benhamou from Exane. Please go ahead sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Yann Benhamou from Exane. My first question regarding your people who are supposed to leave the company, I'd like to know how many have already left and how many are still to leave. This is the first question. Second one, my understanding about your balance sheet situation is that a lot will depend on your credit rating to figure a possible solution to address the balance sheet issue, at what level do you consider your credit rating to be an issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You have on &#x2013; in the report you have a detailed set up there on the number of people actually from the beginning of the crisis and let me just find the right -number of employees on page 9, and there you see that we had at the &#x2013; June 30, we had 94,000 employees compared with 102,000 almost in 2008, the year end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we have given notice to around, just a shade above 20,000 people, and we have had about 10 &#x2013; 15,000 of them to leave, but we still have more than 6,000 people to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it means that the provision for layoffs should be lower in the H2 compared to H1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are &#x2013; well, in H2 compared to H1. Yeah, I would probably agree with you on that but they &#x2013; but they will not be zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And regarding your balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes &#x2013; yeah, and credit rating, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we &#x2013; we have communicated here our commitment towards the balance sheet and that we certainly prioritize to strengthen the balance sheet as we go forward here and the downside is of course the utilization in our factories and so forth. And we are working across the group here to deliver on this and I don't think there is an absolute level where you could say that the net debt-to-equity ratio becomes a rating triggers or something like that, but what we have is close and constructive dialogues with the rating agencies and we keep them updated on activities that we are performing here to strengthen the balance sheet and what's important here is to deliver on cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So clearly it depends on your performance in terms of cash flow in H2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For sure. As always.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no further questions at this time. Speakers, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, then we would like to conclude this session. On behalf of Volvo, let me say have a good summer. And we'll see you next time around in the third quarter. Thank you.</p>
