          <p>Good morning and good afternoon. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome to the Roche Half Year Results 2008 Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instruction]</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Severin Schwan, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead sir.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our second analyst call today. We will have about 1.5 hours before we as the management team will take off to U.S. for town hall meeting with our employees and investor meetings in the U.S. We trust that you have had a chance to analyze our material on the web in the meantime and we suggest to therefore tend to concentrate on a few key messages for both the half year results and of course, for the taking private of Genentech to leave enough time to take your questions.</p>
          <p>If I may start with the half year results. Again, a very solid result for the first six months. On a group level we have grown by 10% in local currencies if you correct for the expected decline in Tamiflu pandemic and 18% in U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>If we turn to page five, you can see that the organic sales growth has been 2 billion over the first six months. We lost a 1 billion in Tamiflu and 1.8 billion primarily due to a weaker dollar, so that the net result on the sales line is minus 4%. You can see the strong result also reflected on operating profit level and core EPS, which has grown by 3% and with this result, we are also very confident to reconfirm our objectives, which we have set earlier this year mainly, highly single-digit local currency sales for the Roche Group with up market sales in both divisions and the core earnings per share at least at 2007 record level.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Bill for the Pharmaceuticals Division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So good afternoon, good morning ladies and gentlemen. A very strong first half for Pharma. I see that many people on the lines who were not with us earlier, so just a few highlights.</p>
          <p>Clearly the sales increase of 9% outside of the pandemic planning for Tamiflu is more than twice the global market average at the present time. And here I am talking in local currency growth as really the only true marker of growth. If you follow it in dollars it would be dramatically higher, if you follow it in Swiss Francs it's lower but the business that really we can influence is the cost and currency business and that's 9% growth and the market average of 4%, four-point-something-percent is also in constant prices from IMS.</p>
          <p>The key products grew double digits and that more than outweighed the Tamiflu pandemic losses of about a billon, so we did end up with total sales revenues up 3%. We invested heavily in the R&amp;D area, an 11% growth in the R&amp;D business and we signaled this to you earlier in the year as being a number of projects that are in phase III, or starting in phase III. Despite that, with good cost control, both in terms of marketing and distribution, operating efficiencies and manufacturing, we did manage to improve the profit margin by 1.9 percentage points, reaching 38.2% for the first half year.</p>
          <p>As many of you that are regular followers of Roche, you do know that in the first half year, we're usually a little bit more profitable than in the second half. And I would expect that this will be also the case this year, given the heavy phase III program, the CETP ramp-up of patient recruitment, and also the start of the phase III programs for the GLP-1.</p>
          <p>If I also reflect at this point the acquisition of Piramed in the UK is now complete. This brings in a very interesting PI3-kinase inhibitor program which has one aspect to it as an appropriate approach for cancer, and the other is for inflammation autoimmune.</p>
          <p>We also licensed in a very interesting molecule from a Belgian and Scandinavian company, which is also going to enhance, we believe, what we are doing in antiangiogenesis.</p>
          <p>If we just take a couple of minutes from some of the key brands in chart 17 on the website you see that our oncology product that grew at 15%, we saw really very good growth across each of the key brands. Avastin itself 36%; this actually came about by a 78% growth in the Roche European/Rest of World territories, driven by label expansions and an increasing adoption.</p>
          <p>ASCO, you saw a very, very strong news flow and I'll say have to say out of ASCO a strengthening and deepening of our presence in oncology. And we do not really foresee immediate heavy competition, but we never take competitors lightly, but at least I think we've got that now in perspective.</p>
          <p>On inflammation autoimmune on page 19, 19% growth in that area and the highlights really are an increasing adoption of MabThera/Rituxan into rheumatoid arthritis and of Actemra, which has been approved in Japan, is having the upcoming FDA advisory panel on July the 29 and that keeps us on track for the action date in the autumn and we would hope to be able to launch before the year-end in the United States and then early next year in Europe. You saw the data presented at EULAR, and I think a lot of this story is getting stronger and stronger.</p>
          <p>Metabolism, page 21, Boniva, 51% growth, as I mentioned earlier, really performed strongly, despite the genericization of Fosamax in the United States and the increasing generic adoptions in Europe with highly focused activities in Europe driving strong growth and good growth in the United States also.</p>
          <p>For NeoRecormon, Epogin, Mircera, a much more challenging environment. A number of biosimilars now present in some of the key European markets, most notably Germany. We saw a 14% overall reduction in revenues from this franchise, 10% of NeoRecormon in the Roche territory. This is primarily a reduction in pricing. We have kept the volume business but it is a reduction on pricing. So again, it comes back to our performance on the operating profit line has been very good because we've compensated for a lot of this.</p>
          <p>In this area you know that the CETP inhibition, we're now recruiting in Phase III. GLP-1 the decision made for Phase III and recruitment will start in the second half year. The DPP IV did not result in weight loss and is now an out-licensing candidate. This will not be pursued by Roche. We are being consequent to our high hurdles that we have for development. And on the P4 alpha gamma we have some fascinating data, really fascinating, not yet in a format to share with you. I haven't heard back from the Disease Biology Leadership team yet with still some further data on renal to come, but this is going to be a very interesting property to think about.</p>
          <p>In virology, Tamiflu very much on track. If you remember, we signaled 1.7 billion reduction for the full year. We have one billion reduced already in the half year, but that's absolutely on track.</p>
          <p>Pegasys, we saw some modest growth, which is a return to growth from slight decline in the first quarter, and market share growing, markets in the U.S. and Europe not growing and so the volume growth tends to be coming from the emerging countries, from Russia, from Brazil and from some parts of the Far East, where Hepatitis B is much more the troublesome element.</p>
          <p>So finally, for the first half year, on track with all the clinical trials, on track with the submissions. As of today MabThera and chronic lymphocytic leukemia has just been submitted, so that's also another tick in the box, and we are on track for our guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand over to J&#xFC;rgen Schwiezer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentleman, Roche Diagnostics continues to grow above the market with 11% growth, in local currency for the half year, further extending our market leadership. Diabetes Care returned to growth, based on the strong growth of the new products and above all instrument placements. All business areas contributed to this growth, with particularly strong contributions from Professional Diagnostics and Applied Science.</p>
          <p>Immunochemistry continues to be main driver in Professional Diagnostics with the 11% growth, over double the market. During the first half of this year we launched eight new tests which will positively influence these trends.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that Diabetes Care returned to positive growth in the second quarter with 7% worldwide, and 9% in the U.S. Molecular Diagnostics maintained its market share based on the strong <mark type="inaudible" />. In Applied Science <mark type="inaudible" /> sequencing business grew over 100%, in comparison to Roche's double-digit market growth.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'm happy to report on an extremely successful tissue diagnostics business. Integration of the former Ventana group was more than on track and the business in standalone base grew by 27%, which is clearly ahead of competition. Nevertheless our strong investments in business and our strategic acquisitions have had an impact on our operating profit in the near term, with a margin decline of 8.6% from 12.2%. Half was caused by the recent acquisitions, in particular Ventana, 454 and <mark type="inaudible" /> and the other half due to investments in the ongoing business, in particular the enlargement of sales forces, instrument replacements, and research. Number of these items are one-time effect; therefore we're expecting already the second half of year the improvement of the situation.</p>
          <p>We have already launched a number of new tests and systems in the first half of the year. We will proceed with this in the second half of the year so that the growth will continue in the period to come.</p>
          <p>So I hand it over to Erich.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Ladies and gentleman. If we turn to chart 35, you see that the cost of development is in line with our expectations and with what we have on that sheet. There is the clear commitment to R&amp;D as we have informed you at the beginning of the year, if you see this 6% in G&amp;A, you will see that there are some long time effects in it.</p>
          <p>If you turn to chart 37, you see a positive development of the tax rate. I think it's a nice effect as you can see that now for the first half year, this year, that the group core tax rate of Roche has come down to 11.7%.</p>
          <p>From a cash flow perspective, the first half year, of course is always the weaker year, because we pay out our dividend, so that's what you find in chart 38. The 4 million dividend paid and of course also the investment paid out into tissue diagnostics Ventana and our increase in our Chugai shareholding.</p>
          <p>This leaves us with a solid net cash position of 10.1 billion and if you have a look on chart 39, I think, this shows you that Roche core is more or less debt free. We have constantly denatured our debt over the last four, five years in a significant manner, with just 1.298 billion short-term debt left over and this by the way will be decreased in the second quarter of this year. So, we move into a transaction which we've now we will now address out of a position of strength.</p>
          <p>And with this, I hand over to Severin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Erich. So if we move on to the Genentech transaction, again page three. You have seen we made an offer of $89 per share, which represents a total investment of close to $44 billion.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to emphasize again is that our offers is both fair and generous, in particular, if we consider that we already have a controlling stake in Genentech. Now, why do we do this transaction, why do we do this transaction now?</p>
          <p>Let me first emphasize again as outlined on page five, that our strategy for Roche remains unchanged. We will continue to focus on pharma and diagnostic; we will continue to focus on medical differentiation; we will continue our decentralized management approach, our "hub and spokes" approach, and that is very much the case also for the Genentech transaction. This is not a mega merger of overlapping organization focused on cost rationalization. This is going private for two organizations, which are already very complementary. Of course, we will also, as in the past, strive for efficiency. Now how does Genentech fit into the picture?</p>
          <p>If you turn to page six, you can see that at the time when we took the majority ownership in Genentech in 1990 eighteen years ago, this was still a relatively small biotech venture, heavily focused on research and development. And due to the enormous success of Genentech, Genentech has developed from a relatively small company to a company which now has the turnover of $12 billion, a company which has 11,000 employees. And as you can see on page eight, it is now a company where research and development is still very important, but a company which also has sizable activities in manufacturing, commercial, administration and other areas.</p>
          <p>Now, if we move forward and look at the key objectives when building a combined Genentech and Roche, let me emphasize again how important it is that we keep the unique and very science-driven culture at Genentech and build on that. At Roche, we believe that innovation has a lot to do with diversity of approaches in research and it is for that reason that we want to keep the Genentech Founders Research Center as a separate unit. But on top of it, as a combined organization we will be able to share intellectual properties, technologies and external networks. So, research and early development will be very much as the focus on this transaction and it is very much our intention to not only preserve the culture of Genentech but to build on it and enhance innovation.</p>
          <p>If it comes to the other functions such as late development, manufacturing, commercial or administration, now with the success of the two companies and the two parallel structures which have been built up in the U.S. we do see a moment to reduce complexity, eliminate duplications in certain areas and eventually also leverage the combined scale in the U.S. on the commercial side.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to cover Erich some of the financial aspects of this transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Severin. If we turn to chart 23, you have again the summary of the transaction as it is planned. Let me stress two points I have already stressed this morning. First of all, to make things absolutely clear, there is nobody else in the game because Roche does not even think of divesting its majority share holding in Genentech. So, this is the deal between Genentech and the minority shareholders of Genentech.</p>
          <p>The other element and as always with due respect we read everything which is written and there is a lot of speculation around the premium and please again, ladies and gentlemen, I firmly invite you to respect that we already own Genentech in the sense that we already have control of Genentech and this is not an acquisition where you have to buy and to pay a high premium for change of control. So, what this is, is taking private. Yes, it's very big one. It's maybe the biggest one, we don't want to go for this rankings more so but I invite you really to see if you analyze other similar transactions of taking companies private where the &#x2013; actually mother company has already a controlling stake in the company. With this you will find out that the premium we offer to the minority shareholders of Genentech is actually full and generous.</p>
          <p>So, if we go to the next chart on page 24 and also there we have studied the models which were developed by some of you this morning of course as a learning exercise. We have given you a range of synergies of 750 to 850 million. This is really our net cash at this moment and again this strategy is, the primary driver for this move is not reaching our cost. As Severin has pointed out, the whole innovation will be shielded and on the other hand, it's only if realistic at certain other function where we have clear <mark type="inaudible" /> in one geographic area will have to be aligned</p>
          <p>So, the deal is highly accretive actually from the second year after closing. And this morning certainly who didn't want to dig into model, I made a comparison and forgive me, it maybe a simple comparison, but I said many of our peers for several years have bought back shares. Some of them even raised debt to buy back shares. So actually if you compare this transaction, what did they do? What to peers do with buying back shares? They actually buy back shares to destroy them, so that the same profit actually will be distributed to fewer shareholders and therefore increasing earnings per share.</p>
          <p>What we are doing, we leave the Roche share and the new shareholders the same, but we buy the net profits which up to now go to the minority shareholders of Genentech, we buy them the net profit. And of course we have some charges against it, but in the end, this is highly accretive because we then channel these profits, which up to now were not acceptable on to our shareholders. And I will just come to the accounting of this channeling in a moment.</p>
          <p>The other element and I think everybody has to understand our entrepreneurial perspective. We acquired Genentech 1990 and they developed as we all say again and again very respectfully into an icon and into really a very admired company. But we should not forget that the first 10 years were quite tough for this company also and that it will able to prosper also under this shield of actually Roche.</p>
          <p>If we now see as we have now ended up in a situation where Roche as a group earns a lot of cash from U.S. customers, but of course the cash is very clearly in the cashbook of Genentech and we have very clear respect, we orchestrated everything at arms length. So this cash is not available at the moment for the developing of the Roche group's position into United States market and with the move we are making today, this cash will become available primarily to further develop our position in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>And this leads me to chart number 25. And let me take the accounting first. There are very clear IFRS rules established and we have implemented them as you can see in the actuary's report. And I really invite everybody who wants to do a modeling go into actually, the details of our financial revenue and how we have accounted for the upping of our shareholding in Chugai and then you will find exactly the accounting measures will be applied after closing of the transaction with the minority shareholders of Genentech, which means everything goes against equity.</p>
          <p>It may sound strange to you, but I invite you to go for the details and we will have accounting workshop background material for you tomorrow to understand it. And I think that's very important. So, there will be definitely no goodwill charges, there will be no amortization of intangibles. This will all be a one-time effort against our equity at the moment of the closing.</p>
          <p>Of course, our balance sheet will look for a moment reasonably strange but I can assure you that we have totally open discussions with the two rating agencies with which we have worked for several years now, Moody's and Standard and Poor's, and they have fully understood the accounting, and by the way, we have also a clear opinion of our officer <mark type="inaudible" /> that this application is absolutely in line with the existing accounting standards.</p>
          <p>So, for Moody's and Standard and Poor's, not the balance sheet as such is in the foreground. For them of course it is very important that we now have access to all the cash in the whole Roche Group. Our strong AA plus rating at the moment was based just on the Roche group accessible cash flows. So the whole situation of Genentech was anyway taken out and these two agencies over the next hours or days will establish their own opinion and then they will let the market know how they ranked the Roche Group actually under the new scenario.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the question of debt. It may surprise you or not that we don't just announce you that everything had been perfectly banked, XYZ. But you may respect that in today's environment, we take our own words with the rating agencies and we take also various scenarios into contact with our core bank. But we didn't go as far as securing all this financing for the deal. Why is this? I think we have invited this morning all potential partners primarily, our core banks but other are also invited to submit us clear financial proposals, how they want to support us in this transaction. And I can tell you from the feedback and from the work we have done over the last week, for me, it's not the question whether Roche can finance this deal, it's a question at which condition we can finance this transaction.</p>
          <p>So this leads me to the next step on page 26, and here also having heard your questions, having seen your articles, we kindly invite you to respect the process. Successfully, very successfully Genentech and Roche since 1990 and as per the new floating in 1999 have worked together as partners, under the so-called affiliation agreement. This is the legal documentation which is totally transparent, which each of you can read in detail and this affiliation agreement was a very clever plan, and design of potential scenarios, which could develop actually and this affiliation agreement also leads to ways in how this transaction will now happen. And this means we have made the offer to the so called independent Directors of the Genentech Board because they will from now on represent the minority shareholders of Genentech. And it's important, is not that the Genentech management has to negotiate with the Roche management about this transaction. It is actually the independent Directors committee, totally independent and they will form their own opinion. They will have their own legal advisors and they will have their own financial advisors, independent from the company. I think this is very important because we have to respect that the daily contact with Genentech will go on as always also during the so-called discussion phase which will now follow. And that it's also obvious that the three Roche directors on the Genentech Board will be totally out of this process and that we will not be involved in any of these negotiations and plus we'll continue to build the bridge into the daily or in to the activities of Genentech.</p>
          <p>This process, and we now should respect that we had the surprise due to the overall environment in three individuals with our offer over the weekend. And we should now give them the time to get aligned to form their opinion and we will then respect that they will come back to us and actually discuss our proposal base on the opinions they get. And this process in the end will lead into a so called merger agreement, which we then hopefully with submit to the minority shareholders of Genentech and the process is then that the majority which means 50.000 and so on percent of the non-Roche shareholders of Genentech have to approve it and if we achieved it then the deal will close.</p>
          <p>So, with this I think we can turn to page 27 but let's now over to platform for your questions. And as I said this morning and I created some laughter I think amongst community, this is also a half year conference call but please nobody should feel ashamed to ask a pharma or even diagnostics question. We now should have one hour to answer your questions. So can we have the first question please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just trying to get a sense of what the margin impact of all the transfer payments are associated &#x2013; that would be eliminated if the two companies came together. I know some of this information is tough to obtain. But is there any rough guidance as to what might be eliminated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what's very important is that since we already control Genentech, the fact that we move from the actual controlling shareholding into 100% does not change any legal obligations nor the tax situation. So this will not allow us just to change anything at will.</p>
          <p>So as I said in this morning's conference call, the actual situation of products like Herceptin, MabThera and Avastin will not just change from one day to the other. There might be over time opportunities about renegotiations legally about future studies on expansion of these products. But for the short to medium term on the core products, please don't assume that margin-wise or tax rate-wise, fundamental change will just happen.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, of course, anything where there is no contract yet between Genentech and Roche we now have the new flexibility to look at things, of course always also respecting if we order across the border, that we respect at arm's length what's happening in the United States market and what's happening outside the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm getting at is a potential for your margins to improve beyond 2015, if the opten arrange. Obviously if you're negotiating against yourself in some ways, you could make that margin very beneficial, a big margin impact. But it wouldn't really work that way. But what I'm trying to get a sense of is what might clear from your P&amp;L beyond 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, you see, you know exactly that if we're talking anything which is beyond five years, and then you discount it to our time, I mean we are already in a very big crunch, sharp area in bandwidth. I mean we haven't speculated about 2015 and what this could impact. We were driven by the actual perspective of improving the overall situation of our group now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The first question I had was other than the cost and R&amp;D synergies that you mentioned on the conference call, can you comment on what other factors drove your decision? And also, do you have increased confidence in the Avastin adjuvant or the Tarceva phase III readouts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think the &#x2013; let me just to be clear, R&amp;D synergies are positive synergies, and usually in American English, synergies mean cost cutting. And that's not what we're talking about with this particular move. What we're talking about is an enhancement of the diversity of our R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Specifically, if you're coming to the portfolio question on Avastin and Tarceva, we have no new insights into either of these clinical trials than we've had in recent months. We all wait for the six-month update on Avastin adjuvant, which is due before the end of this year &#x2013; that's the American study that's running &#x2013; and the <mark type="inaudible" /> other studies will read out when they do read out.</p>
          <p>Do we have confidence in the work that we're doing? Yes, we do. We have shared the confidence that we have with you in some of these programs, but we have no new knowledge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one element to mention in our strategic alternatives when we did the scenarios is of course the currency impact. I mean, you know that the U.S. dollar against currencies which are very important for cash generation in our group like the euro or Swiss franc is at a historic low, and of course this was one of the many elements which started to fit into the mosaic which in the end actually gave us a drive to really look into these projects very detailed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just ask a follow-up. So can you just talk about the timing of the offer? Because it comes in at a time when you're expecting multiple data, significant multiple data readouts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the timing was driven from our strategic process from our board sequence. I mean, we always have during this time of the year first a strategic business plan process, evaluating all the options of the future, and then this is always also followed by an outside meeting with our board where we then present various alternatives. And this time we came to the conclusion, very firmly, from the board and from the executive committee of Roche, that this is the right way to go for this time point.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Maykin Ho from Goldman Sachs. Based on the agreement that you had with Genentech back in '99 in terms of business combinations, the way I look at it, I just want to clarify because previously you said that you expect price to be acceptable. So just in case it is not based on this agreement then, it seems like two independent banks would be asked to determine the price, and assuming that they divide the price, is it true, then, that would be the price that you would go with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's much too short an interpretation of an extremely complex process. So let's make it very clear. What is on the table now is a merger agreement, and we have not even started discussions. And I invite all of you to read through the details, the legal documents which are available in public and to form your opinion.</p>
          <p>And as Severin has said, at the moment we operate on the table and our base case is that it will end into a merger agreement. And I would not speculate at this time point what would happen if in the end there wouldn't be a merger agreement. Of course there are alternatives which then could develop further. But I think it is in the interest of everybody involved, all the stakeholders, that we actually follow exactly the process we have started.</p>
          <p>But I also have to object to [audio skip] and/or alternative as you just have described it. It's not that easy, just that it's either a merger agreement or these opinions of the investment bank. It's a much more complex process. would be if we wouldn't actually finally find a solution based on the merger agreement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. And this wasn't coordinated, I promise. Just one question on the deal and two more on the results. Firstly &#x2013; but following up from the previous question, and I don't know if it's just a question of semantics. You talked about a negotiation process, and clearly there is an offer here on the table. So can you just help us here? Are we talking about a process, or is this very much &#x2013; here's an offer, and the response you get back is a black and white yes or no? What then happens? Are there discussions or where do we go from there?</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the results themselves -- and I will ask on diagnostics -- did I hear right that we're expecting a significant improvement in the second half margin in diagnostics? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. And then Erich, full-year tax rate, if you can make any comments on that, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may take the first question on the further process, it is the duty of the independent directors to form an opinion. And therefore they will &#x2013; this is our expectation, seek financial and legal advice, and we don't want to push them. They should took their time. They should look at it. And we are very confident that if they look at all the aspects of the transaction, they will find it very attractive for the shareholders.</p>
          <p>So this is why we are confident that our offer of $89 will be attractive for the shareholders; it is generous. Again, as we have pointed out several times today, this is not an acquisition. This is ,I think, private, where we go from control to control. With this perhaps if we can take the diagnostics question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Severin, could I just come back to you there &#x2013; and I understand what you're saying with regard to the deal and your belief in a fair price, et cetera. I'm just trying to understand the process. If they were to come back and say this is not acceptable, what then happens? Do you engage potentially in some sort of negotiation process or what happens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if they would come back and say it is not acceptable, I would assume that they would also give us reasons why they believe it is not acceptable, and we would explain why we see it differently. And I'm very sure that in constructive discussions, we will come to a conclusion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Diagnostics answer and as I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, half of this decline was caused by the recent acquisitions, in particular Ventana for platform NimbleGen and the other half was due to investment in ongoing business, for example, <mark type="inaudible" /> in the U.S. and diabetes, and instrument placement in research and some of these items are one time effects. And therefore, we are expecting already in second half improvements of this situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you come to the full year tax rate, if you remember it was around the half year last year that we implemented certain new achievements we had for Roche core. So we already had quite an attractive overall tax rate for the second half year of last year. So this nice effect which we showed this year in the first half for Roche will be diluted in the second half year of last year, already having had a better tax rate.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Still looking to understand the Genentech transaction a little bit. I looked back to the Ventana transaction that was done, and in that transaction it was articulated that you had made a fair offering in the final closing of that. There was the argument that was put forth that they articulated a strategy as to why the transaction was actually more valuable and you ultimately came to their point of view. In this case, as you've pointed out, you are already owners of Genentech with a full understanding of operations in the inside point of view and potential synergies. Is it reasonable to think that it's unlikely that they're able to articulate anything that you don't know in this case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are absolutely right, that the situation between Genentech and Ventana is very different. First of all, Ventana was a full fledged acquisition and Genentech is going private. So this is a completely different base to start with. And related to that, as you rightly point out, if that we wouldn't pay a control premium. Also very important, there wouldn't be a potential inflow, but in this process because we already own the control. And that changes the dynamic of such process substantially as you can imagine. And you are also right, in this case due to the close collaboration which we already have with Genentech, we have a much more detailed insight compared to the situation of Ventana where we didn't know their enterprise before we did the due diligence. So Genentech, there is no need to do due diligence. We know this organization well enough.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess &#x2013; just an outsider's point of view, I'm grappling with the question if I were in Genentech's shoes, I'd look back to Ventana transaction, where you made statements that are very similar to what you're making now and ended up increasing the offer. Is there any point of view that you put forth to prevent the Board from looking at your recent path and looking to...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit to what extent Nutley has been triggered to your decision? I think about the upcoming generic roles, CellCept, Hep C franchise not growing anymore, Mircera not before 2013 and tougher times for Boniva. So that's the kind of things I have &#x2013; I keep in mind when thinking about Nutley. The second question is again regarding timing. To what extent can an unexpected &#x2013; maybe earlier news flow or even the expected news flow jeopardize to negotiating of a final price, because you're saying yourself it could still happen towards the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks, Marcel, for bringing up the question. Clearly, each year when we do a long-range business plan, we are looking at a 10-year provision. So none of this &#x2013; given the history, we've had with Genentech is looking at short-termism, we are looking at a long-term approach. There is certainly, a more challenging environment generally in the United States, and I think it doesn't matter, which party becomes in power next. Pharmaceutical sector will have a certain scrutiny. The forecast for growth are more modest for the total sector.</p>
          <p>So there are some commercial influences that can't see just same. Yes, it fully makes sense to be tighter and we are running the operation in North America. And it's peripheral to the main event, which is, we want to enhance the research and development. We want to have all this scrutiny intellectual property in the run applied and accessible by both parties and having to &#x2013; partly interest. I think there is an all politic strength that can come from that and there are these peripheral benefits that we've outlined in the master integration plan. I think it's also interested in it's further endorsed it deployment in <mark type="inaudible" /> committee about this being &#x2013; going private.</p>
          <p>Firmly, you would not expect people to be announcing integration plans and the details we had shared with the city &#x2013; and that is primarily because of the nature of the dealer itself and the way the confidence that we have in going forward. If we take then your point about news flow again, we're not being opportunistic. We're not just trying to spot from time with &#x2013; between events a year. And we know that by and large the city has been itself incorporated from the near-term news flow into both our price and the Genentech's price. So guided by that, that is also the influence on our offer. Okay, Marcel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean but my question remains open. What happens if all negotiation just drags on to through the end of the year and we see the adjuvant data, would you &#x2013; or I guess you would adjust your offer price or what would happen? Or do you &#x2013; what's going to happen?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. All of my questions have been answered. I'd like to start though with one that you may or may not answer. But perhaps you could help the investment community, especially from the Genentech side, help us understand: What do you believe the probability of success for Avastin in the adjuvant colon cancer trial is? And we need to understand that so we can help understand how much value you're paying for that right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've seen from the investment community an enormous amount &#x2013; I'm actually impressed by the Ph.D.s and statistics that are in or on the call. An enormous amount of speculation of the way of interpreting the study design, the probabilities, the percentage readouts for each time. I believe that we're getting to a point whereby the end of this year, there's an increasing possibility of a readout. I don't know if it will be positive or negative, but it will be a readout.</p>
          <p>What we do believe from our first principles &#x2013; and I've shared with the investment community before &#x2013; is that this molecule should work from its very mode of action. And by now we've shared safety.</p>
          <p>So there are two clear dimensions that we have shared with the investment community. And which I will hope give you a certain confidence. What is still in the lap of the Gods and the statistics is whether the strength of that signal is greater than 25% improvement in the survival benefit per patients. And that's the unknown.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then just to be clear, following up on a couple other questions, and then I'll &#x2013; this is my last one. Thank you for bearing with me. Do the actual 1999 spin documents require that the minority shareholders approved any transaction like this? What I'm trying to get at is, you have stated at this transaction require approval from the minority shareholders. I'm trying to understand, if that right of the minority shareholders could under any circumstances be taken away, or should we think about an absolutely rock solid right for the minority shareholders in this process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, after a merger agreement has been put forward to the minority shareholders, it is enough to have over 50% of the minority shareholders to approve the transaction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And three questions on the diabetes portfolio, just one on the GLP-1 analogue bill. Could you provide some perspectives on Phase III program in terms of recruiting patients to head up an FDA Advisory Committee or post-FDA Advisory Committee and before the FDA has come back with its official thought process? And then just on the PPAR alpha gamma. any color on what you find fascinating about the data you've seen thus far?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for the GLP-1 one, you're absolutely right, there is this draft guideline from the FDA. We are encouraged so far in the interactions we have with the FDA that they are buying into the Phase III program as proposed to the patient numbers and so forth. And so from what we see right now, we are broadly in line with the indications we have given for 2010 submission. So I think we are &#x2013; so far so good. There's still to be a formal sign-off and we'll need to see what that does. But actually so far so good. For the PPAR alpha gamma, it's got a multitude of positive signs to it. If you share this with a group of independent doctors, they would be wildly excited and then the caveat comes in that it's a PPAR alpha gamma.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen. Two questions for Erich or maybe broader. Erich, just going back to the comments you've been making about the strategic use of cash. If we can move away from earnings accretion, as that is not necessarily the reflection of value creation, what you're saying is you find it better to use the cash buying Genentech for the outstanding stake at $89, which suggests that for you, that stake is worth more than the 89. I just wondered why you think it's worth more to you but not the Genentech minority shareholders. And maybe following on from that, if I look opt in agreements that you have in place right now until 2014, 15, it seems to me that a lot of the strategic value of your proposed offer is in the period after that. What do you think you can or will be doing to retain staff to make sure that Genentech at that point in time will still have the value that you have today, given that your previous statements have been that you think an arms length relationship with a biotech organization is a better way to organize the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regard to the financial question, I don't expect you to &#x2013; that you expect an answer from me. I think we have done our modeling and we have based on all the analysis of single cases of typing companies private, we have put a very good offer on the table. And we wouldn't be &#x2013; it's the first day that the offer is out and we wouldn't have made it if it wouldn't be a clear offer here.</p>
          <p>So I think it's up to you and that will be practical read your report about who &#x2013; how you access the overall situation. But please, I mean you cannot expect that in addition to the elements for the modeling, we have given to you that we give additional elements.</p>
          <p>Now coming to the &#x2013; and we have stressed and I have seen and fully supported &#x2013; this is not a spreadsheet deal. This is a strategic deal. And I think that the yardstick will be, and I think we accept this challenge as a management team, that what we say that we have a model to preserve the innovation engine, will be through in three, four, five years from now. And that is brilliant spirit for which everybody around this table has the highest respect. It's not actually extinguished by any activities we are doing.</p>
          <p>And I hope that the commitment by our Chairman, the commitment by our CEO, the commitment by our CEO of the Parma division that we all have worked very clearly and a lot of intensive discussions around exactly this issue, because the spreadsheet was the easier part of it. But I think this shows you that we really mean it and that we really want to go into a very constructive process forwards.</p>
          <p>And I think, one element, which we haven't stressed at this moment, but was also important for everybody who could be affected by this. There is a clear commitment to go for the best in every situation. And I think there were discussions where we made it very clear that it's not a Roche person in the end who will decide but that we will have also external advice to evaluate the best course in situations where we actually will have to take the choice. We have two options and we will reduce to one, but this does not effect in any manner research and early development. This is totally protected as a clear commitment from everybody from Roche.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To add on what Erich just said, this is Severin again, in terms of the retention of the Genentech people, I think this is a key question, and I just would like to reiterate from my side, how big the respect for Genentech's achievement, how big the respect for Genentech's culture. It's not only with the Roche management; I think throughout the organization at Roche. And you have seen from today's announcement that we have sent very, very strong signals to Genentech how much we appreciate the strength Genentech brings into our organization. We have talked a lot about keeping the independence of research and early development to foster this culture.</p>
          <p>Very important, we have announced with a great level of detail, as Bill has elaborated, our new structure. And part of this is that the U.S. headquarters and the U.S. headquarters for the commercial organization will be moved from Nutley, from the East Coast, to Genentech, to the West Coast. And we will operate in the U.S. under the Genentech brand, another very, very strong signal how much we believe in the value of Genentech and in the reputation of Genentech in the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Michael Leacock, ABN AMRO. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions if I may, one on Genentech, one on cost of goods. The Genentech. It seems to me you've mentioned very strongly the idea of keeping the culture of Genentech in this new structure. But I notice you'll arguably be putting about 25,000 U.S. employees of Roche into a structure of 11,000 Genentech employees. Just wondering, thinking about management of that, how you will keep that unique Genentech culture given -- dilution might not be a better word you would like, but the dilution of the Genentech culture by the current Roche culture?</p>
          <p>And then if I can on cost of goods, in Pharmaceuticals your manufacturing cost of goods sold and period costs is down 11% to just 12% of sales. I was wondering, Bill, you know, just how much further down can you go from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How low can you go, Michael? Thanks for the question. Maybe just for clarity, the Roche Group has approximately 25,000 employees in North America. Of that about 17, 17,500 are in Pharmaceuticals. So that tells you that there is probably twice as many people working for Genentech as work for Roche Pharma.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we intend to keep the Diagnostics operations because that makes the difference. We want to keep the Diagnostics operations, as today, completely independent from Pharma. Already today, Diagnostics operates out of different sites and out of different legal entities. So what is really relevant here is the comparison within Pharma, and clearly Genentech is by far a bigger organization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think that, although there are real challenges when you are moving a number of people around the country that this huge undertaking involves, there is a high respect in this company for individuals, a high respect to look after people. That's part of the roots, the gene pool of our own organization, just as much as it is in Genentech. Both organizations are passionate about trying to make a difference for patients' lives. You see it on the Genentech sites and the pictures; you will see at as you travel in some of the Roche campuses. So I do believe that Roche as a company is not typical itself of Big Pharma. Two-thirds of the entire sales now are coming from monoclonal antibodies and proteins. And that's not all from the Genentech sourcing. So there is, I think, an enormous understanding with each other over many years of contact. So I do think this will be a little bit easier than you outline, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Splendid.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Full of challenges. Cost of goods. So clearly, there' a series of initiatives that have been underway for a number of years: closing sites, reducing inventories, focusing on technologies in certain sites. So that's been underway for a number of years and tends to have a sort of modest incremental benefit year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Another clear dimension is the product mix and just the size and scale that some of the brands are getting to and the operational efficiencies that come with that product mix. And then, a little sting in the tail, this year versus last year, last year we had about 150 million &#x2013; 115 million Swiss francs that we had to write off for VIRACEPT that was with a very high level of impurities, and we do not have that write-off this year. So you've got some underlying benefits here, but you've also got a bit of a one-off effect.</p>
          <p>And as to the future, as I said to many of you regularly, we do have continuing downward pressures on prices, particularly in Europe. This is average one to two percentage points per year. And so the first operational improvements that need to come in in our supply chain have to offset those downward pressures on pricing before they can start to be released to the bottom line. But we continue diligently to try and keep the cost of goods low. Okay, Michael?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My first question relates to NeoRecormon and to CHMP recommendation that in future cancer patients who can tolerate blood transfusions should be getting that rather than EPOGEN. I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on what you think the likelihood of that getting implemented is, what the timelines are, and what the potential impact on NeoRecormon sales could be. I mean, my understanding was always that basically after EPOGEN hit the market, blood transfusions were a thing of the past. So is it fair to assume that up to one-third of the NeoRecormon sales could be at stake?</p>
          <p>And then my follow-on questions actually relate to the Genentech deal again. I was wondering whether you can elaborate a little bit on the IP you are getting in the antigenesis space and elsewhere, and maybe give us a little bit more flavor to what extent you are now able to do things that you would not otherwise have been able to do.</p>
          <p>Also with regard to R&amp;D, you clearly want to keep the Genentech culture. So I presume you want to keep the main scientists. And I was just wondering whether in addition to the consideration of 43.7 billion, we should be factoring in additional one-off costs from lock-up arrangements to incentivize the scientists to stay or generally what you think is the best way to incentivize the R&amp;D people to stay on.</p>
          <p>And then a couple of very small questions, Genentech in the Q1 call was very clear that they were looking to make acquisitions. And I was wondering whether you would definitely standby your offer regardless of any acquisitions that Genentech might announce or if there some sort of a material adverse change clause that would allow you to step away from the offer. And the final question I was just wondering who your main advisor is on the Genentech deal. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marietta, for the shopping list. So I'm here to help here on &#x2013; first of all on the erythropoietin and blood transfusions. Yes, there have been some people advising the blood &#x2013; as you said blood transfusion have a role. The obvious difficulty, historically, has been to get enough blood. There just usually isn't enough in supply for some of it. What is actually helping us enormously has been a large prospect of meta-analysis of all the NeoRecormon studies that are being conducted in cancer, if on label. And here we can certainly say that that data is supportive of the continuing use of NeoRecormon in the oncology setting, and that there is no downside to this. So at the moment we still find that our once-weekly NeoRecormon is a good and compelling product to sell in the market and with good data to support its use in oncology. So I don't see that your hypothesis of losing up to one-third is correct.</p>
          <p>Europe, if you remember, has always had a lower use of erythropoietins in the oncology area than in the United States and has been a more prudent correction of the hemoglobin than it has been what we saw from the use in some arenas in the U.S. And of course, it was the use and overshooting that caused some of the problems. So both the ODAC [Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee] advisory panel and the European we fully factored into the way we are moving forward and what we see is NeoRecormon has still a strong role in oncology, has a strong role where price is the key determinant in contracting with dialysis centers where MIRCERA is just operational savings that they are looking for come in. In pre-dialysis, MIRCERA has a clear role. Just for non-MIRCERA, as I mentioned earlier, encouraged by the take-off so far on MIRCERA modest as it is, it's comparable to the take-off same time post launch of Aramis. Does that help on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah just to clarify. I mean if the CHMP were to adopt that recommendation about the blood transfusion for EPOGEN generally. Do you then think you would have the data to prevent this being included in the NeoRecormon label as you actually think that to the extent that some of your cancer patients on NeoRecormon are currently able to receive blood transfusion, but &#x2013; and to the extent that there would be enough blood you might loose those patients?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You should view this as a class issue rather than that it's going to be possible to take one molecule completely out of the rest of the discussion. I think you have to view that as the CHMP reviewed this that they will see that there is a considerable data that says there is a clear role for erythropoietin. So I don't see that this is going to be as major a threat as you are outlining it.</p>
          <p>If I move then to anti-angiogenesis, the first element that we did in the first half-year is a deal with BioInvent and ThromboGenics in Belgium. This is a potential growth factor, which we know has a role &#x2013; it's an early project. But we know that it has a very complementary role to Avastin as an anti-angiogenic. There is a new repilitin line of research at such an early stage with Genentech and we've just opted in a few weeks ago to that program.</p>
          <p>And I think the other instinct I mentioned is both teams have been looking at biomarkers, are there any ways in which we can predict more satisfactorily outcomes to Avastin intervention. I would have say at the moment, the answer is no. But there is data that is generated and if that could be more openly shared, also given the Ventana now is a part of the group, then it may be possible to see some synergies coming out of this, either in biomarkers or in additional lines of research that could results in molecules that are complementary to Avastin.</p>

          <p>We have to respect the model that we created and the model that our very good colleagues in Genentech operate on there is &#x2013; they are majority owned by Roche and they have minority shareholders. Therefore there cannot be an exclusive relationship with the majority shareholders. That is part of the mandate of the management team of Genentech. And so if intellectual property is created that has an added value, it does not automatically flow into Roche. And that's an impediment which could be removed by Genentech being 100% part of Roche and the other way around --</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also the other way round is that we have something as interesting as the ThromboGenics molecule this does not automatically go into Genentech because then we would be giving a free gift to minority shareholders in Genentech. So it is part of the structure of the deal that we have to respect and this is no criticism of our colleagues or the Roche, it is a practical reality of today's business model.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add comments on a very important question you had regarding the retention of the Genentech scientists, which I believe indeed is a very, very important point not only now, until the closing of this transaction plus beyond. And I would like to broaden the answer a bit beyond financial packages. I truly believe that it is most important for scientists to provide them with the right environment and that has a lot to do with freedom, freedom of intellect, focus of biology and science, and environment, that the necessary funds are provided so that scientists can make their dreams come true. It is also about financial packages, but it is above all about protecting the culture and providing an environment where they feel respected and where they feel as an important part of the organization. And certainly, for the packages itself, it is too early to discuss details. It will take considerable time until we come to the closing. It will take certainly several months until this transaction will close. But be assured we will provide the employees with attractive and competitive packages to stay on board.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your last two questions, you see of course, the three Roche representatives on the Genentech part will abstain totally from anything, which has to do with our offer. But on the other hand, we are fully going owned and the cooperation, the ongoing cooperation between Genentech and Roche goes forward as it was in the past, which means if ever they came up with a proposal for an acquisition this comes to the Board and of course, then Roche will continue to be able to form its opinion whether this makes sense, or whether it doesn't make sense. As we have help to evaluate any special proposals, which came up. And there we are of course totally allowed to vote in the interest of Roche, of the majority owner. And the last short question, I hope this one will remain short, just to give others also the opportunities to ask questions, our financial advisor at the moment is Greenhill. Okay. Can we have the next question please?</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions, just coming on the point on retention again, can you just quickly, very quickly run through how the equity component of the Roche compensation works, whether it's restricted to stock only options and how many layers of management it affects and how that can be applied to Genentech's employees, particularly in view of &#x2013; that you do not have an ADR and I think the Swiss francs is something, which is even more of an alien concept on the bay area than maybe Nutley?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just again on the long-term strategic rationale. I mean, I do get two points of it, which is obviously you need to have a solution, you need to work out solutions for 2015 rather sooner than later. I do get the point about the operational efficiency, but this whole concept of enhancing the ability to innovate is still difficult for me to grasp, and I was just wondering whether this is something &#x2013; there is some insight from your recent reorganization of your own R&amp;D, which may have got you two ideas, and whether you could elaborate on that point?</p>

          <p>So maybe just one point that may be is missing, we do actually have stock SARs [Stock Acquisition Rights] in the United States and those are described in the Annual Report on page 69. Thank you, Ian, reliable as ever and it's not quite on the top paragraph 4 Alexandra but I think it's page 69 on the Annual Report, so we do have a stock SAR program. We do have a significant number of the management team in the United States already as part of their incentive package with SARs and what we do believe is that we will come up with a good comparable package in total to the Genentech employees. That's still being worked on, but, you know, it may not be absolutely identical, but it will be a good comparable package for them to &#x2013; benefit to continue. In terms --</p>

          <p>The fact that it is Swiss franc based and it's not rated really actively in the U.S. is going to be an issue and therefore you may finally need to move to something like an official ADR listing.</p>

          <p>Severin, you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra, be sure we will find a solution to come up with attractive and competitive packages. We will manage that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also on the long term strategy, there's nothing as a short-term trigger, Alexandra. There's a complete aggregation here. Now, you may not see it from a financial window, but, in our experience, and I think Severin was summarizing it just a moment ago, researchers are a special breed. Their passion is to find enough new science, so they can make a difference in medicine. And it's because of patent lawyers in the room saying no, no, you can't share that with your colleagues across the hall, this is difficult. So, you know, while you have unique molecules 10 to 15 years ago like a Herceptin, that maybe possible to live with that degree of complexity.</p>
          <p>As you look forward into some of these areas getting more and more complex, potentially more and more competition, potentially more and more licensing candidates, you want to move in a more seamless way to be able to access technology, make it available to the researchers, wherever they are and allow them to get on with their job. Now you may think it's a rather soft dimension when we go into strategic deal, but that's a reality. And therefore, this is not the typical deal that's designed to get a cost structure item that can be quickly put on the P&amp;L. It's got more dimensions to hit the math.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if it's &#x2013; that makes a lot sense that patent lawyers in a licensing deal, so is it something which you have observed that in this run up to 2015 as actually being increasingly becoming difficult because 2015 becomes increasingly part of the picture and --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No because 2015 hasn't even featured yet because right up to 2015 anything that's in a hot and sexy test tube, we could opt in to. So it hasn't featured at all yet in the interactions with our colleagues in Genentech. It doesn't &#x2013; it just starts to appear on to long range planning. But honestly, it's not something that we've either got fixated on or there has been any difficulty in the discussions. I think it's much more from the complexity of the marketplace and the complexity &#x2013; if you like, there was the new s-curve of innovation that were searched here, what are you now looking for in terms of the next generation of monoclonal antibodies. Will it be armed antibodies, fine we have got some interesting place-holders there with our Genentech colleagues? Will it be for enhanced ADCC activity in which case our colleagues in Penzberg and <mark type="inaudible" /> have some very interesting technologies? Will it be in finding one across the blood-brain barrier? So, there is a whole series of where are the next best curves that are in there, which will I think play-out and all of this is the just a bit more complex, so it's not even at all driven by 2015.</p>

          <p>And probably if any thing of further encouragement, but by going from one management team that was looking over three or four different sites, strategic output, by creating our internal diversity of different people, placing different bets, making their management decisions about how they move forward, I certainly got a stronger encouragement, we can create and keep that diversity 100% within the group and it doesn't require, this ones within the group and ones outside the group, for it to be productive. So I think it has given us some encouragement that we could go this far as to keep the diversity.</p>

          <p>Okay, ladies and gentleman, this leaves us with time for one more question please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Vincent Meunier, Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentleman. Thank you for taking my question. First point on the guidance, what are your expectations regarding the market sales growth in Pharma and Diagnostics as you refer your guidance to these two lines? And also regarding the tax rate, just to clarify one point, what's the guidance for this year and beyond, notably including Genentech because this morning you told us that it should definitely lower the tax rate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with the pharma market growth, what I have seen this far is the next five years people are &#x2013; there is various predictions, but it's somewhere between 4 to 6%, would be the prediction for the pharma market. I don't know if that resonates with what the people on the call are hearing, but that if I look at the <mark type="inaudible" /> resources, INS some of the other pharma evaluate, if I look at the various inputs, that's the product range that I hear out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, coming to guidance, you just surprised me and I hope my memory is very clear and I hope it is still clear. So to make it very clear, we haven't given any guidance for the tax rate. What I just have explained in a former response that we have implemented some new concepts in the mid of last year, which has driven down the tax rate of our group already last year. So it had nice effect on Roche, which you have seen in the first half year. This year will be diluted in the second half year.</p>
          <p>That's the comment I made and also I warned, I did not say this drives down the tax rate. I explained this morning that just going from a controlling position of 56 to 100% does not change any tax alignment at all. So that's for the existing products like Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera, the situation will remain the same even after closing of the deal. But in the long-term, I think that's what I said very clearly, there will be hopefully potential for improvement in the overall group tax rate. Ladies and gentlemen, --</p>

          <p>Diagnostics market growth, which includes also diabetes would be around 5 to 6%.</p>
