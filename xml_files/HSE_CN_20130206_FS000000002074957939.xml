          <p>Hello. This is the Chorus Call operator. Welcome to the Husky Energy Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call and Webcast. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sharon Murphy, Senior VP, Corporate Affairs. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us for our 2012 fourth quarter and year end results. With me are Chief Executive Officer, Asim Ghosh; Chief Operating Officer, Rob Peabody; our Chief Financial Officer, Alister Cowan and Head of Downstream, Bob Baird.</p>
          <p>This morning we'll provide an update on our business strategy and an overview of results followed by a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to advise you that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risks factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and on our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Asim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sharon, and good morning. Before I get into the fourth quarter highlights, a snapshot on where we stand today in terms of the roadmap for balanced growth that I laid out for the first time in late 2010. Overall, we are on course to meet the goals we defined through a series of specific financial and operating metrics. We've had a series of quarters of consistent execution and solid performance in an environment where the industry continues to go through a period of depressed Western Canadian pricing and basically that's because our focused integration strategy is providing us with some Safe Harbor. And later in the call Alister and Rob will provide more commentary around the specifics in the quarter.</p>
          <p>However, let me start with a few highlights. Our net earnings from operations for the year of about C$2 billion, a tad over actually, were comparable to 2011 when you exclude the after-tax gains that occurred with some noncore assets in the early part of 2011. And also, I remind you that this reflects the impacts from both the Atlantic Region FPSO offstations and weak gas prices.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations of about C$5 billion was also comparable to the previous year. Reliable performance and strong throughput in our Downstream business made a significant contribution to our earnings by capturing additional margins which allowed us to achieve Brent-like pricing for all of our liquids production in what has been an ongoing climate of wide differentials of various kinds, Canada to U.S. differentials, Brent to WTI differential and so forth.</p>
          <p>Overall if you look at our Downstream business, that contributed of about C$895 million to net earnings for the year compared to C$813 million in 2011 and production was within guidance for the third consecutive year averaging about C$302,000 per day.</p>
          <p>I move into operational highlights by key areas, so I'll start with the foundation. Our heavy oil business has been rejuvenated over the last couple of years. This includes the earlier than anticipated startup and subsequent performance of our new Pikes Peak South and Paradise Hill projects. These exceeded the peak design rates and reached total average production of 17,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We sanctioned our thermal development at Rush Lake. Our current production there is about 1,000 barrels per day from one pilot well only. We plan to expand this to our full 10,000 barrels a day commercial project which will come onstream in the 2015 timeframe and we continued construction at our thermal project at Sandall where we started to drill and expect first production next year. So suffice to say our thermal &#x2013; heavy oil thermal production, I'd call it a strong story for us in 2012 and in fact, we are set to build on that success over the long term.</p>
          <p>In Western Canada, we continue to make headway with the transformation of our business with resource plays where you'll recollect we've got a large land position of almost 2 million acres to develop our most promising prospects. And Rob will speak more to that in a moment.</p>
          <p>Then I'll move on to the growth pillars, start with the Asia-Pacific region where we are hitting our milestones according to plan. The Liwan Gas Project is on track nearing completion as we move closer to realizing first production. The jacket is anchored on the floor of the South China Sea and we plan to move out the topsides to set atop the jacket sometime in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Indonesia is turning the next chapter for growth in this region. We are developing three fields in the Madura Strait. You'll recall at the Investor Day we told you that we have four new gas discoveries under evaluation for commercial production in addition to what we already had in the past.</p>
          <p>So, if I look at Asia overall, in summary, we remain on track to deliver production from Liwan in late 2013, early 2014 and that's kind of the next really visible operational output milestone that we've been looking for.</p>
          <p>A quick update on Sunrise. The first phase is proceeding as planned towards production by mid-2014. All 49 of the well pairs are drilled. The biggest component of this project, the Central Processing Facility is somewhere near the midpoint of completion while the  FEED's facilities are more than three-quarters done, and perhaps most importantly, I'll remind you that we've logged on more than 85% of the costs. That was quite a significant achievement as now the vast majority of the costs for Sunrise are under an umbrella of cost certainty.</p>
          <p>In the Atlantic Region, we are setting the stage for future development as we execute several key initiatives. The SeaRose FPSO came back online in the third quarter, three weeks ahead of schedule and C$8 million under budget after its off-station at Belfast and production since that has been taking long, as expected, the exceptional performance from the FPSO to date has provided a solid platform, we believe, for future development from the White Rose region. In fact, tomorrow we will have produced 200 million barrels from the White Rose area and through existing and new developments we expect to recover as much again in the future.</p>
          <p>We are now focused on extending the life of this basin through near-field satellite projects at the South White Rose and West White Rose. We started development drilling at South White Rose and pending appropriate approvals we expect to begin production next year. We're also looking at production from West White Rose sometime in the sort of 2016, 2017 timeframe.</p>
          <p>The Atlantic Region is a solid, stable, high netback part of our portfolio and we are strategically developing this reservoir to give us many more years of production.</p>
          <p>So, to sum up, we are tracking well against our balanced growth strategy. Our 2012 results demonstrate this strategy is delivering and I would say we are building on our momentum as we prepare to execute the next phase of our growth plan.</p>
          <p>On that note, to Alister, you can take over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Asim. Our fourth quarter results clearly support Asim's earlier comment that we've been on course with our financial and operational targets throughout the year. And the focus on execution we formed over the past two-and-half years has certainly given us a solid footing to develop the major projects in most promising plays.</p>
          <p>The net earnings in the quarter were C$474 million or C$0.48 diluted per share and that compares to C$408 million or C$0.42 per share a year earlier. It reflects stronger U.S. refining margins due to favorable market crack spreads. But I will remind you again that there are product, location and timing differences for our refinery output from the Chicago crack spread, which is commonly quoted.</p>
          <p>We also had stronger throughput of the Upgrader and in the U.S. Refining and Marketing business but that certainly was offset by lower realized commodity prices in the Upstream business due to differentials. This also takes into account the Searcher prospect in the Atlantic Region. We drilled this well in the fourth quarter and didn't find any commercial hydrocarbons. So, we have expensed the C$79 million drill cost in Q4.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow from operations was about C$1.4 billion or C$1.43 per diluted share over the fourth quarter as compared to C$1.2 billion or C$1.24 a year ago.</p>
          <p>Turning to production, we averaged 319,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. Now that's up approximately 12% from 285,000 BOEs per day in the previous quarter but it's &#x2013; and it's comparable to production in the same period in 2011.</p>
          <p>As we said before, these numbers reflect the SeaRose FPSO maintenance program which wrapped up in August and returned to full production earlier than planned, as well as the Terra Nova offstation. It also reflects a planned decrease in natural gas production in favor of increasing light, medium and heavy oil production, as we share capital to higher netback opportunities. Our new heavy oil thermal projects also made strong contributions to production, as Asim said by ramping up well past the design wins ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>In the Downstream segment, the Downstream business has supported our Upstream operations with consistently strong throughputs and safe, reliable performance. You can see that the focused integration strategy is delivering brand like pricing for Western Canada, heavy bitumen and light production. And as you've seen from our results over the last few quarters, it's been &#x2013; it's helped to mitigate our earnings and cash flow volatility from the fluctuating differentials.</p>
          <p>The Upgrader contributed C$68 million to net earnings in the fourth quarter and that compares to C$49 million a year ago and is in part due to higher upgrading differentials and volumes. The U.S. refining operations added C$88 million to net earnings compared to C$80 million in the same period of last year. And that as I said, reflects an increase in realized refining margins as a result of higher market crack spreads and throughputs from the Lima Refinery but also takes into account lower throughput at Toledo, which has some turnaround activity in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the infrastructure and marketing operations added C$84 million to net earnings in the fourth quarter, and that's an increase of C$40 million compared with the same period in 2011. And that's a key part of our integration strategy and reflects our ability to move our crude to market in the U.S. to mitigate the Western Canada location differentials.</p>
          <p>And as you can see from the MD&amp;A, there was a FIFO after-tax loss of approximately C$27 million in the quarter and that brings an annual FIFO after-tax loss to approximately C$28 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at pricing, you'll find the details in the MD&amp;A on the website, but I will list a few highlights for the quarter. The average realized price for Upstream production as a whole was C$57.77 per boe in the fourth quarter compared to C$68.35 last year. And that reflects the impact of the Atlantic Region offstations and lower Western Canada commodity prices.</p>
          <p>Average realized crude oil pricing was C$72.17 per barrel, down from C$89.79 a year ago. There was a slight uptake from the third quarter. The average realized natural gas prices in the fourth quarter were US$3.25 per Mcf, compared to US$3.53 in the same period of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now you have seen the significant widening of differentials over the last few months and our focused integration strategy has proved itself in mitigating this volatility over the year. Rob will speak a bit more to that in a moment but a few items to note going forward.</p>
          <p>We're planning a major turnaround to the asphalt refinery in Lloydminster, beginning in April and that will result in a 25 day total shutdown in operation with an estimated impact of throughput of about 29,000 barrels per day over the turnaround period. We'll also be running a 30-day maintenance program starting in mid-May at the Prince George refinery and the expected impact to throughput is approximately 11,000 barrels per day over the turnaround period.</p>
          <p>In the Atlantic Region, the Terra Nova facility is still ramping up its production, but more slowly than anticipated. And our share of production for Terra Nova in January was about 2,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>From a financing perspective, we exited the year with a robust balance sheet which was backed by the strong operational results across the business. We have reached all the performance metrics as planned and we'll set out a C$4.8 billion capital expenditure program for 2013 and about 50% of that will be directed to the growth pillars. I'll also remind you that we continue to invest in longer cycle projects to fund growth beyond 2017, which means we'll continue to have significant amounts of capital development as we go forward. And finally, the board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of C$0.30 per share.</p>
          <p>Let me turn you over to, Rob, who's going to give us an update on the operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Asim and Alister have already stolen most of my points for 2012, so I'll take a few minutes to provide a little more detail on some of the highlights for the last quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll start with heavy oil. Our performance in this area, particularly with thermal SAGD technology continues to demonstrate a long-term potential of this business. Asim updated you on the thermal part of this business, where we remain on target to reach our goal of 55,000 barrels per day by 2017.</p>
          <p>I will just add that at the end of the fourth quarter, the Sandall thermal project was 40% complete. Additionally, production from our horizontal well program, which targets previously untapped thinner reservoir zones has now reached 8,000 barrels per day and continues to grow. 45 horizontal wells were drilled in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We also continue to high grade our remaining CHOPS drilling locations. In 2013, we expect to drill about 200 wells compared to the 250 wells we drilled in 2012. Total production from our heavy oil business was up 12% year-on-year in 2012.</p>
          <p>Looking at our Western Canada business unit, we've been making consistent progress as we continue to shift away from conventional drilling to oil and liquids rich gas resource plays. With respect to our oil plays, for the near-term projects, we were primarily active on the Bakken, Viking and Cardium plays. We drilled 25 horizontal wells here in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>For the longer term, we're working on the emerging oil plays at the Rainbow Muskwa in Northern Alberta and the Canol at Slater River in the Northwest Territories. At Slater River, we've recently received regulatory approval to build the all-season access road. This year we will conduct further evaluations on the two vertical wells we drilled last year. The results from this evaluation work will help us determine the way forward on this potentially very large but complex play. Overall, production from our oil resource plays increased to about 7,000 barrels per day at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to our liquids rich gas resource plays at our Ansell, we exited the quarter at about 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent barrels per day of production. Today, we're now around 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We also brought on the latest of our Ansell <mark type="ph" /> Woolrich (17:14) wells with encouraging results. We started drilling our first four well bat at Kaybob targeting the liquids rich Duvernay, and we also completed our third horizontal well in the play. We also completed two, the second of our two Montney horizontal wells. In total, production from our oil and liquids rich gas plays was around 20,000 barrels per day at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to the growth pillars, as reported the Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea is now more than 80% complete as we approach first production later this year or early in 2014. The 30 ton monoethylene glycol or MEG unit has been attached to the top sides, which will be floated out onto the jacket during the second quarter. Pipe laying from the deepwater gas field through to the shallow water platform and onto the onshore gas plant is on schedule.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, we're moving ahead with our gas projects on the Madura Straits Block. Following the positive results from our recent exploration program, we're now looking at bringing more projects online. We recently received approval from the regulator to develop the combined MDA and MBH fields and expect to see first gas in the 2015 timeframe. On the BD field, we have an approved development plan and gas sales agreement in place, and we are in the retendering process for a leased FPSO.</p>
          <p>Oil sands development continue to progress, as you heard earlier, the Sunrise Energy Project is advancing with increasing cost certainty following the conversion of all significant contracts to lump sum. We're also moving ahead with preliminary engineering for the next phase of Sunrise. Finally, we expect to put in an application for a Saleski pilot later this year.</p>
          <p>In the Atlantic Region, we are advancing our near field developments at South White Rose and West White Rose. We brought a forced production well online at the North Amethyst Drill Centre and our application to develop the deeper Hibernia level formation is now being reviewed by the regulator. Development drilling will start in the first quarter at the South White Rose extension and first oil is on schedule for 2014.</p>
          <p>On the exploration front, as Alister stated earlier, we finished drilling the Searcher prospect and didn't encounter commercial hydrocarbons. Going forward, we are participating in the partner-operated Harpoon well, which is near our previously announced Mizzen discovery. Pre-drilling work is also complete on two other potential exploration wells in the region that we're planning to drill later this year and they may possibly, one of those may move into the following year.</p>
          <p>In the Downstream business, our focused integration strategy was the big story this year, as we were faced with wide differentials and depressed Western Canadian pricing. As we told you at Investor Day, there are three elements to our Downstream strategy; increasing input flexibility to access a variety of crude options, increasing our product flexibility to improve the range of what we make and finally, improving our market flexibility to get the best prices for our product. At both Lima and Toledo, we're making modifications to allow for increased consumption of heavy feed stocks.</p>
          <p>Some fourth quarter highlights from the Downstream. We're almost finished building our new kerosene hydrotreater at the Lima Refinery. In fact, I just heard we're starting commissioning on that. This will give us more jet and diesel production while preserving the flexibility to swing back into gasoline. At the Toledo Refinery, which is operated by our partner, a new reformer unit has been installed. This reduces operating costs and increases our efficiency, as well as our ability to make low vapor pressure gasoline. In summary, we've had an active quarter and we continue to build momentum as we draw closer to production from our major projects at Liwan and Sunrise.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn you over to the operator.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Really just wanted to dig in a little bit more into some of the projects that you've got on the horizon. So can you talk a bit more about just Rainbow Muskwa, what you're doing up in the Northwest Territories? And then lastly and I mean, I know you did cover that off in your prepared statements. I'm just wondering if we can get a little bit more. And what is your thinking then about the next phase of Sunrise in terms of the approach that you would be taking on that? Would you really use the same approach? Or will you bring more of the control, et cetera in house? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me try to &#x2013; I'm going to hand you over in a moment to Rob to talk about the resource plays, but I need to understand your question a bit more deeply on Sunrise. So, broadly our thinking is, I mean, we've got a SAGD projector. It's sort of a off location fabricated mod that gets shifted onto location, and our broad thinking is to stick with that basic concept. But what did you mean by controls?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's okay. The question is really, how much of &#x2013; whereas with the first project, you've got <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:40) that's overseeing it and running it as your general contractor. And the question is, would Husky then look to become the general contractor with the subsequent phases? But I think you're probably answering it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I think, no, okay. I don't think we have &#x2013; this is not a core skill of ours. And one of the things I've been concentrating on is we stick to what we do best. I don't think general contracting a project of that magnitude, Greg, we would see as part of our core skills. So, we would return to the project at the right time and that's how we would handle it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Rob, why don't you take the resource play questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Greg, I'm not going to give you much more information than you already have and we discussed at Investor Day. I mean, the one development in the near term is we did get approval for the all-season access road, which was a very positive development. And so, we have a program. We're just doing some further testing on the two wells we drilled last year, and on the basis of that, we'll determine the forward program, both later in the year and next year. So that's where we are. As I've said time and again, we're very encouraged that the hydrocarbons are there but we also know this is a very complex environment in which to work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's for the Canol. And I think for the Rainbow Muskwa, I don't think we really have any more news than we shared with you in December. I would &#x2013; implicit in that is like there is no more good news or there is no more bad news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There literally is no more news. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me ask another way. When do you expect to talk more about this? This is sort of at mid-year or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, we'll keep you abreast of developments as they happen. My sense of this, I know there is always this feeling that things are going to happen every month but the fact is it takes a long time to get wells drilled and then to actually see production results. So we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the general point we made, Greg, we pretty well have to read the wells for a year before we get a sense of the type curve because the shape of the individual well, the type curves vary so enormously that you maybe start drawing premature conclusions will be sort of resulting in either overhyping or underhyping the true potential. And I think we've just been very disciplined about it. So far what we have seen gives us room for continued development, but not to draw firm conclusions on economics. That's just a very honest, straightforward answer in terms of &#x2013; we just have to be patient to build this, to get a proper sense of the potential of these projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No problem. That does answer it. Thanks very much all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Just a modeling question. Guys, I'm not sure if you've ever talked about operating cost expectations for Sunrise. I guess, either Sunrise Phase 1 or sort of fully expanded to 200,000 barrels a day but just any help on that front you can shed some light on? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just a very short answer. I mean, with gas price assumption of something like C$5 to C$6 sort of long-term gas price which is clearly way above what it is today. We would anticipate total operating costs in the sort of C$17 a barrel range. So as gas prices are lower than that, it'd be a little bit less than that, and if they're higher, it'll be a little higher than that.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be &#x2013; yeah. That's a Phase 1 indicative and you would expect to be able to pull them down a little bit as you expand the project beyond that, although clearly gas prices are more linear. That being said, when we do Phase 2, the early engineering shows a number of projects to increase the thermal efficiency of the whole project that should help us on gas price, or gas cost, as well.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Good morning. Several quick question hopefully. Rob, when you're looking at your increasing heavy oil production <mark type="ph" /> later on (28:33) with bitumen on Sunrise, have you looked at train as an alternative option to get the oil out? Is that a potential strategy for the company or that you really don't believe that that is a viable solution for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take that question at the high level first. I'll remind you that Husky actually has a lot of pipeline connectivity in place. And as a combination of our internal pipeline connectivities in Canada, our Hardisty terminal through which somewhere between 20%, 25% of all Canadian oil passes en route to the U.S. and our pipelines enters the U.S. They're somewhat differently positioned from some of our peers. So our primary connectivity solution is focused around pipelines, and we've got a material amount of our production already covered through existing pipeline connectivities to make commitments and we've got a plan to increase that. So in our case, we see rail as a bit of a stopgap solution to fill in the blanks where you've got blanks. So it's a solution around the edges and we are looking at expanding our rail capabilities but even after we've done that, it will be a relatively small part of our total picture. So the thing with rail basically is it is more flexible, but it is materially more expensive. So if you've got the pipeline connectivity, pipelines are always the preferred to go &#x2013; way to go and that's the <mark type="ph" /> prospect (30:13)...</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Asim, your pipeline connectivity, is it just &#x2013; go to the U.S. Midwest or does it go all the way down to the Gulf Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Present pipeline connectivities go to the U.S., Midwest. We've got options on upcoming pipes to the Gulf Coast.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's essentially based on Keystone XL, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's based on Keystone, predominantly.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So I guess that that's the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Enbridge and there are others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, Paul, I think one thing to understand, okay, I don't think we've given any external disclosure on this, but we actually have a pretty significant network of pipeline access. It is not based on one massive winner-take-all-type of solution. We actually have a number of pipeline options, and one of the reasons &#x2013; there have been a lot of pipeline constraints over the last year. There have been apportionments and the reason we've been able to write that out is actually we've got more than one solution, and we've also got tankage at both ends of the dumbbell, so to speak. We've got tankage in Patoka. We've got tankage in Hardisty, which allows us to mitigate the results of short-term dislocations. So it's &#x2013; you're asking me &#x2013; I could spend half a day explaining this and we basically have said, look, the simple answer is we've got a complex network of commitments in place and more coming up but don't think of it as single dependency on, if XL happens, or XL doesn't happen what happens to us, okay? It's not the space we are in right now.</p>

          <p>This concludes the analyst Q&amp;A portion of today's call. We will now take questions from members of the media.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> There are no further questions at this time. I will hand the call back over to Asim Ghosh for any closing remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us. I think I said this in the last Investor Day. I forget when I said it but it sounded pretty clever so I'll repeat it again. So we just &#x2013; basically, guys, we strategize for three days in the year and we execute for 362, that's my mantra to the guys, to my colleagues inside the company. And that's what we're trying to drive. There is no major change in our strategy since we first started planning two-and-a-half years ago and since that time, as you can see from the results, we achieved this quarter and throughout 2012, it's in the process of delivering results for us and that's consistent execution is again our mantra for 2013. So thank you for joining us today and we look forward to the conference call a quarter from now.</p>
