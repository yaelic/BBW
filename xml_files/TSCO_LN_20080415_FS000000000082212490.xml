          <p>All right, welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We'll follow the usual running order, with Andy covering the financial results, followed by Terry with an update on strategy and we'll be then happy to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to report that in spite of some challenging market conditions, we once again delivered a strong set of results. Sales have increased by 11.1% to 51.8 billion and Group profit before tax is up by 5.7% or by 15.3% if you exclude last year's exceptionals which was mainly the Pensions A-Day credit. Underlying profit growth has grown by 11.8% to 2,846 million and underlying diluted earnings per share are up 13.1% using a normal tax rate, and so the full year dividend is also up 13.1%.</p>
          <p>These results demonstrate the real strength and diversity of the Group and reaffirm our broad long-term strategy for growth, set out just over a decade ago. International is now a powerful driver of growth for the Group. And this year, our overseas business delivered very strong growth; increases in sales and profit of 25.3 and 24.3%, respectively. Our growth will continue as we begin to lay the foundations for our long-term international expansion, through our entry into the new major markets of China and more recently the United States.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., sales were up 6.7%; and trading profits grew by 7.1%, after the start-up costs in the U.S. and on Tesco Direct to 2,050 million helped by a solid margin performance. Group non-food sales rose 12% to 11.8 billion and non-food remains an important contributor to our growth. We are particularly pleased with the progress of Tesco Direct, which has performed ahead of plan during its first full year of operation. It's also been a good year for retailing services with growing customer numbers and improving profits. Tesco Personal Finance this year celebrates its 10th anniversary. Telecom is growing well, with Tesco Mobile alone attracted 0.25 million new customers this year and breaking through to profitability. Dotcom has again delivered excellent growth in sales and profits.</p>
          <p>The introduction of community to our strategy earlier this year has further focused our efforts on tackling important social environmental challenges, and showing that they are considered in our strategic decision making. Terry will update you on progress with our environmental work, but I want to mention briefly some of our successes with the community.</p>
          <p>Following the introduction of the community plan in 2006, we now have plans in nine countries bringing together a range of community, environmental and health projects, tailored to local market needs, and the remaining three countries will also be starting soon.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we continued our rollout of front-of-pack nutritional labelling across the Group including Turkey, South Korea, China and Poland. We are over a third of our own branded products are now labelled in the U.K. We are still the only supermarket, where all relevant products carry the labels. Over 7,000 Tesco lines and nearly 20,000 when the manufacturers brands, we use them are also included.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to report in the U.K., we've broken our Charity of the Year record raising more than double the ambitious target with 4.4 million being donated to the British Red Cross.</p>
          <p>Over the last few decades, we have become skilled retail property developers, building a valuable property, portfolio that powerfully underpins the business. Our programme of releasing value from property is on track, and proceeds will be used to fund our business expansion and ongoing share buybacks.</p>
          <p>The Tesco team is now over 440,000 strong, it's a big team, but united by a common purpose, to create value for customers to earn their life time loyalty. And this year the team have worked harder than ever to deliver an even better shopping trip for customers. And our latest staff view point confirms that morale is strong. I would like to thank all our people for their hard work which I know will continue in the year ahead. I'm delighted that their efforts have been recognized with Tesco winning the World Retailer of the Year in Barcelona last week.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll now hand you over to Andy, who will take you through the financials. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks David and good morning everyone. First, I would like to outline the main financial headlines for the Group. We've delivered strong growth in sales, profits and earnings in a demanding trading environment. As our developing businesses mature, returns are rising; and at the same time, we are increasing our investment in new growth which will drive the longer-term. Our programme to release value from property is progressing well. And shareholders will continue to benefit directly from this through share buybacks and strong dividend growth.</p>
          <p>I'll now take you through the Group performance starting with sales. Total Group sales for the year ending the 23rd of February, 2008 passed the 50 billion pound mark for the first time. They were 51.8 billion pounds, up 11.1%. Group trading profit rose 11% to 2.75 billion pounds, and profit is stated after start-up costs relating to Fresh &amp; Easy and Direct totalling 87 million pounds for the full year.</p>
          <p>Group underlying profit before tax was 2.85 billion pounds, up 11.8%.  Within this, higher property profits were offset by last year's gain of 25 million pounds on the sale of our investments in GroceryWorks and Greenergy. Group property profits have increased by 35% from a net 139 million pounds last year to 188 million pounds this. You'll recall that last year's numbers included 47 million pounds in JVs, principally relating to the sale of the Weston Favell store. As well as the sale to the 50 JV with British Land that we announced last March, I can announce today that we completed a second deal just before the end of the year with the Prudential. This latest deal was completed on a 4.8% yield and a 66% premium to book value. It demonstrates again the appetite for Tesco property and covenant remained strong. As things stand, we expect to complete further deals this year on attractive terms.</p>
          <p>We have now released proceeds of 1.4 billion pounds from the sale of just over 6% of our U.K. space, 80% of our Group space remains freehold. We currently estimate that the market value of our freehold property assets even after this year's divestments has risen to around 31 billion pounds, and this value is equivalent to our current market capitalization, or it was this morning.</p>
          <p>Strategy Group operating profit is up 5.4% and Group pre-tax profit is up 5.7%. These lower growth rates are principally due to last year's exceptional items, notably the big credit from Pensions A-Day.</p>
          <p>Underlying diluted earnings per share were up 20.8% to 27.02 pence, benefiting from the strong property profits, the effect of the share buyback and an unusually low tax rate, which I'll come back to later. Using a normalized tax rate, underlying diluted earnings per share were up 13.1%.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased with the progress we've made on the share buyback. In the year, we bought and cancelled 150 million of our own shares, representing an investment of just over 650 million pounds. To-date since we started the buyback, we have bought and cancelled a total of 270 million shares with a value of 1.1 billion pounds. This means we are well on track with our target to repurchase shares worth in excess of 3 billion pounds over five years.</p>
          <p>The proposed final dividend is 7.7 pence, up 12.7%, and this gives us a full year dividend figure of 10.9 pence, up 13.1%. This dividend is inline with the rising underlying diluted EPS on a normalized tax rate basis.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to take you through the performance of the U.K. Total sales in the U.K. were up 6.7% to 37.9 billion pounds. Like-for-like sales were up 3.9% and net new stores contributed 2.8%. Ex-petrol, like-for-like was 3.5%.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter ex-petrol like-for-like was 3% and growth has strengthened in the early weeks of the new financial year. Easter adjusted UK ex-petrol like-for-like growth was comfortably over 4% in the five weeks the 29th of March with inflation of less than 1.5%.</p>
          <p>U.K. trading profit was 2,050 million pounds, up 7.1% on a broadly unchanged margin after absorbing the start-up costs and initial operating losses in Fresh &amp; Easy and Tesco Direct. Before these costs, U.K. trading margin was 6.1%, up a little on last year, driven by a strong sales mix and productivity improvements.</p>
          <p>For these preliminary results, sales and start-up cost in the United States are reported in our U.K. segment.  We will begin the separate disclosure of U.S. sales and trading losses within international in the current year, beginning with our Interim Results in September. We expect trading losses at Fresh &amp; Easy this year to rise to around 100 million pounds, as we continue to build out our store network and accelerate the opening of our second distribution centre in Northern California.</p>
          <p>It's been a break through year, for International, total international sales with 13.8 billion pounds up 25.3% at actual rates and 22.5% at constant rates. International trading profits was 701 million pounds, up 24.3% at actual rates, and 22.2% at constant rates. International trading margin rose by 15 basis points before the impact of including China for the first time. And whilst International now represents just over a quarter of the Group sales and profit, it delivered more than half of the Group growth in the year.</p>
          <p>In Asia, sales were 6 billion pounds, up 27.2% at actual exchange rates, and 30.9% at constant rates. Excluding China, sales were up 12.3% at actual rates. Trading profit in Asia rose to 304 million pounds, an increase of 23.6% at actual rates and 26.8% at constant rates. Margins were strong, driven by our performances in Korea, Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
          <p>Helped by favourable exchange rates, in Europe, sales were 7.8 billion pounds, up 23.9% at actual rates, and 16.1% at constant rates. Strong sales growth of 22.5% in the fourth quarter were particularly pleasing, given that it was achieved after the annualization of our Leader Price acquisition last year. Trading profit rose to 397 million pounds, an increase of 24.8% at actual rates, and 18.6% at constant rates.</p>
          <p>Retailing services have made further good progress, led by an excellent performance by our online businesses, where total sales have now reached 1.6 billion pounds, representing growth of 31%.</p>
          <p>Profits were up 49% to 124 million pounds before the start-up costs of Direct. Developing our online businesses internationally remains a big opportunity for future growth. And I was delighted to see that the Homeplus dotcom operation in Korea more than doubled sales in the year.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., industry leading customer services means that dotcom grocery now attracts over 1 million regular customers, with 20% growth in new customers in the year. We are also working hard to deliver improved efficiencies. For example, we are getting 11% higher van utilization than a year ago which at the same makes more delivery slots available for customers. Just before Easter, we launched our latest Tesco Direct catalog 12-months after the first full size catalog was launched.</p>
          <p>Customer response has been very encouraging with orders up by over 75% on pre-launch levels. Over this last year, more than 1 million customers have chosen to order from Direct using either the catalog, the web, by phone or a one of over 200 desks that we now have in store; Direct comfortably abated a 150 million pound sales budget for the year, delivering sales of almost 180 million pounds.</p>
          <p>Telecom has also had a successful year, growing sales and profits strongly. This performance was led by Tesco Mobile which was voted number one mobile network for customer satisfaction for the third year running, and attracted nearly 20% more customers than last year. As the number one supermarket bank in the U.K. Tesco Personal Finance is continuing to deliver excellent returns to the Group. Profits before interest and tax were broadly flat on the year, after the 31 million pound cost of household and insurance claims linked to last summer's floods.</p>
          <p>Our share of the cost of flood liabilities for the year after interest and tax was around 11 million pounds, leaving our share of total TPF profits to 64 million pounds. Without this impact, TPF profits would have seen very good growth. We've responded to the deteriorating credit environment in a prudent way, reducing exposure on our defaulting accountings.</p>
          <p>Underlying bad debts were down 15% on last year, which was far better than the banking industry average. And on credit card arrears, our rate remains low and falling last industry arrears are increasing.</p>
          <p>Profit from JVs and associates were 75 million pounds, excluding the 47 million pound one-off profits on asset sales last year which I mentioned earlier, profit was up on JVs by 16 million pounds. Net finance costs were down on last year at 63 million pounds this includes the net return on our pension schemes assets and liabilities in addition to the impacts of IAS 32 and 39.</p>
          <p>The reduction reflects favourable movements in the IFRS non-cash elements to finance cost relating to the exchange rate differences in hedging, a benefit from our increased pension assets, and a revaluation of our sums and liability. If we exclude these IFRS adjustments and finance income, our normal interest charge rose by 18%.</p>
          <p>Tax has been charged in this effective rate of 24% for the year, lower than last year's rate of 29.1% due to two one-off factors; the first was an adjustment of our deferred tax balances which reflects the 2% reduction in U.K. corporation tax, which took effect from the first of this month. The second and the larger factor relates to the settlement of prior year tax items with HMRC. We would expect the tax rate for the current year to be around 27.5% reflecting the new lower corporation tax rate.</p>
          <p>Net debt has increased to 6.2 billion pounds from 4.9 billion pounds over the last year end, which was principally due to three factors. Firstly, an increase in CapEx, which I'll come back to in a minute; second, the impact of unfavorable currency movements particularly relating to our international balance sheet hedging, and that totalled 0.6 billion pounds of the increasing debt. And third, the acquisition of Dobbies which including debt represents it around 0.2 billion pounds gearing real slightly to 52%.</p>
          <p>We saw a significant improvement in our debt profile in the year, 1.5 billion pounds of funding dated over 30, 40 and 50 years has increased our average debt maturity from nine years to 19 years, 70% of our debt is at fixed rates.</p>
          <p>Before leaving the balance sheet a quick word on pensions. We are proud to continue to offer an award-winning defined-benefit pension scheme and our staff tell us it is very important to them. To ensure that the scheme remains in excellent health, the trustees determined funding using prudent actuarial assumptions. On this basis, the scheme remains broadly &#x2013; fully funded. The trustees have just started their regular independent review of the funding of the scheme as part of our try and yield valuation.</p>
          <p>Now as you know, for accounting purposes IFRS requires we value pension scheme liabilities on a high quality corporate bond yield. The IFRS pension deficit has decreased from last year by 112 million pounds pre-tax, largely as a consequence of the movement in bond yields through the back half of the year. And despite I might say, adopting more cautious assumptions on mortality rate. Post-tax or IFRS pension deficit is now around 600 million pounds. Group capital expenditure during the year was 3.9 billion pounds this was ahead of our expectations of 3.5 billion pounds of the half year. And this is primarily due to some excellent investment opportunities that arose in the U.K. We spent around 100 million pounds acquiring Windfall stores from competitors including Somerfield, Kwik Save and the Co-Op. We also invested another 200 million pounds in a number of mixed use and other development sites. Excluding Fresh &amp; Easy, U.K. capital expenditure was 2.3 billion pounds including 997 million pounds on new stores and 457 million pounds on extensions and refits.</p>
          <p>Total international CapEx rose to 1.4 billion pounds reflecting our enlarged new store opening program, comprising 0.7 billion pounds in Europe, and 0.7 billion pounds in Asia. The increasing CapEx in Asia has been due to the conversion cost of Makro stores in Malaysia, and the impact of currency movements. China is included for the first time. Around 200 million pounds of capital was invested in United States.</p>
          <p>This chart shows the total capital outline on new assets including through acquisitions, and you can see from this, the aggregate spend has been fairly stable over the last couple of years. We expect Group capital expenditures this year to be around 4.2 billion pounds reflecting the start of investment in freehold shopping centres in China, and an increase in spend on Fresh &amp; Easy. We are expecting CapEx in Fresh &amp; Easy this year to be around 370 million pounds reflecting the decision to bring forward our investments in Northern California as I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow was 4.1 billion pounds up from 3.5 billion pounds last year, and 0.2 billion pounds higher than CapEx. This increase is due to improved profits from our core operations and an 0.2 billion pound improvement in working capital. We've made more good progress on returns in the year. Group ROCE is up helped by the lower tax rate and Terry will give you an update on international returns in a few moments.</p>
          <p>In summary then, we've delivered a strong performance both in the U.K. and overseas, whilst continuing to build ever stronger foundations for our future growth. Our balance sheet is strong and underpinned by our high quality freehold asset base. And from it, we are able to fund our expansion comfortably and return significant value to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will now hand over to Terry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy and good morning everyone. So, these results demonstrate that Tesco has again made strong progress. Sales, profits and returns have grown well. Growth has been broadly based, and we are delivering on our commitments to shareholders. The numbers also show our new businesses are coming of age. I am pleased about that because the breadth which gives the Group combined with the strengths of our business model means we are able to cope well with changing market conditions, and at the same time, make the necessary investments for our future growth in the U.S., China, and Tesco Direct.</p>
          <p>International, of course, is an important part of this. It now makes more than 700 million pounds of profit. And that's about the same that the whole Tesco Group did just a decade ago, when we embarked on international expansion. And it contributed over half of the growth of Group trading profit last year. So, we built a whole new Tesco in the last 10 years, but this Tesco addresses markets of 100s of millions of people. And as a result, I believe the Group's growth prospects are better now than they've ever been.</p>
          <p>So to begin my usual update, sales in International have increased strongly up by more than 25% in the year, including a first-time contribution from China. We saw positive like-for-like growth of 2% overall, similar to last year, and good performances across Europe, helped in part by favourable exchange rates, but also in Asia despite some unhelpful conditions in some markets. Profits advanced well, up 24%, and we saw a good margin growth excluding effective China. Returns are on track and I'll update you on those in a few moments.</p>
          <p>We've seen another strong performance across Central Europe. The customer numbers and market share are growing well in every country. We are starting to see the benefits of recent acquisitions in Poland and Czech Republic. Pan-European buying for own brand, but we are now sourcing 1500 products regionally and for produce and for non-food. It's now making a meaningful difference to our competitiveness particularly against the hard discounts as you know tend to source in the Pan-European basis.</p>
          <p>Our progress in Central Europe has been helped by much stronger results in Hungary, one of our biggest countries. The market has been tough, still it's tough, but our strategy of investing hard through the downturn, improving the offer to customers is delivering, and we resume positive like-for-like growth during the second quarter and we've seen our market share move up strongly there to 16%, and that puts us in a good position as and when the economy begins to recover.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in Europe, Ireland did well, benefiting from the opening of the next big DC there 75,000 square meters just outside Dublin, but also the development of few extra supermarkets, we've now got six, in the Republic, they are driving strong non-food growth. In fact in Ireland booking the trend, closing sales. We are up over 30% non-food, hard lines over 20%. But, also pushing them with rapid developments of our store network in Turkey, we trade from 26 Hypers and 39 Expresses we've really pushed on there very, very quickly. We've got successful stores now out of our traditional core in Izmir, we've got successful stores in Ankara and in Thrace. Kipa has already demonstrated that as a name it travels well, we've acquired two sites in Istanbul, we are now planning the big place Turkey to build western and central supply hubs and buying offices in addition to our Izmir base to serve us a national network of stores.</p>
          <p>In Asia our businesses have made good progress with the two largest countries Korea and Thailand delivering very good growth, despite on helpful market conditions. Malaysia has again made excellent progress, good markets and relatively new industry there. We've moved strongly into profitability, we've taken market leadership this year in Malaysia. As a result of the growth of our existing business in converting the form of Makro stores which has been successfully re-launched and we've got a further eight large hyper markets planned there for this year.</p>
          <p>In Japan, our work on adapting the Express format to local consumers in two formats of store is coming together well, and we strengthened the team there and continued the investment in logistics and infrastructure.</p>
          <p>And in China, we have full control of the business. We've begun to push on faster again with regional expansion focused on large freehold shopping centres. We can sell a U.K. supermarket of around 50,000 square feet and with that same money, we can build a 0.5 million square feet shopping centre in China, which seems to me given the long term growth prospects, a very good use of the resources. Now, we'll build four of these shopping centres this year, obviously they contain a huge Tesco hypermarket and that will open early next year, and we'll be moving on to 10 to 12 a year going forward.</p>
          <p>As usual, I am going to highlight the significant events of the past few months using the six key elements of our international strategy, which you know. It's about being flexible, local, maintaining focus, using multi format, developing capability, building the brand. And I'll start with focus. Our focus on building stronger positions in our existing markets mainly through organic growth is working. We opened over 6 million square feet of new space in international last year. This year, there will be more. We intend as a group to open 11.5 million square feet, 80% of which I suppose 9 million or so, will be in International, so, a big step up in International space growth. The new stores are going well. The acquired space is performing very strongly under the Tesco brand. Poland sales of the Leader Price stores are up 43%; Malaysia the six macro conversions, put on sales growth of 40% and the remodeled Carrefour stores, now in the second year in the Czech Republic are giving second year like-for-like of 11%.</p>
          <p>Our success with multi-format continues to grow. The opening of our first Express store in Shanghai, a couple of weeks ago, and that's an important start. Express is now in nine countries. We've got 500 outside the U.K. and it's going to be a very big growth opportunity for us going forward.</p>
          <p>Developing the management capability to cope with the pace and scope of our growth is a key priority to spend a lot of time on it. It's not just about numbers; the senior roles are getting bigger and more complex all the time, because across the businesses, the market leading businesses that we are creating are among the largest enterprise in the whole market. So, our talent planning is strong, three of our country CEOs are now locals. More than 60% of the Directors are locals. And we still have only 180 experts in the whole of international, that's a fraction, 1% of the total staff working internationally. So, these are very local businesses. Because we are about returns as well as growth, I want to update you on two charts we've used for a couple of years now, which shows you how International returns are developing.</p>
          <p>The first track is the long-term developments of international CROIs. That's cash return on investment. Now this chart looks that like-for-like CROI, which shows clearly that returns were a pleasing growth last year up 4% to 13.1%. Overall, CROI internationally was flat, but these numbers move out the extra waiting of immature capitals we've accelerated on investments and acquisitions, internationally. And show the strength of the underlying improvement in International. And it's now well into making economic profit and delivering steady progress towards the mid-teens numbers we require.</p>
          <p>You'll remember the second chart, the circles of scale to invested capital. This year's updated version shows good progress. Some significant changes over the last 12 months, Korea and Thailand have improved again and again despite challenging markets making good progress. Hungary, of course, has bounced back as we hope that it would, confirming our decision to keep pushing on that. Poland and Czech have slipped slightly compared to last year, but mainly as a result of the acquisitions that we put in quite a big lump of extra capital in both of those places. But looking ahead, returns will rise, as we see the full benefits of these deals coming through. Japan also moved to the left although it's from a low base. We are loading it up with overhead for future expansion in Japan.</p>
          <p>You can see some striking improvements in Turkey and Malaysia which have essentially Greenfield rollouts, which is encouraging and pushing on faster in those markets, we believe now will be of very value creating.</p>
          <p>Not only CROI is still improving, cash flows are strong, EBITDA in international plus the 1 billion pounds in the year, after working capital gains this means that 70% of our International expansion is funded by local cash flow.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to the U.K., I want to update you on progress with Fresh &amp; Easy in the United States. Now, understand the first for information about how things are going, I want to say a couple of things about that. But first of all, it's exactly 167 days since we opened our first store. So, it's just really a few weeks into what we believe will be a project lasting more than a generation. I am very encouraged by what I see. It's going much better than I could have hoped for, but of course, it's still too early to make definitive judgments. What is clear so far is that customers love the stores, and that's not in my experience a bad starting point. And, we also know that more and more of them are finding that Fresh &amp; Easy fits well into the shopping repertoires. So, some are becoming completely dedicated Fresh &amp; Easy shoppers, and some are beginning to add it to their repertoire and then being converted over to become dedicated Fresh &amp; Easy shoppers.</p>
          <p>Sales are ahead of purchase, sales densities in just a few weeks are already ahead of the U.S. supermarket, average best stores taking over $20 per square foot. You can see from the chart that the trajectory of sales is also good, it shows that the growth weekly turnover, the store for the 27 stores that we opened just before Christmas. We use that because, got a little bit of a base to it, little bit of history to it. And you can see there is a strong upward trajectory there.</p>
          <p>Customer research is coming in from various sources, what I'll do, I thought I wouldn't give you Tesco research, this is actually independent data commissioned by one of our shareholders, they got Ipsos which is a well known market research company interviewed 200 Fresh &amp; Easy customers in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago, asking what they thought about the shopping trip. And you can see that the results are remarkable, in my experience they are remarkable. They couldn't find a single dissatisfied customer. Now, they would actually collaborate with our own research from various sources as well. And we've been careful to check for American culture and how people respond to things; that is actually and has been for many years, omnibus survey of what American shoppers think of American supermarkets. And they have no trouble finding folks with them, I can tell you. And these figures and our own figures really put Fresh &amp; Easy in a very unique place, a uniquely good place as far as American shoppers are concerned.</p>
          <p>Fresh foods, particularly prepared foods and ready meals have sold well. We are already seeing people transfer out of fast food restaurants into our products, which is a real bonus for us. Own brand sales are strong confirming that the core of our offer is in tune with today's American consumers. So overall, I am very pleased with the promising start we've made and that's why we are going faster as Andy said, putting the next step into Northern California. Important thing now is to let the team get on with it, it's still a relatively small team they are working very, very hard on the business.</p>
          <p>To sum up, International has had an excellent year. This business now has the scale, the competitiveness and the momentum it needs to be a key driver of our growth for the long-term, because most of our businesses can be two, three or more times larger than they are today.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn to the U.K., where we've made solid progress recovering competitors and cautious consumers made sales growth harder to combine. But with strong productivity, mix and margin control, we've delivered good results in the year. After a slower final quarter, we've come into the new financial year on better form trading ahead of the industry, growing market share and a bit above our own planned performance range for the year and for the opening of the year.</p>
          <p>Consumers are going to need a bit of help in the coming months and that's the kind of market where Tesco's strengths will stand out, that's what we've got a reputation for. As always, our focus is going to be on the whole shopping trip, investing in the whole shopping trip, and I'll say a few words on highlights from the last year on price, service, range and availability. Price position has never been stronger. Recently, we cut 170 million pounds of price cuts covering 1000s of products across the store, we've improved it again. We've also been working harder on our promotions on the mix, and on the sharpness and how we communicate them. And we've done some good work on in-store presentation.</p>
          <p>With our new checkout technology, now fully implemented, there is a renewed focus on reducing queues. We've seen the biggest improvement ever since the launch of one-in-front, 0.5 million fewer customers queued compared to a year ago, that's a dramatic improvement basically halving the number of people that queue within a single year.</p>
          <p>The broad appeal of the Tesco brand drives our work on ranges with a broad church, which helps us in these changing markets at times. We saw a solid growth across our food categories. We did a complete upgrade of our Healthy Living launched into the beginning of 2008. Customer feedback and growth has been very strong. Organic is still growing well. Finest is the UK's biggest brand, and of course, you've seen us relaunch last week our value range right across the store.</p>
          <p>On-shelf availability, which we have a very good measure on from dotcom has improved again, that's very important to us. More customers are now able to buy everything they want. And the most &#x2013; the biggest improvement has been in fresh foods and on evening availability.</p>
          <p>Our Step-Change programme helped fund the investment. We saved &#x2013; sorry, we'll save this year 450 million focusing on making the business better for customers, simpler for staff, cheaper for Tesco. We are picking up the pace on our supply chain savings, more shelf-ready packaging, higher vehicle utilization, next generation of scanning technology, obviously energy savings. I am pleased with the progress of our non-food departments against headwind of a more cautious consumer, it's obviously more discretionary spend on food. Sales grew faster than the core business, profitability was strong, and we grew share in most categories. U.K. sales growth was 9% on the year. Volume is 12%, because across we are still seeing some deflation in non-food. Sales growth moderated to 8% in the second half. Our core non-food markets, which are less affected by the economic cycle, grew well. Health and Beauty increased by 7%; toys by 10%.</p>
          <p>On newer categories, again saw a good overall growth. Closing sales, I suppose was most effective, because you have the combination of a slowing market and very poor weather through the summer. But we still marked up a 6% increase in clothing in a flat market. We saw a strong market share gains in other areas. Consumer electronics were very strong up 31%, sports 29%, DIY 20%.</p>
          <p>Our plans to build a strong position in the online digital entertainment market are coming together well. We are doing a soft launch this month of our comprehensive new download site that will support of all the key content providers, very good platform, spent quite a lot of money on it. And there will be a full launch in the autumn. Overall, non-food market share is 8.5%, gotten relatively low shares still in most categories we got a good discount reputation. We can expand stores and of course, sell more through direct channels. So, there is a lot more to come not withstanding this point in the economic cycle. Tesco Direct has made a great start, it's now well into its second year, we just launched the third of our large catalogs, and we've got excellent customer feedback.</p>
          <p>Retail services and other indicator of course are the growing breadth of our business, has made further good progress as Andy has outlined to you. Dotcom was on excellent form sales up over 30%, profits up nearly 50% before the start-up costs of Tesco Direct. Under a new management team Tesco Personal Finance has got back on to a faster rate of growth which I am pleased about, and the stronger flow of new products including health and dental insurance, motor insurance comparison, website and so on, excellent growth in online sales up 20%, 55% of TPF's product sales now at online, and of course, that's a strong platform for future growth.</p>
          <p>TPF has weathered what is inevitably a difficult financial services market, we got falling bad debts and falling credit card arrears. And, I believe there is a significant growth potential for as they are going forward. Telecom has passed an important milestone in the year, it moved into profit helped by a very strong performance from Tesco Mobile.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I want to talk about our work with communities in the environment, as you know to make sure that this gets the right focus and priority in the business. We made an important change last year, by adding it to our core strategy, so our four part strategy became a five part strategy. David gave you an update in some of the community projects. I'm going to talk briefly about the strides Tesco is making towards a revolution in green consumption, by making environmental choices more affordable.</p>
          <p>Now, we don't start from the position, that you have to choose between growing or being green. In fact, I strongly believe that being green will be a good way to grow and add value, and add benefits into the future. Through our unique Green Clubcard scheme, we have reduced carrier bag use by over 1 billion last year and much more than any other retailer, and we are on track to save 2 billion a total of 2 billion this year.</p>
          <p>We are also on target to sell 10 million energy-efficient lightbulbs in a year. We've halved our energy use per square foot in the U.K. since 2000, two years ahead of target. We've cut our CO2 emissions per case by over 10% in a single year, through more efficient operations and innovations some high profile innovations like transporting, wine by canal. We've invested 25 million pounds in creating a Sustainable Consumption Institute at the University of Manchester, and now this brings together around 200 of the world's leading experts from a whole variety of disciplines, and the institute will help lead the way to a low carbon lifestyle, a low carbon economy.</p>
          <p>We recently opened green stores in China and in Hungary, and our fourth U.K. Environmental Store in Shrewsbury sets a new benchmark for green technology and construction in retail. The store has a carbon footprint 60% lower than a standard store of a comparable size. Through our strategy of environmental innovation, the carbon intensity of all of last year store openings was 22% lower than the year before. Our new Express store like this one at Hinckley, are also greener, and this store is 30% more carbon efficient. We will begin the first phase of carbon labelling of Tesco products in the coming weeks with the Carbon Trust, by using our experience of putting clear useful information in front of customers. We will help them become familiar with the new currency of CO2, so that they can change their consumption patterns.</p>
          <p>In summary then, Tesco was about growth. We are confident of sustaining strong growth into the future. We do this by following the customer. As they change, we change. And this means, our growth is increasingly broadly based, as our new businesses come through to scale and profitability. It also means, we can carry the cost of investing in the new products and businesses, which will drive our long-term growth. At the same time, we are delivering improving returns and tangible benefits for shareholders, and meeting our responsibilities to other stakeholders by playing an innovative part in tackling some of the social environmental challenges we all face. We've delivered strong results across the Group by making shopping better for customers. Tesco is a company for all seasons. And I'm confident that the business is well placed to meet the challenges which lie ahead. Thank you.</p>

          <p>I am telling everybody I'm 37. So I can't tell at the back. And two quick questions, assuming we're heading for a recession in the U.K., what will be different this time do you think from the last time?  And what will you be able to do that's different from the last time which is few years ago?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I know that you don't keep gross margins movement at all, but assuming you'll be able to help me out. I know how well Andy did in math O-levels so I'll put in the style of math O-level, which is if last year's U.K. gross margin increased by X, what will be the change in the current year, so give us a bit of a guide, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. While Andy gets his thinking hat on there, Terry, do you want to comment on what will be different about the so-called recession this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; perhaps it wouldn't be right to call it a recession at the moment. I think that it's clear that things have changed for the consumer. And it always takes a little bit of time to get a sure fix on what's been going on. And it looks now as if there was an important change right around the Northern Rock crisis around September time. And probably that has accelerated a bit coming out of Christmas. Essentially consumers have changed, so we will have to change.</p>
          <p>It's not all gloom though, I think that if you reset your store correctly, and you do have to reset the whole offer. And you're successful in getting in tune with the customers, so they feel that you understand the particular pressures that they are under, they will respond to that, and you will get rewarded for that. So, I think you will see a situation where some people are struggling, but some people are doing really quite well with it.</p>
          <p>For Tesco, what's different? I think we're in a slightly better sort of price value position going into this particular downturn. Remember we had a very similar one in '98 effectively a consumer recession coped with that pretty well. And the philosophy of the business is, as I say is, as consumers change, we change. So, we're quite prepared to change what's necessary. We want to do it in a thoughtful way. I know one or two of you were a little concerned about what kept you waiting in the autumn. But I think if you sort of rush, pull or gate at these things, you can easily destroy value, destroy profitability. It's much better to really get a handle on exactly what forces are driving the consumer so that you know how to sort of reset out your store. And I feel that we're doing that now, and we're beginning to see the right kind of response to the consumer. So, again all markets are about value creation. They're not about value destruction. So, it's very important that you adjust correctly for this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just to add to that, obviously, we're a different group now than we were back at the last recession. So if you look at the presentations this morning, the strength of the international business in terms of the Group's performance, okay, for U.K. it hits more challenging times let's call it that, and obviously, we intend to do well in that. But if you look at where the Group is now with the strong international business, which is growing fast, the retailing services we've moved in clearly beginning to demonstrate good growth and more to come. So, from the Group's point of view, I think we're in a much better position to manage our way through, still delivering good value for shareholders. Andy, do you want to talk about it?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. Inflation, in terms of food inflation, what are your expectations for next year or two on food inflation? And within your international numbers you have like-for-like I think you said 2%, what was volumes within that? And are you seeing evidence of more aggressive nature of food inflation in some of your lower income markets? And does that concerns you going forward?</p>
          <p>And then just back to the U.K., you talked about helping the U.K. consumer out. Can you give us a &#x2013; flesh out a little bit more where you see that happening? How that's going to be a portion perhaps between pricing or marketing in Clubcard? And finally, what you hope from the Competition Commission and what do you expect to get?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, how many more questions into that sentence, Clive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Inflation, well, I mean there are inflationary pressures still in the pipeline. And rice, I know, is the latest one to attract attention. It's particularly difficult to separate the fact from fiction at the moment. I was flicking through the newspapers today and seeing some extraordinary sort of tables about price increases. I mean, as you know, we measure the year-on-year price movement of everything that we sell &#x2013; the products about tens of thousands and the volumes. And I think for the whole year, excluding petrol, it was 1.2%, correct me if I'm wrong, and the second half was 1.5%. So, there is inflation because traditionally we have been a slight minus. Clearly, food inflation was a bit higher than that, but within 2 to 3% territory, maybe peaking at 3%.</p>
          <p>So, this is nothing like the kinds of 10, 20, 30% that people are talking about. You've got isolated commodities, but they don't carry on through to the full range of products. I may have used the example of beer, it's made of grain, but it's only 3% of the final selling price, and so that's quite easily absorbed in the price.</p>
          <p>But, I think that's going to continue through the year that upward pressure from commodity pricing. I'm sure some of it's structural, quite a lot of it feels financial, I have to say. And of course, with financial asset bubbles they go down as well as up. So, I wouldn't just assume that this is a permanent increase. A lot of these are crop based, so crop yields and crop volumes can change fairly quickly as you go forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of internationally, the first thing to say is, there is always a kind of trade-off between volume and price. It's not &#x2013; they are not separate items. You don't maintain the same volume when the price goes up. There is always a trade-off. There is more inflation internationally. I don't have the figures to hand. We don't particularly measure inflation. I mean people tell me what it is market by market, but we don't have the same quality of data in the other markets. There is a little bit more inflation going through, but you wouldn't necessarily expect to see like-for-likes grow as a result of that.</p>
          <p>In terms of what you mean by helping the consumer, the consumer is looking for different things, not every consumer. It does affect people who are on more limited incomes, because the rises in energy and counsel tax and general taxes have affected them more. And so, you really have to readdress the whole store in lots of little ways in terms of how much feature space you have, the selection of products and price points that you put on it, the particular selection of brands that you put out there, how you structure your price list. There is actually quite a lot of detail in a change when you set out a store for a different type of consumer. And what you're hoping to do basically is connect better with the customer, so it works better. You've got more of what they want. There is the switching of certain things and switching onto other things. And you've got to show them that you've got it. So, that's what it's about essentially. And as I say, that's a more artful thing than just slashing everything all over the place and hoping for the best.</p>
          <p>Competition Commission, as far as I am concerned the Competition Commission is all but done. You've got just to look at the broad conclusions that it's a competitive industry, consumers are well served. There is a dynamic competition and innovation right through the chain; nobody is out in front and unassailable. So, for me, it's that's it now, let's get on with it, put it back in the hands of the consumer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. James Anstead from Citigroup. Just a few quick questions on Fresh &amp; Easy if that's okay. You've said that the business is doing -- sales trends is better than the U.S. industry average. Can you just clarify what you regard that industry average as being, because you see lots of different stuffs on that depending on how you define it?  Secondly, you're clearly getting very good growth in the sales in the 27 stores you opened before Christmas. Can you talk a little bit about the balance of the growth between new customers coming in and the increasing basket size, don't have to be specific, but just any comments on that would be helpful?  And finally, can you just remind us of what you previously said about the profitability targets beyond '08, '09 and whether you are sticking with those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, it's not an exact science on U.S. average supermarket sales, probably, is no definitive. But for working assumption, somewhere between 9 and $10; of course, clearly with the sales trajectory being so steep that whatever figure you choose it will come past in a week's time sort of thing. But that's the working assumption. The source of growth, obviously, with such rapid progression, is inevitably from a combination of existing customers shopping more and new customers coming along all the time. And when you do all these surveys you get a very high percentage of people for whom it's the first visit into the store. I think for memory that shareholder survey was 20% plus people. It was their first trip into the store.</p>
          <p>And basket size is good. It's obviously held down a bit by new people starting, but if you take those out and look at the basket size, people who've been in there for a while it's very, very encouraging. The thing that encourages me is that the appeal is almost uniformly strong across all income groups. That's pretty unique in America. And so that potent mix of outstanding prices, industry leading prices, but quality and freshness that's not been seen before, has really cut through across all the income groups and all age groups. And of course, the retired market is a huge market in the U.S., and it's made a very big impact, I suppose because of the combination of somewhere you can go locally and the prices are good for people on fixed incomes.</p>
          <p>And all ethnicities and of course that matters on the West Coast. If you say, well, what areas are a little bit in front and what areas a little bit behind, there is a little bit behind after the very biggest families. And you would expect that, if you've got six or seven people in your household, you are not going to think that the Fresh &amp; Easy is going to be able to give you a complete one stop shop, and so some of the very biggest Hispanic families who traditionally like to go to the local supermarket. But what I would say is even the score on one stop shopping, which always would have been the hardest one to score on, because you've got an audited range is good and improving rapidly all the time.</p>

          <p>Hi. Andrew Kasoulis from Credit Suisse. Can you give us a little bit more information on your property pipeline please? You talk about deal imminent in the announcement or certainly deals coming. So if you give us a bit more detail as to how much you would expect to achieve maybe in the next year in terms of proceeds? Also you talked about 8 billion plus of non-food sales, could you break that down a bit please?  Could you give us an idea of how much of that is truly discretionary? Is it half? Is it 25%?  And lastly, can you give us an indication of what the inc-petrol like-for-like is at the moment please, obviously is lots of petrol inflation?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Obviously, in the current market, you've always got to have a caveat on that, but all of a sudden the moment is that it looks like we'll still be able to deliver on what we said we hoped to deliver, which was the 5 billion of sales over the five years. And we're well into that now, and two years under our belt. And we'd look to broadly deliver it in a fairly even progression over time. And, yeah, I mean that's it pretty much really. I think -- I'd say that I've got that caveat about the overall market, but so far we've seen good appetite and I'd say we did this deal in February, I think, the yield was good. And so we expect yields to probably ease out a little bit as the market continues to struggle for liquidity and so on in a more general sense, but so far we've seen good appetite. And the covenant is good and the properties are brilliant, so...</p>

I mean, if you point to, if there is quite a lot in there which is basic solid stuff like household and health and beauty and sort of discount elements to clothing and household goods, seasonal goods. I mean, you can see from the trajectory the figures, if you go back two or three years, I mean, non-food has slowed down more rapidly than food. So, it is affected.  But I think that we can do relatively better in non-food than food actually. I think that we've got a very strong discount positioning in there, and most the market overall might do worst in food, I think our relative positioning can be stronger.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. First saying, you were just finishing up on non-food, Terry. Can you perhaps give us a bit of color as the non-food mature just sort of the shape of the profitability behind that, because clearly overall sales might have come under a little bit more pressure but profits are maturing. We could still say a margin that's improved and perhaps put that in the context of the overall U.K. margin to help us. Back on the U.K. just more generally, clearly we've had stronger competition coming back. Can you explain, I suppose, what happened in the last six months? It clearly sounds like you're more confident going forward, you can outperform, is that just you've now got your offer allowing to where a tougher competitor wants to be because clearly the likes of Morrisons in that won't annualize their improvements for another six, seven months. So why do you pickup now after relatively declining performance? And perhaps just one on TPF, are you confident that there won't be any further write-downs because when you look through you've got that well covered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to start with TPF, Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What was the question again? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any further write-downs TPF or have you not covered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think at the moment the book is in good shape. I think we've got a strong provision in position in terms of all the debt products, the loan products rather I should say. And we feel that we've got a book that's significantly better than the industry. Now you always say these things with due hesitation because as consumers' slowdown start to happen, these things can come back to buy, but as we sit here today, I think we can say that the situation in TPF is looking very good.</p>
          <p>I would point out, it's not an accident, though we are not in the mortgage market, and that wasn't a deliberate decision not to enter there, what we consider to be the irrational pricing area that has now become some of the fallout you've seen in the Northern Rock and everything else. So, I think the business has been managed on a pretty prudent basis for quite a long time. And that said, floods, 30 million increase was a flood hit, the actual results tell you, it's a once every 30-year event. This has just been the last sort of four or five years, we've had a couple of times, isn't that? But -- so look for those 60 years off, anyway, on that basis. So, it's hard, it's obviously impossible to predict those. But in terms of the generic, the sort of the general position in terms of the TPF book, it is in good shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Really a good picture on them for profitability, and largely because you've got this sort of maturation of the investments in logistics, central sourcing, international logistics and U.K. based logistics coming on. The mix &#x2013; the sales mix has been altered slightly through the period, which has been beneficial. Clothing clearly would be the standout because it had a very bad summer as well as a bit of a slowdown economically, but it was well bought this year. So, actually we ended up very clean on clothing with a good achieved margin.  It didn't need to be that way. I think it seemed to be particularly good job. So, we haven't been straining on profitability on non-food despite the relative slowdown.</p>
          <p>On competition, actually we have never really lost any ground against Sainsbury or ASDA actually. The worst we ever were was kind of in the middle of the pack. The standout thing was Morrisons. And I suppose there is a couple of things you can say about that, one was, that they were coming from a low base, but the other one I think, they got their war chest together and their timing was fortuitous or well timed, which ever way you look at it, but all credit to them. And so they hit the market with some investments when people were looking for it. So they got in front.</p>
          <p>I think more recently, we've been able to pull them back into the pack and so, you haven't got much of a spread across the retailers. And we are moving up the relative pecking order occasionally being out on top. But there is not a lot of difference amongst them. And as I say, we could have reacted, perhaps, a bit quick, but the risk there was we might have overreacted or destroyed a lot of value in the reaction. I think much better to get a good sense, good understanding of what's going on. And then I just &#x2013; I remember when I took over in marketing in 1992, when we were in the depths of a recession at Tesco, we were particularly struggling. I didn't actually come up with a recommendation for six months, which didn't make me very popular. But it was worth taking the time, because we then really did understand what we were dealing with, and of course, then you were able to use and build on it in the years ahead. We are not in a recession now. I don't view it as a recession as such, but we are in a slowdown. And we've done our homework. We've readjusted and you should see better relative performance.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc de Speville, Redburn Partners. Terry, question, do you really and truly feel comfortable that the U.K. grocery trading capability is not being noticeably diluted or even &#x2013; if -- I will use the word diluted rather than damaged, by the increased focus on international? For instance, do you think suppliers are now as happy as working with the &#x2013; what has previously and always been a very collaborative Tesco rather than sort of strong arm, aggressive in throwing your market share around. So, that's the first question on the potential dilution on what you're doing to offset that risk.</p>
          <p>And secondly, have you considered or do you think is possibly time for a re-branding to give the Tesco logo, which some people would say still perhaps stuck maybe a little bit in the '90s to slightly &#x2013; and also the stores are slightly softer, less clinical feel that may appeal more to today's sort of middle upper income groups where some surveys show that you maybe losing a bit of traction there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slightly leading questions, but I think taking them straight, no, I don't think that there is a risk from any sense that the business is getting more insensitive, if you like, in terms of its supplier relationships. I mean the view around the world would be Tesco would be a pretty progressive customer in terms of how we go about business and how we try to manage it on a broad basis. As I've always said, it is a tough profession because you're dealing with very expert people on the other side of the table. Remember most of what we buy from global giants like Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestle and these are expert people. So, no, I don't see any danger there.</p>
          <p>You've also &#x2013; it's inevitable that it's going to be a more challenging period because of the point I made earlier that you've got aspirations for price increases, which are not economically justified. And therefore, our job on behalf of the consumer is to make sure we accept the minimum that's economically justified. And an individual consumer can't do that. So they rely on Tesco to do that. So, that's a very important role that we play.</p>
          <p>On the rebranding, I mean to keep that under review; we do regular brand reviews about the business. It's not as important as you might think. I mean, obviously, you want to be contemporary and sharp and so on. It's not as important. What tends to happen is a kind of post rationalization. So if the business hits a problem, then people say, look at the state of the brand, it is terrible. But it seldom works the other way around; the people are turned off by water in a pot of paint. You might say at the moment actually that the market has moved on any way, and customers really are keen on how cheap are the Kipling cakes rather than getting a new color in. But the two are not mutually exclusive, and we do keep it under review. And we would always like &#x2013; we never tend to be an award winner for store designs and so on, but we would like the stores to be bright and fresh and contemporary.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jaime Vazquez from JPMorgan. Three questions, please. The first one is, what is the rate of growth of non-food space in the U.K.?  Secondly, can you give guidance for Tesco Direct sales in the year? I think you've given losses of 20 million, and perhaps sales is more interesting.  And thirdly, do you still expect the U.S. to breakeven next year or during next year after a 100 million loss this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, rate of growth in non-food space, sales Tesco Direct and USA breakeven next year question mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, I don't have the figures to hand, but obviously the rate of growth of non-food space has been higher than the average growth of space which you can work out, because the greater part of it goes into non-food. I mean, it means we've had like-for-like growth but it has not been that spectacular. Part of it though there has been a dilution in the quality of non-food space, because we had this opportunity to build a lot of mezzanines, which we had a limited period of time in which to do that, which is good for the long term. You've developed out the space. And we had to put departments up there, which tended to be big non-food departments, which in themselves are profitable and so on. But they're slightly dilutive to sales per square foot. Direct, Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't want to get into a sort of cycle of always I mean to give a sort of sales budget for Direct. But I mean I think it was a <mark type="inaudible" /> of 180 million this year, just shy of that. So, we've been looking for it to push through the 200 million comfortably next year and keep pressing on.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's James Grzinic from Dresdner Kleinwort. A couple of questions for you. The first one is for Terry. So, second year of underlying margin expansion you have delivered in the U.K., are you happy you can do this again this year? And what should be on the medium term?  And the second one on the market value of the property, 31 million -- billion rather -- can you split that between international and U.K.? And what your yield assumption was for both parts?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to take margin, Terry? Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the underlying margin was slightly up. I've said before that operational gearing is a little bit easier when obviously prices are going up slightly rather than going down. But we haven't seen a pattern of gradual increase in underlying margin in the business. We feel we have good margin control in the business, very active productivity program. And so, I mean, we'll have forecast margins going forward, but obviously, that's something that we would like to do. We think that was a good result that we saw a good top line sales growth and some improvement in margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Property?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We'll move the &#x2013; the yields have to reflect the property deal we did was approved. So in the upper fours, which I think was the right thing to do. And we also got a slightly better rental so that numbers on those as well. So it's a sort of the rental numbers have gone up a bit around the 24 pound mark. I haven't particularly split out the U.K. and international. I'll probably do that for you after this if you want and have a quick look. But that will be the major change there. Then of course we've added in the best part of 4 billion of new assets during the year as well as the disposals. So I think that's the way....</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's James Collins from Deutsche Bank. Two questions. Number one on U.K. space. Looking at the plans for U.K. space this year versus last year, it looks like there is a bit less space coming through from extra both in terms of extensions and new space and more from super stores and convenience. Is that going to be a feature ongoing?  And the second question is a bit more on U.K. competition. I think you've talked about your competitors before being in margin recovery mode over the last couple of years. Do you think this is still the case? And as and when they come out of the margin recovery mode, what does that mean for the way that you compete against those businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're changing the mix of space in the U.K. It tends to be wherever you can get it. Some of the windfalls tend to come in smaller shops. Planning is a little bit easier on Express. But we're having some good success, too, in regeneration schemes and so on, which allow us to open larger stores. They just take more time. One of the reasons I think I mentioned that the CapEx went up at the end is because we were able to move forward on some big regeneration schemes, which has got quite a lot of capital going out in the early years. So in fact, you do get capital receipts and so on and a good big store at the end of it.</p>
          <p>So, we're not obviously aiming for smaller stores. I suppose if you look back over the years, each year would have a slightly different mix of space in stores. There is a new planning bill going through as well, which we hope will slightly improve the situation in terms of getting new space opened. Competition, yeah, I mean, I think, there is still a job to do in the industry to improve to economic returns. And I mean you can't legislate for how individual firms will react or manage themselves, but over the long run, you'd expect the shareholders to expect a return on the investments. And that needs rational managements in the sense that your actions are intended to create benefit and value rather than to destroy it. So, in that sense, that's how I expect people to react, but of course, as a manager you've got to react, you've got to play what's in front of you. So, we've had all kinds of markets over the years. Tesco has always managed to find a way through it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. It's Matt Truman from Lehman. Just on the Fresh &amp; Easy stores achieving more than $20 a foot. I wonder if you can give us some color on maybe the locations, the customer demographics and why maybe these were more successful over the average and whether it's just a question of time and maturity profiles or what's extra special about these stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I understand you're asking, but I don't know it will be that helpful. Could you be down to let's have a list of the stores and their turnovers. I mean, I think it was only popped in there to say, look, we are already getting stores breaking into some useful turnover in just a few days. I mean, the main point to take out of it is that we had a budget and the average is not bad, but it is building that rapidly. I wouldn't take more out of it than that. Clearly, we learn a lot in terms of individual locations and so on. The overall picture is quite encouraging that it's not one of these things where you have some big successes and big failures. There is actually a pretty consistent performance, which are allied to the broad consumer appeal, gives me encouragement because I've never doubted that it would be a success, the issue is how bigger success. And some of the early signs are encouraging on that front.</p>
