          <p>Welcome to the Statoil presentation, which takes place from Presentations Center in London City. My name is Lars S&#xF8;rensen and I'm the Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Today's event can, as usually, be followed by webcast and that makes me extend my warm welcome to the webcast audience. As you know safety is of paramount importance and just for the information to the viewers on the Internet, we just had a safety briefing here in the room. So we don't need to waste time on that.</p>
          <p>Today's program will be split in to two. First, our Chief Financial Officer in Statoil, Eldar S&#xE6;tre will give a short fourth quarter and 2009 earnings presentation. At 1:15 this afternoon we will &#x2013; London Time, we will start the strategy update with our Chief Executive Officer, Helge Lund; our Chief Financial Office, Eldar S&#xE6;tre and our Executive VP for Natural Gas, Rune Bj&#xF8;rnson. That's at 1:15 London Time.</p>
          <p>Each of the two blocks of the presentations, first the fourth quarter of 2009 and then the strategy update with a few presentations, will be followed by a Q&amp;A session. So you will have the opportunity to ask questions. And the viewers on the Internet, can as usually, send in questions to my PC here, and I will ask the questions on your behalf.</p>
          <p>This morning at 7:30 Central European Time, 6:30 London Time, we published the presentations, both the presentations that we're going to follow here now in a minute and also the strategy presentations that we will present at 1:15. So they are downloadable. You are able to download those from our website www.statoil.com.</p>
          <p>Can I ask you both here in London and also the ones that download the presentations on the Internet to study carefully the forward-looking statements disclaimer at the end of the presentation, please.</p>
          <p>Yes, now it's my privilege to pass the floor to Eldar S&#xE6;tre.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us at this fourth quarter and also full year earnings presentation. The fourth quarter of 2009 is another quarter with strong deliveries from Statoil, both when it comes to production, to cost reductions and also exploration results.</p>
          <p>We have also delivered in line with our guidance on unit production costs, our guidance on exploration activities while we came out slightly below our forecast on capital expenditures. At the same time, we had a strong cash generation. So let me start by looking at the financial results for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>I think this is the full year. In &#x2013; I think you have to &#x2013; sorry about that, it will never happen again. In the quarter Statoil reported a net operating income of NOK 33.5 billion and a net income of 7.1 billion. Adjusted earnings were 34.4 billion and adjusted earnings after tax 9.7 billion. Adjusted earnings were down 20% from last year and this was mainly because of an almost 50% reduction in gas prices in Norwegian kroner. This was partly balanced by increasing liquids prices, lower operating costs and an almost 30% reduction in our SG&amp;A costs.</p>
          <p>Net income was up 2 billion, from 2 billion last year to 7.1 billion this quarter, while the adjusted earnings after tax went down 17%. The reported tax rate was 78% as it was reported while the tax rate on the adjusted earnings were 72%. Now the difference is mainly related to the tax rate on the various adjustments that we make to our accounts.</p>
          <p>A full reconciliation of our quarterly tax rate and the net financial items is given in our MD&amp;A. Cost development, including the realization of merger synergies, have developed as planned, and the additional cost reduction program that we introduced one year ago for 2009 and 2010 is also on track. And I will give some more detail into these developments in the presentation later this afternoon.</p>
          <p>The net adjustments that we make to our net operating income were quite small this quarter totaling NOK 0.9 billion and they are all specified in the MD&amp;A material. So let's then look at the full year, hopefully, earnings results.</p>
          <p>Our 2009 net income was 17.7 billion compared to 43.3 billion last year. Adjusted earnings were down 36% year-on-year while the adjusted earnings after tax fell by 33% to 38.3 billion. Lower oil prices and gas prices were the main drivers behind the reduction. Both operating expenses, SG&amp;A and exploration expenses were also somewhat down while adjusted depreciations increased because of higher depreciations related to the new fields that were brought into operation. We have also had a significant drop as you know in the refining margins while our natural gas business, trading business have continued to deliver strong results.</p>
          <p>The net financial items as reported amounted to a loss of NOK 6.7 billion for 2009. And if we adjust for interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange impact and also an impairment related to the Pernis refinery, the net financial items added up to a negative of NOK 0.3 billion which is exactly where it should be and as we have guided. Our tax rate on the adjusted or the underlying earnings was 71% for the full year and this is on par with the year before and according to the guidance that we have given you on our tax, average tax rate.</p>
          <p>So let's then take a closer look at the production figures for 2009 and for the quarter. Total equity production of oil and gas was 2,057,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. That's up 2% from the previous year. The increase in the quarterly equity production was mainly driven by our strong equity production growth outside the Norwegian Continental Shelf.</p>
          <p>Entitlement production in the quarter was almost flat at 1.850 million &#x2013; 52 exactly. This implies PSA, so-called PSA effects of 205,000 barrels per day in this quarter, which is actually more than what is typical and &#x2013; this is due to a very high equity production in the fourth quarter also from these fields and a correction to entitlement volumes from previous quarters. So the PSA effects for the full year was 156,000 barrels per day, which is exactly in line with the guidance that we have given you assuming an oil price of around $60 per barrel.</p>
          <p>An updated guidance on production sharing effects will be given. In the presentation material it is given. A short version is that there is no material changes to the guidance compared to what we have said previously.</p>
          <p>The full-year production for 2009, as you see, came in at 1,962,000 barrels per day. And that is slightly above the number that we gave you more or less exactly one year ago. We will provide more information on guidance going forward on the production and for 2010 and onwards in our strategy presentation.</p>
          <p>Now a few comments also to the adjusted earnings for each of the business areas. E&amp;P Norway reached adjusted earnings of NOK 27 billion in the quarter, which is down 23% compared to last year. The main driver is approximately 50% reduction in the gas, the internal gas transfer price to our Natural Gas business segment and also lower liquids production. This was partly balanced by increasing gas production, gas volumes and a 17% increase in the price of liquids including NGLs in Norwegian kroner. The decrease &#x2013; the 6% decrease in liquids production is mainly due to natural decline and also some well related and operational issues in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating expenses are approximately 10% lower year-on-year and exploration expenses are also somewhat down.</p>
          <p>International E&amp;P had adjusted earnings of 3.4 billion in the quarter. And this is considerably up from the 0.3 level that we had in the same quarter last year. The main driver is higher oil price obviously, and also growing equity production. The equity production increased by 13% year-on-year to a level of almost 550,000 barrels per day, while the entitlement volumes, the total entitlement volumes were up 8% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>The adjusted depreciation of the International business segment were at approximately the same level as one year ago. Increasing depreciation costs from increasing volumes were balanced by an upgrade of reserves on some of the newer fields that have been put into production and also by weaker U.S. dollar versus Norwegian kroner compared to one year ago. Adjusted operating expenses decreased by more than 20% in the International business segment mainly driven by a stronger Norwegian kroner versus U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Natural Gas had adjusted earnings of four billion this quarter compared to 4.8 the year before. Net operating income from the processing and transport part of the business was 1.8, which has slightly improved compared to last year. And the adjusted earnings from the marketing and trading was 2.2 billion, compared to 3.3 billion the year before. And this reduction within marketing and trading was mainly due to lower internal margins and somewhat weaker trading results from operating in a lower gas price environment.</p>
          <p>And finally, Manufacturing &amp; Marketing delivered adjusted earnings of 0.4 billion, compared to 4.2 billion last year. The oil and products trading business were down from 3.9 to 0.7 this quarter. Last year we had a quite significant positive currency gain in the quarter, 2.2 billion and in addition there was a much steeper contango curve on the &#x2013; contango on the forward curve at that time.</p>
          <p>Energy and Retail are again showing good progress with the contribution of 300 million to our EBIT this quarter. The manufacturing business continued to show weak results with a loss of 0.6 billion compared to a plus of 0.5 the year before and this is driven obviously by the lower refinery margins and also methanol &#x2013; weakened methanol prices. So all in all, our adjusted earnings added up to 34.4 as mentioned with the corresponding tax rate of 72%.</p>
          <p>So then, I will move on to comment on our CapEx and exploration expenditures. Our CapEx spent during last year was $12.4 billion and that is approximately one billion below the guiding that we gave you approximately one year ago. And this number of 12.4 excludes lease capitalizations that we have made to our accounts mainly related to the Peregrino field in Brazil. The main reasons for the lower CapEx is the strict capital discipline and prioritizations of the more marginal projects that we have dealt with during this year and also some positive effects from developments in the cost environment.</p>
          <p>On exploration activities, we spent $2.7 billion, exactly what we said one year ago. We completed 70 wells as we said and have planned with a discovery rate of a quite impressive 70%. I will come back to our forecast for 2010 on CapEx and exploration later today.</p>
          <p>So now let's take a look at the reserve replacement and our resource base. The reserve replacement ratio for the year is 73%. And this takes the three-year average up to 64%. And obviously this is a significant improvement compared to the 34% that we had one year ago in 2008, but obviously still not satisfactory and we're working hard to grow this ratio. Based on our pipeline of new plant projects, <mark type="inaudible" /> which is also very important in growing our resources and the gradual step-up in the booking or &#x2013; and conventional resources we are quite confident that the RO will eventually claim climb above 100% in the near future. We will also revert to this issue in our presentation later today.</p>
          <p>So let me now look at the cash generation for 2009, and this illustration shows all the cash movements. We generated NOK 182 billion in cash from our underlying operations. We paid 101 billion in taxes and we spent NOK 75 billion on our CapEx program. The average oil price for 2009 was $58 per barrel and this implies that we were cash neutral at around $55 per barrel, which again is exactly as we told you one year ago, and this is obviously then before dividend. Our net debt-to-capital employed was 27% by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And let's then look at the dividend, the proposed dividend, for 2009. Our Board of Directors has decided to propose a cash dividend of NOK 6 per share for the AGM to take place on the 19th of May of this year. And provided that the proposal is accepted by AGM, the dividend will be paid out to the shareholders or holders of the ordinary shares on the 2nd of June and the dividend will also be made available for ADR bank on the same date. The payoff ratio based on IFRS reported net income is 104% for 2009 and the proposed dividend takes the payoff ratio, if you go back to the IPO in 2001, up to 56%. The yield, the dividend yield, and if I use a share price of 134, would be 4.5%.</p>
          <p>Let me then briefly summarize our 2009 deliveries. Our equity production came in slightly above the guidance that we gave you and presented one year ago. Our exploration program of 2.7 billion delivered a discovery rate of 70%. We spent 12.4 billion on CapEx, which is slightly below the guiding. Our cost-saving initiatives are on track. We have delivered a strong cash generation and ended the year with a 27% net debt to capital employed ratio. And the Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of NOK 6 per share.</p>
          <p>So all in all during 2009, Statoil has made consistent and strong deliveries as we have promised and this is both from an operational and from a financial perspective. So we will now take the short Q&amp;A session before we continue with the strategy update. So Lars, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, Eldar. I just wanted to tell the audience from the Internet there's been some questions as to where they can download the presentations from, and if you go to the front page of statoil.com there is a link to the presentations and you can download them from there. Any questions from the floor? We'll start with James from Morgan Stanley and please wait for the microphones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I have just two questions please, on the dividend policy it now fits your base or if the oil price was to go back to sub 60, say $50 a barrel for a couple of years, are you saying that you will not go below six <mark type="inaudible" /> no matter what or it's going to move basically in line as more or less say payoffs on a long-term basis, but in line with your adjusted earnings which would seem logical, but there's some ambiguity, because the text kind of implies it's going to grow no matter what.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, the cash flow break-even you just outlined there, if we take on both the growing percentage of your production and hence top line that's coming from the gas and your CapEx is going up a bit this year, presumably you've done the calculation can we take it that the break-even for this year is 60 to $65 a barrel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first comment to the dividend policy. It is definitely our firm intention as stated in the policy to grow the dividend year-on-year and that is clear in the policy. Our current view of the long-term underlying performance and our earnings going forward is also reflected in the level that we now established for the dividend going forward. So our current view is that we can grow the dividend from the level of NOK 6 per share going forward. This is based &#x2013; this view is based on our positive view of the long-term underlying earnings, as I said, and that stems from our view on the commodity environment, the long-term commodity environment both for oil and gas, which we have stated is positive. Also going to introduce to you information today that &#x2013; basically that we also are continuing with our long-term growth strategy and we will also obviously continue to carry on with improvements in the organization and improve on margins as such.</p>
          <p>So our intention is to grow the dividend year-on-year also through the normal business cycles of this business and this is actually the meaning of the concept of long term in the dividend policy. It cuts through the normal cycle and this means that we now in a down cycle would be willing to use the balance sheet and also to cut cost to sustain dividend through the downturn. So cycles and commodity cycles in oil and gas business is a natural thing. It has always been there, it's going to be there and we have taken that into account when we have established the level for our dividend going forward.</p>
          <p>Then, a few comments, I will never use the word guarantee in terms of dividend, but this is our firm intention to grow the dividend from this starting point with a long-term perspective cutting through the cycles, normal cycles for this industry. Then to the question of neutrality and cash neutrality for this year, I mentioned that we for last year were neutral at around $55 per barrel and I guess then it's a question of what kind of assumptions you put on a lot of things. We have indicated to you that the production is going to be sort of like in the same range that we've seen for last year. We might come slightly up on the CapEx, slightly.</p>
          <p>For the main, I think the main, if we assume that the downstream business is being sort of in approximately the same environment that we have seen for last year, what we do expect sort of some changes as mainly related to the gas business. And you should remember that in the first half of 2009 we had quite strong results from our long-term gas prices from the oil price link and the delay that we have in our long-term gas contracts related to oil. And that took us into the first half of last year with quite high gas prices.</p>
          <p>Now the lower environment it's coming also into the gas prices on our long-term contract. So we expect to see on average lower average gas prices for this year compared to what we saw last year. So this is why we indicated slightly higher cash neutrality price results for this year compared to last year. So we indicate that this might take us up to around 60, I wouldn't climb up to 65, I would say up to around 60 in terms of cash break-even with the assumption that they are put forward now on CapEx exploration, production and assuming sort of no significant changes in working capital or the downstream environment with just taking into account that we expect a lower gas price environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take another question from the floor, Iain Reid, just across the floor. And while Iain is getting the microphone, let me just introduce next to me K&#xE5;re Thomsen, who is our Head of Accounting, has joined us on stage to answer questions together with Eldar. Iain, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eldar, just a quick question on reserves. Can you kind of indicate what's changed in terms of the booking of reserves from last year? What's the kind of big moving parts which were in there and what's changed on the resources booking? And maybe, since you are allowed to do it now, could you tell us what the 2P reserve level is now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what &#x2013; I guess you're referring to the SEC rules and the impact of that, is that the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, which projects in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I couldn't go into specific projects. What I could comment on is basically that we have seen &#x2013; grown resource base both in Norwegian Continental Shelf and International, we have started to book very carefully. We have a demonstration plant in Canada. So for the first time we see some unconventional resources into our resource base, and we think that is going to be much bigger contributions going forward. If we refer to the changes that the SEC have implemented, there is really no major implications from those changes into our number. One of them is actually that we can start to book in Canada because we haven't actually produced anything from the demo, but we can use analogs into this. And that's mainly the only place where we have sort of an implication from the new rules into our resource base. Our Norwegian Continental Shelf that is a mature, to a large extent, a mature province with well-defined reservoirs and the impact of a more precise definition of reliable technology doesn't give us very large additions to the resource bases as such. So this is very much sort of ordinary straightforward changes, adjustments from Iraq new field coming into production and then these developments from the new resources.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You booked something in the Marcellus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Marcellus we have just started to book. Basically what we can book on the conventional gas is related to the wells that you have drilled and a certain circle around those wells and also wells that you have planned, have plans to drill within the next two years. So that's what we can book. So it's not big numbers but we have started to book it, but again this represents a huge resource base, which would fit into our reserve growth going forward.</p>
          <p>Well, 2P I'm forbidden to use that word, so what I can say is that in terms of expected &#x2013; well we are not we haven't made up a set of data on &#x2013; according to what is presented as the conditions for defining 2P. We have used our old way of looking at it which is derived as what we call the expected, which is quite similar to the 2P. But the expected recoverable resource that we have accessed and that is at the same level of around 22 billion barrels that we have presented earlier and that represents approximately 32 per year, three years of current production and it's approximately 50% on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and 50% outside of Norway.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Eldar it's Colin Smith from ICAP. Just coming back to the dividend again, in terms of the payout that you've got and in terms of long-term underlying earnings, does the concept of a payout ratio still have any meaning for you? I mean, would you like to tell us that 6% represents X of current underlying earnings sort of thing? Can you also comment a little bit about what you think required reinvestment looks like? And finally I think you mentioned the possibility of share buybacks, it doesn't look to me as though you've got that much space in your balance sheet and I just wondered under what circumstances you might actually undertake share buybacks. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the payout ratio as such for the future for this dividend it has relevance because it still have the policy as we've stated. So it has relevance, but changing the policy going forward that has as such no relevance, but we felt it was important to demonstrate what would have been the impact with the old policy and that leads exactly to 104% and that gives some of the reasoning behind the adjustments to the dividend policy that we have proposed to create more predictability in this number.</p>
          <p>When it comes to share buybacks that is something that we would like to have in our toolbox. It might be that for a given year we might have a situation that we might want to return more cash to our shareholder than what we can actually put into our view on the underlying earnings. So it is something that we might &#x2013; would like to have in the toolbox for the future and therefore we have included that just having it mentioned in the policy. The Board have not taken a view as to whether they will ask for such a mandate for this year for the AGM. So what we're saying now is that we will &#x2013; they are proposing a dividend, cash dividend of NOK 6.</p>

          <p>We are actually running out of time for this session and there will be a much longer Q&amp;A session at the end of the next session. So if you don't get your question asked or answered in this session, can I ask you to leave it for the next, because we're actually almost running out of time.</p>
          <p>On the Internet, I've got a number of questions here. They are all directed at the time 2012 and beyond. So we will sort of save those questions for later, not because I'm not going to forget these questions, but just save them for the next session. This Q&amp;A was generally just about the 4Q and full year 2009 earnings.</p>
          <p>There is one question left from the Internet that I will ask here though before we end this session and go into the next. And that is from Helge Andr&#xE9; Martinsen at Nordea. Could you please comment on the huge volatility in the item purchased, net of inventory variation adjusted found in the Int business segment?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's why I have the competition. And I think even he got surprised now. Now it's &#x2013; the purchase in the Int section is depending on some internal methods that in some instances the Int section have sold direct into the market and the OTS, the trading organization is more the agent, and if so, then you get the &#x2013; also a cost there. And some instances has had &#x2013; has gone through OTS.</p>
