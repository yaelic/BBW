          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Ecopetrol Earnings Conference Call. My name is Luisa and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Alejandro Giraldo, Investor Relations Manager of Ecopetrol. Please proceed, sir.</p>

          <p>Okay. Good afternoon to all and welcome to the conference call where we will discuss Ecopetrol's operating and financial results in the first quarter of 2011. Before we begin, it is important to mention that the comments by Ecopetrol's new management could include projections of the company's future performance. These projections do not constitute any commitment as to the future results, nor do they take into account risks or uncertainties that could develop. As a result, Ecopetrol assumes no responsibility in the event that future results are different from the projections on the conference call.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be led by Mr. Javier Guti&#xE9;rrez, CEO of Ecopetrol. Also participating will be Adriana Echeverri, CFO; H&#xE9;ctor Manosalva, Executive VP for Exploration and Production; Pedro Rosales Executive VP for Downstream; Enrique Vel&#xE1;squez VP for Exploration; Hector Casta&#xF1;o, VP for Production, and Alvaro Casta&#xF1;eda, VP of Transportation and Logistics.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call to Mr. Javier Guti&#xE9;rrez, CEO of Ecopetrol</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alejandro. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us on this conference call. First, I will summarize the highlights of the first quarter of 2011, which will be followed by comments from our VP on the operational and financial report. Finally, we will review the outlook of this year.</p>
          <p>Let's go to slide five to review the highlights of the first quarter. The company continued making progress in core strategies reaching a new record in production and achieving solid operating and financial results. The gross production of the corporate group rose 17%, reaching an average production of 686,000 barrels equivalent per day.</p>
          <p>From January 24, 11,500 barrels per day were added to Ecopetrol's group, equivalent to the 51% of Equi&#xF3;n's production, the new company that owns all the assets previously held by BP Colombia subsidiary. Those assets were acquired by Ecopetrol and Talisman in 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding transportation, we increased our evacuation capacity in crude and products by 22% and 27% respectively due to the completion of several infrastructure projects.</p>
          <p>The excellent operating results and favorable price environment resulted in higher net income, greater margin and EBITDA. The net income amounted to COL$3.4 trillion, 62% increase compared to the first quarter of 2010. EBITDA was COL$6.5 trillion equivalent to an EBITDA margin of 52%.</p>
          <p>In slide six, we have summarized the execution of our investment plan. The investment in the first quarter amounted to $1.9 billion, 134% more than in the same quarter of 2010, driven by higher investment in exploration and production, acquisition and new business.</p>
          <p>33% of the investment was allocated to production projects, 23% to acquisition, 17% to subsidiaries, 13% to new business, 6% to transportation, 4% to refining and petrochemicals, 3% to exploration and the remaining 1% was allocated to corporate initiative and the supply and marketing segment.</p>
          <p>The investment in acquisitions and new businesses amounted to $671 million and includes the earn-out as agreed on Hocol and all IP purchases, the last payment for Equi&#xF3;n derived of the Ca&#xF1;o Lim&#xF3;n-Cove&#xF1;as pipeline and the increase of stake in Ca&#xF1;o Sur block, among others.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn the call to H&#xE9;ctor Manosalva who will comment on upstream results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez. Good afternoon. In slide seven, we have summarized <mark type="ph" /> the highest (0:05:40) points of our upstream activities. During the first quarter of 2011, Ecopetrol drilled four exploratory wells, A3, in Colombia. All of them operated by Ecopetrol, on three stratigraphic wells. The presence of hydrocarbon <mark type="ph" /> was spotted (0:06:02) in the exploratory wells, Tinkhana-1 and Nunda-1 as well as in the stratigraphic well, Jaspe 3.</p>
          <p>Our affiliate, Savia Peru, confirmed evidence of hydrocarbon in the well ST1-2CD located in the Peruvian shallow waters. The well is being tested. In the first quarter of 2011, the corporate group achieved a record production of 685,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, rising 17% compared to the same quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>Ecopetrol accounted for 634,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day; Hocol, 41,300 barrels; Ecopetrol's stake in Savia, 7,300 barrels; Equi&#xF3;n, 11,500 barrels per day; and 2,000 barrels per day from Ecopetrol America.</p>
          <p>Ecopetrol's production growth was mainly driven by the rise in Castilla and Chichimene fields, which accounted for 106,000 barrels and 20,000 barrels per day respectively. In the associate side, Rubiales and Quifa wells contributed to Ecopetrol a gross output of 97,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn the call to &#xC1;lvaro Casta&#xF1;eda who will present the results in transportation segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, H&#xE9;ctor Manosalva. Good afternoon, everyone. Let's move on to slide eight to review the main points in Transportation. Total volume of crude and products transported grew 12% to 1,200,000 barrels per day, of which 75% accounts for crude. The growth came mainly from crude to be exported and naphtha transported through the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:08:24).</p>
          <p>Crude transportation capacity rose 22% in the first quarter of 2010 and 2011, due mainly to the increased capacity at Ocensa from 400,000 to 560,000 barrels per day, ODC from 151,000 to 171,000 barrels per day, and Ayacucho-Cove&#xF1;as from 42,000 to 45,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Product transportation capacity grew 27%, mainly due to increase in Pozos Colorados-Gal&#xE1;n line and the use of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:09:16). Generally, capacity at the Port of Cove&#xF1;as increased to 770 million barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Cove&#xF1;as pipeline, we achieved <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:09:35). By the end of the quarter, as was highlighted, timing of new contract for the ground transportation of the pipe and the beginning of operation at <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:09:48) with a capacity of 30,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>We estimate the starting date for the phase one of the pipeline in the first quarter of 2012. As previously mentioned, Ecopetrol and Occidental de Colombia reached an agreement <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:10:10) control of the Ca&#xF1;o Lim&#xF3;n-Cove&#xF1;as oil pipeline. This operation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:10:18) capacity.</p>
          <p>One transport requirement for Ca&#xF1;o Lim&#xF3;n has been made, allowing for the transportation of the highest crude production from eastern plains.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn the presentation to Pedro Rosales who will comment on refining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, &#xC1;lvaro. Good afternoon, everyone. Let's go to slide nine. The operating result in the refineries increased by the higher margin of product, the reduction in low sulfur diesel imports due the hydro treatment plant output and the continuous effort to implement initiative to reduce costs and to improve processes.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> The feeds in the (0:11:15) Barrancabermeja refinery grew 5% in order to increase the production of low sulfur diesel from the hydro treatment plants. The gross margin in the Barrancabermeja refinery was $12.55 per barrel, a 93% growth compared to $6.51 per barrel in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>The modernization plan of the Barrancabermeja refinery progress &#x2013; achieved a progress of 98% in the front-end engineering design, which provides the master plan for industrial services, advanced 34% mainly in the civil works. The modernization plan of the Cartagena refinery reached a 24% progress at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide ten to review the main results in supply and marketing. The rise in the oil price increased our export basket price in 23% for crude, 29% for products and 33% for natural gas, all of them compared to the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Our sales volume grew 16% compared to the first quarter of 2010. Local sales accounted for 44% of total sales and export sales for 55.6%. Exported volume, excluding sales to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:13:16) increased 44% driven by the higher level of oil production. Natural gas export increased sharply due to the end of regulatory restrictions <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:13:34) domestic market supply during the dry season of 2010. The main markets of our exports were the US Gulf Coast, Far East and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>The export of products rose 22%, boosted by higher fuel oil volume and some trading operations developed to meet supply contracts signed in Central America.</p>
          <p>Local sales volume grew 8% mainly due to lower natural gas demand from thermal power plants in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the same quarter in 2010 when Colombia was facing the El Ni&#xF1;o phenomenon.</p>
          <p>I now turn the presentation to Adriana Echeverri who will comment on the financial results of the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pedro. Good afternoon, everyone. Let's move on to slide 12. As Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez mentioned before, we achieved important goals that were finally reflected in our solid results for the first quarter. Higher crude oil prices and exported volume led the growth of 42% to total sales when compared to the same quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>Export sales alone rose 58%. Total cost of sales, operating expenses, grew 27%. Cost of sales rose <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:15:15) 21% mainly due to the growth of 25% in variable costs as a result of a larger volume of production <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:15:25) and purchases of hydrocarbons at higher prices. The increasing production of <mark type="ph" /> implied or rising (0:15:33) hydrocarbon transportation services as well as an increase of amortization and depreciation expenses coming from investment in the upstream segment. Fixed costs rose up to 6% is explained mainly by higher depreciation and maintenance costs thanks to the rising levels of production.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased 88% compared to the first quarter of 2010. That's mainly because of the rising exploration and product expenses related to seismic survey, non-successful (sic) [unsuccessful] (0:16:06) activities and the investment in new exploratory assets.</p>
          <p>As a result of the aforementioned, operating income amounted to COL$5.4 trillion, which is 69% increase compared to the first quarter of 2010 reaching an operating margin of 44%.</p>
          <p>Moving to non-operating results, there was a net loss of COL$285 billion. This result was mainly due to the equity tax <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:16:42) attached to it that were recognized entirely in the first quarter of 2011 and the expenses of the retired people provisions and foreign exchange losses in dollar denominated treasury portfolio due to the peso appreciation. These large expenditures were partially offset by the income coming from subsidiaries accounting under the equity method.</p>
          <p>Finally, all these effects were combined to reach a net income of COL$3.4 trillion. EBITDA amounted to COL$6.5 trillion, which is 58% higher than in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide 13 where we present our financial results by segment.</p>
          <p>Exploration and production segment contributed COL$3.2 trillion to net income. That was led by the continued increase in the oil production and higher prices of export crude basket. EBITDA was COL$5.7 trillion.</p>
          <p>Refining and petrochemicals segment reported a net loss of COL$48 billion. EBITDA, though, was COP$315 billion. Operating results improved compared to the first quarter of 2010 due to a strength of margins and net import of low sulfur diesel. Non-operating results were affected also by the equity tax payments of COL$118 billion in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Transportation segment generated a net income of COL$110 million and an EBITDA of COL$308 billion coming primarily from incremental volume of crude oil and refined products to be transported.</p>
          <p>Finally, supply and marketing segment reported a net income of COL$107 billion and an EBITDA of COL$194 billion benefiting from the high exported volume and favorable negotiation prices on purchases of crude oil during the whole quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to slide 14 where we'll see an overview of the company's cash flow and balance sheet as of the end of March 2011. Speaking about the cash flow, the company continued having a strong cash generation. Initial balance for the year was COL$5.5 trillion. Operations generated additional cost for COL$11.1 trillion and from other sources we got COL$179 billion.</p>
          <p>The purchase funded operations were COL$5.9 trillion, organic CapEx was COL$1.6 trillion, pending payments from acquisitions were COL$669 billion and other expenses were COL$20 billion. The ending cash balance as of March 31st was COL$8.5 trillion.</p>
          <p>Turning to our balance sheet, it remains at a low level of indebtedness. Assets amounted to COP$73 trillion and liabilities to COL$34 trillion. Financial debt to EBITDA ratio for 12 months was 0.35 times and no additional debt was raised during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The liabilities includes the accrual of the dividend for a total amount of COP$5.9 trillion approved by our general shareholders' meeting celebrated last March and also are including a higher provision for taxes due to increasing net income in the first quarter and the recent elimination of the patent extension for fixed assets in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:20:47).</p>
          <p>Finally to remark in the financial area, in line with the recent upgrade of the Republic of Colombia's rating to BBB minus by Standard &amp; Poor's, S&amp;P also increased the company's corporate credit and debt rating to BBB minus from BB plus which is good for us with a stable outlook. This new investment grade adds two investment grade BAA2 rating that was granted by Moody's Investors Service to Ecopetrol since 2009.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to slide 15 for an overview of <mark type="ph" /> any (0:21:31) results of our corporate group. In general terms, the rest of the corporate group for the first quarter exceeded those in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Total sales for the group during the first quarter benefited from the better volumes and prices and are finally amounted to COP$14 trillion, 2.1% higher than the same quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Group's net income amounted to COP$3.1 trillion, which represented 63% increase to the respective same period last year. Group's EBITDA was COP$6.8 trillion and EBITDA margin reached an attractive 48%. This is 57% higher than the first quarter of 2010, showing the positive operational results of the companies of the group and the cash generation capacity.</p>
          <p>In the following slide, number 16, we have the main results of our subsidiaries. The main contributions that we can see in the line of sales before elimination came from Reficar with COP$1.1 trillion, Hocol with COP$892 billion and Equi&#xF3;n with COP$441 billion.</p>
          <p>On net income, the best results came from Equi&#xF3;n with COP$212 billion, followed by Hocol with COP$186 billion and Ocensa with COP$27 billion. Subsidiaries with the higher EBITDA were Hocol will be COP$337 billion, Equi&#xF3;n with $139 billion and Ocensa with COP$97 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn again the presentation to Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's move over to slide 18 to review the outlook for the following quarter of 2011. The goal announced by Ecopetrol for 2011 remains. In exploration, we expect to drill 37 exploratory wells. Average growth production for 2011 should reach 750,000 barrels per day, mainly driven by the growth in our fields Castilla, Rubiales, Chichimene <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:24:06).</p>
          <p>In transportation, we will make progress in the crude evacuation program. And together with our partners, we complete the first stage of the Bicentennial Pipeline by December 2011 and will increase the Oleoducto <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:24:30) capacity between Rubiales and Porvenir by 200,000 barrels per day, among other relevant projects.</p>
          <p>We will present for approval the modernization project of Barrancabermeja refinery and will complete the Technical and Certification of the first mechanical development program.</p>
          <p>We will actively search for a higher share of our crude in new markets and will start the building of the ethanol plant by Bioenergy. The greater cash generator in this year above our initial estimation will reduce our plant funding needs.</p>
          <p>Our subsidiary, we keep investing in several projects such as the modernization and expansion of the Cartagena refinery, higher crude production and increased transport capacity.</p>
          <p>We continue to be fully committed with achieving our medium and long-term goals as set in our corporate vision.</p>
          <p>Now we'll turn to the questions from our participants. Thank you so much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I have two questions. First question relates to production growth. This quarter's growth was around 17%, which is lower than the 21% production growth guidance for the year. So if you could comment on what are the plans to catch up and reach the 21%?</p>
          <p>And then the second point would be, if you could give us a bit of an update on the additional shares to be issued to the market, if you have any news on that? And on the approval for the additional 10% in the Colombian Congress, how is it going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Paula. Okay, in relation to the production growth, people from exploration and production are going to comment that &#x2013; let me &#x2013; a short comment in relation with that, it's mainly related to the bottleneck, the transport restrictions that we still maintain during first quarter of this year due basically to the delay in the operation of the Ocensa pipeline. That was originally scheduled to be ready on December 2000 &#x2013; first day 2011. And finally, they were in operation on March 8th. That's why we were obstructed in terms of our plans, but it represents approximately around 40,000 barrels per day during the first three months of the year. But right now, we are developing a set up &#x2013; excuse me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But now we are developing some additional plans &#x2013; planning to be in the original figure. Maybe H&#xE9;ctor or Enrique could comment about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically that Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez said is everything right. The main issue was the lack of evacuation of the crude due to some delay on the pipeline construction. But as he mentioned, on March the 8th, we complete that task. We were ready to start fighting for the goal. So we are in a good shape in order to fulfill our promise to get our 22% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:29:08).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In relation with the additional 10%, okay, it is important to comment that maybe &#x2013; as you know, right now, we have in place the possibility to go to the market with the capitalization process. It is the original process that was approved by the Colombian Congress in 2006, of which we went to the market in 2007. It is 10.1%. That is right now in the stock market in Colombia <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:29:52) Toronto and Peru basically. And as we mentioned <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:29:57) we're continuing the process to analyze which is a proper moment to go to the market. But right now, the government is with a possibility to obtain the approval for an additional 10%. But it's a process of &#x2013; it's a process of selling shares of the secondary market basically. But now the projects haven't been approved by the Congress and continue in the discussion process in the Congress of Colombia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the one 10% is completely disconnected from the second 10%, so you won't have to &#x2013; you do not intend to expect for any approval to go ahead with the first tranche, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have all the approvals ready. Basically, what is the only approval that we need is the final decision of the Board of Directors to go to the market logically. We need the approvals of the securities in Colombia, but it's a normal approval, but we don't need any approval of the Colombia Congress or any other authority to go to the market. We have all the approvals and it's a capitalization process and the other process is the secondary selling in the market that are a completely different process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, good afternoon, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. Point number one, I wanted to understand a little bit more about your production profile. If I look into your reserve figure, 1.7 billion barrels, about 80% is crude. How should I think about peak production? From what I understand from most of the fields I am aware of the increase in recoverable factor, they usually extend the life time of the reserves, meaning that it won't necessarily imply to an increase in production, rather sustainability when it reaches a plateau, and that indicates up at Ecopetrol it should be the same thing. So think about the original reserve base, 1.7 billion barrels, that you guys currently have, how should I think about production growth? What will be the peak production and whether that would be constrained by execution, in other words wells drilled, or something related to the behavior of the reservoir? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second thing I wanted to ask is about this decoupling between the WTI and the Brent. Given you guys are in the Pacific side, a significant part of your access goes to the US, whether you are going to &#x2013; whether you have been able to decouple yourself from the WTI and sort of track more closely to the Brent or something related to that? That's the second question.</p>
          <p>And the third one, if I may, in terms of the capital increase, the primary...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. In terms of what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the capital increase, the primary capital increase, the one that doesn't require Congress approval that depends on yourself. If I look in terms of your cash needs, as far as I understand, your budget is based on a $65 per barrel and prices currently hover over $100 a barrel. Production have beaten original estimates, so you are generating far more cash than you thought initially. So the question comes in terms of what is the actual cash need of the company in Colombian peso, and I understand there is a mismatch, but in term of Colombian pesos, and if that the original size of the capital increase could be significantly reduced on the back of this &#x2013; the beat in both oil prices and production growth? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Okay, we are going with the first one. In terms of the production profile, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your question, applying &#x2013; we expect to reach a peak of 1,800 bopd per day. And we plan to have this plateau until 2020. The idea is to increase gradually from 18% to 30% based on these recovery factors. Other things that you have to consider are the increase that will come from exploration as well as from acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Basically what &#x2013; we have been considering the &#x2013; our current analysis, we take into account the current results and the projects we are developing. Practically I am sure that result is to get our goal of 1 million barrels in 2015, of which, as Enrique mentioned, 800 corresponds &#x2013; 800,000 correspond to oil and 200,000 basically to that. That you also have to take into account that we have a goal to add reserve in average of 150 millions of barrels per day, an average we have been doing during the last period. And also you must consider the recent increase in the success in the exploratory work that we've been developing in Colombia, but also even overseas.</p>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just follow-up on this first question before we go into the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I understood correctly, you can get about 8,000 barrels a day with the current reserve and maintain the plateau through 2020 as you're going to be able to increase the recoverable factor from the current 18% to around 25% to 30%, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, really our goal in terms of the oil recovery factor, we've done more than 30% -- around 34%, 35%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you're going to be able to extend your plateau production, 800,000 barrels a day, far beyond 2020, right? Because...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct me if I'm wrong. You have an oil in place of 42 billion barrels, right?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Adriana Echeverri. We have been &#x2013; with respect to your second question, please remember that we do not have long-term contracts. It's therefore &#x2013; we've got some gas sales &#x2013; a majority of our sales are spot market, so that we realize the differential that is now wide open. It's between WTI and Brent. Our international trade then started to negotiate our product with reference to Brent, right? So that's how we really got a good opportunity to have the best in this last price value.</p>
          <p>So according to that, the last sale, in the last three months, are the majority of them tied to Brent in the case of crude oil. In the case of fuel oil, which we're continuing to negotiate with the US <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:39:09) and the New York different indices. So in terms of crude oil, crude oil that remember we're right at 58% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:39:27). Very much of that is explained in that opportunity that we were able to take in the fourth market due to the differential between WTI and Brent, and nominating the exports to Brent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in term of the cash needs &#x2013; the last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of our needs, the way we work is that every year, we establish our budget where we include of course our capital &#x2013; our CapEx and all the budget for expansion and all that.</p>
          <p>We make a budget with some price and $1 above that price of the oil &#x2013; that the crude oil is situated <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:40:19) the year is less financing that is our need. This year, we &#x2013; last year, when we elaborated the budget, we established for this year, maybe to go to the market for the capitalization process in order to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:40:35) something that we could need raising money from the local market for capital needs.</p>
          <p>However, since oil prices have increased so much, of course, our capital &#x2013; our financing needs are zero. We have currently powered not only the expenses, but also the capital &#x2013; the capital needs.</p>
          <p>So I think the point there that sometimes we have some opportunities like the ones that we have taken in the last few years in acquisitions and some other transactions that are not in the budget, then we have to keep some excess cash, so then we can take some advantage from the market and have the cash to contribute when we need.</p>
          <p>All that is not currently covered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. So if we have, of course, cash needs for the operations and CapEx, we have no need for financing currently. But if you think, having the opportunity in order to be able to take it, we have to be ready with additional financing alternative, so that we can cover the liquidity needs and also take the opportunity of a merger. That is internal...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, that's very clear. Thank you very much. If I could just follow-up on this last part, so we are talking about potential acquisitions opportunities in Colombia; and if so, are we talking about E&amp;P or refinery or it's still an open ended discussion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>No, we don't have any budget in the &#x2013; right now, a possibility, but Adriana mentioned, you don't know &#x2013; we can't detect in the future in the market as it has been during the last year, but right now we are not considering any acquisition.</p>

          <p>Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One, environmental approvals for exploration, and I apologize I got cut off for a few minutes. So for some reason, this was asked already, I really apologize. But I was just wondering what you are finding in terms of delays right now. I know some companies have been having delays getting approvals for all of the exploration drilling that they want to do. Maybe you could comment on that and what your expectations are going forward?</p>
          <p>Second, just in terms of exploration results, you seem to have had some successful wells in the quarter. Just wondered you could comment on any areas that you might have had unsuccessful wells.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, you still &#x2013; it seems you would have substantial growth opportunities as you go through the rest of this year. From where you ended in the specific fields where you were producing at the end of the first quarter, where is the big growth going to come from between now and year-end?</p>

Frank, regarding your first question, environmental license, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:44:38) Ecopetrol or the whole industry is facing a lot of troubles with &#x2013; in order to get environmental license. And it's basically because of lack of people in the Ministry of Environmental. So we are working very hard with them. It's a teamwork in order to get done some permits. But yes, we have some delay &#x2013; we have delay regarding to start some operation, okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

Also, we recently announced a discovery in the upper Mag valley. The name is Nunda <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:46:17). So also we need to drill <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:46:21) well in order to define exactly this discovery.</p>
          <p>We plan also &#x2013; we mentioned in the beginning of the conference call, our plan is to drill at least 30 wells &#x2013; 37 wells, seven in international and 30 in Colombia <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:46:44) as well as A3 and A1 and we have different chance of success for those well.

          <p>Second question, what was the amount you paid to Shell for the 50% additional stake in Ca&#xF1;o Sur block and how much did you pay to Occidental for the Ca&#xF1;o Lim&#xF3;n-Cove&#xF1;as pipeline?</p>
          <p>Third would be, what happened to the Akacias-1 well in the CPO-9 block in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:48:49) and why haven't you started the delineation campaign there?</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you, Juan. In relation with the first point about the negotiation with Venezuela, it is important to mention that the Colombian government and Venezuelan government <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:49:24) &#x2013; it's a complete program of &#x2013; the strengthening the relations in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:49:33) sector considering oil, gas, electric, energy and so on, different purposes. We have a Round A table of negotiation in place. Basically some of the most important advances may be in the supply of gasoline for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:49:55), for example. And in terms of the possibility of developing some production or exploration activity, basically, we are in terms of only of the negotiation of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:50:10) relation with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:50:12). But really, we &#x2013; up to now &#x2013; we haven't got properly agreement in terms of doing any kind of investment in Venezuela. We also have been working in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:50:23) strengthening of the relation between Colombia and Venezuela, but it is important to mention that really we don't have a currently <mark type="ph" /> accurate way (0:50:35) to develop any field in Venezuela. But for example, in our case, it's very important to mention that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:50:41) the contract for the selling of gas. Right now, we're competing selling gas to PDVSA, in Colombia here on Ecopetrol, in an average of around 220,000 cubic million per day basically. This is in relation with the Venezuela negotiations, okay.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the prices of the transactions, I believe that's confidential.</p>

          <p>Akacias. This is Enrique Vel&#xE1;squez. Juan, your question was, we have not completed delineation work so far. Basically, because we are waiting for the environmental license from the ministry and we expect to get it by &#x2013; hopefully by the end of August. So we plan to drill at least two wells between August and September in order to have a fair idea about the delineation, okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And your last question regarding the activities in Gulf of Mexico, recently, as you are aware, the authorities in the Gulf of Mexico issued some permissions to &#x2013; for drilling <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:52:15). We've got two license, one for Logan and one for Cobra. The plan &#x2013; we expect to spot the well, the first one in Logan, hopefully by the end of May and hopefully the Cobra one where we expect it maybe by the end of July, okay?</p>
