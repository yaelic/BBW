        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony.</p>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another great quarter. We achieved record revenues of over $4.2 billion, up 20%; record Q3 non-GAAP net income of $649 million, up 35%; non-GAAP EPS of $0.30, up 30%; record year-to-date free cash flow of $2.2 billion, up 22%; and non-GAAP operating margin of 21.5%, up 80 basis points sequentially.</p>
          <p>We continue to execute on our triple play. With strong double-digit growth in storage security and virtualization, it's clear we continue to gain share in these key areas of the market, areas where we're already the market leader. With the announcements of VMware View 4.5, storage efficiency technologies like FAST v2 and FAST Cache and the acquisition of Greenplum, it's clear we're investing for the future, and more importantly these investments are bearing fruit.</p>
          <p>And with non-GAAP gross and operating margins up 40 and 80 basis points, respectively, quarter on quarter, we continue to improve profitability. We expect to continue this triple play over the long-term because of how well we positioned ourselves to capitalize on the fundamental shift to cloud computing.</p>
          <p>Now, let me start by taking a few minutes to discuss what's driving our good results. The industry generally agrees the shift to cloud architecture is no longer a question of if but of when. The answer is it's happening now, albeit at different speeds for different companies. But all companies go through the same three phases to transform their traditional physical infrastructures to true cloud architectures and to take full advantage of the ability to offer IT as a service.</p>
          <p>Phase one is the virtualization of IT-owned applications, which also requires simple, efficient VM integrated storage. Phase two is the virtualization of business critical applications. This is where SLAs around performance availability, workload availability, recoverability and security really matter. Phase three realizes the full benefit of cloud by taking advantages of phases one and two, together with IT automation, provisioning and chargeback to offer IT infrastructure as a service for the entire enterprise. It's at this phase that you have an elastic cloud of compute networking storage resources and are also seamlessly drawing on compatible cloud services where it makes sense.</p>
          <p>So let's look at what EMC offers for each one of these phases. The first phase typically tends to involve small deployments. Typically it involves the IT department's virtualizing applications they own and manage. For these implementations, which require virtualization and simple and efficient storage, EMC has VMware's VSphere, our unified storage products. With the majority of customers currently in this first phase, our unified storage product line has grown rapidly, and others are benefiting from this trend in the mid-tier as well.</p>
          <p>Where we're really distinguishing ourselves in this phase is with efficiency technologies like SSDs, FAST and FAST Cache, as well as with tight integration with VMware. For example, one well-known online brokerage firm in the quarter selected EMC's unified product in large part because of FAST Cache. Its ability to accelerate performance to address unexpected workload spikes could not be matched by either of the other two vendors competing for this deal.</p>
          <p>In the second phase, where virtualization extends to business critical applications, SLAs become very important. In fact, customers are telling us they want better SLAs after they virtualize. Also if customers selected to deploy business critical applications on enterprise storage for high SLAs in the physical world, they're not going to deploy them on mid-tier as they virtualize. In the second phase, customers look to technologies from VMware like vCenter AppSpeed and vSphere Storage and Network IO Control to help control performance SLAs at the application, storage and network levels. Likewise, they demand that their storage infrastructure extend these capabilities and support these SLAs.</p>
          <p>For example, EMC's FAST works with storage IO control to deliver industry leading distributed resource scheduling for storage, make the enterprise apps perform two and a half times better for the same cost. Customers also look to things like VMAX, VPLEX, Deduplication and Security to meet these SLAs deeper in the infrastructure.</p>
          <p>In phase one, a ray-based snap and replicate is suitable for backup, but in phase two tight integration of high performance backup like EMC's Avamar with vStorage APIs and with V sensor provides much higher service levels. For example, in Q3 a large manufacturing customer who wanted to reduce space and power consumption in a data center, and at the same time virtualize their service and desktops selected VMAX. We won another deal at a well-known global cosmetics company. In this case the customer is expanding its VMware implementation and will use active-active VM teleportation with VPLEX to raise availability and federate across data centers at distance.</p>
          <p>These are great examples of the sophisticated enterprise class technology required in this phase, and in these cases it happened to be technology our competitors could not match. In fact, in phase two implementations, larger competitors tend not to have all the necessary best of breed technology, and our mid-tier competitors don't have the portfolio to really provide a full solution.</p>
          <p>Phase three is when you really get to IT as a service. This involves things like integrated stacks, management up and down from physical to virtual and usage monitoring, all of which EMC offers. Our VCE coalition enables hybrid clouds with Vblocks. Our UIM, Unified Infrastructure Manager, offers cross-domain provisioning, change and configuration managements. vCloud Director offers self provisioning of virtual machines in a multi-tent environment, and VPLEX facilitates seamless data mobility between private clouds and external providers.</p>
          <p>Illustrating this, a very large pharmaceutical company this quarter decided it was taking them too long to provision their virtual machines and turned to EMC. Now as they implement their VMware road map they're moving forward with Vblock with VMAX, UIM and will use VPLEX for an active-active data center architecture. What these examples demonstrate is that there does not tend to be any one typical cloud deal. Companies' infrastructure requirements are as varied as the companies themselves. This why it's so important to have a broad and deep range of products and services, and as each company develops its cloud infrastructure road map EMC can meet their needs through every phase, from the departmental to enterprise wide from tier 0 to the back of an archive.</p>
          <p>Now, a common question in the investor community is whose storage works best in virtualized environments? We think the best way to find out is to go ask customers which vendors they trust. As you can see from the results of these surveys, which come from separate sources, EMC consistently rises to the top when it comes to providing infrastructure for virtualized environments.</p>
          <p>Now there is one smaller competitor claiming to have a lead in virtualized environments, but the facts simply don't bear it out. Rather note it tends to be the bigger, more established companies with broader offerings that come in behind EMC. Customers realize that the journey to a cloud infrastructure can be complex, requiring a broad range of services. As a result, they go with companies like EMC that can provide more.</p>
          <p>Public cloud providers are also building the infrastructure on EMC for a number of reasons. With virtualization being the foundation for public cloud service, VMware is key. With the vast amounts of data being stored and managed by public cloud providers, scalability is critical. For example, VMAX's x86-based scale architecture offers this at petabyte scale.</p>
          <p>With multitendencies, security is critical, and the ability to attest to that security is just as important, particularly for a public cloud provider. RSA Cloud Security solution offers this accountability. And enterprise customers need data mobility for true seamless hybrid cloud, and VPLEX enables the advanced federation of resources into and out of the enterprise.</p>
          <p>This quarter we announced that several service providers are taking advantage of these technologies for offering public cloud services to their clients, and this number continues to ramp. Joe will give you more color on some of these wins in his comments. The various examples I referenced are just a few of the deals we closed in Q3 with customers looking to start or continue to build out their cloud infrastructures, both private and public. Our Q3 cloud wins span verticals including government, healthcare, media, manufacturing, energy, services and academia, and all of our product line, across VMware, Security and Storage including high-end and mid-tier block and file.</p>
          <p>Now that I've given you a sense of what's behind our strong results, let's look at the numbers in more detail. Revenue in the quarter grew 20% to $4.2 billion in Q3. The increasing value customers received from our products and services is driving improvements to our business, with non-GAAP gross margin of 60.5%, up 40 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven primarily by higher storage product margins, thanks to the faster growth of our higher-margin storage products.</p>
          <p>Ongoing operating improvements helped drive non-GAAP operating margins of 21.5%, up 80 basis points sequentially and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30, up from $0.28 last quarter and from $0.23 a year ago. Free cash flow is strong, and year-to-date was $2.2 billion, up 22%, and $427 million greater than our non-GAAP net income for the same period.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion in cash. Of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S. with the remainder overseas. We spent $500 million on acquisitions in the quarter and $283 million buying back 15 million shares of EMC stock, bringing us to $800 million on EMC share repurchases so far this year. We still expect to spend $1 billion on EMC stock by the end of the year. In addition, EMC spent $92 million buying VMware shares, and VMware spent 131 million on VMware shares. Looking at VMware's pivotal role as the cloud data center operating system of the future, we feel strongly that these relatively small purchases to maintain our ownership level are an excellent long-term investment.</p>
          <p>Now looking at our geographies. We saw balanced double-digit growth around the world with strongest growth in our BRIC plus 13 emerging markets. Joe will provide some more color here. The negative impact of currency on our year-on-year revenue growth in Q3 was 60 basis points. Assuming rates stay at September 30 levels, there should be no impact in currency on our full year revenue results. Now, turning to a few details about our various products and services.</p>
          <p>Overall storage related revenues grew 16% with or without acquisition effects. We believe that we continue to gain share in key segments of the storage markets. We are the number one storage due in large part to our technology leadership, and this is what continues to define us today. We are the leader in the most important technologies in information infrastructure. For example, we were the first to introduce SSDs in enterprise storage and the automated tiering software to leverage it. The ability to marry solid-state and spinning drives leads to enormous performance in efficiency improvements. We unveiled this destructive technology almost three years ago, and we're clearly benefiting from our leadership here in both high-end and mid-tier storage systems.</p>
          <p>This past quarter we continued to reap the benefits of our innovation as our Symmetrix product revenues were up a robust 23%. The VMAX infrastructure leverages standard x86 processing, it's highly scalable in terms of both performance and capacity and includes advanced high value functionality like virtual provisioning and FAST. It is these capabilities, which are driving our gains, not only in the traditional high-end deployments but also in large consolidation plays, private cloud infrastructures and increasingly public cloud environments.</p>
          <p>I think that the success and brand tradition of Symmetrix leads many to think just in terms of traditional high-end storage, and of course, we continue to set the pace there. However, I would encourage you to think more broadly regarding how this new architecture has been designed to be ideally suited for the new information requirements of virtual infrastructures in cloud environments. It's this combination of our existing leadership position and the rapid penetration of these new cloud-focused environments that's driving our strong results.</p>
          <p>A great example of this success is a Q3 win at a major global healthcare company. In this deal, VMAX's virtual provisioning and FAST with the ability to tier to scatter drives were key features as these enabled the customers to increase utilization, simplify their environment and reduce CapEx and OpEx. In this case, where the customer was deploying VMware, our competitor required three times the amount of hardware to perform equivalently to two VMAX engines. This is a clear example of how VMAX is winning in large VMware consolidations. In this case the customer wanted a storage system that could support 2,500 virtual machines and growing to 6,000.</p>
          <p>In fact, VMAX has proven itself to be so cost effective and flexible that in many instances customers have consolidated multiple mid-tier storage platforms onto one VMAX. This is happening with both EMC and competitive mid0tier storage platforms. As a couple of proof points, we swept the floor of a mid-tier competitor's products with the VMAX at the global healthcare customer I just mentioned and also in another win of one of the world's leading media and entertainment companies. As customers are moving towards the cloud, EMC is best able to help them along every step of the journey, and these are just two more examples.</p>
          <p>Our mid-tier storage business continued to show good growth again in Q3, increasing 22% year on year. The software capabilities we announced last quarter for our CLARiiON and Celerra platforms, Unisphere, FAST v2, FAST Cache and block compression for primary storage are being embraced by customers. Percentage of systems shipping with SSDs in the mid-tier continues to increase, helped in part by the availability of FAST v2 and FAST Cache. These features were definitely a factor in several of the deals we won this quarter, including where we beat out a mid-tier competitor in a well-known west coast university.</p>
          <p>In addition we won a project to remove an incumbent's mid-tier products, and we also beat two other vendors at a well-known U.S.-based retailer based upon the strength of our VMware integration and significantly better capacity utilization. Another key benefit of the breadth and depth of EMC's business is that we have a leadership position in some of the hottest areas of technology today.</p>
          <p>These technologies and products act as wonderful door openers for EMC. This was the case in a recent government project where we leveraged Data Domain's relationship to highlight the CLARiiON capabilities in our VMware environments. CLARiiON integration with VMware was a deciding factor in the purchase of several CLARiiON systems as initial footprints in a deployment that will eventually scale to several petabytes. That's in addition to the large Data Domain purchases happening this quarter. This is just one great example of the synergy and success of our model.</p>
          <p>Our backup recovery systems business continues to grow at a high pace. We expect BRS's extraordinary growth opportunities to play out for a long time. This will clearly lead to more success for BRS as the clear leader in the space, but it will also drive additional opportunities for EMC to help customers in other ways.</p>
          <p>As we announced, we've added a new division and a whole new set of opportunities to our portfolio. Greenplum, which we announced in July, is the foundation of our new Data Computing Products division. Its first new products, the EMC Greenplum Data Computing Appliance offers the industry's best price-performance ratio, three times more scalability and up to four times as many database calls and competitive systems and data input speeds up to five times that of our competitors. Our DCA integrates database, compute and storage into an enterprise class, easy-to- implement system that can meet petabyte scale big data requirements. We are very excited to pursue this incremental market opportunity by offering yet another leading edge solution to customers as they increasingly seek the best analytic tools to derive business values from their massive volumes of data.</p>
          <p>Our RSA Security revenue growth accelerated in Q3 to 22% year on year. Our GRC and SIEM products did well, as customers need a way to manage their multitude of discrete security devices. The combination of these capabilities enables customers to have an easy-to-use governance layer that can oversee and manage other security products throughout their environments. As security and compliance become increasingly important to all customers and as more infrastructures move towards the cloud, this unique governance and management layer is a key differentiator and enabler in the marketplace. This was the reason we won an important security operation center's project at a very large financial services customer this quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was relatively flat against last year's Q3. The xCP platform continues to be very popular, and IIG won a number of significant new customers in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Clearly the rollouts of virtual infrastructures and the buildouts of private and public clouds drove the strong growth of VMware in the quarter, up 46%. The excitement around VMworld with over 17,000 attendees is a great example of the impact VMware has on the industry. At VMworld, we made a number of announcements, including vCloud Director, VMware View 4.5, vShield and vFabric.</p>
          <p>We also made a number of announcements around how other EMC products are being integrated with VMware, including Unified Infrastructure Manager 2.0, which when deployed with vCloud Director and Vblocks creates what's essentially a vCloud in a box. Other announcements include an EMC storage infrastructure with secure authentication which when combined with View 4.5 sets a storage efficiency record of $38 per client, the best in the market due to tight integration of all these various technologies. We also announced a strong RSA VMware cloud security and compliance solution, another industry first that will help ease the security concerns of customers as they move towards the cloud.</p>
          <p>Because virtualization is the foundation of cloud computing, a key to success with VMware is bringing the virtual infrastructure and the information infrastructure together. And while we encourage others to work with VMware, we work harder than anyone else to integrate the virtual and information infrastructures. With over 60 different integration points now between EMC and VMware, including support for all the VMware APIs, we lead in VMware integration.</p>
          <p>Recognizing the difference such tight integration makes in performance, a global medical technology company purchased both the CLARiiON and Celerra system in the quarter. It was the combination of the VM plug-ins, unified architectures and features like FAST and FAST Cache, all from one vendor, that drove this deal for us.</p>
          <p>Our result this quarter and for the last several are great indicators of the strength of our strategy and business model. The move to cloud is underway. All of IT is moving in this direction, and while customers are moving they're spending towards these new architectures at varying speeds, the tidal wave of change is definitely real.</p>
          <p>We are leading in the hottest areas of the move to the cloud, and we have the broadest portfolio across all the key customer requirements from virtualization to storage to security to information governance. And while we cannot control the economy or IT spending, we believe that we will certainly continue to grow and gain share due to our leadership position in this rapidly growing opportunity.</p>
          <p>So looking at the environments, the opportunity ahead, our unique competitive position and the strength of our strategy and model, we are once again raising our expectations for 2010. We now expect to achieve $16.9 billion in revenue, non-GAAP operating margins of 21 to 22% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.25. This reflects revenue growth of 20% and EPS growth of 39%, very robust growth and even better leverage.</p>
          <p>As you can see, strong growth with leverage in investments have been the standard for us since 2004, and with the results and outlook we're reporting today, it's clear we're continuing on this trajectory. But what's most exciting is the fundamental shift to cloud architectures is only in the early stages, and we believe we are better suited than anyone else to capitalize on this trend as it unfolds over the next several years. We fully expect that the triple play of share growth, investment for the future and financial leverage we're delivering this year can be maintained over the long-term.</p>
          <p>So in summary, our strategy's clear, the business and operating model are in place, our investments continue to pay off, and the cloud opportunity is very big. As a result, we expect to continue to deliver double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth for the next few years. I'll now turn the call over to Joe who will provide some more color on the quarter and what we see through the end of the year. Joe?</p>

          <p>Thanks, David, and a warm welcome to everyone attending today's conference call.</p>
          <p>As always, thank you for your interest in EMC. As Tony said, I am currently in Beijing and thus actively participating in today's earnings call from approximately 6,000 miles away from my colleagues, but I trust the marvels of communication technologies will make the mechanics of this call appear seamless.</p>
          <p>Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q3. In fact, our topline revenue was the best in EMC's history as we posted solid growth on both a year-on-year and sequential basis. I am also proud to report that we continue to create leverage in our P&amp;L while investing in the future. To this end, in Q3 we added approximately 1,700 professionals to consolidated EMC in the areas of sales, emerging high growth markets, R&amp;D and VMware. Our goal is to develop more innovative products and maintain strong growth.</p>
          <p>And most importantly we established EMC and VMware as clear thought leaders with substantial momentum in private, public and hybrid cloud computing. We firmly believe cloud computing, which enables IT as a service, is the next big transformational wave that is shaping the information technology landscape. Our success in Q3 would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the 47,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world. I want to thank them for their leadership and congratulate them on their accomplishments.</p>
          <p>I would now like to make a few comments on the global economy and more importantly our view on IT spending trends. On the economic front on a consolidated global basis, we continued to see a slow recovery, albeit with a few bumps in the road. Pretty much in line what we have been saying all year, and looking forward, we expect this trend to continue.</p>
          <p>Closer to home in IT spending terms, we are seeing real strength in rapid growing and emerging geographies; moderate growth in the U.S, Japan, most of Europe, albeit with a bit of chopiness in a few countries; and solid growth in countries such as Australia, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. Additionally across all markets the very good news is that the demand for virtualization, information storage, information protection and information security and governance, areas where EMC/VMware is the leader are growing considerably faster than the IT average. This is evidenced by the fact that in Q3 we grew on a year-on-year basis 21% in the U.S.; 28% in APJ, 22% in constant currency; 14% in Europe, 19% in constant currency; and approximately 30% in emerging markets. This balanced geographic growth demonstrates that we are focused on IT markets that are growing much faster than the IT market as a whole, and more importantly we are clearly taking share.</p>
          <p>Additionally what drove this demand is the ever continuing growth of information and the innovative uses of this information by our customers as they drive for higher and higher levels of productivity while meeting the mandate for risk mitigation and adherence to proper governance and compliance policies. What adds to our confidence in our future is the thought leadership, innovations and strong product road map we have in a new big wave of IT, cloud computing. It is our firm belief that cloud computing will transform enterprise IT shops as the customers migrate their IT data centers into private clouds. This transformation will also happen in the service provider community as they build out an expensive number of very large enterprise class public clouds.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the actualization of private and public cloud computing will provide our customers a massive benefit, mainly the ability to run applications more flexibly with a lot more automation at a significantly lower cost, while assuring that the attendant policies and service levels are adhered to.</p>
          <p>But even lower costs and more flexibility can be achieved as customers take advantage of both private and public cloud computing by federating or operating their various application loads between their own private clouds and the public clouds of their chosen service provider partners. We call this cloud implementation the hybrid cloud.</p>
          <p>I assure you the mast majority of our R&amp;D budgets, our acquisitions, our go-to-market motions and the buildout of our partner ecosystem is aimed at leading and winning in this game-changing hybrid cloud opportunity. The importance of having a world-class partner ecosystem cannot be overstated. I firmly believe no one IT company could possibly possess all the IT resources to go it alone. And very importantly, every single customer I speak with wants &#x2013; in fact, demands &#x2013; best of breed and choice.</p>
          <p>To this end, our partnership with Cisco is deepening and our VCE coalition is gaining significant momentum in the market. As proof, I am again pleased to report that our Vblock sales are well ahead of plan. Our partnerships with system integrators such as Accenture, CSC, Capgemini, Wipro, TCS, Deloitte and others continues to grow strategically and technically.</p>
          <p>And last, on the service provider front, we are building a number of very deep alliances with many of the leading telcos and service providers around the world. In Q3, we announced partnerships with the following companies: France Telecom's Orange Business Services, SingTel's Alphawest, Saudi Telecom, Cable and Wireless, and Terremark. And you can expect many more announcements over the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p>In summary, EMC is executing well in today's IT market. We have a great product and technology portfolio and the go-to-market prowess to capture the opportunity that the private, public and hybrid cloud computing wave offers. Thus, I reaffirm our belief that we can achieve double-digit growth rates over the long-term, and to help you better understand why we are so confident in our future, we will host an investor and analyst day in Q1.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate today's portion &#x2013; Q&amp;A portion of today's call.</p>

          <p>Yeah, thanks, guys, and congratulations on the good quarter. So my question is going to be around basically the cloud strategy as a whole. You guys lay out obviously a clear picture of where you're going from a strategic perspective. Can you help me understand where clustered NAS fits into your thought process around cloud or the market that you guys look to address going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Aaron. Basically, we have a very successful high-end NAS product with Celerra. There's a lot of developments that we are investing in there, development activity that we're investing in there, with products coming to market.</p>
          <p>Cluster NAS is really all about how do you handle the global name space. We have really solid plans in that area, and I feel comfortable with our road map. As always, I like to keep some surprises, so we don't &#x2013; I don't want to tell you exactly when we'll release new products, but I will say we have a very robust product line for 2011.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, guys. I'd like to echo the nice quarter. Looking at, I mean, it appears most of your business lines are fully optimized at this point. I guess I'd like to focus on the one that doesn't appear to be, the Information Intelligence Group, the old Documentum. I was wondering if we could get an update here, kind of what you see out there from this business unit and how strategic this is going forward, relative to kind of the focus on the hybrid cloud. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Brian, sure. A couple of things, first of all, when we think of the hybrid cloud, one of the big phenomena there is big data. And big data is going to come in a couple different forms. It's going to come in the structured form, and that's obviously where Greenplum and the DCA that we just announced are important, and it's also going to come in the unstructured form, again, which is why Documentum is still a very important part of the overall strategy.</p>
          <p>Now within the IIG business, there's a couple things happening underneath the surface. That business is transitioning from a large enterprise license type business to a smaller application dependent business, so we're moving from the traditional ELAs to the kind of smaller XTP application-oriented rollouts. So underneath the surface you're seeing that churn occur, and that's why you're seeing the topline relatively flat. But strategically it still has a great role in the cloud strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David's right, Brian, there's a lot of moving pieces, and we are in the transition through our xCP strategy which will make the Documentum platform a lot more lightweight, a lot more SaaS enabled, and as we get through that transition, we expect we'll see better growth.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A question for David, and first, here again, congrats on the numbers. With regards to the gross margin in your core EMC business, 55.5% this quarter, I can't even remember the last time you've got such high gross margins, and with some of your larger competitors making a lot of acquisitions and trying to accumulate a lot of assets after years of nonactivity in your area.</p>
          <p>How should we think about gross margins in your core business going into next year? And also, VMware provided some initial growth thoughts on 2011 last night. Would you care to do the same with regards to your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, no, we're not going into 2011 at this point in time, other than to reiterate my comments I said earlier that we are looking to execute our triple play over the long-term, and certainly next year, we'll be looking at double-digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings group, and those are the only cows, if you like, stakes I'm putting in the ground right now relative to 2011.</p>
          <p>Relative to gross margins, I mean yes, we have seen nice expansion in the non-VMware side of the business. As I mentioned during the quarter, what we're seeing is a mix shift towards our higher gross margin products. So we're doing very well with things like our NAS products, like our VMAX, like our Dedup products and some of our storage software, and that mix shift is helping the margins grow sequentially.</p>
          <p>I would point out to you gross margins, we equate that as an indicator of kind of value you're providing to the customer, and the more value you're providing to the customer, the better gross margins are going to be within the business. So that's what's happening beneath the service there.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. So a number of your large competitors have announced integrated appliances for the cloud. I wanted to understand what your views were on this competitive activity, and whether you believe that your Vblock strategy was an adequate response?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think Vblock strategy was a response. I think we started it. Kind of the first integration of taking the cloud OS VMware, the connectivity and network, the server and the storage and putting it together was pioneered by us. So I don't think we're reacting at all. I think others are reacting to us.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; us and Cisco, we're not giving out numbers yet, but what I've told you is true. Our &#x2013; we set what I thought was a pretty aggressive plan for Vblocks, and I'll repeat what I said. We are well above our plan that we set for ourselves, both last quarter and this quarter and for the year. So it's going well.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just a question on your &#x2013; 3PAR was acquired by HP amidst a bidding war. How do you guys think PAR being at HP changes the landscape in high-end storage, especially for VMAX, I guess, given HP's sales and services?</p>
          <p>And then secondly how do you think the EMC-Dell relationship goes further given their keen interest I think on other storage assets versus reselling CLARiiON?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that 3PAR changes the landscape at all. We've been &#x2013; 3PAR is 10 years old, we've been competing with it for quite a while.</p>
          <p>From HP, will they make 3PAR more successful? I'm sure they will, but I think what you're going to see there is in large substitution for their high-end EVAs and for business that they previously funneled to Hitachi. So I really don't see that changing the landscape as all.</p>
          <p>As far as the Dell relationship, obviously, we took a step back as Dell went after 3PAR. And obviously cooled things off. We are again in discussions to see if we can do something more meaningful and lasting. Both companies would like to do that, but the key is it's got to be meaningful, and it's got to be lasting for me to tell you that it's back on track.</p>
          <p>So I can't tell you that yet, but I can tell you we are in serious discussions, and there is intent on both parties to do that. But obviously 3PAR moved from Dell was a setback to the relationship.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Need a quick clarification first. Storage grew 16%, you said Symm up 23, mid-tier up 22%, so what within storage was below 16%?</p>
          <p>And then the question is really if you could talk about the low-end products, you guys have talked about bringing that out in Q1, what would be kind of the margin and revenue ramp profile of this? I would imagine these things would certainly have higher software integration to them?</p>
          <p>And related to that if you could update us on how you're doing with channel push there, how many partners you've been able to add and what kind of metrics we could talk about? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Bill, I'll start that. I'm going to pass it over to Joe for the second part.</p>
          <p>So in terms of storage, you're right. The total storage business was up 16% &#x2013; Symm 23, mid-tier 22.</p>
          <p>Remember that in the storage business, well, first of all, those numbers I gave you for Symm and mid-tier are product only numbers. In the storage business, there's also products and services, maintenance and professional services, and also there are a number of other products in there, including some of the third party products that we sell through like the Connectrix switches and our Select line. So that's the difference between the 16 and the 23 and the 22.</p>
          <p>And for updates on mid-tier, I'm going to pass that over to Joe.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

We'll announce that in early Q1. It is on track. It is in beta now. It is doing very well, and again I'm very excited so stay tuned. We'll announce that in Q1.</p>
          <p>It is the fastest growing market in storage, and again we're excited to be &#x2013; very excited about the prospects of entering that market in a big way. In a big, big way.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, good morning. I wondered if you could give us an update on the backup recovery business, in terms of revenue run rate? Previously you commented <mark type="inaudible" /> $1 billion, see if there's an update there. Maybe also talk about the cross-selling opportunities in the heritage Data Domain accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I got the first part of the question in terms of the run rate. Can you repeat the second part, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the other piece was if you could just talk about the cross-selling opportunities within the Data Domain accounts in terms of heritage Data Domain? What kind of pull through are you seeing there for <mark type="inaudible" /> products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, got it. Mark, so on the run rate, we mentioned that in the third quarter, Data Domain and Avamar lines combined had reached the $1 billion run rate, which was ahead of plan. We said we'd get to that level in 2010. We got there in Q1.</p>
          <p>And that's continued to increase sequentially into Q2 and then again into Q3. So we're not going to go break that out again, once we got beyond our $1 billion run rate. But we are continuing to see sequential growth, and obviously the run rate's now higher.</p>
          <p>In terms of cross-selling, some nice opportunities. I mentioned, for example, in my prepared comments where we'd cross sold into a Data Domain account a large CLARiiON project that's going to scale up to petabyte type scale, and of course there's good BRS opportunities into the EMC accounts.</p>
          <p>So the good news is that when we look at BRS, A, it's opening new doors for us, and B, we're also able to increase our footprint inside of the EMC account. So it's working both ways. It's certainly a win-win from that point of view.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. My question is on the implied sequential growth guidance for the topline for the core business for the information infrastructure. It's around 14%, if my math is right. That seems slightly stronger than seasonal, so given your comments on the economy being sort of in a slow recovery, I was wondering if you could add any color on why you think that's going to be as strong as the implied guidance suggests?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Jason, are you talking Q3 to Q4 sequential growth? Seasonality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The five-year average is something like 13%, and this implies around 14%, so it seems like a little bit better than the kind of historical.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe, Jason is talking excluding VMware, just to clarify his comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's close, Jason. I mean basically what we're doing is like we do all the time. We get bottoms of forecasts. We could put a little bit of management wisdom hopefully on those forecasts, and we've been pretty accurate through the year, and this is where we're coming up and so we're telling it to you as we see it.</p>
          <p>So we don't see the market slowing down. We think there's good opportunity out there for IT and especially in the areas we are &#x2013; virtualization, storage, information protection, information security. Those areas are hot, and I suspect they will remain hot for the foreseeable future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, in terms of the three phases to get to true cloud, can you just talk about what inning we're in in phase one rollouts? And as we move from phase one to two, do you think we get a pause because of either a hesitancy to move to mission critical apps or maybe because we have to digest before we start consuming again, or do you think this is a seamless transition between the two phases? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's pretty seamless. Customers are seeing phenomenal reliability. The VMware OS continues to get the highest marks in the industry for stability and high quality in their platform. And of course, with the advent of Nehalem servers, would give you that six to eight cores and tremendous power.</p>
          <p>Customers are seeing the reliability, the capability, and they are definitely, definitely moving to phase two without a pause. And I think phase two will be very successful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jason (sic) [Maynard], just to pick up on that comment, as I mentioned, the requirements and the benefits that customers change from the phases. Phase one is really about consolidation cost reduction. Phase two, customers are looking for costs, they're actually looking to increase their SLAs as they virtualize, which requires a whole set of technology to drive the optimization around those SLAs.</p>
          <p>So it really changes the game very much from a VMware point of view, but also from a storage point of view. The requirements in phase two are very, very different, and that's why I gave you some examples in my script because the ability to seamlessly reach phases one and phases two really sets us apart.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I want to focus a little bit more on the fourth quarter guidance. I mean, clearly you guide up versus Street expectations for the fourth quarter end earnings. I just was wondering, Joe, you said you did a bottoms up forecast, but what is going better than expected and included in that guidance? Is Symmetrix number look pretty strong vis-&#xE0;-vis expectations, maybe, what are we missing potentially that had you raise guidance that's better than expected? It seems like a pretty strong outlook Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly on the storage side the stars of the show would be, VMAX and our BRS, Data Domain and Avamar products. And the other star of the show is our NAS business, our Celerra NAS business is also growing tremendously faster than our major competitor. So those would be the stars of the show. Obviously, information security is incredibly important, and you see the growth in our RSA divisions business. So those are going great, and our &#x2013; our new entry into Greenplum is showing a lot of progress and a good pipeline. That's not going to be a major impact, obviously because of its size, but still got great growth. So we have several areas that are &#x2013; I would call hot, and of course you mentioned you wanted the II side, but VMware continues to &#x2013; they raised their guidance also. So pretty good strength across major product lines, and then, of course, we've got some &#x2013; in Q1 we're going to enter a new phase with our low-end products so we're in pretty good shape going forward, in very good shape going forward.</p>

          <p>Congratulations on the quarter. One of the concerns during Q3 was if customers are waiting for the unified CLARiiON and Celerra anticipated next year. Can you comment on what you saw in the CLARiiON product line or what to expect there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, I didn't mention CLARiiON as a star. But it's holding its own. What we did do, which customers are loving, is as I said, as we did with our VMAX platform and before, we have released a lot of the key software on the older platforms ahead of the new announcements. So Unisphere, FAST Cache, FAST v2, new compression technology are being very well received by customers, and that's having an effect. Obviously CLARiiON is also affected by Dell moving on to EqualLogic. So CLARiiON had a lot to overcome. Our new whole mid-tier strategy, we think, is back on track and we're looking forward to the future. So I think it'll continue to not be a star in Q4, but it will prod along and do okay.</p>

          <p>Lou Miscioscia of Collins Stewart. Sir, you may ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess I was going to ask about Europe, as to why it was, I guess growing less than some of the other geographies. But also, since you mentioned it, that your competitor in the NAS area that you're growing faster than them. I think in their hardware area last quarter, they grew 50% year-over-year last quarter, maybe you could give us some comparable numbers to also take a look at your numbers within the mid-tier area for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, think of it like this &#x2013; I'm not going to give you new numbers, but I understand their growth rate. And I said that our &#x2013; if you looked at our Celerra alone, it grew faster and I say that again. So obviously our Celerra is aimed at &#x2013; Celerra NAS is aimed at the higher end. And that's a good space to be, and we're going to do a lot of expansion there as I answered to the first question. However, where they're growing extremely fast is an area we're not in, which is the low end, which I told you we started addressing in early Q1. So that's kind of the macro statement around that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then Lou, just to pick up on your question about Europe, as Joe mentioned in his comments, if you look at Europe in constant currency, you actually grew it 19%, so where we did have a currency headwind &#x2013; in my script it was about 60 basis points for the quarter, basically all the headwind was in Europe, and 19% current currency is pretty good growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. David, could you talk a little bit about cash flow and free cash flow? As you think about Q4 specifically, what are the objectives that you have? And you mentioned '11 double-digit revenue and earnings growth, how should we be thinking about free cash flow particularly since it &#x2013; on the consolidated basis it slowed down a little bit this quarter in terms of the growth rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Keith, a few comments on free cash flow. First of all, I think it's &#x2013; the one metric that's least helpful to look at on a quarter-by-quarter basis because of the ebbs and flows in timing, the working capital investments and even some CapEx buildups. So I comment that free cash flow for the year so far, it's up 22% year-to-date; it's over $400 million higher than our non-GAAP net income. Looking forward to Q4 and the year and looking forward to 2011, we continue to strive to have our free cash flow be higher than our non-GAAP net income.</p>

          <p>So again, thank you for joining us, we very much appreciate it. And in closing I want to reiterate that we are executing well. Our strategy for the private, public and hybrid cloud is solid and gaining traction. We have a product road map that is well aimed and, again, very exciting. And we have the go-to-market and alliance partners necessary to bring these innovative products to market. But most importantly we have 47,000 plus great people in EMC and VMware who believe in our vision and our future. Thanks for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you in the future, talking to you soon. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.</p>
