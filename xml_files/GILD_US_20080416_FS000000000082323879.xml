          <p>Good afternoon.  Welcome to Gilead's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call.  I am pleased you could join us today.  We issued a press release this afternoon providing results for the first quarter ended March 31st, 2008.  This press release is also available on our website at www.gilead.com</p>
          <p>Joining me on today's call to discuss our results are John Martin, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Milligan, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Young, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer and Matt Howe, Vice President of Finance.</p>
          <p>John Martin will take you through the corporate highlights for the quarter.  John Milligan will review the first quarter 2008 financial results, Norbert Bischofberger will discuss our research and development program and Kevin Young will summarize our commercial milestones and provide more color on the market dynamics surrounding our various franchises.  We will then allow time at the end of this call to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to John Martin for the corporate update, I would first like to remind you that we will be making statements relating to future events, expectations, trends, objectives and financial results that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Act of 1995.  These statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement.  I refer you to our Form 10-Q for the year ended December 31st, 2007, subsequent press releases, and other publicly filed SEC disclosure documents for a detailed description of the risk factors affecting our business.  In addition, please note that we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>We will also be making certain references to financial measures that are on a non-GAAP basis.  We provide a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers on our website.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John Martin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Susan.  Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.  We are pleased to summarize for you Gilead's accomplishments during the first quarter of 2007.  I will start by reviewing our corporate milestones for the quarter and our thoughts on some emerging data that may affect the HIV treatment landscape, and then turn the call over to John Milligan who will run through the financial results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>First, in February, our partner GlaxoSmithKline announced that ambrisentan with a trade name of Volibris in Europe has received a positive opinion from the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, for the treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in patients classified as World Health Organizational functional class II and III to improve exercise capacity.  GSK has stated that it expects approval by the European Commission in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p>Also we announced in March that we entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs &amp; Company to repurchase $500 million of common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program.  We also appointed Jay Toole to the position of Senior Vice President of Corporate Development.  As many of you know, Jay is a PhD scientist and physician who joined Gilead in 1990 and has played a leadership role in many of our key discovery and clinical research programs.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about the evolving HIV landscape, first providing a brief background on two important data sets on GSK's abacavir that emerged during the first quarter namely the DAD and ACTG 5202 study results.  The DAD data were presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in February of this year and were subsequently published in The Lancet in April.</p>
          <p>The data collection on adverse events of anti-HIV drugs, or DAD, is the name of a study that include 11 cohorts of more than 33,000 HIV-infected patients in 21 countries, including many in Europe, Australia and the United States.  It was established to follow HIV patients over the long-term to assess cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality outcomes.  The data show that use of abacavir is associated with a 90%, almost twofold increase in the risks of myocardial infarction or MI.</p>
          <p>The second study ACTG 5202 is a US-based study conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trial Group and sponsored by NIAID comparing in part Truvada and Epzicom head-to-head.  The study, which commenced in late 2006, enrolled 1,800 treatment na&#xEF;ve patients who were randomized to receive one of four regimens:  Truvada or Epzicom with either Sustiva or boosted Reyataz.  The Data and Safety Monitoring Board of the Division of AIDS met in early February and reviewed preliminary study data.  The review indicated that Epzicom patients who at screening had high viral load of more than 100,000 copies experienced significantly higher rates of virologic failure and grade III and IV adverse events.</p>
          <p>These data led the ACTG to recommend to investigators that patients with high viral loads at screening, nearly half of all patients, be unblinded and counseled on what the DSMB finding could mean to them and consider switching off a regiment containing Epzicom.  The study is continuing in this modified fashion.  I am certain that there will be continue discussion about the importance and potential impact of these two data sets.  But at this point, we believe that it would be premature and inappropriate for us to speculate on any potential regulatory actions either in the US or European Union resulting from these study of results. Gilead remains focused on our continued efforts to ensure physicians understand the profile of Truvada either as part of Atripla or in combination with a protease inhibitor.</p>
          <p>I would like to make a brief update on the further progress made during the quarter to increase the diagnosis and treatment of HIV in the US.  Specifically in Virginia the State House of Delegates passed and the Governor signed a bill eliminating written informed consent and pretest counseling requirements in line with the CDC recommendations.  This brings of number of states that have taken legislative steps to reduce the barriers to testing and guidelines to 9. Additionally, similar bills have been introduced in Maryland, Massachusetts and Nebraska.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to John Milligan, I would like to say from my perspective Gilead has never been stronger with more opportunities than ever before to continue to grow our existing marketed products, including the further rollout of Atripla throughout Europe, the anticipated introduction of aztreonam lysine for inhalation for cystic fibrosis and Viread for HBV into the market, and the significant progress that we are making with our research and development programs.  And with Jay Toole taking the lead in our business development activities, we will continue to look at products and programs that complement our existing business units.  I am very proud of the more than 3,000 employees here at Gilead and the efforts they make every day to improve the lives of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases worldwide.</p>
          <p>Now to our financials: John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.  The first quarter of 2008 was another very successful quarter.  Total revenues, which include product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues for the first quarter of 2008 were $1.3 billion.  First quarter product sales were $1.1 billion, a 30% increase compared to the first quarter of 2007 and our second consecutive quarter of surpassing $1 billion in product sales.</p>
          <p>HIV product sales totaled $965 million for the first quarter of 2008 driven primarily by the continued strong uptake of Atripla in the United States as well as the strong growth of Truvada in the United States and Europe.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were $350 million, an 18% increase over the first quarter of the prior year.  This reflects our commitment to investing in our pipeline and our geographic expansion while keeping a sharp focus on overall expense management.  As we have noted in the past, we plan to continue to expand our operations in Europe and Kevin will speak to you in a few minutes about the progress we are making in this regard.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter 2008 net income was $496 million or $0.51 per share on a fully diluted basis.  Non-GAAP net income per share for the first quarter of 2008, excluding the impact of after-tax stock- based compensation expense, was $0.54 per share on a fully diluted basis, a 16% increase over the first quarter of 2007 non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.46 per share, which also excluded the impact of after-tax stock-based compensation expense.  During the first quarter of 2008, we generated 557 million in operating cash flow and repurchased and retired 16.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $816 million.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the specific results for the first quarter.  Total revenues for the first quarter of 2008 were $1.3 billion, an increase of 22% from total revenue of $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2007.  This performance is driven by a $301 million increase in our product sales, partially offset by a $71 million decrease in our royalty, contract and other revenues compared to the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Product sales were a record $1.1 billion for the first quarter of 2008 marking four consecutive years of quarterly product sales growth.  Product sales from the first quarter increased sequentially by 11% as our HIV product sales continues to grow.</p>
          <p>In terms of foreign exchange impact, $37 million of our product sales increase in the first quarter of 2008 was due to the favorable foreign currency exchange when compared with the same period in 2007, and $9 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  This favorable impact takes into account our hedging activities.</p>
          <p>Royalty, contracts and other revenues increased from the fourth quarter of 2007 by 70% due primarily to the increase in Tamiflu royalties.</p>
          <p>Now turning to more specifics on product sales.  HIV product sales grew to $965 million for the first quarter of 2008, up 37% from $705 million in the first quarter of 2007 and up 12% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2007.  Atripla contributed $324 million to our first quarter HIV product sales as demand for this product continued to increase in the US.  Atripla sales accounted for 34% of our total HIV franchise sales in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Efavirenz portion of Atripla, which is distributed back to BMS and reflected in the cost of goods sold line, was approximately $120 million or about 37% of Atripla sales in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In addition to growth in retail demand, we also observed large non-retail purchases in the first quarter of 2008 by a small number of centrally purchasing state ADAP accounts with warehousing capability.  We believe such purchases could be driven by the grant cycle for Federal ADAP funds, rather than being completely demand driven and therefore could temper orders in the current quarter given the likely increase in inventory levels in those accounts exiting the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Truvada sales were $479 million for the first quarter of 2008, up 39% compared to the first quarter of 2007, of which approximately 6% was driven by the favorable foreign currency exchange impact when compared to the first quarter of 2007.  Truvada sales for the first quarter of 2008 were up 7% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2007, of which approximately 1% was driven by the favorable foreign currency exchange impact when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  Truvada sales accounted for approximately half of our total HIV franchise sales in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the US, Truvada sales were $239 million for the first quarter of 2008, up 28% compared to the first quarter of 2007.  Sequentially, US sales were up 14% demonstrating Truvada's continued uptake as the NRTI backbone of choice when using combination with protease inhibitors.  The growth in Truvada sales was also driven by our January 2008 price increase in the US as well as the higher than usual non-retail purchases by certain state ADAP accounts as I described earlier.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Truvada sales for the first quarter of 2008 were $218 million, an increase of 50% when compared to the first quarter of 2007, driven by strong sales volume growth and a favorable foreign exchange environment.  Sequentially, Truvada sales in Europe increased 3% mostly driven by the favorable foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>As we discussed in our year-end earnings call, in response to an increased level of parallel trade activity in the region, effective December 1st, 2007, the company initiated supply management system at France to manage orders of Truvada and Viread to insure adequate appropriate supply of those products commensurate with the market demand in France.  Based on the results today we currently believe that the supply management system has accomplished what we have thought and we expect that future sales in the region will better approximate demand.  We'll continue to monitor parallel trade activity to ensure continued effectiveness of our supply management system.</p>
          <p>Viread sales were $153 million for the first quarter of 2008, down 5% from the same period in 2007 due primarily to lower sales volumes in the US and Europe, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact.  Viread sales for the first quarter of 2008 increased 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange environment and higher pricing.</p>
          <p>Hepsera, for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B, generated sales of $83 million in the first quarter of 2008, up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2007, of which approximately 7% was driven by the favorable foreign currency exchange impact.  Hepsera sales for the first quarter of 2008 experienced an 8% increase sequentially, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the US and certain European markets.</p>
          <p>Sales of AmBisome were  $71 million for the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 15% when compared to the first quarter of 2007, of which approximately 8% was driven by the favorable foreign currency exchange environment.  AmBisome sales increased by 5% sequentially due primarily to increased sales volumes in certain European and international regions.</p>
          <p>Finally, Letairis sales were $20 million for the first quarter of 2008.  Letairis was approved by the FDA for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the United States in June 2007 and we're very pleased with its ramp since launch.</p>
          <p>Our royalty, contract and other revenues for the first quarter of 2008 decreased by 38% compared to the same quarter of 2007, and increase by 70% over the fourth quarter of 2007, due primarily to the royalty revenues from Tamiflu sales made by Roche.  The changes in Tamiflu sales in both comparative periods were due primarily to the fluctuations in sales related to the government pandemic planning initiatives worldwide.</p>
          <p>Royalties received from Roche and recognized in our revenues for the first quarter of 2008 were $93 million.  These royalties, which are paid one quarter in arrears, reflect a royalty rate of approximately 22% as applied to Roche's sales of Tamiflu during the first quarter of 2007.  As you may be aware, Roche is scheduled to report first quarter 2008 earnings tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Now turning to product gross margin.  Non-GAAP product gross margin for the first quarter of 2008, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was approximately 79.1% compared to non-GAAP product gross margin of approximately 79.9% for the same quarter of 2007 and 79.3% for the fourth quarter of 2007.  The lower product gross margin, when compared to the same period last year, was primarily due to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which carry the Efavirenz portion at zero gross margin, partially offset by favorable overall product mix.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses.  Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation expense for the first quarter of 2008, were $138 million.  This is an increase of 27% from $109 million in the same period of last year, primarily as a result of increased clinical study expenses as well as higher head count related to the growth in our business.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses for the first quarter of 2008 decreased 18% from $169 million, primarily driven by higher license payments to Gilead's collaboration partners in the fourth quarter of 2007, and partially offset by the increased clinical study expenses in the first quarter of 2008 as well as higher headcounts.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation expense for the first quarter of 2008, were $177 million, an increase of 33% compared to $133 million in the same period last year, due primarily to increased marketing, promotional and other expenses in support of our antiviral and cardiovascular programs, as well as higher headcounts, especially in our cardiovascular business.  The stronger euro also contributed higher expenses in US dollar terms for our euro-based operations.</p>
          <p>On a sequential basis, non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses for the first quarter of 2008 increased by 7% from $165 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, due primarily to higher head count and other expenses to support the growth in our business.</p>
          <p>On our first quarter 2008 revenues and pre-tax earnings foreign currency exchange had a net favorable impact of $37 million and $20 million respectively when compared to the same period last year. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, the foreign currency exchange impact on our first quarter 2008 revenues was favorable by $9 million while the impact on our first quarter 2008 pre-tax earnings was not significant.  These take into account the product sales and expenses generated from outside the United States as well our hedging activities.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2008 was 28.0%.  Our effective tax rate for the full year of 2007 was 28.9%.  The lower effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2008, compared to full year 2007, was primarily driven by increased earnings in favorable tax jurisdictions.</p>
          <p>Next, I would like to turn to our operating cash flow performance to the quarter and finally our net cash position at the end of the first quarter.  In the first quarter of 2008, we generated $577 million in operating cash flow.  Our balance sheet at March 31st, 2008 shows cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.6 billion, a decrease of $133 million as compared to the balance of approximately $2.7 billion at December 31st, 2007.</p>
          <p>We also repurchased 16.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $816 million this quarter under our $3 billion share repurchase program.  The includes the $500 million of common stock that we repurchased on the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we entered into in March with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.  As of March 31st, 2008, we had approximately $2.2 billion remaining under this share repurchase program, which will expire at the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>We continue to actively evaluate strategic ways to use our cash and investments, including continuing our efforts to pursue opportunity to in-license or acquire product to complement our own internal effort.  We're also committed to returning cash to our stockholders as is evidenced by the ongoing share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to turn to our financial guidance for the full year 2008.  You can locate all of our guidance for the 2008 year on Gilead's corporate website.  The only metric that we'll be updating from our guidance provided to you in January is the effective tax rate for the full year 2008, which we now expect to be in the range of 28 to 29% compared to our previous guidance of 29 to 30%.  The decrease in effective tax rate guidance is primarily related to increased revenues in favorable tax jurisdictions.  For all other metrics, we are reiterating our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with the sequential quarter-over-quarter growth in our product revenues, particularly the HIV franchise. As I discussed previously; however, we saw larger than usual purchases of our HIV products by a small number of US states, which we believe may be related to their ADAP budgetary cycle, which could result in significantly lower orders in the second quarter based on their current estimated inventory levels.</p>
          <p>In addition, the exact timing of anticipated pricing approval and subsequent launches of Atripla in European countries is still uncertain, and will have an impact on our product revenues.  And, finally, foreign exchange rates remain extremely volatile due to macroeconomic factors and it's difficult to predict at this point whether current rates are sustainable and how future fluctuations in these foreign exchange rates could affect our revenues and expenses for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I am reiterating the guidance of 4.7 to $4.8 billion in the net product revenues for 2008.  This is for direct product sales only and does not include royalty, contract or other revenues.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, the expense guidance we're reiterating today will be non-GAAP, which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense.  We are reiterating our full year non-GAAP gross margin guidance in the range of 77 to 79%.  We are also reiterating our full year expense guidance of $610 million to $630 million for non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses and $710 million to $730 million for non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses. And finally, regarding after-tax stock-based compensation expense, we're reiterating the 2008 fully diluted EPS impact to be in the range of 12 to $0.14 per share.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, our solid operating performance continues to be a validation of the significant efforts made by the more than 3,000 Gilead employees.  We remain committed to driving performance for our shareholders by working to improve the lives of patients around the world.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to turn over the call over to Norbert, who will discuss our research and development highlights for the quarter.  Norbert?</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.  In the first quarter of this year, Gilead achieved several significant research and development milestones, further advancing our pipeline programs.  As you know, we now have a more robust pipeline of product candidates than ever before, so I am going to only to focus on those that have made significant advancements during the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the antiviral front starting with HIV, I am very pleased to provide you an update on our elvitegravir program.  First, with FDA's consent, we are nearing completion of the design of the Phase III program for elvitegravir.  As we have previously communicated, we will be conducting two non-inferiority studies evaluating elvitegravir versus Merck's raltegravir.  Because of the clean safety profile of the highest dose of elvitegravir studies in the Phase II trial, the FDA requested that we consider evaluating two doses of elvitegravir in the Phase III studies, the 150 and a higher dose, 300 milligrams, with the thought that the 300 milligram dose could provide greater efficacy for patients with more advanced disease.</p>
          <p>Based on recently obtained PK data demonstrating that the 300-milligram dose does not provide substantially higher exposure than the 150-milligram dose, we will no longer be required to evaluate the 300-milligram dose and the planned Phase III studies will only have two arms.</p>
          <p>The two studies will enroll patients in the US and in Europe and the primary end-point will be the proportion of patients that achieve and maintain HIV RNA less than 50 copies per ml at week 48.  Due to the work we did to resolve the need to evaluate the 300-milligram dose, we now anticipate initiating these studies in the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>I am also very pleased for the first rime to provide you with the details on our PK enhancer program.  As you know, elvitegravir requires that it be boosted with 100 milligrams of retonovir in order to be dosed once a day.  Because of the benefit of simplified and convenient therapies to patients, as exemplified by our own Atripla, it is our goal to also co-formulate elvitegravir into 1 pill, once daily complete regimen.  The incorporation of retonovir, however, presents a challenge because of the requirement for a specialized formulation.</p>
          <p>Though our strategy has been to develop a proprietary boosting agent, one, which is devoid of HIV activity, can easily be manufactured and can be given at a relatively low dose so that co-formulation with elvitegravir and also Truvada is a possibility.  We now have that candidate; it's GS 9350, which appears to fit all of these criteria.  In fact, a pilot formulation study demonstrated that we can co-formulate 9350 with elvitegravir and Truvada into one single pill.  We have filed the IND and we are currently preparing to evaluate the safety, tolerability and metabolic profile of GS 9350 in healthy volunteers.  If the results are positive, we could then move the compound into HIV-infected individuals, evaluating safety and efficacy as a boosting agent versus retonovir.  We look forward to keeping you posted on the progress we make with this compound.</p>
          <p>On the HCV front, following submission of data to FDA, we have now resumed screening patients in the continuation of the Phase Ib study of GS 9190, our novel HCV polymerase inhibitor.  We will continue the evaluation of the 40 milligram dose which, based on a pilot QTc study in healthy volunteers appear to have QTc prolongations that were small and clinically manageable.  We will now finish enrolling patients in the Phase Ib study to establish the safety and efficacy of the 40-milligram dose in a sufficient number of patients to allow us to go forward into Phase II studies.</p>
          <p>With regards to 9450, our caspase inhibitor in license last year, the company is currently been evaluated as a hepatoprotectant in an ongoing Phase Ia study in HCV-infected individuals.  We have recently added US sites to the study, which would accelerate the enrollment of patients and we anticipate data from this trial by the end of the year.  We believe that this molecule may also have utility in other diseases such as fatty liver disease or NASH.</p>
          <p>On the respiratory front aztreonam lysine for inhalation is Gilead's unique drug formulation specifically designed to achieve high lung antibiotic concentrations with a short duration of administration.  The US NDA was filed on November 16, 2007 and we have a PDUFA date of September 16 of this year.  In order to make the product available to CF patients in need, prior to its commercial availability, we opened up an expanded access program and now have more than a 100 patients enrolled in the program.</p>
          <p>Ahead of schedule, we announced that we filed a marketing authorization application in the European Union on March 7 and we have since also filed in Canada, where the submission was granted a priority review.  We're preparing to conduct a hit-to-hit open label study versus TOBI in the EU to support registration and plan to initiate this study shortly.  The study will not need to be completed in order to gain approval in the EU, but it will support a conditional approval strategy.</p>
          <p>We will also be initiating in the second quarter of 2008 a study called the mild study that will evaluate the quality of life of aztreonam lysine for inhalation in patients whose lung function is less compromised than patients who are involved in our Phase III pivotal studies.  Quality of life will be assessed by CFQR, a patient-reported outcome tool used to measure health-related quality of life for people with CF. If the outcome from this study is positive, aztreonam lysine would be the only inhaled antibiotic with demonstrated benefit in earlier diseased CF patients with Pseudomonas infections.</p>
          <p>With regards to our cardiovascular franchise, the Phase III studies for darusentan in resistant hypertension are progressed in terms of enrollment in both the DAR-311 and DAR-312 studies, which are approximately 58% and 25%, enrolled respectively.  The darusentan data monitoring committee met recently and recommended that the studies be continued.  We believe we are on track to complete enrollment and receive data from these studies in 2009.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased with the progress Gilead has made in the first quarter and look forward to informing you of further advancement of our pipeline candidates through the remainder of this year.  With that, next, Kevin will review our commercial highlights for the quarter.  Kevin?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Norbert, and good afternoon everyone.  The first quarter of 2008 was an extraordinary quarter with multiple significant events occurring.  I am referring to the results from the DAD data and the ACTG 5202 study as John Martin previously discussed.  The treatment communities' ongoing discussion and decisions around the potential impact of these data sets, along with our anticipated new product launches will continue to make 2008 a very exciting year.  However, we believe these data did not have any impact on product revenues for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Before turning to our commercial performance for the quarter, I would like to remind you that the analysis of our HIV and HBV market share data in the US and Europe, we rely on the most up to date third party data available to us in each market.  This data lags our financial results by one quarter.</p>
          <p>I would first like to discuss the performance of our antiviral franchise, which is comprised of our HIV and HBV marketed products.  Our US HIV franchise performance remained the best in the industry in Q4 of 2007, and the gap between Gilead and our closest competitors continue to widen.  Atripla built on its leadership position in the US as approximately 28% of the estimated 538,000 patients treated with antiretrovirals, or just over 150,000 patients, were on Atripla therapy.  Atripla together with Truvada when prescribed as an alternative therapy with protease inhibitors continued to account for approximately 8 out of 10 treatment na&#xEF;ve patients.</p>
          <p>In patients switching to Atripla from other therapies, over 50% were from non-Gilead based regimens.  Patients previously on Combivir continue to dominate switch patients &#x2013; comprising 29% of the total patients who switched to Atripla.</p>
          <p>Truvada continue to be the backbone of choice for antiviral therapy in the US with an estimated 169,000 patients receiving Truvada.  This represented an impressive 31% of all patients treated with antiretrovirals.  Notably, 68% of all US patients, or 365,000, received the tenofovir molecule during the fourth quarter of 2007 in one of its three forms, namely Atripla, Truvada or Viread, an increase from 64% from the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>We continue to make excellent progress with our HIV products in Europe and believe that with the continued rollout of Atripla, as well as further responses to the DAD data and the ACTG 5202 study, we will continue to build upon on our strong position.  As you know, we and our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb received European approval for Atripla in late December 2007.  The launch is well underway in the UK, Germany and Austria, and just last week I am pleased to announce that we launched in Greece.  In addition, pricing negotiations are progressing well with France, Italy, Portugal and Spain.  And we believe we are on track to have those finalized before the end of the third quarter, with other European Union countries rolling out over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>The market opportunity in the big five countries continued to show robust growth and it was estimated that, as of the fourth quarter 2007, 256,000 patients were treated with antiretrovirals within these five markets.  This represents a 9% year-over-year growth rate and is comparable to the rate of growth achieved in the US.  Truvada has continued to build on a strong base throughout the EU and was the number one brand throughout the big five markets, while tenofovir was the leading molecule in France, Spain, Germany and the UK during the same period.  We anticipate that we will achieve the same position in Italy during the current quarter.</p>
          <p>Truvada plus Sustiva continue to extend their lead as the combination of choice for treatment na&#xEF;ve patients, growing to 27% of treatment na&#xEF;ve patients, which is more than double the next closest regimen of Truvada plus Kaletra at 13%.  An important potential driver to solidifying this regimen's first-line position is that the British HIV Association was the first committee to react to the DAD data and the ACTG study by recently publishing revised UK HIV treatment guidelines for consultation.  If these guidelines are finalized at the end of consultation period on May the 16th and remain unchanged, Truvada plus Sustiva will become the preferred regimen for patients in front-line use in the UK.</p>
          <p>Of all treatment initiations on Truvada during the fourth quarter of 2007, 60% came from treatment na&#xEF;ve patients while 40% have switched from other products.  The patients that switched to Truvada, approximately half have been on a Combivir-based regimen.</p>
          <p>In the NRTI market, Truvada continued to outperform Kivexa, known in the US as Epzicom, with a Truvada versus Kivexa market share ratio of 2.3 to 1.  This will be an important metric for us to watch as we monitor the impact of the launch of Atripla as well as the response to the DAD data and ACTG 5202 study.  And finally on the HIV front, approximately 55% of all patients that initiated therapy began on a regimen that contained Truvada.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to our Hepatitis franchise: during the first quarter of 2008 in the United States, Hepsera continue to be the leading antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B.  As of the end of February 2008, Hepsera maintained its place as market leader with a total prescription market share of approximately 44%.  In the Gilead territories outside the US, Hepsera's market share remained relatively stable despite strong competition.</p>
          <p>Turning to Viread for HBV:  In late March, we were very pleased to have received our first approval of Viread for this indication in Turkey and we're currently awaiting reimbursement authorization prior to launching the product.  With an estimated 350,000 chronically infected HBV patients, Turkey represents an important market and is a country in which we have established a direct Gilead presence.</p>
          <p>Also in March, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion on the approval of Viread for HBV throughout the EU and we currently anticipate approval in the second quarter.  As we prepare for the anticipated European approval of Viread for HBV this quarter, we're excited about the timing of the European Association for the Study of the Liver conference taking place next week in Milan, Italy.  This event will pull together key thought leaders in HBV from throughout Europe and will allow us to showcase the attributes of our HBV portfolio, particularly Viread for HBV.  There will be presentations from 10 Gilead-sponsored abstracts, five of which are oral presentations.</p>
          <p>In reviewing our commercial readiness to support a successful launch of Viread for HBV in the EU as well as potentially the US later this year, we are far along in our pre-launch preparations and feel we are well positioned to support a successful rollout with our existing commercial infrastructure in both of these markets.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our cardiovascular franchise, and Letairis for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH.  In an effort to share additional details on the Letairis launch and the PAH market, we conducted a survey of approximately 100 prescribing physicians responsible for more than 10,000 PAH patients in late March of this year.  We are in the process of refining a robust data set in cooperation with a third party source that we hope to use in coming quarters.  Until such time that we feel that data is reliable and indicative of market trends we will continue to conduct our own market research to use on our earnings calls.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the recent performance of Letairis as well as the market dynamics we have been seeing.  During the first quarter we recorded $20 million of Letairis sales, which is very much in line with our expectations at this point in the launch.  We now have approximately 3,600 physicians enrolled in our Letairis Education and Access Program, otherwise known as LEAP.  Of these physicians approximately 25% represent the main treatment providers for PAH.  The remaining 75% are an important part of the referral base and their continued education is essential to our efforts to expand awareness and diagnosis of this disease.</p>
          <p>Letairis has an approximate 15% share of ERA [endothelin receptor antagonists]-treated PAH patients as of our March Gilead-conducted survey.  Importantly, in the PAH centers, which accounted for approximately 60% of all Letairis patients, that share was approximately 20%.  Letairis captured approximately 24% of newly diagnosed patients treated within ERA, during this period according to our survey data.</p>
          <p>Since the launch of Letairis patients have come from three primary sources: patients new to therapy, patients who have switched to Letairis from other PAH treatments, namely bosentan and PDE5 inhibitors, and finally patients who have had Letairis added to their existing therapy. Monotherapy currently comprises approximately 60% of PAH-treated patients with the use of combination therapy at approximately 40%.</p>
          <p>On the reimbursement front, access barriers have been minimal and manageable since the launch of Letairis, with comparable coverage to bosentan on most formularies.  Letairis is covered on virtually all of the top managed care plans as well as virtually all state Medicaid plans.  We are very encouraged with the physician feedback we have been receiving.  As their experience grows, physicians are gaining additional comfort and expanding the number of patients to whom they prescribe Letairis.  We believe we are well positioned to build upon the early success of Letairis.</p>
          <p>And to further support the product, we will be initiating our Athena 1 Phase IV program shortly.  In this study, we will evaluate Letairis in patients who are poor responders to sildenafil monotherapy.  Importantly, at the upcoming American Thoracic Society meeting taking place in Toronto, May the 16th through May the 21st, we will have data from four studies of Gilead products: two for Letairis, one from our ARIES-E study and one from our ARIES-1 study.  We will also have a poster presentation on aztreonam lysine for inhalation from the interim data from the open label study, and one poster from our Phase I study in CF patients of GS 9310, 9311, our phosphomycin, tobramycin antibiotic combination therapy.</p>
          <p>As Norbert mentioned earlier, we have a PDUFA date of September the 16th for aztreonam lysine with the FDA and have already begun our launch preparedness.  We believe we are in excellent position to launch the product without major additions to our existing sales force.</p>
          <p>In closing, I am pleased with the commercial progress we have made in the first quarter and believe we have laid a strong foundation for growth over the remainder of 2008 and into 2009.  I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call.  Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  I guess I'd just open up with John Milligan: could you quantify if possible the amount of non-retail HIV demand that you think might not surface going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Meg, your question is how much?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't ask it well but what was the anomaly in terms of dollars, as best you could measure in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is very tough to quantify that, because we've observed now for the last couple of years, larger sales especially in places like Florida and Texas ADAPs, where they buy centrally and they do have warehousing capability.  So we don't have complete insight into demand, so we don't know exactly what that number is, so frankly, I can't quantify it for you.  We did see, if you look back historically in '06, Q4 '06, a little bit into Q1 '07, we did see a bump up in non-retail there and we did see some bump up here.  We don't have the March data in yet, so we don't know exactly what that looks like: that's another factor that leads me to conclude that I shouldn't give a specific number.  I can tell you that the ADAPs, as a typical historical percentage of our overall sales, has been right around 25% and then Texas and Florida are a subset of that, so that's about all I can tell you -- and it's 25% of US sales per month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you just solved on that, so it doesn't sound like this bump is atypical, it sounds seasonal, is that a fair assessment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think it's likely to be a seasonal pattern unless something changes within the government.  Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  And, I wanted to ask about the abacavir situation just in terms of how much of the share and how quickly you think that might be able to be taken by Truvada?  How should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Thomas, this is Kevin, I will have a go and then probably John will add to it.  As I said, we felt there was really no impacts of DAD and 5202 in these first quarter results.  Certainly from what we've fed back on a qualitative basis, I think it's going to be an impact first on new patient prescribing.  I think that's where the &#x2013; that the change will start to happen, well I think we will have to wait and see what happens in terms of switching Epzicom or Kivexa patients.  Just to give you a type of quantity, in the US there are just over 50,000 Epzicom patients and total abacavir, if you add in Trizivir and Ziagen would be just over 100,000.  So clearly, I think first and foremost it has a potential to affect Epzicom in the US and Kivexa patients in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Thomas, it's little bit hard to quantify the patients, there was a lot of things are happening, you also have to remember that this an ageing population and so as HIV patients get older their cardiovascular risk naturally increases, which could have a knock-on effect.  But you know doctors and people in the guidelines realize they are just trying to get their arms around these data to try to figure out exactly what they mean right now.  So we really can't quantify that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think, Thomas, the BHIVA change, which was you know fairly speedy, is quite a significant I think stake in the ground around the recommendation of using Truvada plus Sustiva as first-line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well anyway, I got to say, I mean congratulation on a great quarter and obviously huge quarter for you guys.  I just had a question and I don't &#x2013; I just want to understand what was happening in Europe. Did I hear you correctly that the sequential Truvada, Viread sales were up 3%, and that was FX? Was there demand growth sequentially in Europe and do you think this abacavir situation will affect European physicians differently than US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, let me take the -- I'll take the second part first.  I think it has probably more potential to affect Europe, you know, in advance of the US, you know again I, the British HIV guideline changes and they are very well held not only in UK, but across Europe.  There are national guidelines, but there are in each country and we'll have to see how they change.  Of course, you know, DAD was a study coming out of Europe, it was multinational, but it did come out of Europe.  So I think there has been a high level of resonance and you know as I said in the script, we have a lower Truvada to Kivexa ratio, so we have the potential to move that towards the type of ratio that we have in the US.  So, yes, I do think that there is the potential to, if you like, start that potential gradual change in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, your question was about sequential growth in Europe.  If you look at just on a dollar basis, quarter-over-quarter we grew 10% in Europe. And so there is a couple of factors in there, one of course we alluded to in the script, which is the situation in France, where there was a drawdown in inventory associated with the management plan we put in place, so that's number one.  The second part is of course is we're launching Atripla, so as you just saw we had slightly over 14 million in sales so far even in those early countries, and again we presume that that's all switching based on the label in Europe, so that certainly would have had an effect on the Truvada-Viread growth rates as well.</p>

          <p>Okay, well that was close.  Just a quick question, follow-up on Europe.  Kevin, you've given us the numbers for the US for the total tenofovir and emtricitabine penetration and I think you said 68% tenofovir and by implication about 59% for emtricitabine.  Could you give us the comparable numbers for tenofovir and emtricitabine at this point in Europe for the most recent data you have?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks.  I asked you guys last time kind of a three-part question and I got hammered, so I'll ask you just one question this time.  Can I -- can we switch topics to aztreonam and just give us a little bit of a sense as to how big is the market patient-wise, <mark type="inaudible" /> in the US and maybe a little bit of a sense as to what kind of pricing -- or perhaps your competition is -- kind of what the current pricing of your competition and perhaps why, how would you stack according -- you know relative to that, given your data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Kevin.  Just in terms of patients is about equal number of patients US to Europe, to the main countries in Europe and that's about 30,000 patients in each region.  So, you've got about a total of 60,000 patients.  But what you do have is somewhat a different treatment approach.  Obviously the mainstay of treatment is TOBI, tobramycin, here in the US where as you've got -- you have got TOBI in Europe but you also have colistin as a treatment option that is used by European clinicians.  So it's somewhat of a different treatment picture.</p>
          <p>In terms of TOBI, the WAC [Wholesale Acquisition Cost] is about $3,500 per month of therapy, so --of the cost of therapy and that's a month's course.  So, it does depend on how the clinician is typically using TOBI in terms of the severity of the disease with the patient.  Obviously more cycles used for more severe patients, but there will always be the off-month interval because of the avoidance of resistance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in Europe, the prices are a lot lower, is that correct, for TOBI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I'd have to give you an exact price and follow up on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there are a couple of differences between the US and Europe. For one, there is a lot more use of just locally formulated tobramycin, so that takes up a part of that market and also they use of drug called colistin or Coly-Mycin, which is often used, again compounded by local pharmacies.  So, the sales of TOBI itself have never been as large in Europe as they have been in the United States.  The other thing to say is, Kevin mentioned there's 30,000 patients; really that's about 30,000 cystic fibrosis sufferers and obviously it's a subset of patients and I think that's closer to 12,000 annually, most of whom take a sort of mild disease and some of them who are more severe in disease.  So that changes the revenue numbers.  So I wouldn't use 30,000 as your basis for thinking that those would be on treatment.</p>

          <p>That was close as well.  Question for you, for Kevin, on Letairis.  You mentioned a 24% NRAC share, can you give us that number for year-end?  And then, why do you think, why isn't this a little higher given the label, and the last part to this is what impact if any do you guys see on ERAs going to Tier 4 and some parts of the private payroll?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try and remember those questions, Geoff.  First of all, it's important to say that the figure I quoted was not a prescription.  Basically it's from our survey, it's not even a patient record survey.  It's basically a questionnaire that we asked 100 physicians to complete.  So it's their judgments on how much ERA, PDE5 and their brands that they are using, so it's important to qualify that.  It's essentially a survey that we did in the month of March, so it's a point in time.  So in terms of having any retrospective data we just don't have that.  So, it was a, essentially a survey that you know we felt necessary we had to do, because we are still waiting to have a third party produce a high quality type of data set that we get for Synovate in HIV.</p>
          <p>I can remember the third part of your question.  I still think that the ERAs a very valuable in terms of their role in treating PAH.  I certainly met with quite a number of PAH specialists and they do consider ERAs as a first-line option and I think generally they can get those products approved from their payers.  So, my expectation is that, I think for the foreseeable future they are going to stay at Tier 2 and Tier 3.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, thanks.  I'm wondering if I could turn to the pipeline for a second, and I wasn't really clear on 9350 development plan, maybe can you clarify and go a little beyond if those data are positive, what stage you can put them in, into HIV patients and how quickly development can be, maybe?</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, our &#x2013; maybe I should start that where we ultimately want to go. We want to have a co-formulated single tablet that can be given once daily, that is a complete regimen similar to Atripla.  In order to get there, that single tablet will contain elvitegravir and our booster.  So with our PK enhancer what we have to do first of course is to find out in healthy volunteers whether it indeed boosts CYP3A4 substrates and that we have filed the IND and we are initiating those studies shortly.</p>
          <p>If then we confirm that, yes, that's indeed the case and we also accumulate some safety information in a limited number of individuals, we could then go into HIV-infected individuals and really, hopefully, even with the single pill and initiate the larger study that will ultimately get us approval of elvitegravir plus the PK enhancer co-formulated with Truvada.  But I also want to tell you of course in parallel, we are also developing elvitegravir for treatment experienced patients and those are those two Phase III studies that I talked about, that we're initiating in the third quarter of this year.  Was this clear, Mike, have I answered your question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, thanks for taking my question.  I guess my question is related to aztreonam lysine in cystic fibrosis.  I guess in choosing to run a head-to-head trial against TOBI, are you looking for non-inferiority or superiority?  And what are the potential risks to your market share depending on the outcomes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we did -- the study is designed as a non-inferiority study versus TOBI and just to make clear this is a &#x2013; so we filed in the European Union under a special provision that will get us approval, but ultimately the Europeans in order to get full approval will want a head-to-head study against the standard of care, which is TOBI.  The threat to our business I think is minimal -- the threat to our business I think is minimal, that's my opinion, because it is clear that TOBI when it is repeatedly used has very minimal efficacy.  We have seen that in our own study in '06 and we have also seen it in the TOBI studies, whereas patients that have not seen aztreonam, they will have a much better response.  That's why we feel very comfortable to do a head-to-head study versus TOBI.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I also believe &#x2013; I will also add that if you believe in the profile of your product you know you should be prepared to do comparative studies just like we did with Study 934 in HIV, and just like we're doing with our new study, as Norbert said, in the mild cystic fibrosis setting, which again is another advance in terms of the science in developing the profile of the drug.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks a lot.  Just a follow-up question on the guidance: so I understand the three reasons you laid out, as to why you're not increasing it, but it still seems to be a little inconsistent with the DAD and ACTG results that was an upside surprise, and I am wondering if what I'm missing is maybe it will just take longer for that to have an impact? Or is there another answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not certain how long it's going to take to have an impact.  We're pretty confident it will have an impact because these are important data sets.  And they are data sets that are maturing as well including the ACTG study is an ongoing study.  So there are additional things will come out of it.  Full data set hasn't been presented, so very few people even know what the results were of that interim look.  And we won't probably see that until later on this year.  So the ability to have data sets and discussions and for physicians and patients to make decisions is going to take some time to flow through.  Obviously, the prevailing wind is quite favorable to us.  But the specifics aren't out there yet, so it is difficult for us to predict the impact on sales across the world.</p>

          <p>You know, I would concur with John that it does take time to go from those high decile opinion leader type of physicians down to the lower.  We've seen that with the Combivir switch and I think really DAD and ACTG is just starting to percolate down the decile, so it will take time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Norbert, just a question on elvitegravir: obviously, the PK enhancer works and that will help you overcome a major obstacle of using low dose retonovir in treatment na&#xEF;ve patients.  So just curious, you know what would need to be done to begin to look at those patients in terms of smaller, you know, earlier stage clinical trials and what point in time or what timeline do you think you could actually be in pivotals looking at elvitegravir plus 9340 combo in treatment na&#xEF;ve patients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so we would need -- you know, you need a certain safety database for people to become comfortable to expose a larger number of individuals in a Phase III study and what that would that number is depends of course what the preclinical talks is and the preliminary clinical experience.  One thing that makes me feel comfortable about the PK enhancer is that we think it and will end up be a fairly low dose similar to retonovir, hopefully lower.  And so I think the danger of having &#x2013; big safety events will somewhat diminish if you use that lower dose.</p>
          <p>But, you know, with elvitegravir we also need a certain safety database in order to go into Phase III studies and that safety database will be accumulated in large part in the treatment experienced patient studies that we're initiating right now.  So I am not prepared at this point to give you timelines simply because we are still thinking through this internally, but I think I have given you a flavor of how you could construct them or think about them.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, hi, thanks.  So my question has to do with darusentan: can you remind us of the design of the ongoing Phase III trials and how are you ensuring that you are getting real resistant hypertension patients in these trials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a very good question.  So the way the protocol is designed, these have to be patients that are resistant -- that have resistant hypertension as defined by the JNC 7, the Joint National Committee, and that defines resistant hypertension as not being ongoing blood pressure, which is 140/90 in hypertensives, 130/80 if you have chronic kidney disease or diabetes, despite being on free full doses of antihypertensives, which has to include a diuretic.  So in other words, all our patients are at least on three full doses of antihypertensives.  And by the way, full dose is defined as either maximum label dose or something lesser, if there is a medical reason for it.</p>
          <p>So it's completely documented, it's completely consistent with the definition and that's why we feel comfortable that adding on darusentan into that &#x2013; patient population, if you can show, if we can repeat the observation from the Phase II study, where we saw about that an additional 10 millimeter decrease in systolic-diastolic blood pressure, then I think we would have a very strong package for -- to send to FDA for approval.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Thanks for taking my question.  Kevin, you made the remark, I think in response to Thomas' question, that the effects of the DAD and ACTG studies will first be seen in new patient prescribing.  Can you give us some idea of the proportion of patients, na&#xEF;ve patients who were started on an abacavir regimen, say as of a few months ago, and what percent of those patients are not already contraindicated against tenofovir?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically in new patients, the percentage is probably about 9% of naive patient start on Epzicom.  Now you will have to add in the very, very small amounts that still might be there for something like trazavir, but basically I think Epzicom is the product to concentrate on.  So, it is quite a small number but obviously a lot bigger in Europe.  Our ratio of Epzicom to Truvada in the US is about 4.4 prescriptions to 1 in our favor, and as I said in the call it's 2.3 to 1 in Europe.  So there is that, I mean we feel there is that upside for us.  Obviously, it's a smaller pool of antiretroviral treated patients in Europe but I think in terms of market share versus Kivexa/Epzicom, there is a high potential there in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Phil, I would like to add, you asked the question, how many of those patients are contraindicated to tenofovir?  Our contraindication statement in the US simply reads: if you are hypersensitive to tenofovir or any components in the formulation then you are contraindicated.  So, we really don't have a contraindication per se.  In the warning section, it says that you have to be careful with very low creatinine clearances, but those patients are very rare.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and let me add my congratulations.  Just a question for Norbert on 9350, the PK enhancer.  I mean clearly we can see use for that drug beyond elvitegravir. I don't know if there are any products that you might have shelved in the past, maybe the HIV protease inhibitor, or ones that are available in the marketplace that you could potentially move forward using the PK enhancer.  Is there an opportunity there?</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, that's a very good question and that's a question we have asked ourselves as well and we are currently going through the thought process.  But clearly, as you know there are a lot of opportunities for PK enhancers that go beyond elvitegravir and they are not only in HIV, they are also in Hepatitis C and we are looking at some of those, you know the use of a PK enhancer in other areas. But I am &#x2013; at this point we haven't made specific decisions and are not prepared to give you any specific answers.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, just had a unrelated question, I'll be honest about that.  Can you just share with us your expectations for the darusentan data and what do you do with that drug if the data is positive, in terms of marketing the molecule?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well so, I can speak to the data. You know the two studies that we are doing right now, the two Phase III studies, are very similar to the Phase II study that was done, the 211 study that was presented at a previous meeting.  And as I said, we added on darusentan to existing antihypertensive drugs, all of the patients were on three, some of them were on four antihypertensive medications and we saw about a 10 millimeter, both systolic and diastolic decrease in blood pressure.  So we feel very -- I personally feel very confident that we will replicate those data in our Phase III studies.  And I think now Kevin is going to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the sort of -- early thoughts on commercialization, Ian, I think there's two critical questions, really, that we're working through right now in quite some detail is:  what type of results will we require to launch this and I think you know it's going to require not only some focus on specialists, but also some focus into some section of the primary care market.  And then, secondly, I think the other question will be what type of risk map will be, because of course it's an ERA, it will have a risk map.  And the question then will be, you know, the risk map appropriate for our product profile and appropriate for this type of market.  So, that will I think evolve as we get to know both the market as well as we see the data from the Phase III studies -- and of course discussions with the FDA.</p>
