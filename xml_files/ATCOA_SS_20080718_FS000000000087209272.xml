        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I have the honor to open this presentation with Atlas Copco. And I will leave over the speech to the CFO of Atlas Copco, Hans Ola Meyer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik, and very welcome to all of you here in Stockholm and also of course everybody, on the telephone conference that we are conducting in parallel with this presentation. We will stick to the usual format meaning, that I will hand over in a few moments to Gunnar Brock, our CEO, who will go through some comments and some slides summarizing the second quarter results and then after that, 15, 20 minutes later we will open up for any questions you might have.</p>
          <p>I think we will get right to it. So please Gunnar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans Ola, and good afternoon and good morning to everyone. I was just thinking what kind of a headline we should have for this presentation, since most people are out sailing and taking vacation. And it was a good quarter from the emerging markets. We came up with a slogan, Billowing Sail Supported By Favorable Trade Winds. Now I will not explain much more about that now, but I hope that it will be apparent as we go on.</p>
          <p>I will refer to those of you who are not present here in Stockholm to the number of the slides. So quickly, we move into slide number three, which is some kind of a short summary of what took place during Q2. And although we haven't used the word record, but I think we had a record high order intake, a record high invoicing, and record high profits, which as you can see also has been coming from most areas, all business areas and most regions around the world.</p>
          <p>But particularly, we should mention that the Construction &amp; Mining Technique has contributed with a substantial 32% organic growth. Although the other two, Industrial Technique had 13% organic order growth and Compressive Technique just around 10, so I think all of them have contributed.</p>
          <p>Now when we move to the profit level, unfortunately this time around, as always, we have to comment on the currency effect. This quarter it was a headwind of around MSEK 310, which for the two quarters that we have behind us, that's up to, close to 700 million. We, as everybody else in the business are exposed to quite heavy increases in raw material and components and for us it's mainly component price increases. But, we have managed to move our product costs in the right direction through efficiency measures. We are constantly trying to move sourcing from China, India to Europe. We are relocating production, redesigning products et cetera. And little by little I think we are managing to offset the pressure that we've had.</p>
          <p>So, let me then move on to the next, which is slide number 4, which more in detail give you the figures. Now I'm not going to dwell on all of them, but the operating profit I said is up 20% and the margin is 19.2, despite the unfavorable currencies. The profit before tax or PAFE, as we call it, are also actually up like-for-like exactly 20%, but in the figure the 3215 for last year we had a capital gain effect, and also some of you may remember, we had actually a pile of cash and had actually positive interest net.</p>
          <p>This time with the re-leverage of the company we had a negative interest cost of 288 million, so of course, comparing &#x2013; that's of course reality, but comparing like-for-like it's exactly the same 20% increase.</p>
          <p>Cash flow did not show that good figures as a total, the operating cash flow, if I look at the working capital, did develop well, but we had a coincidence of periods falling due, all &#x2013; not all but substantial interest payments are actually hitting us in Q2 and Q4, we had higher than usual tax payments at the same time, and we also are pouring some money into the customer finance.</p>
          <p>So these are, let's call it, not extracurricular, but they are not part of the normal daily operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>Moving then on to the global map and as you can see the local currency &#x2013; that's local currency under net of acquisitions and divestments clocked up 23% which is basically the same as year-to-date. And if you look at the world, you could say that it's all accelerated in Latin America, Africa, Middle East, and Asia. There we saw an acceleration in the second quarter, whereas you saw a slower development in U.S. and Canada and parts of Western Europe.</p>
          <p>I will then go a little bit more into every continent. So if you look at North America it was still a positive picture for the company. So we still grew our business in North America. And partly underpinned by very strong mining demand, coal mining, a lot of investments still going into coal, where we have our portfolio of surface drill rigs. We saw a rather okay demand from the motor vehicle industry, but as you know, we are not always tied to the number of cars produced. There are other factors like model changes and things like that. So it was actually not a disappointing picture.</p>
          <p>The construction business or products related to construction. Our rental company clients did not order much and we could see a weakening in the lighter construction and also in some of the slightly heavier products, which you could see also later on in Europe. Then what has taken place and we also mentioned that in the outlook, that there is some kind of a slowdown in the areas where our clients are actually exposed to consumer products. And that is of course in keeping and in line with what you have seen from other companies</p>
          <p>Moving to South America, perhaps I should mention, when we talk North America, although Mexico is sometimes Latin America and sometimes North America. Mexico is doing extremely well, is looking good. And I think we have got a good foothold in Mexico, and it's a very large economy, as, you all know.</p>
          <p>South America, very strong growth across the board; Brazil continuing to grow well in all the three business areas, IT, CT, CMT; Chile doing very well, of course it's a large mining market, but also compressors did well.</p>
          <p>Slide eight, Europe, Africa, Middle East. Here you can see a little bit of a mixed picture, as I said before, strong growth still continuing in Central Europe and Russia. And also good growth in certain areas, for instance, general industry tools and particularly MVI tools did actually quite, quite well. But we see the same continuation of a softer demand in the construction related particularly relating to housing. We see rental companies are careful in ordering. They are rather ageing their fleet than ordering at the moment. And where the slowdown is noted as is of course in the same way here to industries that are basically producing directly for consumers.</p>
          <p>Africa, Middle East, growing extremely well, all business areas. IT is not big in this area. They had a rather flattish development but CT, CMT did extremely well in Africa and Middle East. And then rounding up with the Australasia, Asia still doing well and continuing where CT and IT actually accelerated the growth and CMT kept a very high pace, but not an increase. On the other hand, if you go to Australia, a rather exceptional increase in the Australian mining industries.</p>
          <p>That takes me to slide 10, where you see the graph that I have been talking about that it's the 25th consecutive quarter of order growth and you see it's &#x2013; it shows an acceleration as I said before but it has the components that I also mentioned underpinned by the CMT growth. But also, there may be a little bit of the March-April effect, since all Easter holidays were in March, March-May have been a bit weaker and corresponding April is a little bit stronger. So perhaps one should keep that in mind as well.</p>
          <p>Then I am to the slide 11 and that's the bridge, and I am unhappy to report as many of my colleagues that currencies are still playing with us and it was about 5% in the quarter for the orders received. As I have said so far, we have taken around close to 700 million and if you ask about the remaining part of the year if rates are where they are we are looking at another 4 or 450 or something like that. Hans Ola will probably correct me in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>But what we did not see in the Q2 was a revaluation of receivables which in Q1 you'll remember out of the 400 million, 200 were revaluation of period and receivables. The rest was the rates. So there was nothing of that this time.</p>
          <p>Moving on to business areas, I don't think I'll dwell much on the slide 13, but move immediately in to 14. So, as I said, CT did well across the board, although you could see in U.S. and in some key pockets in Europe that customers particularly industrial area customers that are exposed to the consumer goods industries are slowing down a bit. But we could see some very good growth in the whole emerging market area.</p>
          <p>Margins almost the same, if you would like to have a bridge, if you then take currencies that was 1.5% negative. If you take the mix gas and process being higher than the previous quarter, as the same quarter last year, you have another 0.5. And then if you take the effect of acquisitions another 1. So in a way you should add 3% now, 19.8 is what it is. But if you try to make some kind of a reconciliation with the same quarter last year, it's almost 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>We did some acquisitions particularly interesting I find is the acquisition of Hurricane, which is adding either interesting product category to us for high booster, high pressure compressors that are used a lot in oil and gas industries. And then keeping in line with our aim of getting closer to the end user, we acquired two distributors in U.S. And if you then look at the slide 15, I think it is, you could see that the margin is faring well and although slightly lower growth, it's still a very good growth.</p>
          <p>Turning then to CMT, Construction and Mining Technique, which is continuing to deliver very good growth figures, but also in Q2, we managed to actually invoice reasonably well. You may remember we are &#x2013; we have said many times that we are not really catching up with the invoicing, but I think we did reasonably well in this period. We see that Mining all over &#x2013; Mining globally is doing extremely well and if you then try to pick out the pockets where it's less good and you will find, construction related and specifically those areas that are more related to residential construction. But there is nothing really new in that.</p>
          <p>If you ask about a Dynapac had a margin of 11.5% in the quarter. So we are moving up the Dynapac margin. It's seasonal, as you know, but the program moves on, we are opening our new factory in India in a couple of months. And the forecast we have given at the time of acquisition and that we give today, one year later is still that two to three years time we will have a margin of around 15%.</p>
          <p>Now making a bridge for CMT, currency took away 2% and acquisitions one. So if you take the running rate of the CMT ex-Dynapac, it would have been 22%. But 18.9 is what it is. We did not acquire much for CMT in the quarter, but we had a very interesting acquisition and that is a service company in Indonesia. Indonesia is a very large mining company &#x2013; sorry, mining country and we are underperforming, if you like. If you take our performance in Indonesia compared to in other places, there is a lot to be done and one way of course doing this is to increase your feet in the street when it comes to customer contacts and the after market.</p>
          <p>And looking then at slide 17, you could see a rather nice growth pattern of organic revenue growth over the years and fortunately also a nice follow of the EBIT line. Coming then over to Industrial Technique, which also had a rather good organic growth 12% up, and as I said earlier actually growing also the MVI sector and aftermarket, where we have a lower penetration than we have in CT and CMT. It's actually moving out well.</p>
          <p>We have had a few things that are cluttering the picture. We have restructured. We are closing a factory in Hemel. We are opening building, starting production in Hungary. And at the same time, we are redesigning our product flow and production in Sweden. So we are going to outsource more much more than we have had done so far. This has taken a toll on the result.</p>
          <p>If you allow or takeaway the 43 &#x2013; 46 million we have talked about as restructuring cost directly to the closing redundancy payments et cetera. We have probably missed about 1%, 1.5% on the margin, because we are not very efficient today in this whole process. Hungary is moving on, we still have some hurdles to get a good outsourcing for what we call B&amp;C components. So what we're saying is in Sweden we were basically trying to manufacture the core parts whereas more and more will be outsourced. And that has really taken a bit of a toll.</p>
          <p>So the dent you see on slide 19, that dent is not permanent, although it will not sort of point immediately upwards in two, three months but we will get there.</p>
          <p>Financials, slide 21. I don't think there is so much more to say because and I will repeat myself, I just limit myself to one repetition and that is the profit for continuing operations before tax &#x2013; sorry profit before tax PAFAS as we say is then allowing for the capital gain and the interest net actually also moving up.</p>
          <p>Coming then to the bridges, the flow through, and of course you could see comparing to the Q1, a slightly lower flow through basically because of the restructuring issues you can see in IT. If you look here, I think in Q1 the flow through in compressor was 39, and 37, 38, its similar sort of pace. I think it was 41 for CMT in Q1, so it's &#x2013; we are keeping the pace. It was of course quite positive in IT, but adding, not the restructuring 46 million, but adding the problems of about as I said 0.1, 1.5% on the EBIT for the inefficiencies.</p>
          <p>So I think the consolidation of those figures compared to Q1 are reasonably easy. I will not say too much on the balance sheet, I commented upon the cash flow and of course we are moving more, or put it this way, it's difficult to withstand a slight increase in the working capital because more and more of our sales is taking place in far away markets. So if you take CMT which is growing a lot, many customers are in Australia, Asia, South America et cetera and shipping times are long when goods arrive, you have adaptations to local safety regulations.</p>
          <p>We also still have an issue with some supply into our factories, components suppliers who can't keep pace. So it doesn't matter if 90% of the machine is ready if we have not got the pieces for the remaining 10%, we cannot ship. So therefore the whole sort of line is getting a bit longer. Then you could also say that emerging market customers are not perhaps as disciplined payers as the West European, Germans, Swedish customers are, but that's not excuses than it's an explanation. We will have to try to see how we can still keep a higher efficiency on the working capital.</p>
          <p>On the net debt to EBITDA, relating to our capital structure, of course we had a payout of a dividend in the second quarter and at the same time we have rather sizable tax payments. Coming then to the cash flow, I will not dwell on that much more, I think I have commented upon it and you may ask questions later on and then we can deal with that.</p>
          <p>And that leads me to the last slide, the outlook, trying to summarize it. We believe that the overall demand of our products and services is expected to remain at the high and good level, primarily underpinned by emerging markets as we see continued strong growth and also by a continuation of a very good demand from the mining sector.</p>
          <p>But, some of our divisions sell to customers that are exposed to consumer goods and particularly in North America and in some parts of Western Europe, you will see a slowdown, we expect.</p>
          <p>So, by that I have done my bit and now it's up to the people here in the room and those on the telephone lines.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gunnar. Before I ask the operator to repeat the procedure for putting questions. I think we will do it this time by allowing two questions from the telephone conference and then we'll go back to the audience here in Stockholm. And the reason for that is that we have a relatively sizeable crowd on the telephone lines and due to the nice Swedish summer weather not as many as usual here, so I hope you can live with that distribution of questions.</p>
          <p>So please operator can you repeat the procedures for the telephone conference, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any question already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yes, the first question comes from Joakim H&#xF6;glund from Kauphting Bank, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. I have a question regarding, well it's connected to your outlook. Anyway, we heard Sandvik, well a couple of hours ago talking about their initiatives in the continuation and of employment to meet higher demand and I wonder how you look upon that. I mean we're looking at the figures and sequential increase to the number employed. I find that you slowed down in the first quarter to now pick up again.</p>
          <p>Could you please comment about your view about new employments to meet growth and also if possible connect that to the operational leverage, is it, that way that you employed a lot of people last year that now are sort of working hard to make themselves more profitable and therefore we see a higher operational leverage in CT and CMT? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that could take an hour, Joakim, so with what lies behind. But let me just say without having the leverage in front of me, we have actually made quite some acquisitions over the last 18 months, which has added a lot of people but not much business. And if you then try to make some kind of revenue per employee et cetera, you may find it is not as good as it could be. I mean we acquired Ruifeng in China, the remaining part we didn't own, we didn't get so much business, but we got 700 Chinese.</p>
          <p>They will not be 700, they are not 700 now, they are fewer and they will not be that many in the end, but it &#x2013; that kind. And the Fluidcon I mentioned just recently, that's I think just over 200 people and not so much revenues. So I think one has to keep that in mind. What we generally are doing is, basically we don't employ more people today unless it is absolutely clear that people is a bottleneck and I'm talking now about every area except the &#x2013; what we call feet in the street, that is sales people, service engineers, technical sales people, et cetera. We don't really employ those kind of people either in the western world in Europe, west Europe or in North America, but we do in the rest of the world given the sizeable growth, and of course we are here trying to be a little bit more aggressive and I have talked about that a few times and we have been anticipating. So obviously you are right, Joakim to the extent that some of those people that we have employed during the last two years, as it takes, it varies between the function and the business, but it takes one, one and half year to really get them up to speed, and therefore it could be that some of it is kicking in, not as a straight line but more one quarter than other.</p>
          <p>What we do as you most probably have seen, we keep a track on the new feet in the street, what gross margin they generate, how long it takes to generate that gross margin, what the distribution is between the good, the medium and the less good sales people, and so on. So the adding of employees is basically in that area, unless it is a very clear bottleneck in manufacturing or assembly. But I think we can do more with what we have.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question from the telephone conference, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question comes from Johan Eliason from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, this is Johan. Congratulations to good numbers. Just a few questions, you were talking about the growth going forward. It seems to be driven by the emerging markets and mining. Could you just give us a feeling for what the share of revenues from emerging markets are right now in your order backlog? Then on CMT, you talked about the underlying margin around 22%. Is that a sustainable margin or was there any types of positive effects going into it? And what should we expect in the backlog? Do you have positive price developments that will support this margin even further? And then finally just in CMT your growth seems to be exceeding your northern peers quite significantly, are you taking market share there right now and if so, why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, question one, what is received from emerging markets year-to-date, the first six months it was 47%. And given our outlook and given what I believe I think that will of course increase as we go forward, but hopefully not because of a decrease in other places, but an even stronger increase in these places, but we will see.</p>
          <p>If I then look at the margins on CT, yes, I think their running rate, and of course when you say running rate, I mean the fact of the matter is that we have a currency headwind that's shaved off 1.5% on the EBIT. Now, it's difficult to say and I'm sure my colleague, Ronnie Leten here, is supporting that, of course you don't automatically get that back just because currency headwinds starts to slow down, that is clear. But given the actions we have in place, given the actions to improve on the acquired companies, the Greenfield, the compressed natural gas, medical air area, the ABAC, I think there is a good opportunity as we've said before to move the margin in that part of the business forward.</p>
          <p>The other issue that we &#x2013; I haven't said anything about, but I think it is clearly relevant, and that's of course the aftermarket share of the total. As the equipment continues to grow, of course the aftermarket is as a relative piece falling, and therefore you may see an adverse effect on the margin. Now in this quarter, it was basically the same relation as last. So that's why I haven't really mentioned much about it. I think the other joker here is a little bit the price increases, because I think so far we have done well in mitigating them with those various actions I mentioned. But we saw something in the end of this quarter, and that was some very sudden, very high price increases of scrap metal for instance, moving straight up the sky.</p>
          <p>And of course if you have too many of those, you cannot compensate immediately. I mean we don't treat our customers like we are being treated. If they have placed an order with us, we try to stick to both the delivery and price. But many of our suppliers say, this is the price, if you want your product you take it. So &#x2013; and I wouldn't say there is a little bit of wild west, but there has been quite some demands on price increases. So bearing in mind how that will pan out, that can take away a point or half a point or add half a point on the margin side. So I leave the answer at that.</p>
          <p>The last question was Construction and Mining Technique and growth. Well, I think it's interesting because the only message I have to my colleagues is that don't complain about growth because the market is always bigger than you believe. And I think the market opportunities in all our business areas and for sure in this CMT or mining environment, the opportunities are great. Now, I can't comment about others. I am happy with what we are doing and we will try to plod on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see if we have a question here in Stockholm then. Yeah. Actually two, it looks like, so you decide guys who starts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, it's Erik Ejerhed from ABG Sundal Collier, two questions, if I may. Firstly, what percentage of your sales for the Group or per division is exposed to what you call consumer goods, just to get an idea there. And secondly on Dynapac you gave us the margin, what is the sales level and what kind of growth rates are we seeing at the moment organically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, what part of the business is exposed to the area that we are sort of talking about as a possible weakening, is your question, right? It's not an exact science, but when we try to look at the universe of our clients I would guess and it's a bit more than a guess, but you cannot be entirely sure because you have indirect effects of that are imposed. But it would be somewhere between 10 and 15%, closer to 10, we believe than 15, but that is &#x2013; sorry that's the consumer goods exposure and construction, the residential construction rate.</p>
          <p>But also there the border line between what is really residential and what is non-residential, is not that clear and of course when we sell a lot products to rental companies, it's not exactly clear the end destination of some of it. Whether it is really a paving of roads into a housing development or if it is paving of roads around factory buildings etcetera. So &#x2013; but I think we can say that together consumer goods related, as well as construction related 10 to 15%.</p>
          <p>Then you asked about Dynapac, well, here we see that on the light product assortment, the weakening we refer to in North America and in Western Europe is mainly in that sector. But it's also to be seen in the heavier compaction as well, more than hitherto right. The growth is coming in Latin America, Africa, Middle East and Asia. But today these basically balance each other, because the history of Dynapac is of course a stronger presence in Europe, relatively less so in U.S. and weaker of course in the rest. But we are very happy with the development of our Dynapac business in Brazil, very happy in China and India. In India our factory is ready. So, today you could say they are more or less equal to each other. So, reasonably flat.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A second question here in Stockholm then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Anders Roslund from &#xD6;hman. Follow up on Dynapac. The seasonality in Dynapac means that you should have a peak in earnings and sales in the second quarter. Would that reflect also that you will have peak, both in sales and also margins in the whole Group for that division, Construction and Mining that the seasonality is such a big impact that you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if I understand your question, the seasonality in Dynapac is not going to counter balance the driving forces in mining. If &#x2013; that I don't think, because the forces in the mining, the mining demand are so strong. But we cannot speak with great credibility about ten years of experience. This is the first year and what we are of course going to do is to try to offset the usual seasonal experience by working harder in the distribution area where previous owners may not have had the same opportunities.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you also have, put it this way you have more seasonality, the more of your business is in North America and Europe. When you talk about construction works in Latin America, Middle East, many parts of Asia, you have less seasonality. So, let me give you a better answer in a couple of years on exactly how that works out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also on the margin, would then be a peak, the 11%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>11.5, if it follows the old pattern, of course it is going then to go down in the Q3 and Q4 like it always used to do. Now, the ambition is of course not to have it to go down as much, but we will have to come back to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, my second question here is about the acquisition effects you mentioned in the bridge, earnings bridge. Do you have any PPA effects which would fall away or disappear next year? So what is the dilutive effect of acquired business being &#x2013; having lower margins and what is PPA effect, if you have such.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to show my ignorance, I am not exactly sure what PPA is, but let me answer the question like this, that one thing is acquisition effect, when we didn't have the business, the same period last year, that's one. And that's when you have it in the bridge. The other acquisition effect is of course, if we buy a company take ABAC or CNG business or whatever or Dynapac. Of course, as has happened in most cases, we buy companies that are far from our profitability, in any case. It takes two to three years to move them up. So even if the bridge is not showing anything, there still is a sizable part of the business, that is not performing to average. So that's &#x2013; so if you take ABAC, they were in queue till last year. I think they came in, in April, early April, didn't they?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yeah...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, so that is in, but you have a constant sort of diluting of the result until we feel either we have reached &#x2013; as far as we can reach or and in any case, as in the ABAC case we have said at least 15%, but hopefully close to our average and in Dynapac we have said 15.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I try to follow up on the PPA, purchase price adjustments, I gather you are referring to, when we look in the next couple of quarters, I anticipate that what you mean, is there are going to be sizeable effects of the then &#x2013; the acquired companies a year ago from that. And not in a dramatic way I'd say first of all, of the Dynapac we haven't made and ABAC we haven't made any huge acquisitions as you know. So to find those example &#x2013; those small effects within Compressor Technique and CMT will be very difficult to see them if you see what I mean. Then we go back to the telephone conference please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>You have now a question from Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Couple of questions regarding the Industrial Technique. Could you please comment a bit more about the ongoing restructuring and the sort of less efficiency than you hoped for, for how long that will go on and maybe describe the actual actions taken? And also a question to Hans Ola. Very, very hard to answer probably, but the eliminations, the corporate hedges were rather limited this quarter. Is there a possibility to give any guidance whatsoever for us in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah I think I touched upon this a little while ago but let me then say again. I mean, we have the direct costs relating to redundancy payments and closing down etcetera of the factory. But when you do that, during the period, and of course long before that takes place, you have to start to build up stock, you have to build up goods in &#x2013; or work in progress, both in Sweden and in the new factory that's being built in Hungary. You have to train people to become as efficient or hopefully even more efficient in Hungary than in UK.</p>
          <p>You &#x2013; as I said, also, we are changing a little bit the production mix in our large factory here in Sweden and moving over more to purchase components that we don't deem to be the core components. Now doing that, you have to work out some suppliers, you have to get reliability and quality of those. All this put together is putting quite a strain on the organization so &#x2013; but in book keeping terms is adjustments, gross margin and then the adjusted gross margin. There you have a difference of a couple of points that shouldn't be there. And that's what is showing up here. How long will it take? I think that when spring comes, we should not have too much to complain about. Then it may be other things but I think that we need this part of the autumn to gradually improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; you referred to on the operating profit eliminations as you said, which is a combination of many things, costs, corporate costs in general, but also as you alluded to when we do currency hedges nowadays it is only on a Group level, it's not in the business area results. So in the last two quarters, Q1 and Q2, we've had about 100 million positive in each of these hedges. That explains why the eliminations line, or the common Group functions line is less negative than normal, if I put it that way.</p>
          <p>This effect on the profit is difficult to pinpoint very exact per quarter, since the corporate costs are not only regular salaries but many different items related to option plans and valuations of this and so on. But to have a go at it, let's say that a good guess is somewhere between a 100 and 150 negative in a run rate per quarter, I would say. That's the best guess at least.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Ben Maslen from Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon everybody. Just back on Industrial Technique, it sounds like you're changing the business model a bit. Are you moving more to an outsourcing, more of an aftermarket model? Is the aim of that to improve the margin over the longer term or just to reduce the cyclicality if things get a little bit tougher? That's the first one. And then secondly, your cash flow is normally stronger in the second half of the year. Do you have any plans to use your buyback? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I then start with the question on changing business model. Not really in a way. We do move, of course, in order to try to lower the overall costs by moving away from the Western European to the Central Europe. But we also, which we haven't talked about, move gradually more business to Asia, both China and particularly in Japan where we have two companies with a manufacturing footprint. Fuji we bought some years ago and KTS we bought a couple a quarter ago. And there we will do more at substantially lower costs actually than we have in Sweden. And therefore, we also, by taking over some of the products in the move from UK to Hungary, by taking over some of the products in Sweden, we are then moving away, or outsourcing some of the less complicated, and doing more of the core components in house. It's not really a change of business model, I think it's a rather a refinement of where we are. Then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gunnar, also we could just remind a little bit what is written on the structure changes in IT there in the report. That these particular actions that have been taken is related to the pneumatic tool, the air tool manufacturing, and as you know, we've been quite successful growing electrical tools, sophisticated electrical tools for many years. And that has been behind the very strong development of Industrial Technique in many ways. So it is again, just to repeat what Gunnar says, it's not the full business model change in that sense for the Industrial Technique business area. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your question was about the buybacks right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what are your plans around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Now we are in a position to be able to do something, and of course we have said, and continued to say that, if the cash flow of the business, cash generation, if acquisitions, planned or believed to take place will happen, then of course you can use the buyback mandate as some kind of a regulating factor. If nothing happens in terms of acquisitions and other, let's say, cash generating issues I think that you will see certain activities as we go on during the autumn.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, and congratulations on an exemplary set of numbers. I have a few questions, please, and one question was, if you could say a little bit about, please, the growth in aftermarket in the different areas. And the percentage of sales represented by aftermarkets now? And secondly you talked about customer finance, and I wondered what you were doing in terms of customer finance. And thirdly, I just wanted to say, when you talk about doing share buybacks in the autumn, if your cash flow holds up and your acquisition opportunities aren't too enormous. Given that the B shares are in the 80s and you earned just over 2 kroner in the last quarter, and you would find it virtually impossible to buy a company as good as your own on your current price/earnings multiple. Should you not be stepping up the pace of share buybacks and exploiting the opportunity right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. And could I just ask one more question? Were there any exceptional lumps of orders in the Q2 '07 quarter that would have affected the base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with the last question, I don't remember everything, but I do remember that we had some large gas and process order in Asia in the first quarter, that was I believe last year, yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the aftermarket, it's growing well in its own right, and sometimes this relation of aftermarket to total sales may be interesting if you have a steady run rate of equipment but when equipment goes up and down, of course the other one follows. But if you take CMT, the aftermarket grew in the quarter I think around 35%. That's a combination of parts and services. IT grew well, I think also in the area of &#x2013; but now I have to kept under steered by Hans Ola, I think it's around 25, and the compressor around 12-15%, if I remember correctly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you have the percentage of sales?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Compressor Technique, it's 26% of sales. The CMT, if you take away consumables, it would probably be around similar, perhaps 30. And adding then consumables, the drill bits, drill steel etcetera, it's coming up to 45ish or so. On Industrial Technique, it is I think 22-25% or something like that, if you add the services and the parts. But I may be wrong in one or two points. But...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But basically I think that's what we have today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, and the question on &#x2013; the question on customer finance and the share buy back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the customer finance, we have commented for the last year that it's starting to become a factor in the balance sheet. We do it obviously with intention to capture more sales of primarily CMT and CT equipment. And customers very often favor, more and more I should say, even in our industry, to buy and secure, let's say, financing, service, maintenance and equipment purchase in one go. And we think this is a strength for us in keeping and increasing market shares in the market. So that's the basic underlying reason, of course.</p>
          <p>From the balance sheet point of view, we have a portfolio that is in the region of SEK 3.5 billion, so it's not a huge factor. It's not to be compared with let's say Scania or Volvo's share of customer financing. But of course, it's still on the increase, and we are very happy with the development. It means, of course, that our return on capital employed as a Group is slightly diluted compared to the pure industrial business, if you like. But as you said, we have it with the full intention and belief that we are capturing good equipment sales by offering this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just ask, are you having to offer them a subsidized finance rate? And how do you make sure the credit's what you want?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The credit...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The credit quality, I mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The credit risk point of view is very thorough. We have very strong procedures for that process internally, and obviously we believe strongly that behind this strategy lies the fact that we know our customers better than any financing institute that is external. It also rests on the fact that any difficulties on part of the customer will be seen, and sort of, how should I say, discovered by us that have a constant contact with customers much quicker than any external financing.</p>
          <p>So we will suffer some credit losses over years, that's for sure, but so far and in our projections, we don't see that as any alarming factor at all. When it comes to the financing costs, no, we see this as an added feature and not as something that we can throw in at &#x2013; without cost, so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, great. Sorry and the question on the buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think without commenting in detail, I think that we continue to have our view that about two-thirds of the growth should be organic and one-third should come from acquisitions. And we are constantly working on targets to acquire companies across all divisions. I think there is, of course, a great degree of uncertainty. You work with a lot of projects and some or few may happen, but you don't know when. So I think that is a joker when it comes to deciding on timing and amounts of buyback. So I think we will have to leave it at that.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, now we have a question here in Stockholm. We will start with Mats.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mats Liss, Swedbank. Just a couple of questions here. First regarding Construction and Mining Technique. I mean the growth is impressive here in the second quarter but should we see it as upwards divisional trend or is it more like a Q1, Q2 event? And secondly, about lead times here, how much of this will you be able to deliver in 2008? And finally about Compressor Technique I mean, it was a while back when we saw the CT margin below 20%, and I was just wondering if there are any bottlenecks worth mentioned in CT currently? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I mean I think one has to show some humility and say we are pretty happy if we can continue with these growth rates in CMT. Whether they have peaked or will escalate, I think it's difficult to say. The underlying demand, of course, is the issue and I can only say as we have done and like now many others say, this is driven today very much by China, particularly, but also India. And as long as they pull the cart I think you will see some good opportunities in the mining business side. But to say whether this is as good as it gets, or if it can get a bit better or a bit, I think we'll &#x2013; let's see in October when we meet. We are not &#x2013; I don't think we lose that much business because we cannot deliver. I think that our competitors in general have similar situations. We may lose orders because we cannot deliver, they will do so. I don't think we are disadvantaged. I think we have managed to ramp up our capacity particularly in Sweden and in Texas in Garland pretty well. But, again, we have a model with a lot of outsourcing which means that not always do our sub-suppliers keep pace, and therefore we have this delay and accumulation of goods in transit or work in progress.</p>
          <p>The other question was Compressor Technique and the question of bottlenecks. Well this is perhaps not so much on the order intake, but on the invoicing side, I think we still can get more efficient in certain divisions in Compressor Technique when it comes to handle this flow through from order to final delivery. I think we have made quite a few changes, we have started factories outside, we are redistributing sourcing and purchasing of components and so on. So I think it's &#x2013; we can probably do a bit more but I cannot say. Except for the gas and process, which is today a sizeable part of CT, their delivery times are 18 to 24 months, and there we are clearly losing orders because we cannot deliver that's without any doubt.</p>
          <p>Was that all you had on Compressor, Mats? Or did you have anything...?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that's true. How much? Well generally our order book in CMT or for mining equipment doesn't extend that far. I think if you take just the order book today you would probably have orders for the rest of the year. Now, not all would be delivered this year because some of it are larger drill rigs that will be delivered mid 2/09 or even later 2/09. So I &#x2013; we have a rather constant flow, so I don't really look all that much how much of the order book is going to be delivered before Christmas and how much is after because it's a rather constant flow. But some of it is mid next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take a rough estimate that the order book size in relation to equipment sales, because aftermarket by definition doesn't have an order book, you come somewhere in the region of six months in CMT. But there are some divisions that are longer than that as Gunnar said, late 2/09 deliveries is perfectly doable there. But the average is somewhere there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you compare for all our three business areas, if you take orders at hand today compared to the same period last year, they have all increased substantially, but that's also evident if you track the orders received and see what we have been invoicing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we had another question here in Stockholm, here, first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Johan Trocme, Nordea Markets. Two questions. First of all on customer finance. If there is a lending volume around 3.5 billion, is it fair to assume that the net debt associated with that business is at least above 3 billion?</p>
          <p>And have you had any &#x2013; great, right. And have you had any heads up from the rating institutes in terms of being able to disregard that net debt from the corporate net debt of the Group? Both in terms of assigning your credit rating, and in terms of where you see your own indebtedness, not least when reviewing your capital structure on an ongoing basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have frequent discussions with &#x2013; or dialog with the rating agencies. And I think my comment earlier summarizes fairly well. They are fully aware of our strategy, they are fully aware of the size of that part, and they obviously understand and have the view that should it become much bigger, they will have to separate and assign different views on from a credit rating point of view on that part of the balance sheet or that part of the debt, and the other debts so to speak. But again I think we will have to come back when it starts to become a more &#x2013; a bigger portion of it. But they are fully aware, and of course that means that in their rating discussions and assessments they take it into account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But from your own point of view, 3 billion of the corporate debt that you have is not really Atlas Copco's corporate debt in a traditional sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's a matter of definition, if you want to exclude everything, but I &#x2013; we certainly see your point. But as I said, we have so far stopped short of making the full separation of the two portions of the balance sheet and the income statement. I wouldn't exclude that that may be different as we move forward, but probably not in the next couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a second question. You mentioned some component price inflation. What particular component areas have you seen those types of developments which stand out, looking at your everyday business? Are we talking steel plate or parts of compressor elements or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said earlier, the one that really stands out is the scrap metal. But again we buy relatively pure steel and pure raw material. We buy normally components that have been value added once or twice before they reach us.</p>

      <speaker id="3">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I was just wondering if you could give us a few words about the outlook, particularly at IT where I certainly am beginning to feel that the automotive sector's going to turn down in the Western world. And obviously you're doing well in Asia. How sustainable is your Asia business areas? Is this a one-off boom or do you see your better level of business there continuing?</p>
          <p>And perhaps a few words about South America. Is this mainly a mining market for you today? Or is there is a risk of boom-bust conditions there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Taking the outlook in automotive, I think the &#x2013; as I said earlier, actually, the business held up reasonably well in U.S. and quite good in Europe. And what you see is of course a shift from west to east, you see that in Europe. And if you look at the projected car production in Central Europe and Russia, it's looking pretty good in terms of growth rates. And the same, of course, if you look at the Asian markets. And in U.S. you will see, that to a larger extent the Asian transplants do better than the local American suppliers.</p>
          <p>Now we are trying and spending a lot of time and money on building our platform stronger in Asia, because by tradition we have grown well in Europe and the North American car market. Also, the Asian companies use to a lesser degree the sophisticated electric tools and the more kind of air tools.</p>
          <p>So I think we have a great potential and we see also in the general industry quite some very good growth figures in Asia. India is another place that is looking very good. So I am not too pessimistic over time at all on the Industrial Technique's ability to grow away from, let's say, emphasis in North America and Europe. So I think that looks okay. I think it's more our ability to get the feet in the street and get the business going. We have done very well with the Tier 1 suppliers in Asia lately which we didn't do before. So I think there are good opportunities.</p>
          <p>As I speak, I did -- no, I saw here, you talked about the bust and boom in Latin America, right. I think, yes, if you look particularly at Chile and Peru, these are the two mining markets in addition to Brazil. Then the rest is a little bit of everything. But Brazil is a very diversified industrial market today where CT, IT, not only manufacturing &#x2013; car manufacturing, but there is also, as you know, aircraft manufacturing and the development of quite a good base industry. So Brazil is very widely spread, and there the oil and gas &#x2013; I believe the oil and gas investment's coming after the enormous finds of oil. It will be pretty interesting. So, yes, Chile and Peru are very much mining, otherwise I think it's more diversified.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have I think two more questions, one more question on the telephone conference. We'll take that final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The final question come from Nico Dil, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Nico Dil from JP Morgan. Just a quick question on the Industrial Technique division. I think you highlighted about 1.5% effect on the negative side because of efficiency losses etc. I was wondering how long it will take you to recover from that?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, obviously you're taking some measures to improve the business overall. How long will that take and what sort of improvements do you see on the longer term here? Where do you think the margin can go to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the inefficiencies in IT, as I said earlier, we expect that by spring they will be &#x2013; we will not talk about those. I think that by then we should have done the transformation and the outsourcing, etc.</p>
          <p>I am not sure I understood. Was your next question related to IT or to the company as a whole??</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's to IT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To IT. It doesn't make it easier to answer but I thought. Well, you know, sometimes I think I sound like a parrot, but our interest is not necessarily to improve our margins in any of our businesses today, if that is to the detriment of volume, because I think we have good margins. We have relatively efficient operations. So the way of adding value is of course rather growing well than perhaps add up another 0.5 percentage point of margin and not grow that much. But if we can't help ourselves to both grow and add margins I'm not going to be unhappy.</p>
          <p>But I think you have to &#x2013; when you take Industrial Technique, one point that makes life not always easy for Mats Rahmstr&#xF6;m who now is our new president in this area, that many of our major competitors in this area, Cooper Stanley for instance, IR as well, are basically having dollars as a cost of goods currency. So besides our complaint, when we talk about the translation and transaction exposure to our business, there is also a dynamic effect that they may be happy where they are, benefiting from a lower cost of goods because of their dollar. So I cannot tell them how to act, but if they chose rather to forsake price increases and fight on volume, of course it presents a different picture. So if we can grow volume well and keep 20% to 21% margins I am very happy.</p>
