          <p>Welcome to the BHP Billiton Interim Results Investor and Analyst Teleconference. My name is Lloyd and I'll be the operator for today's call. For the duration of the call, you'll be on listen-only. However, at the end of the presentation, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I am now handing you over to our host of today's briefing, BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer, Marius Kloppers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I have with me Graham Kerr, our CFO. My apologies to all of you that neither of us are in London, as is the custom for us. Graham and I decided to do this Investor Tour together, since it's his first one. But my apologies once again.</p>
          <p>I know that our results have been out for a couple of hours so I'm only going to make a few opening comments. I'm very pleased that we have delivered a robust result for the December half year, despite significant volatility. The strong and predictable performance for us is a vindication of our longstanding strategy as the more diversified company and in particular, and then I'll make some notes in a minute, our strategy of investing throughout the cycle. But let me make a few comments about the financial results first.</p>
          <p>The underlying EBITDA, up by 8% to $18.7 billion. Underlying EBIT up by 6% to $15.7 billion. Attributable profit at $9.9 billion and I should note the impact of functional currency in the corresponding period, that gave us a very low tax rate in the corresponding period, and then operating cash flow of $12.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Particularly pleasing has been the performance of one of our core businesses, the Western Australian iron ore business. We're &#x2013; our invest through the cycle where many of the investments that delivered tonnages in the half were made at the depth of the global financial crisis, is really a reaffirmation for us of our invest through the cycle philosophy. And similarly we had a record half year production at New South Wales Energy Coal.</p>
          <p>We noted in our presentation this morning a number of areas which will give us upside in the short to medium term, but where our assets are running below capacity, giving us latent capacity, but at the same time, also impacting our unit costs through the non-dilution of fixed costs. And we particularly noted grade and industrial action at Escondida, wet weather and some industrial action in Queensland and then, obviously, following the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, getting to work on our Mad Dog and Atlantis assets. I should note that these restraints are temporary and we have every anticipation of this being a source of large momentum for us going forward.</p>
          <p>However, I do need to note that if we look at our portfolio, the smaller businesses, the more processing-centered businesses, have suffered tremendous margin compression over the last couple of years. And for us, I wanted to note two specific issues. One, in line with our strategy of not running anything that is cash negative, taking definitive action there. And secondly, not investing incremental capital in those businesses so challenged.</p>
          <p>I also want to note that the longstanding rationalization of our portfolio in pursuit of a simpler organization and more scalable organization, more highly focused on the big assets in our portfolio and the expandable asset in our portfolio, continues with announcements in Guinea, Chidliak Diamonds, the other diamonds review and the divestment of Richards Bay Minerals. And that process is part of the strategy in order to concentrate our focus on those assets that are expandable and that will take the majority of our investment capital.</p>
          <p>I thought that I would, in closing, before I take questions, make four points and draw them out. One, predictable performance, secondly, determined action where we've taken action where we've had some headwinds, thirdly, the latent capacity that exists in a number of high margin businesses and, lastly, I wanted to particularly note on our capital investment, I wanted to reiterate our capital priorities of maintaining the dividend, maintaining the balance sheet at a strong A and then, obviously, on the cash flows that result after those two allocations, to live within our means.</p>
          <p>And this is particularly &#x2013; the latter is particularly relevant as we have this very rich slate of development options and over the next 12 months to 24 months, we are going to have to take a number of large decisions on how we sequence what we do, what we don't invest in and so on. So, the combination of these four particular points means for us that the outlook in the short term for our business is compelling and we are even more optimistic in the long run.</p>
          <p>So with those opening statements, if we can have the first question on the telephone, please?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our first question today, gentlemen, is from the line of Jansen, Heath, from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, morning, Marius, it's Heath Jansen here from Citi. Just two questions. One, first of all, on your cash flow to CapEx. I mean, how practical is that going to be going forward to really match those CapEx requirements to cash flows? I mean, once you start all of these large projects, it's going to be difficult to switch them on. And I guess, if we do see some sort of downturn, would you be looking to ratchet back that CapEx profile? I guess you can do it in things like Petrohawk, but that may be more difficult with some of your other industrial assets.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, you had some one-off gains coming through in the oil business with derivatives on Petrohawk and also in Trinidad and Tobago. I was wondering, are they going to be ongoing or is those derivative positions now being closed out? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Heath, the second one first. In terms of the business we inherited from Petrohawk, completely once-off event. In terms of the embedded derivative, which IFRS forces us to revalue from time to time, we essentially have a sales contract that's got a basket of embedded derivatives in it, from Henry Hub to ammonia and so and so on. I think Mike's stated that he's never seen that adjustment on a period-by-period basis be over $100 million, but up and downwards adjustment there is likely to reoccur. So the first one, not, second one, yes. And may obviously will be up or down, depending on where the gas price moves.</p>
          <p>The first part of your question is probably the core issue that occupies a lot of our thought, Heath. And, basically, this is how we think about it, that we forecast on a rolling basis what our P50 cash flow estimates are, and that changes, obviously, over time. You do not want your commitments to &#x2013; not precisely every year, but in aggregate, put you in a position where something that you have committed to, which you are executing, that you've got to impact that at all.</p>
          <p>And you are far better off saying as you make your forecast, I'm going to try and marginalize as much as possible, I may not take this decision, a given decision, until we are a couple of years down the line. But it is true that those &#x2013; as Mike Yeager calls them, the big four, is sort of after you've pushed the button on any given stage, is in the high strategic context and lower flexibility to act, but, I should stress, only at the point where you've made the commitment on a specific stage.</p>
          <p>We do think that the shale gas business, which has got a relatively short cycle time from investment to cash flow, is a little bit of a different nature. The flexibility that that provides, together with some of the other supplemental projects and our basic approach to try and modularize &#x2013; wherever we can make two decisions instead of one, we try and make two decisions. But I think on balance, what has resulted in the past is we've looked at this forward projection is that when times have turned out to be better than our P50 estimate, we can't really accelerate the project flow, and we have to do a buyback. When times are worse, you can slow down the forward book, Heath. And that's sort of how we look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marius.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question today, gentlemen, is from the line of Jason Fairclough from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Marius. Good morning, Graham. Just a couple of quick questions for you on CapEx, if that's okay. First, just in your outlook statement, once again, you're highlighting that you think demand growth for steelmaking raw materials is set to decelerate. And I'm just trying to square that with one of your big flag fall investments, which of course, is the Outer Harbor. It just feels like $5 billion or $10 billion, or whatever this is going to be, is a very big chunk of capital to commit to a commodity where you're less than convinced by the outlook.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, on the CapEx. It looks like you're dialing this back a little bit, and maybe if you could just speak to this a little bit in terms of, is this because of a lack of project managers or a lack of willingness in the business to actually commit the capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jason. I think that -- I struggled with the sentence on the steel demand growth. What it means to say is that the rate of growth is decreasing. So, roughly speaking, from memory, in iron ore over the last 10 years, you had about 10% annual growth. And going forward, I think, our forecast is unchanged from what we said before, which is sort of the 4% level.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the total size is a much larger market, so the number of tons that have got to be added in the market every year is still a growing &#x2013; is a much larger number than 10% was of the equivalent market before. But it is a deceleration of the percentage growth and that's what it means to say. I do think that it's worthwhile noting, as we've said over so many years, we do distinguish between different phases of industrialization and we do see the iron ore business being &#x2013; as operating at a different GDP range than the others.</p>
          <p>Just to then put the third piece of information on there, unchanged forecast of about 1 billion tons, 1.1 billion tons of steel in China by 2025. The industrial graph Mike Henry showed before and it's really that, that drives our iron ore demand model. No changes on that.</p>
          <p>CapEx; we've often said &#x2013; I mean, these are not my words, but probably Alex's words, but they still echo in the hallway. We have to live within our means and it's clear that if you look at the varying quarters and particularly at the metallurgical business performance, with where we've got the interplay between cost pressures and revenue and particularly, currencies as well, that CapEx estimates, forward CapEx estimates over the last six to nine months would have come down. And I'm talking about the five-year horizon which is sort of the horizon that you've got to take into account for your rolling decision making. And for every cause, there is an effect and what we've tried to communicate today is how we think about that effect, Jason.</p>
          <p>What is incredibly important to us is that people distinguish between having a suite of options and then the decision to trigger any given option, which probably brings me to the third part of your question which is what holds you back.</p>
          <p>I think sort of the four overlapping nodes, that you need sort of like a Venn diagram in order to make a decision. You've got to have the resource. We mostly have that for the things we're looking at, obviously. You've got to have all of your approvals. We've made very, very good progress on our core things. You've got to have the teams and you've got to have the money.</p>
          <p>Now, I think that, given that we've got these five minerals hubs, the train of project thinking that surrounds all of them, given the permit &#x2013; progress that we've sort of on an ongoing basis being reviewing with the market and where the market is well-briefed. Given the resource base which we've disclosed in our quarterly production statements, I think it's fair to say that the constraining forward view that will limit how much you can do is CapEx or available cash flow.</p>
          <p>I mean, I don't want to put a number to it but I guess, if that cash flow requirement was relaxed, we'd probably have options to the value of twice what that number is at the moment. So that's sort of how we think about it, Jason. I don't know if that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that helps a lot. Could I just follow-up if you don't mind, Marius. If we go back sort of the invention of the diversified miner. The idea was that the diversified miner could carry more debt, because of the diversification of cash flows, because the cash flows were a lot less volatile, and that, that higher debt load would drive shareholder returns on the one hand, but on the other hand, it would give you the flexibility to invest when others couldn't. And if I look at your balance sheet, to me, it just doesn't feel like cash flow and availability of money should be a constraint on your growth. But I'd love you to convince me otherwise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can comment about that in a few ways. When I became CEO, I will ask Paul Anderson, "How do you think about this?" And Paul said, "Marius, you've got to pay a healthy dividend, because it's a thing that always disciplines you." And in our case, we pay just over $6 billion a year, our total dividend in full. Beyond that, it's an art, not a science, but I think the planning parameter that we always use is that you've got to live within your means from an organic growth perspective and if there is capacity left in the balance sheet, well, that's used to catch the train in the rare event that the train comes past. So that's best more or less how we think about that, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So can I paraphrase you there? So you're saying that the balance sheet is only for use in M&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, M&amp;A &#x2013; well, to quote another predecessor, M&amp;A is always an opportunistic thing. So I can plan on my P50 CapEx. I can high grade my portfolio and I can, over time, not perfectly in every year, live within my means. What that means is that from time to time, there will be balance sheet capacity available if an opportunity comes along. Now, in no way do I want to create the impression that there is a reserving of capacity here for -- in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Our commitments are substantial. We're going to have to cut the cloth carefully as we look at prioritization. And the next two years, in particular, are crucial to go back to Heath's point, as we sort of firm up commitments and those things. What we did want to convey today, though, is just talk about Alex's live within his &#x2013; live within means, which comes from global financial crisis and which is sort of fairly embedded in our thinking, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Appreciate your time, Marius. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we can have the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question, gentlemen, is from the line of Caroline Learmonth from Absa Capital. Please go ahead, Caroline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First question, in the petroleum business, you talk about an increasing focus on high return liquids-rich shale. Given the increased focus in that particular area and given well-publicized low gas prices in North America, is there an impact going forwards onto the numbers you put forward in November in your petroleum presentation in terms of forecast production rates coming out of onshore U.S. shale and forecast CapEx spend?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is in terms of your portfolio management, can you explain in the medium long-term where the aluminium business sits in terms of priority? And then just finally, and just picking up on some of the M&amp;A comments that were made. What is the likelihood in the current environment, and given the Petrohawk acquisition4 of any further acquisitions in the short term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Caroline. When we put out the Petrohawk acquisition, we put forward a CapEx schedule. And I was <mark type="ph" /> at times (19:53) to point out at the time that previous snapshots of capital that we'd put out for the rest of the business and the Petrohawk CapEx shouldn't be additive. The way I described it to the market at the time is that one plus one doesn't always equal two. And I think it's fairly clear from the comments that we've made over the course of the morning, so far that as we go through our next five-year planning process, that process of prioritization and high grading the portfolio is taking place.</p>
          <p>Now, it's got two dimensions when it comes to petroleum. One is sort of within petroleum. And I'll say a few words about how capital is being allocated from the drier parts of the onshore portfolio to the wetter parts. And then secondly, obviously, in the totality of our businesses. And by the comments that I've outlined to Jason and to Heath before, I think it's clear that there is a changed outlook for overall CapEx. So the overall picture is going to be moderated. We're not ready today to give a five-year snapshot going forward, because the picture is evolving.</p>
          <p>And then if I look at the petroleum business, in aggregate, I mean, within that overall picture of some moderation to match the cash flow generation, I think Mike is basically going to try and build his organization in the dry gas areas, but effectively moderate the number of drill rigs in those areas quite considerably from the plans as presented. Now, there will some offsetting pickup in the -particularly, the Black Hawk and Redhawk and Permian.</p>
          <p>Where the sum of the two come out is probably, I don't want to put a number to that, but probably &#x2013; is an evolving number, but probably, somewhat less in the same way that the overall CapEx is being moderated somehow. So, basically, what you're seeing is both within the petroleum business and in the portfolio as a whole, that ongoing reprioritization as facts unfold. So I don't know if that helps. That's probably as far as I can go today.</p>
          <p>On aluminium, there's probably what we've done, what we would have liked to do different, if we have the time all over again, how we view the business and then how we go forwards. So let me make a few comments about all of those aspects for the sake of completeness.</p>
          <p>We've said in years past that aluminium probably has taken a turn downwards in terms of profitability, not only on a cyclical basis, but on a structural basis. And the reason for that is that you basically had capital compression of refineries and smelters in China, which basically means that the amount of CapEx that you have to put in, in the Western world for un-bauxite refineries and then the smelter is a higher number than the Chinese can build those facilities for.</p>
          <p>That has structurally moved the rent in the entire industry down. And what we've said is that as developers, that business is B- prioritized for capital. Now ideally, if we have had full insight of this four or five years ago, I think we probably would have added not only little capital in our smelting business, but we probably would have added even less capital in our refining business as well. We first put it together in smelting a number of years ago, but I think refining is essentially in that same space.</p>
          <p>Short term, the industry loses money over much of the cost curve. And should we have any asset in our aluminium business that is cash negative, in line with our longstanding policy of not running assets that don't make a cash contribution, we will rationalize that, in the same way that we've, in the past weeks, rationalized production in our nickel and in our manganese businesses. Same rules apply to them.</p>
          <p>Going out further and thinking about any portfolio moves, I think that our priorities are centered around the things that we've announced already on diamonds and titanium. The choice to get out of a product line is a very large one. We take those choices with great difficulty, because it means that you can never enter them again. So already for us, making the choice to exit two complete product lines in diamonds and titanium constitutes a fairly sizeable choice.</p>
          <p>Last point on M&amp;A. M&amp;A is an unpredictable thing. Or to use my immediate predecessor's words, it's an opportunistic thing. Certainly, there are times when the various price movements in various commodities cause assets, from time to time, being available in the market at lower than their through the cycle average replacement cost. Should they be of a Tier 1 nature, we will have a close look. But certainly, in our case, it's not a question about size for size sake or any other motives.</p>
          <p>It's purely a question of if assets fit in box and they are &#x2013; they happen to be cheaper than their through the cycle replacement costs, that would be attractive to us. But it's on a completely opportunistic basis. So I hope that, that helps, Caroline. And I hope I've captured all of your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question, gentlemen, is from the line of James Gurry from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marius and Graham. I just want to go over, can you confirm just from what your public statements have been, when you think to approve Olympic Dam, Jansen and the Outer Harbour? It seems that all these projects are pretty much due in 2012. And just reading on from that, you've got $27 billion of CapEx projects in execution now. So, what do you think that number might look like or what might the percentage increase be by the end of this calendar year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, James, the amount of capital that is not yet productive relative to the market capitalization and the cash flow of the organization is something that Graham, myself, and the rest of the team watch extremely closely. Of course, there are different types of risks and different lead times on those different projects.</p>
          <p>For example, I think the Jansen project may have a longer end-to-end lead time than, for example, the Olympic Dam one and the &#x2013; sorry, than the Outer Harbour one. And the Outer Harbour, in turn, is different from some of the shale gas investments where revenue &#x2013; investment to revenue is very quick. So, I don't want to give any forecast today about what the amount is in execution at year-end. And yes, our baseline is to consider all three of those projects. Some of them pretty close to the end of the calendar year during this year. Whether all of them get approved on the first go is obviously still a moot point. And nothing is approved until it's approved.</p>
          <p>But the point I want to emphasize is that, is the one that Heath asked in his first question. Will you &#x2013; how keenly attuned are you to not overcommitting the company on capital that is difficult to slow down once you've committed? And I think you have added the second dimension of consideration that gets a considerable amount of airtime inside the company, which is, how much capital is there that is not yet producing a revenue? But I don't want to give a forecast today, not having completed that five-year plan at this time, James.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Marius and Graham. I had two questions, please, on the shale gas business and the acquisition. First on the share gas industry, we're seeing a number of participants and producers either cutting volumes or deciding to exit. Just curious to know what your expectations are on how this industry could restructure itself going forward?</p>
          <p>My second question has got to do with accounting a bit more. Is there a risk that we could see, a goodwill write-down on the acquisition of Petrohawk, given the accounting terms you will have to market? And maybe just lastly on that, I understand that it's difficult to give a five-year view on the CapEx, but just for the next two years, could you maybe confirm the CapEx at Petrohawk? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sylvain, the shale gas industry, I think &#x2013; at the moment, what's happening is those that have more liquids-rich acreage in their portfolios are trying to refocus towards that. That's obviously not possible for all of the players. But we certainly seen what's happened to share prices of some of the players in the Bakken and so on and so on.</p>
          <p>My anticipation is that much of the growth story, where you've had a number of entrepreneurs which have said growth rates of multiples of tens of percentages and a CapEx profile to match, that it'll be increasingly difficult over the next 12 months for those smaller companies to sell that story and as I said, not everybody will be able to say, "Look, we'll reprioritize CapEx."</p>
          <p>I don't know if there's a natural consolidator of the shale gas industry, just given the industry structure. From our perspective, we probably, with the addition of the four work areas in the two acquisitions that we've done, we probably feel that we've got a fairly full plate. Or as I've put it, there's sort of four different kinds of food on the table. We may add a little bit of one or the other but it's not likely that we add something completely different at this point in time. We're working very hard to digest what &#x2013; to eat and digest what we've got on the plate.</p>
          <p>Accounting, 12 months from acquisition to allocate acquisition price to the various assets. That's the normal rule. Clearly, the fortunes of liquids versus gas, both from a pricing but also from a technology development point of view, is shifting. I think that from memory, our numbers that we put out had about 50/50 revenue liquids to gas for 2015. And clearly, that's the direction that the market is pushing this in.</p>
          <p>I should also note that as we made the acquisition, we noted that our cost of capital is different from some of the companies, exploration companies, really, that own this material. So I wouldn't say that there's no risk. Who knows how situations develop, but those are sort of the parameters that guide us here.</p>
          <p>Incidentally, and probably a bigger issue for the industry as a whole and also for us, is where the structural rent capacity in the aluminium and nickel business is going. And, clearly, you've seen no charge from us in this half, but it's clearly as our view about a continued long-term margin suppression in those businesses continued to build, that's something that we've got to keep our eye on, just for noting, Sylvain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And on the CapEx for the next two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't given any new guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just, for the others on the call, just say some of the reasons why not. 18 months ago, shareholders asked us, do you have growth and do you have options? And we slated to put a five-year snapshot of what we anticipated at that point in time out. But CapEx is an allocation job for every day.</p>
          <p>And particularly as cash flows change, what you actually end up choosing changes. I don't know whether we spend more time reconciling to previous snapshots if we put out such a snapshot, or whether we really get the benefit of people understanding our business better. I think from our perspective, better guidance is probably the one-year guidance and we've given the $20 billion CapEx and exploration budget for this year, Graham, from memory, or reaffirmed that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, reaffirmed $20 billion. We spent about $10 billion for the first half. And the $20 billion includes the CapEx and exploration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's how we think. We're probably unlikely to put out a five-year snapshot &#x2013; forward snapshot any time soon. The way we'd like our investors to think about it is more in terms of our historical cash flow priorities, invest in the business, keep the dividend, keep the single A, live within your means.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question, Marius, is from the line of Andrew Keen from HSBC. Please go ahead, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marius, good morning. Thank you for taking so many questions on CapEx and shale gas. And in fact, I'm going to ask you just one more, not necessarily to get you to look at the revision in the previous guidance. But actually just as a matter of principle, I mean, even in the last half, your CapEx was running at roughly double your EBITDA and you're looking at really overspending and still putting cash into this business on a net basis for a number of years.</p>
          <p>My question is, as a matter of principle, why don't you make the shale gas business much more self-funding rather than still allocating additional capital to it? And that would make it clearer from our perspective in terms of knowing what your capital risk is.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I'd be interested in your thoughts on this, wouldn't that also make it better for shale gas as a market, generally, for what is still essentially a domestic commodity market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, our basic strategy is probably very close to diametrically opposite to the model that you've described. What we basically have had a longstanding thing is the portfolio generates the cash and the cash all belongs to corporation and the corporation then decides how much it wants to allocate to an individual business.</p>
          <p>We really do not want to get into a situation where Ian Ashby feels that he's got call on the entire cash flow out of iron ore just because he's generated it. However, the thrust of your question which I read to be more why aren't you prudent or more prudent in low gas environment allocating less cash to this business, is at the thrust of your question, I believe.</p>
          <p>And from that perspective, I think short of giving you a detailed forecast on the five-year CapEx or two-year CapEx on the shale gas business alone, the guidance I'd like to give you is that Mike is going to try and let's call it minimize, for lack of a better word, the amount of drilling that he does on the dry areas and he's going to try and prioritize and move his rigs to those areas where liquids are a substantial portion of the whole. And all of that within an overall guidance that if what he drills doesn't make a contribution, he's not going to do it. So, essentially, we look at the same parameters, but we probably don't philosophically arrive at the same place, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and just the other comment I'd make, I mean, the accounts you're looking out there are basically from August 2011, so the acquisition had just being made in that half. So we're still in the process of bedding it down and we've talked about economies of scale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, I've had the unfortunate &#x2013; well, fortunate and unfortunate experience of being part of most of the assets that this corporation has acquired over the last 15 years or so. And it takes time to settle them down, get the accounts clean and get your overall strategy to bear down. But where Mike is heading is less gas and within an overall moderated envelope, more liquids, if he can.</p>
          <p>Now I think that, and I do want to reflect on the acreage that we've bought here, I mean, we are more convinced than ever that, from a resource acquired, which is ultimately we're in sort of a resources company, we've made the right choice. You know that there is upside over time in liquids. But again, Andrew, please continue to watch this space as our experience here grows and as we, no doubt continue to adjust our plans as we learn more.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. I've got two smaller questions, hopefully less <mark type="ph" /> threatening (40:21). Firstly, just on the smaller divisions, you mentioned in your presentation that you've implemented some steps to let's say, address the profitability. Now, we've seen in the press about manganese and how you're just processing stockpiles. Could you just sort of outline what you're steps are in aluminium and manganese? And then secondly, just in terms of the tax rate going forwards, should we be modeling in closer to 34% as opposed to 30%? And I think you alluded to favorable FX previously, so just some guidance on that would be much appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I may ask Graham to answer the second question. While I'm answering the first question, you can think about that. Grant, our philosophy is really simple on assets. If you don't make cash, or the customer can't take the product, we shut you down. And that may be a simplistic view, but it's one that's served us well over time. And I think that if you have more manganese units &#x2013; outside, we've shut down the <mark type="ph" /> South Blond (41:32), didn't make sense from an electricity perspective, it didn't make sense from a contribution perspective.</p>
          <p>If some of the other units don't make a contribution at the opportunity cost of the ore, which is slightly different from time to time, because some of the ore you can't get out, for example, in South Africa, sometimes there are logistical constraints. But on that arm's length basis judgment of what the input is, and I stress that, if the unit doesn't make money, it gets shut down.</p>
          <p>Smelters, the same thing. And you've seen us basically task Alberta with those tasks in the aluminium and in the nickel business, but the manganese business is no different from that. So I don't want to predict anything here, but that's the way we think and we don't give infinite leeway on that. I do need to stress that that applies even for individual what we call operations within an asset.</p>
          <p>And you will have seen some of the comments we made on the met coal business where we said, some of these assets are not running at full capacity, because they're not getting the shifts of people allocated to them, which means that the fixed costs aren't being diluted over enough tons and we said that, "Look, if you don't make cash, we're going to shut you down." So that's probably how I would look at it, Grant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to sort of paraphrase that, so you've served notice to all the &#x2013; literally the individual plants within these divisions to, I guess, look at their cost base and do whatever they can to ensure that they generate cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Graham, I'll take the second question. If you're talking about a tax rate going forward, 34% is a good guide. But the number was obviously lower last year, as we've switched from basically an Aussie dollar tax currency to a U.S dollar-based tax currency. But 34% going forward is a good indication to use for your models.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we probably had two periods in succession where we had impacts. We had one where we had a functional currency &#x2013; sorry, where we had an Aussie dollar movement, which resulted in a benefit, and then we had the final functional currency change to U.S. dollars, which from memory, was another $1.4 billion or so impact on the tax line. So we've actually had two halves of artificially low tax rate, Grant. And we're reverting to sort of business as usual here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But they're both obviously non-cash impact as well.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Marius. Sorry, I know it's been a long day for you here. But just a quick one on Escondida. We've seen an &#x2013; on again, off again, we're seeing the grave disappointments coming through again at Escondida. And I'm just wondering, to what extent is this temporary, to what extent is this structural and why are we on the sell side continually overestimating grades at Escondida? Is it a modeling problem? Is it something where the ore body is just different than we thought it was going to be as it gets deeper? Or is there something else going on? And I guess here it's just &#x2013; it's not just Escondida, but it's also some of the larger mines out there, such as Collahuasi as well. But just wondering if you could give us a little extra color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, I think that the grade profile that we forecast three years ago and the one that Peter reaffirmed in the visit were &#x2013; I'm looking at Brendan here. When was that, about 18 months ago? That grade profile, we have a very high degree of confidence in that. But we've had one or two strikes which have moved the tons, when you take it out, around a little bit and then you, obviously, have the strike impact itself.</p>
          <p>But on the overall block model and sequencing of that mine, given that it's a mine that we've operated for a long time. I think we've just got to make sure that you and Brendan equalize here, because we do have a slide on our website which is the same slide that we've had for the last couple of years and we have a high degree of confidence in it and no changes. So, that's probably how I would answer that. Brendan, you're sitting here next to me. I don't know if you've got anything to add to that, that you've historically said?</p>

We do want to stress those four points that we've made upfront, specifically the predictability of the results, our concerted action to act where action is necessary, the latent capacity that exists in a number of core businesses, and I just want to highlight those three again. Escondida, 600,000 tons of copper. Gulf of Mexico in Mad Dog and Atlantis, where everything is in place, reservoirs, the superstructure, we've just got to get back to work. And then, in the &#x2013; obviously with a little bit more uncertainty given where we are on negotiations, the coking coal assets.</p>
          <p>So, those will &#x2013; those together with the projects that are almost completed that comes from our invest through the cycle philosophy will give us short and medium-term momentum. And the last thing we want to stress on CapEx, it's a job for every day. As we've so often said, we live within our means over time. And I hope that you've taken away some of the ways that we think about our cash flow prioritization. But once again, thank you for joining us this morning.</p>
