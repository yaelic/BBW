          <p>This presentation contains forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Deutsche Telekom management with respect to future events. They include, among others, statements as to market potential, and financial guidance statements, as well as our dividend outlook. They are generally identified by the words "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "intend," "estimate," "aim" "goal," "plan," "will," "seek," "outlook" or similar expressions and may include generally any information that relates to expectations or targets for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, earnings, operating profitability or other performance measures, as well as personnel related measures and reductions.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections. You should consider them with caution. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict, and are generally beyond Deutsche Telekom's control, including those described in the sections "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" of the Company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>Among the relevant factors are the progress of Deutsche Telekom's workforce reduction initiatives, and the impact of other significant strategic or business initiatives, including acquisitions, dispositions and business combinations, and cost-saving initiatives. In addition, regulatory rulings, stronger than expected competition, technological change, litigation and supervisory developments, among other factors, may have a material adverse effect on costs and revenue development.</p>
          <p>Further, an economic downturn in Europe or North America, and changes in exchange and interest rates may also have an impact on our business development and availability of capital under favorable conditions. If these or other risks and uncertainties materialize, or if the assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, Deutsche Telekom's actual results may be materially different from those expressed or implied by such statements.</p>
          <p>Deutsche Telekom can offer no assurance that its expectations or targets will be achieved. Deutsche Telekom does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements to take new information or future events into account or otherwise. Deutsche Telekom does not reconcile its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a GAAP measure, because it would require unreasonable effort to do so.</p>
          <p>In the general matter, Deutsche Telekom does not predict the net effect of future special factors because of their uncertainty. Special factors and interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including impairment losses, can be significant to Deutsche Telekom's results. In addition to figures prepared in accordance with IFRS, Deutsche Telekom presents non-GAAP financial performance measures, including EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EBIT, adjusted net profit, free cash flow, gross debt and net debt. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with IFRS.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP financial performance measures are not subject to IFRS, or any other Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Other companies may define these terms in different ways.

          <p>Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Deutsche Telekom's second quarter results conference call. As always, we start with a presentation by our CEO, Ren&#xE9; Obermann; and our CFO, Dr. Eick, followed by a Q&amp;A session. With that let me hand over to our CEO, Ren&#xE9; Obermann.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. As you will have seen from this morning's announcements, we have produced a good set of results for the first half of the year, and I am pleased with the progress to-date. On a like-for-like basis, that is, adjusted for currencies and changes in the scope of consolidation, revenues grew by 0.3% and adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.5% in H1 2008.</p>
          <p>Overall, the negative impact of currency movement in H1 2008 was &#x20AC;1.2 billion on revenues, and &#x20AC;280 million on adjusted EBITDA. Importantly, there has been a significant rise in free cash flow of nearly 60%, and also a net income of almost 24%. As I will discuss in more detail in a moment, we have made clear, tangible progress in reducing our cost base, and in improving our margins.</p>
          <p>Let me go into more detail now, starting with Germany. I am pleased to say that the revenue decline of BBFN domestic in the second quarter was only 4.4% and that is at the upper end of our guidance range for the full year of between -4 and -6. Our cost base at BBFN domestic, has been reduced significantly. Year-on-year, adjusted OpEx is down by over 7%, that is &#x20AC;200 million, and the head count has been cut by 11,500 as of the end of June.</p>
          <p>The net result is, despite a fall in revenues, that we have been able to improve the margins at BBFN domestic from 33.5 to 35% year-on-year. There has also been an improvement in the fixed network adjusted EBITDA margin in the Central and Eastern European businesses to over, very strong, 43% and in domestic mobile to nearly 40%; I'm particularly pleased about that.</p>
          <p>At BBFN domestic, adjusted EBITDA has been more or less stable now for over a year, with the effect of the cost cutting initiatives, "Save for Service" showing through very clearly &#x2013; showing very clear results. By the end of June, "Save for Service" has delivered gross cost savings of overall &#x20AC;3 billion annually, comparing to baseline, and the 32,000 gross head count reduction program has been completed six months ahead of schedule. That has resulted in a gross reduction of nearly 34,000 full time employees, which translates into a net decline of 25,700 since the end of '05 or the beginning of '06. And that means a reduction in adjusted personnel expenses of approximately &#x20AC;600 million from the first half of '06 to the first half of '08; so within two years.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the slide, the effect of this is that, over the past two years, the head count in Germany has fallen significantly from 168,000 two years ago, to just over 142,000; that means a reduction of over 25,000.</p>
          <p>Let me also draw your attention to the success of the Vivento program. Since it started in 2002, there have been nearly 40,000 transfers into Vivento. Almost 80% of these have subsequently left Vivento, and more than 20,000 outside the Group. As of June 30, only 8,200 out of the total of 40,000 were still Vivento employees.</p>
          <p>In the domestic broadband market, we have maintained our retail net add market share now at over 40% for seven consecutive quarters. At the end of the half year, we had almost 10 million DSL retail customers. That's an increase of almost 2 million over the past 12 months. The vast majority of this, 90%, are either in 12 or now in 24-month contracts. Total retail broadband growth in the second quarter, which amounted to 340,000, is always in the second quarter seasonally low, as you will recall from previous years.</p>
          <p>Total line losses in the quarter were around 650,000. The increase compared to Q1, reflects predominantly higher All-IP migration from resellers &#x2013; and by the way it's very much inline with our guidance which we had given in March, it's actually at the lower end of the guidance, 1.2 million total for the first half, and the full year was 2.5 to 3 guidance.</p>
          <p>Our Central and Eastern European fixed-line business continues to perform well. Healthy margins of over 43%, and an adjusted EBITDA contribution of approximately &#x20AC;250 million. Please note that the head count reduction program there is not confined to BBFN just domestically, it's also taking place there. Over the past two years, the head count in Central and Eastern Europe has been cut by nearly one quarter and now stands at just over 15,000 full-time employees.</p>
          <p>At T-Mobile Germany, there has been a material improvement in financial trends compared to the second quarter of last year. First of all, the decline in service revenues had slowed down significantly and is now below 2% compared to over 3% a year ago.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA is up by over 4% year-on-year at 773 million in Q2. It had declined by over 8% year-on-year in Q2 in 2007, if you compare the quarters. And the adjusted EBITDA margin has increased from under 37% to nearly 40% now. That encouraging EBITDA development reflects discipline on the cost side including lower subscriber acquisition costs per gross add in Q2 versus Q2 '07.</p>
          <p>Contract net adds in the second quarter were at just over 200,000, while contract churn was down very slightly at 1.1%. Minutes of use per contract customer were up in Q2 by about 9% year-on-year, which translates into increase of total MOUs [minutes of use] of 15%. This compares to Q1 where the increase was 6% and 13% respectively. So, the trends on minutes of use is further increasing.</p>
          <p>Let me go to T-Mobile internationally. There has been a continuation of the growth story with 1.1 million contract customers added in the second quarter and the total international customer base that now stands at nearly 87 million. Because of the exchange rate movements, it is important to focus on the organic development here. This shows international revenue growth that is excluding Germany of nearly 6%, and adjusted EBITDA of 5.5%, pretty much in line with our strategy we want to grow abroad in mobile. This strong performance was evident in both the US and in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Coming to US, we saw very strong, again very strong US dollar revenue and also adjusted EBITDA growth in the States. Our business to date has not shown any effects from the weaknesses in the US economy. In Q2 specifically, total revenues year-on-year grew by over 14%, service revenues by nearly 16% and adjusted EBITDA by over 16% to $1.6 billion in Q2. Contract gross adds were up by 6% from Q2 '07 and unchanged from Q1 '08. The perceived slight shortfall in contract net adds is simply the expected impact of sequentially higher contract churn. Q2 '08 is the two-year anniversary of the introduction of two-year contracts for new customers. These customers came off contract for the first time in Q2 '08. In addition, prepaid net adds were seasonally weaker in Q2 and traditional prepaid customers fell by 160,000 in Q2 but this was more than offset by growth in FlexPay low contract.</p>
          <p>In Central and Eastern Europe, there has again been an excellent performance. Total revenues, service revenues, and adjusted EBITDA have all delivered double-digit growth in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA up by 17% and an improved margin of over 43%. Contract net adds in the quarter were well over 400,000 and contract churn in the key markets was consistently below 1%. We have also seen strong growth in data revenues. Non-voice revenues grew by nearly 18% year-on-year and, if you exclude messaging in Central and Eastern Europe, by almost 80%. The cash contribution of Central and Eastern Europe was up by over 30%, now at &#x20AC;532 million.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the map on the next chart, when it comes to OTE [Hellenic Telecommunications Organization] and Cosmote, the acquisition of OTE will allow us to strengthen and consolidate our presence in a series of important growth markets in Southeast Europe namely Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, and Macedonia as well as Greece of course.</p>
          <p>As of the end of March, Cosmote had 16.5 million customers in these markets and these have increased by 35% year-on-year. In 2007, revenues of the Cosmote Group grew by 28% to over &#x20AC;3 billion and EBITDA by 12% to 1 billion.</p>
          <p>Having received the approval of the Greek Parliament, we expect the OTE acquisition to close in Q4 following the approval by the EU and various supervisory authorities in the respective countries. Incidentally, while on the subject of acquisitions, let me just add that we are concentrating our efforts on the integration of OTE, and that's going to keep us fully occupied for some time to come. In addition, even if any further acquisition were to present itself, in that case &#x2013; theoretical case, let me be clear that Deutsche Telekom would not issue its own shares in support of this. I think it's important to clarify on this one.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Mobilize the Internet. Let's turn to the third element of our strategy, which is Mobilize the Internet, and let me start by focusing on the strong growth and data revenues. Excluding messaging, these increased by almost 24% to &#x20AC;588 million. In Europe, the increase was over 46%. Last time I expected a minimum of 40%, now we are at 46% so much higher. And in the US in dollars, by nearly 17% but if we include messaging there, the increase in the US was 31.5%. Differently from Europe, in the US, messaging is still the biggest growth driver for mobile data. We expect the growth in non-messaging data revenues to accelerate. Once we have launched 3G more broadly in the US, which we should do by the fourth quarter of this year, we've launched it in New York in May and just this week we are launching 3G in Las Vegas, Austin, and San Antonio and by the end of the year in total about 25 markets.</p>
          <p>Specific developments in the second quarter in Germany have been the launch of the Femtocell trials in the Cologne/Bonn area which began in June and we've also now equipped the entire domestic UMTS network with higher uplink speed through HSUPA so uplinks now are possible with 1.4 megabits. In Europe, overall, we sold 2.3 million 3G-capable devices in the first half of the year and that was much more than last year. It compares with 1.4 million in the first half of '07.</p>
          <p>To emphasize how strong the growth in mobile data has been, let me highlight the details on the next two slides. In Europe, web'n'walk, the open internet on a mobile device or web'n'walk for the laptop, the service as such has now more than 4 million customers. Non-voice revenues excluding messaging are now at &#x20AC;350 million.</p>
          <p>In the US, the most prominent product is myFaves. For community services, myFaves users have now increased to more than 6.5 million, up by more than 1 million in the quarter alone. And non-voice revenues excluding messaging have risen to over US $370 million.</p>
          <p>In Europe, data ARPU excluding messaging has increased by 25% year-on-year to &#x20AC;1.5 per customer. In UMTS data volumes in Europe more than quadrupled from Q2 in '07. In the US, data ARPU including messaging has increased to US $8.6, and the number of SMSs and MMSs has more than doubled year-on-year to a very impressive number to 41 billion messages.</p>
          <p>Coming to the network-centric side to T-Systems. We have established the joint sales force and production units with Cognizant for the Global IT delivery to become more competitive. It has provided us with access to the vast offshore capacities of Cognizant and allows us to lower significantly our production costs in system integration. The restructuring of the domestic business to concentrate on network-centric ICT is well underway. The reduction in head count amounts to nearly 6,000 full-time employees as of the end of June. Our international sales strategy continues to deliver. Revenues in Q2 increased by 3.4% internationally compared to the second quarter of 2007. The order book, adjusted for the order entry for Media &amp; Broadcast and Active Billing, which is out of T-Systems, is up. So, comparing apples to apples, the order book is up by nearly 10% in the first half of the year to &#x20AC;6.4 billion. And we closed a number of major deals such as Royal Dutch Shell and Sparkasse in Germany.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by reconfirming that we remain confident that we will achieve our guidance for the year of adjusted group EBITDA of &#x20AC;19.3 billion around, and a free cash flow of around &#x20AC;6.6 billion. It remains our intention to maintain an attractive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Let me hand over to Karl.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ren&#xE9; and also good afternoon and good morning from my side. I am also very pleased with our first half year's performance and our second quarter results, especially with improvements in our domestic operations. On an organic basis, that is adjusted for currency and changes in the scope of quantization both revenues and adjusted EBITDA were stable year-on-year in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>I will comment on the development by division in a minute, but let me highlight the development in Broadband/Fixed Network where the domestic revenue decline improved to minus 4.4% with stable adjusted EBITDA compared to the second quarter of '07. The development in domestic mobile was also very encouraging, where we saw a year-on-year increase in adjusted EBITDA for the first time in three years.</p>
          <p>Reported net income in the second quarter was impacted by a number of special factors amounting to minus &#x20AC;239 million in total. These consisted primarily of personnel related restructuring expenses. In addition, net interest expense was impact by a one-time charge of &#x20AC;0.2 billion for the additional interest expense for bonds with step up clauses, due to the ratings downgrade. This charge was not booked as a special factor and therefore impacted both reported and adjusted net income. Adjusted for special factors, but including this one time step up charge, adjusted net income increased by 11% to &#x20AC;633 million in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow continued its positive trend from the first quarter and increased by 12% to close to &#x20AC;2 billion in the second quarter alone.</p>
          <p>Let me now discuss the divisions starting with mobile. Here we saw on balance, good results. On an organic basis, the customer base grew by 10 million to 125 million. We saw particularly strong customer growth in the US, Germany, The Netherlands and several Eastern European markets including Hungary and Croatia. Financial results were once again impacted by adverse foreign exchange movements, especially in terms of the dollar/euro and pound sterling/euro exchange rates.</p>
          <p>While reported revenues were essentially flat, they grew by close to 4% on an organic basis. Continued strong organic growth in the US was the main driver behind this development. Despite the negative foreign exchange effects, reported adjusted EBITDA grew by 3.4%. This was driven by more than 5% adjusted EBITDA growth in our European mobile operations with good growth in most countries including Germany, more than offsetting weaker developments in the UK and Austria.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA for T-Mobile US (sic) [USA] stayed essentially flat in euro terms. In organic terms, adjusted EBITDA for the mobile division grew by 5.3% to &#x20AC;2.9 billion, mostly driven by the US, which remains the strongest organic growth driver for the Group.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Broadband Fixed Network or BBFN, revenue trends improved compared to the first quarter, while we were able to keep EBITDA stable with good focus in cost cutting.</p>
          <p>The domestic revenue decline of 4.4%, we were at the upper end of our guidance range of minus four to minus 6% for the whole year. Adjusted EBITDA for BBFN as a whole benefited from the deconsolidation of T-Online France and Spain last year.</p>
          <p>Including the EBITDA benefit from the sale of loss making operations, adjusted EBITDA at BBFN remained stable. Domestic adjusted EBITDA remained stable as well, with cost cutting offsetting the impact of the negative revenue development.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at the domestic revenue development at BBFN. Compared to the first quarter, the revenue decline improved from minus 6% year-on-year to minus 4.4% in the second quarter. This improvement was mainly due to a lesser decline in calling revenues. These decreased by 16.5% year-on-year, in the second quarter, compared to a decline of 22.8% in the first quarter. In addition, IP Internet revenues grew by 4.7% in the second quarter, compared to a decrease of 1.3% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As we saw, adjusted EBITDA in BBFN remained stable. The domestic revenue decline of approximately &#x20AC;220 million was more than offset by domestic OpEx cuts amounting to approximately &#x20AC;240 million. Additional savings from our Save for Service group cost cutting program in BBFN amounted to &#x20AC;0.4 million. These savings came from a variety of sources including production, sales and service, marketing, IT and ho-bites.</p>
          <p>The result in business customers continued to be impacted by the sale of Media Broadcast and the transfer of Active Billing to BBFN. Adjusted for these effects and assuming constant currencies, total revenues declined by just 1.2% in the second quarter compared to a decline of 5.2% in the first quarter. This development was supported by continued growth in international revenues, which grew by 3.4% in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA however remained under pressure even if adjusted for the sale of Media Broadcast and the transfer of Active Billing and assuming constant currencies. The decline of 11% adjusted is due to continued pricing and competitive pressure.</p>
          <p>In terms of our Save for Service cost-cutting program, by mid-year we had already achieved a total run rate of &#x20AC;3 billion annually, compared to the target for 2010 of 4.2 to &#x20AC;4.7 billion of gross cost cuts. The Q2 contribution alone amounted to &#x20AC;0.5 billion. This combines with the FX developments more than compensated for the higher market spend and led to a net cost base reduction in the group of &#x20AC;0.4 billion compared to the second quarter the year before. Specific cost cutting measures in the second quarters included at BBFN more in-sourcing in production and IT and reduction of sales and service costs.</p>
          <p>In mobile, first cost savings from the network JV in the UK, in business customers personnel reductions at systems integration in Germany and last but not least at the GHS [Group Headquarters], personnel reductions at Deutsche Telekom headquarters and OpEx reductions resulting from the shared service initiatives.</p>
          <p>In terms of personnel count, the head count of the Group was reduced by 6,900 employees or 2.8% over the past year. This consists of a head count reduction of 11,500 employees or 7.5% in Germany, which more than offset an increase of 4,600 employees outside Germany. As a result of this head count reduction, we were able to reduce adjusted personnel expenses in the first half by 4% for the Group and 6% domestically. This also resulted in a slightly improved personnel cost ratio.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the main financial metrics for the Group. Free cash flow in the second quarter improved to &#x20AC;2 billion despite higher CapEx. Cash generated from operations improved from 4.1 to &#x20AC;4.4 billion due to slightly lower income tax payments and less of negative impact from working capital than in the second quarter the year before. Net interest payments improved in particular, due to a special interest payment of &#x20AC;190 million in May '07 for a bond, which matured that month. Accordingly, net cash provided by operating activities improved from 3.2 to &#x20AC;3.7 billion. This more than compensated for the increase in cost in cash CapEx, which was caused in particular by the 3G driven increase in CapEx at T-Mobile US (sic) USA and the decline of proceeds from the disposal of assets due to lower proceeds from real estate sales.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, reported net income was impacted by special factors amounting to &#x20AC;239 million, consisting mainly of personnel related restructuring payments. In Q2, '07 however, the negative special factors from restructuring were compensated by the gain from the sale of T-Online France. In addition, net financial expenses were impacted by the one-time step-up charge of &#x20AC;0.2 billion from the ratings downgrade. These two factors and a slight increase in minorities more than offset a reduction in P&amp;L taxes. Adjusted for special factors, net income continued to improve compared to the prior year. The second quarter increase of 11.1% would have been even stronger were &#x2013; it would for &#x2013; the step-up charge of &#x20AC;0.2 billion, if this would not have happened.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, net debt increased significantly in the second quarter. This was mainly due to the dividends of &#x20AC;3.7 billion paid in the second quarter, including dividends paid to minorities in our Eastern European holdings and the payment of &#x20AC;2.6 billion for the initial 20% stake in OTE. This more than offset our free cash flow of &#x20AC;2 billion in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with net debt of &#x20AC;40.6 billion compared to &#x20AC;35.9 billion at the end of the first quarter. Despite this increase, our balance sheet ratios remained healthy with gearing of one times and an equity ratio of 35.1%.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon, I had a first one question on T-Com in Germany. You had a good performance in terms of line loss, but in terms of broadband market share it is slightly below your target. My question really was, have you lowered a little bit your marketing expenses there. And would that explain the strong performance at the EBITDA, or is it unrelated to that?</p>
          <p>And if that's the case, then can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on what you've been doing on the costs? I note that civil servants are down quite a bit, which is a change from the previous quarter. Thank you</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Market expenses, of course if we have less gross adds then of course the SACs [Subscriber Acquisition Costs] in total are a little reduced. However, it's a seasonal impact that the DSL adds are lower than in Q1. It's compared to last year &#x2013; also it's been seasonally lower in Q2. What was the rest.</p>
          <p>The SACs overall are at a very competitive level, of around 200 or a little less than &#x20AC;200 for a Double Play connection. Since we launched the Triple Play about half a year ago, the mass market launch, it's a little too early to talk about Triple Play SACs in particular. So, in total since the beginning of the Entertain product, the acquisition costs were lowered and quite significantly lowered.</p>
          <p>Cost side, we have reached net cost savings of 0.6 billion in the first half of the year, and about 0.5 billion are from 'Save for Service' at T-Home. About another 0.1 billion comes from less market expenditures and from reduction in outsourcing and termination and others. I hope that answers your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was wondering about your domestic fixed EBITDA, where you have guided I think for the full year for a decline of 5 to 8%, now it's flat year-on-year not only in Q2, but really for the first half of the year. How do you see this coming through, would you start to raise expectations on that front. And if not, would that be something that has to do more with the cost cutting side of things or more with the top line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, the decline in adjusted EBITDA should not be generally taken as a benchmark for the next quarters. There are some reasons why the number might look a little different.</p>
          <p>The first quarter in '07 was impacted by the introduction of bundled products in November '06. So, therefore we had higher OpEx in the first quarter of '07. In the second quarter '08, we had relatively low market invest due to seasonally as I said earlier on, lower broadband market growth. It seems to be from today's perspective that we could end up at better end of the guided range of EBITDA decline, from minus 5 to minus 8%.</p>
          <p>So, at the better end we expect some higher OpEx in the second half despite further Save for Service measures, because of market invest into broadband growth. We want to participate at the broadband growth opportunity as long as the market grows that fast and therefore we do expect some more market investment now.</p>
          <p>To what extent and what size, I don't know yet. What I can say is I think we can achieve the very good end of the guided range of the EBITDA decline, but there will be some more cost impacts because of marketing in the second half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Peter Nielsen from Cheuvreux. Two questions please, one on German mobile and one on UK You've obviously had a strong margin performance in Germany and you've had a reduction in SACs here. Would you expect to be able to maintain that element in the second half, and can you see a scenario where you come out of '08 with flat or even slightly increasing earnings in domestic mobile?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the UK, any comments on how you will prioritize in the second half, I mean, how should we evaluate your performance in the UK in six months from now, would you like to be judged  on revenue, developments, customer intake or on margins. Or do you think you can improve both? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look I always said that Germany, the German margin should be possible to be as high as 40%, but the range I always &#x2013; in the past always said that a margin between 35 and 40% is sustainable despite the competitiveness in Germany. And intra-year we expect the normal margin development with a relatively higher margin in Q3 and a relatively lower margin in Q4, but always within that very range. So, I do expect the margin to be overall in the second half of the year to be good. I wouldn't dare yet to say it's going to be 40%, but it's definitely I think within that range, probably on the better side of the range.</p>
          <p>UK, the relatively weak performance in Q2 reflects the development of decreasing sales growth in the second half of '07, which was deliberate as T-Mobile UK at the time focused on a good financial performance in all major financial performance metrics on a year-on-year basis.</p>
          <p>It delivered, let me just remind you of that, it delivered a 23% year-on-year EBITDA increase in '07. And so the drop of adjusted EBITDA in Q2 does reflect the higher market spendings, mainly on retention, customer retention, as well as growth at market share increases and it should translate improved growth rates in the course of the year.</p>
          <p>So, in other words in '07 we were very focused on results. In '08, we also try to catch up a little bit on the customer side, particularly on retention. I've always said in the past that the UK, which we are a little opportunistic because the market is very, very competitive, sometimes overheated and we try and use opportunities and use time windows for additional growth. And, as I said, last year we focused on results and therefore we had to catch up a little bit.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I had a question regarding the dividends, please. I appreciate that the dividends are a Board decision, but in the opinion of the management, can you confirm that the last year's dividend, you consider that to be a floor level, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I don't know &#x2013; if I may take this question, I don't know whether I would want to describe it as being a flaw. But certainly when <mark type="inaudible" /> make a decision about the dividends for &#x2013; I should &#x2013; for just a short term perspective.</p>
          <p>And I think we have made it clear that it is not only dependent on our net profitability, but also on our free cash flow, which is performing very strong. But it's also dependent on our balance sheet ratios. That's why I think we are seeing a good performance for today's dividend level. One always has to say, by German law, this is a decision, which is to be made commonly between supervisory board and management boards.</p>
          <p>This decision is always fueled once we have the full year results, i.e. in February beginning of next year. And until then we have to be open in our wording. But I think we are managing our business in a very stable way.</p>

          <p>Mr. Hannes Wittig from JPMorgan, may we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Just wanted to see if in the UK &#x2013; of course, Mr. Obermann, you have already explained you are following a bit of an opportunistic strategy. But at the same time the current financial performance doesn't seem satisfactory. So I wondered if you were potentially open to market rationalization and &#x2013; with that asset.</p>
          <p>And secondly, in Germany, you are running below your target net addition rates in terms of market share gains. So I wondered if you were going to accelerate marketing efforts to get back to more than 45% and what form that could take; actually better than guided</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second part. I don't know where you take that from that we're running below target in Germany. With regards to the, I think it's quite the opposite. With regards to the STN line losses, traditional fixed line losses, the March forecast, at least from my memory, was a little worse than we currently perform. I think total &#x2013; half year is 1.2 million PSTN line losses. I think the forecast at the time was between 2.5 and 3 million line losses, particularly due to the additional impact of so-called all IP regulation for resellers. And so far we've managed to keep that pretty much &#x2013; actually better than guided. And let's see how the year-end goes.</p>
          <p>Second, the overall target for this year in broadband was up to 45% share of our net adds. So far we have been beyond 40%. And knowing that 45 is ambitious, but we still very much aim for that. And, I said it earlier on, that we are putting a little more resources into marketing and sales efforts in the second half. And therefore we shouldn't take the first and second quarter results in Home, financial results in Home, as the benchmark for the remainder of the year. As I said, it remains to be seen how much additional we really need to put into the market in order to increase our share.</p>
          <p>I don't want to give any new forecast. We're shooting for 45% share of the net adds. We have to take a little more aggressive stance in marketing and sales, but overall, we are competitive, as we have demonstrated for seven consecutive quarters. So I do not share your view that we're running below our target. I think we're performing quite well in the fixed line business.</p>
          <p>UK &#x2013; you asked me whether we are open to sell anything. I am not making any speculation on M&amp;A and neither on all these rumors, these endless rumors on who are we always involved in buying, whether we are going to sell any one of our businesses. UK is a part of our <mark type="inaudible" /> with mobile. And also UK contributes to our overall scale in procurements. And so I am not going to change our strategy and I am not going to make any comments on M&amp;A, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me do some remarks to our UK performance from my financial perspective. I think, first and foremost, one should not overdo the second quarter. I think one really has to consider the first semester. And if you look into the first semester, and if you take the negative forex developments out of consideration, then we saw a moderate revenue increase. And the total EBITDA, taking negative forex exchanges out of consideration, the total EBITDA was more or less stable. We saw a small decline, but total EBITDA was more or less stable. Yes, we certainly would have wanted to see a better performance in the UK But from a first semester perspective, it was more or less a stable business.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. You've given us an interesting chart showing the very strong growth in data volumes. I wondered if you wouldn't mind commenting a little more on data loading on the 3G networks, particularly in Germany but also elsewhere. And whether you're seeing any capacity constraints starting to emerge?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if I understood you right on the progression of broadband net additions in Germany this quarter, you're indicating that this is a seasonally weak quarter and that marketing spend was lower than it might otherwise have been. Have you seen any economic impacts on the business? And would you highlight any particular markets or customer behavior that you feel has been affected by weakness in the broader economy? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No capacity constraints on the mobile data networks, although traffic is increasing strongly. And also, by the way, revenues are increasing in Europe 46%, and in some markets traffic volumes quadrupled, or even higher than quadrupled, year-on-year which is good. And that's pretty much in line with our strategy.</p>
          <p>Any impact from the economy on our business? Actually, no. It seems that our business is quite robust against economical impacts. Look at &#x2013; you compare the Q2 this year with Q2 last year, in broadband in Germany and we had 370,000 last year, we had 340,000 this year.</p>
          <p>I would like to add that in Q2 we have introduced the largest IT system change, system migration, one of the largest in this industry. Because we really introduced a new system integrating 17 or so old systems which were previously running in T-Home. And that also had contributed a little bit because we had some service constraints in the second quarter due to this major IT migration, which has made us sweat for quite a while.</p>
          <p>So, no, I don't think that there is an indication on economic impacts in our business. And I think that's in none of the markets a realistic &#x2013; or a relevant trend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. On your SACs in German mobile, do you think the new iPhone will put up pressure on the subsidies in the second half? And second, what impact do you think higher inflation will have on your cost base in general regarding wages and energy costs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah true, the iPhone is &#x2013; because it addresses high-end customers with high-end tariff packages and also generates extraordinary good ARPUs and significantly higher data ARPUs than with other devices. Therefore, there is a little higher SAC, but if you look at the long-term amortization of those iPhone customers, the picture looks very good and very attractive to us.</p>
          <p>Given the overall numbers of those iPhones, there is an impact, but I think we can well cope and still keep a good margin in the German mobile business, as I said earlier on. So, I would still encourage the teams to continue to sell iPhone and get those customers and sell those high-end tariffs aggressively, because I still think we can very well digest some additional SACs on this particular product, because it pays back very nicely in the mid-term.</p>
          <p>Energy cost, let me double check here what we've got there. I think Karl is ready to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well when it comes to the inflationary effects for the second semester, yes there are going to be some. And it will be wages to a certain extent, but I think also energy, but then let me also give you some flavor of what one has to expect starting with T-Mobile where we have 4,000 employees affected from a wage increase of 3.6% effective June 1. T-Systems where 27,000 employees are affected. We have a salary increase of 3.1%, but only from January 1, '09 onwards, so no effect in the second semester this year. Then we have TPG where i.e. our retail organization here in Germany where we see wage increase for 5,000 employees of 3.8% effective June 1. That's why, yes, there are going be some inflationary effects. I think to a certain extent, the same is going to be true for energy, but I think it is controllable.</p>

          <p>Yes, one question regarding the accounting treatment for the future consolidation of OTE. How will you treat the options granted to the Greek government?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to the expected seasonality on the mobile profitability &#x2013; you make a reference to this for Germany. Should we take the usual profitability pattern because of the roaming regulation put in place last year? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with how to treat the &#x2013; our obligation towards the Greek government. We are consolidating from the moment of final approval; we are consolidating also the first put-option from the government to us, which is amounting 5%, which means that we are consolidating from the beginning on 30% of the company. That's how we're treating that kind of put-option.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You made a reference to higher margin in Q3 for mobile in Germany; usually this is related to roaming. Should we expect the same kind of seasonality because of the roaming regulation in Europe? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jacques, personally I wouldn't expect a major impact of that. On the roaming regulation in 2008, and you know that roaming regulation was really put in place mid 2007. We always said in 2007 the overall impact was in the higher double-digit range and for 2008 we expect an impact of the triple-digit range. So nothing particular then to be expected for the third quarter; so nothing that we would comment upon. So, the overall impact of the roaming regulation in 2008 is a triple-digit.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yes, I'm just coming, just a follow-up on you data trends; on slide 16 &#x2013; you've already answered the question on volume, but in terms of revenue you showed an almost &#x20AC;50 million increase in your data revenues, excluding messaging. Could you give us a bit more detail as to what products drove that? I'm assuming that's not a currency effect.</p>
          <p>And secondly, in terms of your pricing strategy in German Wireline, I believe one or two of the cable operators are now down at &#x20AC;25 for triple-play before the analog fees for TV are included. Does that give you something you have to react to on your broadband pricing for double-play or triple-play? Or put it another way, when you talk about putting more investments into DSL in the second half, are we talking about price cuts or more to do with SAC and marketing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Justin, the revenue increase in Europe, if at all, is not positively influenced by currency. It probably is more negatively influenced by currency. But, it's primarily on access. It's mobile internet, data access, through the laptop, pocket PCs, and so forth, for all kind of applications from surfing to mail and messaging. Sorry not short messaging, from surfing to mail and to specific applications. So the biggest chunk is really from the access site as forecasted, as foreseen.</p>
          <p>Pricing in Wireline, what's our answer? I mean, our answer is to stay competitive but not to be the price leader. We've stuck to what we always said and we always said that we can maintain a certain premium and the premium range is probably between say 15 to 20%, maybe, in some cases, 20 to 25%. It's not going to be, you know, &#x20AC;20 premium. But a certain premium we can maintain. The customers still come to us and there are many customers who want to come back from other competitors. So, I don't think we're, overall speaking, we're uncompetitive. We may have to adjust prices here and there if the competition does, but overall today we're well positioned.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Couple of questions, one on the UK and one on German fixed. On the UK, I was just wondering if you could give us a quick update on the network sharing JV with 3 and whether the cost associated with that had any significant impact on EBITDA in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And the question on domestic fixed &#x2013; just whether you've got any updated thoughts on extending the VDSL footprint beyond the kind of current plans in light of the extra competition from cable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost impact of the JV in the UK is coming in. It is not the strongest number in the first &#x2013; in the second quarter, which was the first quarter, more or less, the first quarter of the JV. I would say it was a smaller 2 digit number. That's the guidance I think I could give. I think we will certainly see a more positive effect in the second semester and the full year next year. But, as mentioned, this is only starting now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as cable guys go and their footprint, I think you should talk to them, I don't want to make a statement on their footprints. I think they have upgraded quite a big part of their network, but the number and the percentage you need to talk to them.</p>
          <p>Our VDSL footprint let me just double check, but we will &#x2013; by the end of the year will be in around 50 cities. We covered the cities to a large extent, not fully because it wouldn't be economical. But additionally we have upgraded the ADSL2 capabilities. We can operate it in more than 750 cities, which would make us very competitive there.</p>
          <p>So, ADSL2+ plus VDSL giving us around 17 million household coverage for the time being and we will continue to roll out VDSL in the rest of the year and that would be about 10.5 million homes by the end of the year. Total spending so far was 1.4 billion on it. Further spending to increase coverage within these cities is depending on customer demands, but also on whether we get some further progress on regulation. I think the regulation is not yet ideal for further significant additional investments and the regulators need to rethink their position there.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. First question is on the M&amp;A &#x2013; your statements that you will not use some shares, just to know, if you consider that your share price is too low to be able to make a relative acquisition or is it a general approach whatever the view of share price?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on the US, Q2 was the anniversary of the two-years contract, do you expect that the negative churn effect that you've seen in the US will last over the forthcoming quarter or will it dilute over the next forthcoming quarters? Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me just start with the M&amp;A question. We wanted to rule out issuing new shares, also to different shares, as to certain extent from some of our peers who tried to do some acquisitions using own shares. I think it is &#x2013; for the time being, certainly, not the right funding means issuing new shares. That's something which is crystal clear.</p>
          <p>It's a matter of price, but also it's also a matter of further dilution. That's why we are ruling it out at least for the time being. Now you can ask me, what is time being? I think at the very, in the actual markets there is no use of issuing new shares. That's perhaps what I could a little bit more clarify. And again, as Ren&#xE9; was mentioning, we are right now concentrating to integrate OTE and that's it.</p>

          <p>Okay. As far as US churn goes, I think the increase was slight increase from 1.7% in Q1 to 1.9% in Q2. This effect will grow itself out in the next 12 months, but the churn rate might be a little higher than 1.7% for the next quarters. It's a little &#x2013; it's difficult to tell at this point in time. But I think we have a conservative guidance of 3 million net adds and we are very confident that we will at least accomplish this. We also have net adds from T-Mobile at home beginning in Q3, so I think we'll have a decent net add increase from this new product as well and we'll see what the net add results will be in the next quarter. But overall 3 million net adds is going to be &#x2013; is a conservative guidance.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. A question on churn in Germany, do you have the churn figure using the historic disclosure? I would like to know how far do you expect the net subscriber additions to continue in Germany. My other question was on IPTV revenues, could you give us an idea of what was the ARPU generated from other than voice or subscriptions in the quarter. And also when do you expect fixed line revenues to be growing, thanks to these kinds of new services? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Laurent, maybe you can rephrase your question with respect to the churn rate in Germany, because we didn't really get it.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would like to understand what is the, if you had to use the historic disclosure of the customers, what would be the net customers in fact?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you have changed the way that you report contract and prepaid customers? The net subscribers that you report seems to be much higher than what it would have been using historic disclosure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah okay, then we got it. No, we didn't really change it. The impact is why we have so much more prepaid customers. That there was a change in law a year ago which actually prevented us from switching off inactive prepaid subscribers. So, we have to keep them for a longer period of time on our books. These are already customers that we do have, so that's the net impact, but that's got nothing to do with the &#x2013; has nothing to do with churn rate and in particular nothing to do with the churn rate on contract.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. A very good afternoon to you. Firstly congratulations on a good second quarter. And I have to say though nevertheless it's rather disappointing that given how vicious the equity markets remain and how everybody is trying their best to reduce uncertainty and panic, you still don't want to give a straight answer on the Sprint M&amp;A question. And as an alternative would you at least say whether Deutsche Telekom's top managers are prepared to buy shares in order to signal their confidence in the group's value and therefore their confidence that these rumors are baseless?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I am not going to comment on any specific price speculation. I'm sorry you find that disappointing, because once I start doing that I'd have to do it anytime with any kind of these rumors. But I have said very clearly, loud and clear that we have a good piece of work ahead of us and we'll have to concentrate on the OT integration, on making sure that the cooperation with the OT management and the countries there work so that we can extract the synergies which we have planned for to be achieved. And that's going to keep us busy for quite a while, plus we have clarified that we wouldn't use our &#x2013; we wouldn't issue new shares even if there was an M&amp;A opportunity coming up, we wouldn't do that with new shares in order not to dilute the shares and so forth. I think that's as much clarity as we can provide and I apologize if that is not satisfying.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very &#x2013; before Ren&#xE9; will also address the issue of buying our own shares by the management, there was one open question with respect to the triple-digit, triple-play ARPU which is on an average 7 to 8 years higher than for the double-play, but we're not, not at this point of time with that customer base, we are not splitting it down. We'll do that at a later stage of time, once we've got really reliable numbers and a bigger subscriber base, Ren&#xE9;.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's something on &#x2013; I think the question is still open whether management buys shares is a signal. That is something we were certainly thinking about, but at this point in time haven't taken a collective view on and by the way we would let you know as soon as we have taken a position on this one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I have a question concerning the IPTV take-up. You received a guidance in March for 500,000 for the end of the year and we're standing now at 250 and you started the year at 150, with kind of a negative trend of course, also seasonally probably, but does that mean that your IPTV strategy is not turning the right way you thought so, and how important actually is IPTV, if the uptake of this IPTV bundles for your BBFN revenue guidance? That would be the first one.</p>
          <p>The second one would be personnel cost ratio, can you give us a feel where your target is to lower that? I understand that you are looking a little bit towards France Telecom and they have a ratio of around 17 to 18%, is this a target you envisioned for let's say, over the next two years till 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the IPTV site at CeBIT we've made the bundles very attractive, basically launch it with more features and reduced prices. And, the uptake is visible. We sold around 250,000 of which 200,000 are now installed and up and running. Customers who use the entertain product are satisfied. And I personally speak to those customers and I'm of course using my own product myself. It's a good product and I'm convinced we can continue to sell it and the 500,000 could be the next milestone to be achieved, but that's not a question of a few weeks early or later. So in other words, we're not going to overspend money to attract customers just to achieve that very milestone in November or December, it has to make economical sense. Overall, mid-to-long-term I think that internet-based TV with all those features is a relevant product; it's a good product obviously for the mass market. It just takes its time before there is a relevant critical mass and the snowball effect as we call them are taking place. I do think the product is good, we continue to sell it. We're not going to overspend. I'm not going to spend stupid money in order to just to achieve the 500,000 a few weeks earlier or later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when it comes to the personnel cost ratio, Arnd I do not want to be negative to France Telecom, but to a certain extent it's a little bit difficult to compare and to take as a benchmark due to the fact that France Telecom is not that significant in T-Systems which is a labor intense business, but yes we will certainly further &#x2013; we would certainly continue our head count reduction and head count restructuring that goes without saying. We are not putting out new numbers, because we do not want to give new guidance, also with respect here to the German public. But clearly we do want to further reduce and I think until 2010 we will certainly see a further reduction of 1 or 2 percentage points. But that's also not a number we would want to guide, but clearly we are also orienting us to our peers and there is clearly more room for improvement.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, actually two questions please. The first one is on IP bit-stream access, could you give us some details on the run rate of that at the moment? And secondly on OTE, how relevant is the share price for the level of goodwill you plan to show in your balance sheet? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pricing just to give you a little bit of background here as a resale also for naked DSL or call it IP bit-stream access is &#x20AC;19.15 and that's limits to regions where the alternative carriers don't have coverage, until the end of Q2, I think that number must be wrong. So, I don't give you &#x2013; I can't give you full details yet on the number of pure IP bit-stream access. An orientation could be the 650 of which around 450, around that number is an orientation for our own line losses but it's only in orientation. There are some migration effects between us and cable guys and resellers and vice-versa. So, no further detailing, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously you could read in our balance sheet, well first and foremost we are right now in the process of doing our Purchase Price Allocation. That's why the total amount of goodwill is not yet decided. That's I think the first remark I would want to make. Second remark, the total amount of our goodwill then as we decide on it is more dependent on the share price we have &#x2013; the price we have acquired the shares, i.e. the price we have acquired then after a full approval of the 25%. And then the goodwill which is locked in, and if we would do thereafter more buyings, yes, then we would benefit from the share price performance as we did for example with the 2% we acquired already in the market. This was done in the third quarter and we have clearly benefited from the lower OTE share price. These buyings but again share price &#x2013; goodwill is depend on PPA, i.e. Purchase Price Allocation and the price we bought. And we paid for the  23%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One more addition to the previous statement, IP bit-stream access and the biggest migration from resellers is from us to unbundled, and then bit-stream access from our competition. So, these effects are somewhat difficult to describe over the phone unless we have a chart in front of you. So there are some effects by that. The pure IP bit-stream access from us to &#x2013; from our own offers to our own IP bit-stream access so far is very, very small by the end of Q2, very small, only a few thousand. The bigger part of the migration is to other carriers such as O2, others, which then use unbundled local loop from us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon everyone. Just to following up on Justin's question earlier Ren&#xE9; you talked about the increase in European mobile data revenues non-messaging, you had a very big absolute increase in Q2 on Q1, close to 50 million where in previous quarters you've been moving at 20 million. And I didn't quite understand what was actually the driver of that. You mentioned accesses, but perhaps you could give a little more clarity on that? And on a second question, it seems like in the UK you're having to spend more to sort of try and standstill. Are you there for recognizing that perhaps your entire distribution model in the UK needs to be rethought because you're too dependent upon independents such as Carphone? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Guy, it's still &#x2013; still the question is, the answer is the same. The bigger, the biggest part of the increase in mobile data revenues is from revenues due to access to internet services. I mean access tariffs for mobile data, but of course there are a number of initiatives to improve the service offerings, i.e. the partnership with Yahoo! oneSearch, which we consider an industry leading mobile search experience which is in place since March 2008. If you look at our web'n'walk start page you will find the Yahoo! oneSearch which is quick and easy with good relevant results. And so that's an important thing.</p>
          <p>Then we have new partnerships with some of the most popular mobile community-based video and photo sharing, social networking platforms, YouTube, MySpace, Flickr and bebo and things like that. Then we have on the plans for this year, but that's not yet in place, a new mobile instant messaging service later this year. And there are a number of other initiatives to drive and promote the usage of mobile internet, mobile internet services. And basically, still the biggest part of the revenue comes from selling the access bundles and the access packages, that's I think true for across Europe. I hope that answers your question Guy, but what else can I say? I mean this is tariffs basically, access tariffs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, can you comment if you think your debt ratings are stable or do you expect to see them change again and also do you expect to wish you some new debt in the markets later this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randall, first and foremost, I think our debt ratings are stable, at least the rating agencies' language gives us confidence that the rating is stable, never predict the rating agency but for the time being I think it is stable. And I think that's also how the bond markets are seeing us and whether we are going to issue new bonds later this year is certainly very dependent on the debt capital market environment. Perhaps we would want to, but only if we are invited. As you know we have a significant liquidity reserve on our side, that's why we do not have to tap the markets, but if the market would invite us, perhaps we would take the opportunity, but only again if we would be invited.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just two questions, the first question is that although you were asked about customer behavior and you expressed it in terms of changing revenues, I wondered if you had been doing any recent research in order to determine if there are early signs of change in behavior. This may not yet be expressed in revenues, but you might take the view that they would in the future and I wondered if you had anything on that. That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If that question relates to the economy and its impact on customer behavior, things like change in bad debts also would be an indicator and the answer is we have not seen any relevant changes in for instance bad debts or payment moral overall. And I guess that's the strongest indicator which we can provide here.</p>

      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes, it's Will Draper calling from Execution. Just a general question really on your T-Mobile strategy. It appears from the quarter that you have quite dramatically cut acquisition costs and CapEx in order to support the EBITDA margin and the free cash flow generation from T-Mobile, that's excluding the US of course. I'm talking about the European properties. I wonder whether that signals a change in your strategy away from growth at the top line and towards maximizing cash flow, or am I reading too much into what is just one quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're reading a little bit too much into it. We have always been and we continue to be aware of SACs, not to go through the roof and not to be unjustified. And get good returns for the investment for a new customer. If you look at our net adds and our gross adds in contract in particular we have not gone out of the market at all. We have been pretty much in line with the market and we have kept a good share. For instance in Germany, it is true though that from I think in Q1 it was 91 million or so SACs in Germany, it is now 86 or something, so there were a few million less but I wouldn't read too much into it. Our SAC and marketing and spending policy on this is always of course also driven by economical considerations but also by strategy considerations. We wouldn't want for instance to give up market leadership easy, market leadership is important. It also impacts the long-term profitability. So, no, don't read too much into it. CapEx has been always seasonally a little impact to it, seasonally a little lower but Karl has more details on this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, to some extent I would want to contradict, we didn't cut CapEx in order to boost our free cash flow. Yes, we had a positive effect in the UK due to our joint venture. Again we had discussed and considered already but if I look into our CapEx development in comparison to last year, in the first semester i.e. over the first two quarters, we have increased it by a little bit more than 14%. And despite this increase of 14% in CapEx year-on-year, first two quarters, we have seen this nice increase of free cash flow up to 3.6 billion. And again I think there is always kind of a seasonality when it comes to cash out for CapEx spending. And we certainly have a very disciplined approach to our free cash flow, but it's not the way that we're cutting our CapEx to achieve our free cash flow.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, if I can follow-up on your comments as well as some of the questions about the unwillingness to use stock for any potential future acquisitions. And I don't want you to necessarily comment on speculation, I respect your wishes. But I'm wondering if a very attractive acquisition presented itself, how much would you be willing to increase leverage given your unwillingness to use stock, your target of two to three times, would you be willing to exceed that temporarily for a very attractive acquisition?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think we have always made it clear and this was true over the last, I don't know how many years that we do want to manage this company in a range between two or three times net to EBITDA and we have given this range in order always to have undisputed access to the capital markets and also always to have enough liquidity reserves. And this policy is unchanged and it's not going to change, so it is two to three times net debt to EBITDA, full stop.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thank you. I had a quick question on T-Mobile Germany. I wondered if you might be able to give us the actual minutes of use numbers, either the contract or a cost base and perhaps comment on what percentage of your contract base you think have now migrated on to some of the new cheaper packages that you've introduced in the last year? And then secondly, relating to something Dr. Eick said earlier on about buybacks, can you be a little bit more specific on the circumstances under which you think a buyback will be appropriate, is it to do with the level of your share price, the level of debt, is it something else? Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very quick on the minutes of usage probably on the contract side, because that is obviously the number you are looking for. These were 122 minutes on the second quarter 2007, we are now at 133, so that's a healthy increase of 9%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laura, question about buybacks. First statements, I think for quite some while we are not ruling it out any longer. But second statements we always have made it clear that the way to participate our shareholders in our free cash flow is our dividend payment, because what we do want to be is we want to be attractive in yield and we do want to be seen as the attractive dividend play for our shareholders. And this is also true for the future which is clearly the first priority. Again, we are not ruling it out, but I always have made it clear that this is something we would take into consideration if we would have surplus liquidity and surplus cash. Surplus liquidity and surplus cash means that we are further deleveraging to below two times net debt to EBITDA or that we would get some kind of surplus cash from asset disposals, which we could then redistribute to our shareholders. But again. first priority is we do want to be seen as an attractive dividend yield.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Well, never rule out any impairment charge in the future, because nobody knows how the share prices and how the equity capital markets are developing but for the time being, and as we discussed and as we talk, I would not anticipate an impairment charge of T-Systems in the second semester as we talk right now.

          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Two questions. First of all &#x2013; well they're both on T-Mobile Germany &#x2013; the level of CapEx does seem extraordinarily low and I suppose half of the network is shared with BBFN, but then elsewhere in your presentation you talked about femtocells for the first time. Could you give an indication on whether you think femtocells are going to have a widespread rollouts, what stage of a trial you are at in Cologne, Bonn and what are you paying at the moment for a femtocell? The second question is on T-Mobile margins and the reduction in cost that we have seen. Could you be a little bit more specific about what aspects of costs have been reduced year-on-year, so we can gauge how sustainable that is? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>The CapEx development you're referring to is not unusual. The level of CapEx in Germany in particular over several years has been very efficient. In some years I think we were as low as 4 to 5% on sales. Let me just double check where we said, I think the CapEx has even gone up a little bit in the comparison of the quarters by 20% or so to 73 million or whatever it was Euro. So, in the quarter so I don't &#x2013; I wouldn't interpret that at all as a reduction. However, we get much more for the dollar than we used to get in the past for various reasons, so our CapEx efficiency has gone up significantly. Femtocells roll-out, no, not yet. We're just trialing and I have no detailed reports on the trial yet to tell you. I mean it's too early, nor am I in a position to say what femtocells are going to cost us effectively once we go out into a big roll-out. That's far too early and it's a little &#x2013; to be very honest, a little too specific for me as well at this &#x2013; here in my role. I can't give you that detail, I have to check it up. And everything else, Stephan you want to add on the margins.</p>

          <p>If I could add on OpEx development in mobile, if this was one of the questions, more specific which costs we have reduced year-on-year in mobile, I think I would want to mention two effects. We have seen the reduction of our total amount of OpEx in mobile communications Europe cost by 300 million approximately. 50% of this is the benefit of the currency development specifically from the pound-euro conversion rate, another 50% comes from sales and service in Europe. And this sales and service goes across all cost lines and across all cost items. There is nothing specifically I would want to mention and as you know we are lean and we are seeing a very efficient European T-Mobile organization. That's why its not that much about head count reduction as we have in wireline and that's perhaps I think the flavor which I could give you when we talk about OpEx T-Mobile Europe.</p>
