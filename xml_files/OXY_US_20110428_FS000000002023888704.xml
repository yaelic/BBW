          <p>Good morning. My name is Christy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Occidental Petroleum 2011 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Mr. Stavros, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Christy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Occidental Petroleum's first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call this morning from Los Angeles are Dr. Ray Irani, Oxy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Chazen, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Bill Albrecht, President of Oxy's U.S. Oil and Gas operations; and Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas business. Our first quarter earnings press release, investor relations supplemental schedules and conference call presentation slides can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen, who will review the first quarter financial and operating results. Steve, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. I hope you can hear me better than I can hear you. Thank you, Chris. Core income was $1.6 billion or $1.96 per diluted share in the first quarter of this year, compared to $1.1 billion, or $1.35 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. Non-core items amounted to a net after-tax charge of $44 million.</p>
          <p>Non-core items included pre-tax gains of $225 million from the sale of the Argentina operations, and a $22 million gain from the sale of our interest in a Colombia pipeline. Non-core pre-tax charges included $163 million related to the early redemption of $1.4 billion face value of debt, $35 million write-off the entire accumulated cost of exploration properties in Libya, and non-recurring out of period charges for state and foreign tax of $62 million.</p>
          <p>This resulted in net income of $1.5 billion or $1.90 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011 compared to $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We reorganized our Permian operation in two business units this quarter. One unit will hold the CO2 flood assets and the other will operate the conventional production. In connection with these, we've moved the production from Southwest Texas, which was previously part of the Midcontinent and other, into the Permian. The Midcontinent and other includes production from the recently acquired South Texas and North Dakota properties.</p>
          <p>Natural gas liquids account for about 10% of our oil and gas volumes and sell at a discount to crude oil. Starting this quarter, we're reporting NGL and crude oil production sales separately as opposed to the previously disclosed combined liquids volumes. Please see the investor relations supplemental schedules for the 2010 quarterly realized prices and production sales volumes reflecting these changes.</p>
          <p>Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter. Oil and gas segment and core earnings for the first quarter 2011 were $2.5 billion compared to $1.9 billion for the first quarter of 2010. Realized prices increased 24% for crude oil in 2011, and 11% for NGL prices on a year-over-year basis, but domestic natural gas prices declined 25% from the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Sales volumes for the first quarter of 2011 were 728,000 BOE a day, a 6% increase compared to 685,000 BOE a day for the first quarter of 2010. The production guidance we gave you in last quarter's conference call of 740,000 to 750,000 BOE a day was at an $85 average price assumption. The actual first quarter oil price reduced our production volumes by about 10,000 BOE per day, including 1,000 BOE a day at THUMS in Long Beach in California.</p>
          <p>As we've previously disclosed our Iraq production was lower by about 9,000 BOE a day due to less than planned spending levels as we were in the startup phases of operations. Inclement weather, mainly in Texas, caused an additional reduction, about 7,000 BOE a day.</p>
          <p>These reductions were offset by less than expected production loss in the Elk Hills maintenance shutdown, and operational enhancements providing higher than expected production in Colombia, Yemen and Qatar, as well as the new assets resulting in production of 730,000 a day. Please see the production and sales volume reconciliation schedules in the investor relations supplemental schedules.</p>
          <p>First quarter production, 730,000 a day, was higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 production of 714,000 a day. First quarter volumes compared to the prior fourth quarter included 25,000 barrels a day from the new domestic acquisitions in South Texas and North Dakota. Sales volume, 728,000 a day, which is higher than our initial guidance of 725,000 a day, differ from production volumes due to timings of liftings, principally caused by Iraq, where liftings are expected in the later half of 2011.</p>
          <p>First quarter 2011 realized prices improved for all our products over the fourth quarter of 2010. Worldwide crude oil realized price was $92.14 a barrel, increase of 15%. Worldwide NGLs were $52.64 a barrel, improvement of 7%. And domestic natural gas prices were $4.21 per MCF, increase of 2%. Oil and gas production costs were $11.30 a barrel for the first quarter of 2011 compared to last year's 12-month cost of $10.19 a barrel. The increase reflects increased workovers and maintenance activity, and higher costs for energy.</p>
          <p>Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $2.25 a barrel for the first quarter of 2011 compared to $1.83 for all of last year. Total exploration expense was $84 million in the quarter. This amount included the Libya write-off of $35 million which is included in non-core items discussed earlier.</p>
          <p>Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2011 were $219 million, which were greater than our earlier guidance. These results are among the best ever reported for the chemical segment's first quarter of operations, which is historically a weak quarter due to seasonal factors. First quarter operations were positively impacted by strong export demand and improved supply/demand balances across most products, resulting in higher margins, including higher demand for calcium chloride resulting from the severe winter storms in the Northeast and Midwest sections of the United States.</p>
          <p>Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 (sic) [2011] (07:05) were $114 million compared with $202 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $94 million the first quarter of 2010. The decrease from the fourth quarter earnings were mainly due to lower marketing and trading income. The worldwide effective tax rate on core income was 40% for the first quarter of 2011, which was in line with our guidance.</p>
          <p>Capital spending for the first quarter of this year was $1.3 billion. About 88% was in oil and gas, 10% in midstream, the remainder in chemicals. We're currently operating 16 rigs in the Permian and 24 rigs in California, compared to five and 11 rigs respectively in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations the first three months of 2011 was $2.2 billion, which includes a build in our accounts receivable of about $1 billion for the fourth quarter. In addition, we received $2.7 billion in proceeds from the sale of assets and used $1.3 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, and $3 billion on acquisitions. We used $310 million to pay dividends and $1.5 billion to retire debt. We borrowed $1 billion at the end of the quarter for short-term needs which have now been repaid.</p>
          <p>These and other net cash flows reduced our $2.6 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $500 million to $2.1 billion. Free cash flow from continuing operations after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition and debt activities was about $500 million.</p>
          <p>Acquisitions &#x2013; our acquisition expenditure in the first quarter was $3 billion. These acquisitions included the previously announced South Texas purchase, and properties in California and the Permian. Excluding the South Texas purchase, these properties did not materially impact the first quarter volumes.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we will make a payment of about $500 million in connection with the signing the Shah Field Development Project. This amount represents development costs incurred by the project prior to the effective date of our participation. Future development costs reflected the capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the first three months of 2011 were $812.6 million, and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.4 million. Our debt to cap ratio declined to 12% compared to 14% the end of last year. Our remaining outstanding debt has an average interest rate of 3.7%.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to the current quarter, first quarter average oil price is about $95. Expect the second quarter oil and gas production volumes to be as follows. Domestic volumes are expected to increase to at least 425,000 BOE a day compared with the first quarter daily production of 404,000 a day. Latin America is expected to be comparable to quarter one volumes. In the Middle East region, where an overwhelming majority of the value, using either the SEC standardized measure or income, comes from Qatar including Dolphin, and Oman where the operations are running smoothly.</p>
          <p>With regard to second quarter production in the Middle East region, we expect no production for Libya. Production levels in Iraq are not easily predictable due to volatile spending levels at this early stage of that project. This is caused by the nature of the contract which allows, at anywhere near current oil prices, immediate recovery of expenditures through cost recovery barrels. As a result, the level of development spending in any given period has an immediate impact on volumes for that period.</p>
          <p>In Yemen, almost all of our production comes from concessions operated by others. In addition, the Masila Field contract, which produces net to us about 11,000 barrels of oil a day, is approaching expiration at the end of 2011, and capital spending is being phased down. These factors make it &#x2013; forecasting the production volumes from this area to be very difficult. For the remainder of the Middle East, we expect production to be comparable to the first quarter volumes.</p>
          <p>Total sales volumes are expected to be 725,000 BOE a day, which do not include any volumes from Iraq or Libya. A $5 increase in WTI would reduce our production sharing contract daily volumes by about 3,500 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our total capital spending program to $6.8 billion with about $500 million of the increase related to the Shah Field Development Program, subsequent to the effective date of our participation, and the remainder principally in California spending, attributable to additional permits being obtained.</p>
          <p>At current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $34 million. First quarter WTI oil price was $94.10 a barrel. At &#x2013; $1 per barrel change in WTI prices affects NGL quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $4 million. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $34 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4.25 an M.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $85 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration program. The chemical segment earnings are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. We expect continuation of the first quarter trends with sufficient gains from strong exports and seasonal demand improvement to offset the reduced contribution from the calcium chloride business. We expect our worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 39%.</p>
          <p>In California, we are continuing the program I discussed in last quarter's conference call, which is progressing with satisfactory results. Permitting, especially exploration permits, are still an issue, but we've recently obtained some permits that make us optimistic about increasing our second half capital spending plan. Governor Brown has been working to speed up the permitting process. We expect that his effort will be successful, which should enable us to increase our activity and add more jobs to the state. In the first quarter, we drilled and completed 26 shale wells outside of the Elk Hills field.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from David Heikkinen of Tudor Pickering Holt.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Steve, first wanted to talk about your Permian operations, with the division of CO2 flood assets and conventional production, can you give us what the current production is for each of those assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're actually breaking up so we couldn't actually hear the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, is that better? Is that better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a lot better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll speak really loud. So Permian operations...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Loud and slow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The CO2 flood assets and the conventional production, can you give us production amounts for each asset team?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bill I think can rough it out. We're not going to report that separately because it's a little confusing. But we can give you an idea for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, it's about &#x2013; on the CO2 side, it's about 140,000 or so BOE per day. And on the primary development side, it's around 60,000 to 65,000 a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on Shah gas, the $500 million payment prior to participation, how was that communicated or was that expected? Because we didn't have that in our expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first $500 million related to basically the historical costs, because they &#x2013; I guess they've been working on it for three years &#x2013; Sandy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They've been working on it for three years so that's the historical cost. We treat it as effectively a bonus payment, but it's really related to the cost. And some of it is actually accrued. The remaining $500 million is our estimate of what the capital will be for the remainder of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and as you think about the total cost of the project now, do you have any update as far as what that will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$10 billion is still a good number. We're currently reviewing all the engineering procurement contracts with the Shah team and $10 billion or $10.2 billion looks good to me right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we own 40% of that...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to remind you. So including the sunk...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the sunk's in the $10 billion too, so we're talking about about a $4 billion net to us. $500 million we've essentially already paid. We expect that $500 million will be either paid or accrued this year, another $500 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that was it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>...question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, can we just dig around in California a little bit more and try and work out really by the three elements that you've got going on there, how the satisfactory progress is going and where we'll go from here? Can you talk more about Kern County going forward, about other California if you like? And then I noticed you've said that you've got 26 shale wells drilled and completed. Can you talk about the production from those? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. The exploration program is slightly stalled from the permitting process. We hope at the back half of the year we can catch up. That's the pure exploration. I think we're doing very well on the shale exploration development. And that's actually progressing well, and the wells are &#x2013; we basically have caught up to where we needed to &#x2013; where we thought we would be and we're continuing to progress. We're getting a little better results from the completions than we were historically because we've probably figured how to do it better. The Kern County discovery, basically I don't think it'll change much until we move &#x2013; until we start drilling more of the deeper wells, which won't happen till we get closer to having a new gas plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's the latest on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So fundamentally we're shifting to an oilier, more predictable outcome for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just working backwards, the gas plant is back up from the turnaround I guess, and we then get a wait and see to development the second one, which I guess is still.../</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. It's back up but it's not exactly brand new.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and the next one, later...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next one is about in the first quarter of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you put some volumes around the shale exploration and development, in terms of any sort of additional data you can give us on what you're finding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd really like to wait another quarter if I could, because I've got some preliminary results now but having been burned on this in the last quarter &#x2013; last year, I'd just as soon be cautious about it. I've got some good results currently but we'll see if they continue for the next few months. But it's been &#x2013; it's really picked up nicely, and I think our completion techniques have improved. So I think we're doing better, but I'd like to put off more detailed discussion for another quarter, if I could. But there's nothing in here that's negative. If anything, it's slightly positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to try a couple please, if I may. Obviously the discussions you appear to have had with the Governor in California, can you give some indication as to what commitments you may have given in terms of your activity levels? Obviously it seems to be a highly politicized situation over there right now. And what's really behind my question is when we look at the Department of Conservation data, Steve, it's looking like you got a load of permits issued in March, like of the order of more than 90. And I just want to get a feel as to are we really starting to see a ramp up up there and what commitment have you made to basically raise your own activity levels obviously in the unconventional?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Governor's focused on jobs in California and so we've indicated that &#x2013; job creation as the permits come, which is fairly obvious but &#x2013; not something that's hard to figure. The permits that you're looking at there, a lot of those are development permits, which are sort of normal course of business things which we counted on. We did get some for an extension, not an exploration, but an extension of a discovery and some permits to drill there which I think will be good. So we're encouraged, but we really have a long way to go. We still have a nine-month backlog, roughly. So the boost there, a lot of that was the normal development stuff within the field which is not as contentious. And so I'd like to wait another quarter before we say that the tide has really turned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just a quick follow-up on that, the run rate up until March was about 10 or 12 it looked like, maybe 10 to 15 if we're lucky. And you did say on the last call you had about 107 permits to drill in the shales this year. Can you just say one, was that run rate about right, so is the step up correct? And second, is the 107 still a good number or is that moving higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's likely to move higher as the back half of the year comes. I mean we've indicated we're going to put more money in so I think we'll probably be higher at the back. I'm hoping it'll be higher at the back half of the year. There's some other issues floating around here that are sort of technical issues. But I think the big jump up in the early part of the year was drilling within fields, and then there's some on this extension, which was very positive because we focused with the Governor and others on this extension &#x2013; this field extension, which is very important to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, my only follow-up, Steve, is can you talk a little bit about the Lost Hills acquisition? Looks like a steam flood, but my understanding is there's also historical well data that suggests that there's some deep similarities to the discovery you had in Southern Kern County. So a little bit, if you could elaborate on that? And I'll leave it there, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, it's a very small amount &#x2013; relatively small amount of production. We have &#x2013; it was sort of a special situation. We own the minerals under a slug of it, so we could get significantly better economics at almost any price level than somebody else might. So &#x2013; and there's obviously some other opportunities there. But right now, it &#x2013; I don't think it'll add a whole lot until &#x2013; for several years. So it'll be a slow build up and I think it'll do fine. Obviously we've got a lot &#x2013; we're by far the largest gas producer in the state, and some cheap gas, to turn it into oil strikes me as a okay trade right now, although we're not bearish on gas over a multi-year period.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't report any &#x2013; so in the Q, I think we'll report the earnings rate of Libya, but it might be a penny in the earnings.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. And then if I'm looking at the Permian Basin view, and of course you guys control a lot of the pipeline systems in and around that area, how are you using your logistics assets to move some of that crude to market? And are you seeing any sort of significant discounts to that crude? Are you able to get higher realizations because of the assets you own?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is yes. We're doing I think better than the average there. We're not interested in solving the whole industry's problem with pushing. We're just interested in solving ours. So I think we're doing better. Our realizations company-wide are very good, and likely to improve into the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a way to quantify the kind of uplift that you guys got in the quarter from your domestic oil price realizations from owning those assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, because they pass it back to the &#x2013; they don't keep it in the midstream. They pass it back to the oil companies so we can pay royalties on it, so pretty hard to come up with a number. Generally speaking, our basic marketing business does about a &#x2013; putting aside the current situation, does about $1.50 a barrel better than a small producer would. It's clearly a lot wider than that now.</p>

First, Steve, in response to an earlier question, you said that you guys are just kind of climbing up the learning curve on the completions in the California shale wells.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe, it's mainly asset jobs driven. And we're just simply treating these wells, larger intervals, with more asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and what are the average lateral lengths running on your horizontal wells?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, got it. And then the second question for you, Steve, thinking about NGLs, last week Dow announced that long-term contract for ethane supply, what do you think the potential is there globally for similar contracts for you guys?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're looking at the oversupply of &#x2013; the future oversupply of NGLs, and we'll try to figure out how our chemical business can reap some of the benefits from that.

        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to the &#x2013; I guess there's two approaches here on California, bottom up or top down. I think on a top down basis, you've made a couple of statements about where volumes are expected to go. Firstly, I believe you've said that California will be bigger than the Permian for the full year of 2012. And I think in the past &#x2013; I haven't seen it recently in a presentation, you've talked about you'd...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>'12, '13 I think is probably what it &#x2013; was probably a better. I think I said the next couple years, so that would take me to the '12, '13 area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that would I guess mean 200,000 a day barrels of oil equivalent plus?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in the past you had in your presentation words to the effect of unconventional oil in California would achieve a similar level, i.e, I think it was to be the biggest business unit within I think it was 10 years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that would mean unconventional in California alone would be more than 200,000?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's &#x2013; yes, our biggest business unit is the Permian &#x2013; combined Permian. I didn't split it in two so I could make it easier, no.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, is there any other long-term statement of that kind that you can help us with, again just from a top down point of view for getting our arms around it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think those are pretty conservative statements that I think &#x2013; pretty easy for us to see how we can achieve that if &#x2013; we had little bumps in the road as you're aware. But I think once we get by the whatever you want to call it, the issues here in California, I think you'll see pretty good growth in the &#x2013; certainly in the shale production for sure. So I think that &#x2013; because we're focusing on that now because it's fairly predictable. We may not know what two wells will do but we certainly know what 100 will do. So I think we've got a pretty predictable program for the next year or so that'll allow us to build a base and then we can do some more exotic things, if you will.</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean there might be some that are less, sometimes more, but if you took an average around $3 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's real complete and hook-up, not just drill.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then we can move forward on the CapEx number that you've given us for California as the kind of word going forward on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd like to spend more, to understand, this isn't &#x2013; we're not limiting them. This is just an estimate for you so you can see what we think as sort of a &#x2013; what we think we can do, but we would like to spend more if this moves along faster.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much would each well produce, Steve, approx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's &#x2013; a reasonable guess and there's some variance around it, but on average around 400, mostly oil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, yeah, 400 barrels a day, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, 400...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's about 400 equivalent, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but heavily skewed to the oil side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand, yeah. And then I guess the obvious question to follow that up is what kind of declines is it going to show?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you're trying to get to the ultimate recovery, I think we're somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to see &#x2013; I figured if everybody's doing follow-ups, I might as well jump in as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're breaking up. Did he say he answered the question, is that what he said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, could you please repeat your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you're having some trouble hearing me, Steve. Can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can hear you now better. It's not perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry, I had a problem with the phone. I said if...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's your problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, if everyone else is doing a follow-up, I figured I would as well. I think what we're really all trying to get here is real simple. So let me try a couple here to see if we can frame it. Are you still comfortable with your 10-acre spacing and if so, how much of the acreage on your current 12-rig drilling program do you believe that you've de-risked out of the 1.6 million acres? And if you could just do the math for us and help us &#x2013; hold our hand a little bit on it, ultimately, when you talk about 200,000 barrels a day of unconventional production or greater as a conservative statement, what resource are we talking about in the context of supporting that? If you could just try help us a little bit with ultimately what you see as the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll try to do it without going nuts. The 10-acre spacing I think is fine. It's possible it could be less, but we'll say it's 10 &#x2013; less, meaning a number below 10. We're pretty comfortable that we've got more than 200,000 acres. That's fairly safe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're talking about 20,000 more locations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With 0.5 million barrels per location? I'm sorry, 0.5 million...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 400,000 to 500,000, whatever you want to use, doesn't...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what was &#x2013; is it only the permits then that's stopping you putting more money to work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Permitting and people. You've got to get the rigs and you don't want to destroy everything. But it's a combination of all those things. But that's sort of where we're headed over the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. One final follow-up if I may, completely unrelated, Wolfcamp activity, could you maybe just give us a little bit of color as to what you're doing there in the context of the overall Permian business? And I will leave it there, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're talking about the Berry stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everybody's &#x2013; it's a different Berry everywhere, so Bill will answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Doug, of the &#x2013; just to give you a flavor, of the 16 rigs that we currently have running in the Permian, right now six of those are drilling Wolfberry wells which as you know, is that interval between the Spraberry and the Wolfcamp. So we've got nearly 50% of our Permian development program designated to drill Wolfberry wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you give any kind of characteristics around the wells, Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean they make good returns. General IPs are somewhere around 150 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with ultimate recoveries of 200,000 or so BOE per well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there multiple horizons that you're targeting in terms of &#x2013; I hear talk of like seven different recompletions in some of these wells. Is that something you're seeing or again, if you could just elaborate on how you see the potential here, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Doug, it's a thick interval, as you know. And so we're doing multi-stage fracs on these intervals. So frankly, we're not leaving a whole lot behind in terms of recompletion potential. We'd like to open up the whole thing up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. Terrific, thank you.</p>
