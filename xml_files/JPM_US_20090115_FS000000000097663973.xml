      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody; thanks for joining us early this morning. We simply wanted to get our results out as soon as they were ready, so appreciate your patience in us moving up the time on this. As usual, we're going to do the presentation but I'm going to cover it pretty quickly since there's a lot of material in here but slow down on certain slides to really make sure I'm very clear about what is in them. And then we'll take some Q&amp;A at the end.</p>
          <p>If you start on the presentation, just quickly on the first slide, you see that our full-year profits for 2008 were $5.6 billion or $1.37 a share, driven down substantially from the prior year by higher credit costs of $22 billion. But really the point here is absorbing that substantial increase was the very high and strong pre-provision profit that you can see, the $73 billion of revenues less the $43 billion of expenses to give you $30 billion pre-tax pre-provision profitability, which is obviously a big part of the story as well across all the businesses.</p>
          <p>If you go to the next slide, slide two, I will only point out here that for the quarter, $702 million of net income or $0.07 of EPS, rather than spend time here as usual, it's best to go through this business by business, which I'll do. But first, let's just hit slide three and let me spend a minute just to flag for you what are the big items that are embedded in that $0.07 of results.</p>
          <p>So here on slide three, fourth-quarter significant items, you see a variety of negatives and positives which are baked in there, so just let's walk down them from the top. First one, four billion pre-tax increase to our loan loss reserves for $2.5 billion after tax; that brings our total loan loss reserves to $24 billion from 10 a year ago.</p>
          <p>The next item is 2.9 billion pre-tax of net markdowns on leveraged loans and mortgage exposures, the exposures we've been talking to you about for the last several quarters now and that's in the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>The next item, merger related items; that really reflects a gain related to the net positive impact of a variety of refinements to the purchase accounting estimates for WaMu, which as we said last quarter would get refined in the first quarter given that we did the deal five days before the end of last quarter, so it's negative goodwill. That flows to the income statement as a gain of 1.1 billion after tax.</p>
          <p>Next, MSR risk management results of 1.4 billion pre-tax, $900 million after tax, we just point this out because of the bigger than usual number and this is money we made taking some risk and the way we manage and hedge the change in value of the MSR asset in the mortgage banking part of retail.</p>
          <p>And then next is $1.1 billion pre-tax of private equity write-downs shown in corporate; and lastly as you saw in our 10-Q because this happened very early in the quarter, the 600 million after-tax Paymentech gain on sale. So with all those items just flagged for you in the businesses over to the right in which they appear, I won't harp on those again.</p>
          <p>Now let's just start with the Investment Bank on slide four. So let me start you up on the upper right side of the page in the box so you see net loss for the quarter of $2.4 billion in the Investment Bank, and this table is its own significant items table for the Investment Bank. The leveraged lending markdowns and the mortgage related markdowns flagged for you on the prior page and I will show you where we stand on those positions in a second.</p>
          <p>Credit costs, this is additions to reserves shown on the prior page, total four billion pre-tax for the firm, 700 million pre-tax in the Investment Bank in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And then the last item is the impact of spread tightening on structured liabilities, an item we've been talking about over the past several quarters for $700 million pre-tax. Those items come down to if you tax effect them but not comp effect just to be clear what I did here, that's $2.7 billion after-tax impact in the quarter where there wasn't a comp accrual is the way I did that.</p>
          <p>I'd just make one additional point that typically we see when our spread tightens and we have a reduction in value of our structured liabilities on the liability side, our counterparty payables on the asset side of the balance sheet tend to increase in value and have an offset. In this quarter, the spreads didn't behave in the same relationship, so actually what's known as CVA [Credit Valuation Adjustment], the value of our counterparty receivables adjustment actually was a negative, a meaningful negative number as well.</p>
          <p>So now if you just walk down the bullets in the P&amp;L, aside from those items that are in the box above, you see Investment Banking fees of $1.4 billion revenue. That's down 17% from a year ago. But we see on the next slide, I'll show you the continued leading market position that we have in corporate finance across all categories is very substantial. Next line, the $1.7 billion fixed income markets negative revenue for the quarter, if you net out the DVA leveraged loan marks and mortgage marks from above, that brings you back to 1.6 billion positive revenue. And really the story there is weak trading in the credit related products, offset again by continued very strong and record performance in rates and currencies and continued strength in commodities and emerging markets, which has been the story for the last several quarters.</p>
          <p>Moving now to equity markets, negative revenue of 94 million in total; if you net out the impact of spread tightening and that's 260 positive. So that's again weak trading, particularly it was weak trading results offset in part by strong client revenues, particularly in the prime service businesses.</p>
          <p>Next is credit costs driving the P&amp;L, 765, a little bit of charge-offs in the quarter. But again, the bulk of that is the nearly $700 million addition to loan loss reserve. That brings, as you can see in the table to the left, the allowance to total loans in the Investment Bank of 4.71%, up substantially from last quarter and last year, as you can see for yourself, 193 a year ago to 471 now. So while credit is degrading, we think we're doing what we should be doing to bolster the loan loss reserves through the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Lastly, expenses down 9%; lower compensation expense, a 63% comp to revenue ratio for the year, trued up in fourth quarter; and all that brings you down to the $2.4 billion bottom line losses that you see here in the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Next slide, on slide five you see the standing of the Investment Bank in the client franchise and you can look for yourself at this and you see how strong the current franchise position is and understand why despite the challenging environment that we're in, we're very confident about the ability to deliver the Investment Bank business strong results looking ahead.</p>
          <p>Slide six, I don't need to spend much time on, you've seen this before. But when you take the $1.8 billion of markdowns on leveraged lending, the 1.8 billion of markdowns takes us down to $12.6 billion of notional commitments remaining. That's a total markdown cumulative of 5.7 billion or 45% so the carrying value of $6.9 billion of market exposure is where we currently have our remaining legacy leveraged loans at $0.55 on the dollar on average. Obviously that goes loan by loan, name by name, piece by piece.</p>
          <p>Slide seven is then the last page on the Investment Bank, and it's just a recap of again what we've shown you last quarter. If you start in the box in the upper left, it's the aggregate exposures we have in these various residential and commercial mortgage exposures. Last quarter, we ended the quarter with $18.6 billion worth of exposure. You see in middle column 3.9 billion reduction in the quarter, and it ended at $14.7 billion. Obviously the marks came down. That was 1.1 billion of markdowns embedded in the $3.9 billion of exposure reduction, the bulk of that against the commercial exposure there where you see $9.3 billion of exposure at the end of last quarter, total reduction of 1.6 and then ending just under $8 billion.</p>
          <p>So moving past the Investment Bank, slide eight, I just wanted to show you how we are now for the first quarter including the operating results of Washington Mutual in particularly the remaining businesses here. So what I've shown and you'll see this in our supplement as well is the top half is the way JPMorgan Chase was reporting its businesses that were affected previously. And so at the bottom is how we've revamped some of our disclosures and I'll walk across that, across the bottom.</p>
          <p>The first two buckets are going to be the two new segments of disclosure within retail Financial Services. Retail Financial Services will still be one of our six business units, but we will break those results down into retail banking, which is going to be really the branch banking business as well as business banking and the related loans in business banking, and WaMu branches will go into that business; moving over then to consumer lending, and then for all the remaining lending activities aside from business banking, all the origination and balance activities. So that is home lending, education, auto, et cetera, will be shown and reported in this business as well as mortgage production and servicing, and again related WaMu activities reported beginning this quarter in there.</p>
          <p>And then over on the right side of the page, you see Card Services and Commercial Bank, disclosure exactly the same as before, but as we get to those businesses, you can look at the supplement and see we're just enhancing some of the disclosure items that are embedded in these businesses to help you understand what we picked up from WaMu where it's relevant.</p>
          <p>Slide nine I won't spend a lot of time on, but we just break down the key statistics that drive the P&amp;L for both retail banking on the top half of the page and consumer lending at the bottom, the way we always do. Just at the top half, I'd just point out the healthy underlying trends. We feel good about them, average deposits of $340 billion, up a bit year over year, ex-WaMu. And then in the case of WaMu, deposits have been stabilizing and have stabilized. That is reflective of the fact that we've been adjusting pricing and have not seen a runoff in deposits though, which we think is a good sign and very good for the business. Branch production stats are very strong as well. Obviously at the bottom, you see origination activities down, and that's driven by generally speaking the tighter underwriting standards that we've been talking about across the various portfolios.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, now the retail overall P&amp;L, so retail top few lines is just the consolidated retail financial services business earned 624 million for the quarter. But going to the pieces, the second bullet in the middle of the page on the left is retail banking, $1.040 billion of profit in the quarter, up 85%. Obviously that includes WaMu with total revenue of $4.5 billion for the quarter. That $1 billion number, just stare at that for a second. That is a powerful source of ongoing earnings that we are going to continue to invest in and grow, so we feel very good about the profit line in this business.</p>
          <p>Next, you go down to consumer lending, which I described what that is. And you see the net income loss of $416 million and that obviously includes to the negative the additional higher charge-offs &#x2013; credit costs rather, 3.3 billion which higher losses, as well as the addition of loan loss reserves which related to the residential real estate portfolio is 1.6 billion of the 4 billion of additions to reserves running through that 3.3 billion of credit costs. And then in the revenue line, non-interest revenue of $2.1 billion includes that positive MSR risk management result I talked about earlier.</p>
          <p>Next slide, slide 11, I just wanted before going through the stats on the key portfolios, just to show you a page that shows you how WaMu balances coming into our credit reporting is going to have an effect on our credit stats as you try to think about them versus the past and compare them to others. I'll just quickly run down the page. The first row of numbers is Chase, so that is legacy Chase consumer lending, 205 billion of balances, 1.5 billion of charge-offs, 2.98 charge-off rate for the quarter, and allowance against that of 7.4 billion or 3.62% coverage. When you add in the portion of the WaMu balances that we didn't impair, obviously that's a selection of loans that are performing really well, so that's $58 billion with zero charge-offs in the quarter. That will obviously grow over time and obviously had the conforming loan loss allowance that we put against it, but that's at a lower level than Chase. When you blend those two together, the charge-off rate comes down to 2.32 and coverage to 3.16. But that is the row, the blue line, the blue shading, you will see that row from hence forward in our supplemental disclosures and we really think that that is the relevant line looking at the credit stats related to our non-credit impaired consumer lending portfolio.</p>
          <p>We'll also show you the total including the impaired portfolio, which you see on the next line which is $89 billion. But obviously we marked that so that doesn't reflect charge-offs in it. So it further dilutes down charge-off rates and allowance coverage ratios.</p>
          <p>I'll quickly hit the next few slides. You've seen these before. The main point, if you look at the delinquency trends on the upper left is that delinquencies continue to go higher. If you move over to the upper right box, you see the dollar charge-offs in our home equity portfolio, which were $770 million in the quarter, charge-off rate of 2.67 and that's all in. When you look at just a portion of 95 billion or so, that's heritage JPMorgan, you see that same 770 drives a charge-off rate against the legacy portfolio of 3.24; obviously the loss trend up more dramatically than when you look at it on a blended basis. The key point is at the bottom, last bullet, so we do see continued deterioration. We expect that that 770 of quarterly charge-offs could progress towards $1 billion plus or minus per quarter over the next several quarters, hence the addition to loan loss reserves in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Next slide, same thing on prime, 195 million charge-offs in the quarter, 1.20 charge-off rate, 1.97 charge-off rate for heritage JPMorgan only, and that our quarterly loss outlook, bottom bullet again, could be as high as 400 million per quarter looking out over the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>And then on slide 14, subprime portfolio, 319 million of net charge-offs in the quarter, 8.08 charge-off rate all in, 9.76 for heritage JPMorgan, and the quarterly losses here could be as high as 375 to 425 a quarter over the course of 2009, similar guidance here to what we had before, nonetheless an addition to reserve there.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 is an important update, so let me take a second on this. We talked to you when we acquired the WaMu portfolio about some scenarios of expected lifetime losses. If you go to the table here, let me just refresh you. The first two columns, you see per prior presentation. We had said in our last presentation to you that our base estimates reflected US peak to trough HPI [Home Price Index] of down 25%, but that reflected working down the page $36 billion of remaining life losses from the beginning of 2008, which then had embedded in it 31 &#x2013; 30.7 billion remaining after the close. We also told you the next column over that if we got to a deeper recession, which we approximated could reflect a 28% peak to trough HPI, that the losses could go up by $6 billion and 42 and 36.7. We're going to stop talking about from the beginning of the year. So if you just look at that bottom line 31 up to &#x2013; 30.7 up to 36.7.</p>
          <p>Now moving over to the right, current outlook and this is market outlook because we haven't recranked every number in here, but the current market forecasts Case-Shiller, whatever you want to look at, Economy.com, would suggest that the peak to trough may go to something more like 31%. We refined or triangulated what our implied losses could be having had another quarter's worth of work to do; that against that kind of market outlook, the implied range of where losses could be, could be as high as 32 to $36 billion, to give you a freshened up view on that.</p>
          <p>Going down the bullets, the next important point is the second bullet. As we also refined our accounting on the balance sheet, current marks reflect 32.5 billion of remainder of life losses. So that puts us marked and accounted for at the bottom end but inside that range of where current market expectation is.</p>
          <p>The next important point is that losses that we've actually taken thus far &#x2013; it has been very early &#x2013; are actually in line with losses and delinquencies, in line with what was embedded in our valuation so far. And then last point is that how to think about this is that when you would have future additions to loan loss reserves, that would happen if and when the actual delinquencies and losses started to exceed what was embedded in our initial expectations. So I'll leave it at that. You will hear more at Investor Day. It's very early but we know this is an important topic, so we wanted to just give you a freshened up view of that.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Card Services, slide 16, I'll pick up the pace a little bit. Here you have &#x2013; I'll just make the point if you look at the key stats on the left side of the page, the P&amp;L is all in. This is what's in our disclosure supplement. This includes the WaMu portfolio embedded in all the P&amp;L data: revenue, credit costs, expense, and profit. But for the key stats in order to give you all a better trend of what is going on in larger Chase business, we're going to show you stats excluding WaMu as well. For the most part, those will be stats that I try to refer to in terms of how trends are behaving across the business.</p>
          <p>So working down some of these bullets here, you see loss for the quarter of 371 million. That was really driven by the 4 billion of pre-tax credit costs, up substantially year over year. And that's both due to higher credit costs as well as an addition to loan loss reserves of $1.1 billion in the quarter. You see the charge-off rate circled at bottom of the table of 5.29 in the fourth quarter, which is basically in line with our last outlook. But now looking ahead, we do see that loss rate for 2009 beginning the year at something more like 7% and progressing across the year through to something more like 8%. Again, that is on an ex-WaMu type of basis, so consistent with the guidance that we've talked about before. I won't run through the rest of the stats on the page, but you can see them for yourselves there.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the next slide, 17, Commercial Bank, $480 million of net income is a record quarterly number for this business and that would be the case without the inclusion of WaMu, so continued strong results in the business here. That's on record revenue for the quarter of $1.5 billion, up substantially year on year. And you can just look at the balance sheet stats, second bullet describes them to you, but the loan liability balance is up 17%, loan growth up 11%, so that's 117 billion of loans, 114 billion of liability balances, a very well funded business. Of that loan growth, you see 11% year over year. Embedded in that is 37% growth in the government and not-for-profit business. Jamie is going to talk a little bit about the lending we've been doing, but you can see it really here in this business. And then credit costs of 190 billion, some signs of weakening of credit stats here, so a little bit of increased charge-off, 40 basis points, as well as some loan loss addition here.</p>
          <p>Treasury and Securities Services on slide 18; $533 million worth of record profit, up 26% from a year ago. That's on record revenue again in both Treasury Services and worldwide Securities Services in the quarter, $2.2 billion total revenue, up 17%, and again the big driver of that is growth in the balance sheet here. So you see $336 billion of liability balances, up 34%, and we're seeing tremendous influx of balances in this kind of environment, which obviously could abate. Looking ahead, we'll see. And also just looking ahead, we're conscious of the lower rate environment, which could also put some pressures on spreads in this business as well as in the Commercial Bank on their liability balances.</p>
          <p>The last business, slide 19, Asset Management quarterly profits of $255 million, down 52% year over year, obviously driven by what's going on in assets under management. So you see assets under management down 5% with $211 billion of market related declines, offset in part by continued strong inflows, 61 billion for the quarter, 151 billion of inflows over the past year. But most of that obviously in liquidity products, lower margin hence the impact on revenues, so quarterly revenues of $1.7 billion were down 31% year over year.</p>
          <p>Slide 20, Corporate/Private Equity, so just walking down the table, I've hit these numbers before for you, so 1.1 billion of private equity losses, write-downs to 6.9 billion of carrying value. That translates into a 700 million after-tax loss. Corporate is slightly over $1 billion of profit. A big piece of that is the Paymentech gain running through that line. The last piece of Corporate is the merger related items, which includes the extraordinary gain on WaMu offset in part by the Bear Stearns related and WaMu related merger expense.</p>
          <p>I'd just make a comment here; the merger related items, this number probably plus or minus 600 million after tax in 2009, blending together WaMu and Bear Stearns, which is consistent with what we've talked about before.</p>
          <p>Lastly, before I hand it over to Jamie, Capital Management, slide 21; it's important to note that we continue to maintain an extremely strong capital position. So you see Tier 1 capital, 136 billion, up from 89 billion a year ago and 112 billion last quarter. That translates on a regulatory basis to a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8%, up from 8.4% a year ago and 8.9 last quarter. Looking further down those ratios in the table, I'd also just point out very strong tangible capital ratios aside from the regulatory capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Just a few more points on the bottom left side, you've really got &#x2013; I wanted you to realize we're talking Tier 1 capital under a Basel I regime. While we're not on it yet, we're working towards it and understand that Basel II would be higher for us if we reported on that basis. The second point is that really maintain capital strength while managing the other part of balance sheet strength which is the credit reserve side; that's up to 24 billion, as I said earlier, from 10 billion one year ago, and all that ran through the P&amp;L. So to maintain the capital account the way we did goes back to the wide pre-tax margins we had pre-provision.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, I just wanted to flag for people because there has been a lot of concern around the off-balance sheet accounting rule changes, so SFAS140 and FIN46R. While these aren't yet released, we put a little table here in the bottom right so you can look at it yourself to give you an estimate of what it might mean to us. And the point for us is that we look at this all the time and on forward basis are managing capital with this stuff in mind. And you see when you flip to the 10-Q balances that a lot of people see of what is off-balance sheet, walk that across to what the GAAP asset impact might be. These are best estimate and translate into RWA under Basel I. It could be something like 80 basis points maybe plus or minus. But obviously that will depend on what the final rules actually look like and when they get implemented.</p>
          <p>With that, I will hand off to Jamie to fill in any outlook comments that I may have missed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I just have a few comments; then we'll open it up to questions. On the Investment Bank, I think there are two things I'd like to talk about. One is the results on the client side have really been exceptional. The market share gains, I think it's true on investment banking. And on trading, we see a lot more client flow and we think we're going to do very well servicing investor and corporate clients.</p>
          <p>We get asked a lot about Bear Stearns and the impact of Bear Stearns. I hesitate to say this a little bit. We still expect to get $1 billion of earnings from Bear Stearns late in '09, predominantly prime brokerage doing well and energy and commodities, but it also helped and aided our business in equities since they come, and really across the board we got some pretty good bankers in the deal. However, it is hard to separate out positions that we inherited that we decided to keep or didn't hedge right, something like that.</p>
          <p>But when we took on Bear, we did take on a lot more risk assets and we got them down substantially. We probably lost several billion dollars more than we would have in the year had we not done Bear. And again, it's hard to really separate what was our responsibility and what we had because we could have sold some of the things we inherited.</p>
          <p>The retail business, we're working hard at WaMu. We're still very excited about it. I think this is still approximately what we told you last time it was going to do for this company. We're very excited about the ability to build small business, private banking, asset management, and middle market on top of the retail branch platform there. We hope to consolidate all of WaMu's systems by the end of the year. That is the point where we get very comfortable about how we can grow it. We will be changing the brand in California at the end of March. We're going to get some points by starting to use the new name in California.</p>
          <p>You might have saw it yesterday; we closed the mortgage business, which we are obviously a very big player and we still think we're going to get very good at it. Though we don't know the real ongoing profitability of all the mortgage business, we did close the remaining broker business that we did, mostly in the prime side. And we just think it was the smart thing to do because a lot of the business that came through that side was just not our kind of quality.</p>
          <p>Card, Mike gave you some numbers where losses will be higher. We don't totally see that yet, but we are assuming unemployment is going to go up and obviously, that's going to drive Card. We also owe you &#x2013; we're not going to do it now, some comments on the new UDAP [Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices]. So I think when we have Investor Day about what that might mean for the business and how we might adopt the changes to UDAP, suffice it to say here it probably will drive profits lower and reduce the amount of credit you can make availability and the way you can make it available to consumers, but we think we can adjust to it over time in a very reasonable way.</p>
          <p>Commercial Bank, all I can say is just really great results; you can see the reserves; NPL is incredible. It hasn't gone up that much. They have to go up. You cannot have an environment like this where you don't see a lot of stress and strain on middle markets. We do expect loss to go up there.</p>
          <p>Treasury and Securities Services, gangbusters; I think one of the important things there to keep in mind is we didn't have many of the pitfalls. So we feel really good how we run that business.</p>
          <p>Asset Management results down because obviously assets under management are down. I think the important thing here also is we have grown the business, more bankers, more net inflows, and we also stayed away from the pitfalls that have beset some of the folks in that business.</p>
          <p>Mike mentioned the balance sheet. We think we're in very good shape. I should add that we did add &#x2013; and you see in the supplement that our investment portfolios at the parent have gone from $116 billion to over 160. As we try to invest some of the excess liquidity we have, it drives some of those ratios down, but it's completely discretionary on our part how to use that. In the short run, it drives slightly higher income in corporate as we buy some of those portfolios.</p>
          <p>I wanted to mention two other things that are important. Really one of the things, we started this Way Forward campaign about all the things JPMorgan is doing to help the system, to help our clients, small business, middle market, investment banking, and there is going to be a lot more coming about that. You have seen, I think we've been at the forefront of mortgage modifications. We have some more information about that coming up in a day or so because we think there are more things to do to help keep people in their homes and do a better job for the consumer.</p>
          <p>And also in the press release, we announced also that in the quarter, we extended new credit of over $100 billion because there have been a lot of questions about whether banks are making loans. I think we are speaking for lots of banks, people are out making loans. This quarter alone, I think we did 4 million new credit cards. So we extended credit card loans, corporate loans, middle market loans. We bought a 1.4 billion bond issue where no one else would bid on it from Illinois. We are in business. Some businesses, the loan demand is actually dropping rather dramatically.</p>
          <p>We've also in the interbank market. We have had on average 40 or 50 billion out in the interbank market. That is also a form of lending. So people ask are banks lending to each other, I think some are and trying to help the system that way. All this is helped by the TARP. We think it is a valid question of people to ask what you are doing with this TARP money. We do say it's hard to separate exactly what is TARP money because remember, we're making loans all the time. But we are trying to follow the intent and spirit of TARP, which is to help the economy of the United States recover and make sure we're fair to people. We even have done some major large syndicated leveraged finance loans. I will mention two, InBev and Mars, but there are several others.</p>
          <p>We are still in business. Obviously the cost of money is higher for clients and people have tightened up some of their underwriting standards, but we're still in business. We're still trying to do the best we can both for our shareholders and the country.</p>
          <p>We will stop there and open for questions, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Jamie and Mike, curious to get your thoughts on a lot of talk going back and forth on loan remodification laws and potential principal reductions. You have done a lot of loan remod on your own, but I don't know if there has been a lot of principal reduction involved. Just thoughts for you guys but really for the industry in general on what potential impact that could have on both acceleration of losses, but also just the state of the securitization markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so we are really trying to figure that out. All I'm going to say at this point is it's legislation. We don't know if it's going to get passed or not get passed. I do think it could have a pretty chilling effect on consumer lending in general and drive up bankruptcies in general if people go to the bankruptcy courts more. But you really have to wait until specific things come out to see what the GSEs do, FHA, and all the real specifics around it. We're reserving final judgment on how that would work.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we're going forward with what we think are very good programs to modify mortgages. Sometimes they include principal reduction. Remember the really important thing for consumers is much more affordability and cash flows. Principal is an artificial concept when you talk about cash over a long period of time. So people can afford a home; that's what you really want to do. It's also very important in mortgage modification to reunderwrite, to do real income verification, real appraisals to make sure the people can and want to live there, and to do the second time around maybe what wasn't done so well the first time around.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In what kind of timeframe can the system do it? Let's say we have come a new mantra going forward. Let's say everybody adapted JPMorgan's efforts. Doing it one at a time like this seems difficult whether you go direct or through a bankruptcy judge. What kind of timeframe can we get there, whatever there means?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think most of the companies are doing it have really staffed up a lot to be able to handle these kinds of things. In any event no matter how you do it, you're going to do it one by one. That is the right way to do it. It's a lot of work. But obviously when the home prices stabilize, the foreclosures will start to go down a little bit, and we'll get through it.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, a numbers question. Mentioned margins up like 50 basis points. Net interest income was 80% of revenues, obviously a weak revenue quarter. But most of it comes on the liability side. You mentioned in the remarks a little bit, but at what point do lower interest rates start to turn that around and start to actually be a hindrance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's tough to say, Glenn. We're trying to manage our way through that as we speak. The best visibility we have would be that margin ex what goes on in the Investment Bank I hope would be stable percentage-wise looking ahead. But we have to see how we do managing to operate around this very, very low interest rate environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I can't help but ask, you grew the corporate portfolios. What are you buying there? I did notice a bunch of CLOs being purchased in the fourth quarter. I'm assuming that's part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Remember, we got a lot of new deposits in, so we bought a lot of mortgages. We've been doing a little bit of CLOs, a little bit of other credit related product. You're going to see us do that. We're getting some enormous spreads. We think some of them are very safe and sound. And we want to make money in that portfolio, but we're being cautious about how we do it. And we don't have to do all this at once. We're not making any big bet for the company.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I was wondering, a couple questions in Card. The outlook for the first quarter almost a 200 basis point increase and the net charge-offs in your outlook. Just wondering are you seeing that in the delinquencies yet? Did you see a sharp acceleration in December in the delinquencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did not see a sharp increase in delinquencies in December. I think I mentioned that we don't have full visibility of why it would go to 7%. That is a little bit of a guess that the economy is worse and unemployment is going to hit the 7.5 or 8% number. But we're just saying if that happens unemployment, credit card loss will simply go up. We don't know for a fact that's going to happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's more driven by your unemployment outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Card business as well, does margin get any benefit from the improvement in TED spreads over the past couple weeks and what would be your outlook on the Card margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer, it does. What really happened is it had a big negative in the third quarter and a little bit of recovery in the fourth quarter. I think we did say &#x2013; I forgot the number -- it cost us &#x2013; at one point, it was costing $100 million a month. That's disappearing, so it doesn't really benefit us next year. It's just the extra cost disappears. Some of that cost, by the way, ends up as a benefit in corporate because we get the benefit on the other side of that in other places of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the outlook on consumer balances, card balances, the consumers are delevering and you worry about adverse selection, do you expect to grow card balances or are you looking to grow card balances in this environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is John, right? It's very hard to tell because what we see is the consumer is spending less, so card spending was down a very dramatic 8% in the fourth quarter. Payments are way down too. So balances, we don't know how those two are going to intersect. What we do know and I believe is that our share is going up. Remember, we are very prime. So we think we're in more a secure part of the segment and we've added a lot of clients. We continue to market. It's just very hard to tell what's going to happen to balances next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last quick question, WaMu if you put together everything that you talked about, did you get roughly $0.10 as you expected this quarter contribution from WaMu in your estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think ex the extraordinary gain, I think it was a little bit better than $0.10.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and no change on the Bear, as Jamie said, in terms of a $1 billion run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The thing about that is it takes time to ramp up. We talked about the fourth quarter exit rate of '09 being the incremental profitability of about $1 billion after tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there positive contribution to overall JPMorgan this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think I already said that and I'm not going to talk about the quarter specifically, and it's hard to separate because we took on Bear. We consolidated their risk positions. We obviously started making decisions what to buy, what to sell, what to hedge and not to hedge. It did add a lot of risk position to our company in areas we already had risk like the SP, securitized product, leveraged loans, some credit. And it did cost us net-net, however you look at it, several billion dollars this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that several billion, unlike other things, didn't really have the offset of comp because we're not punishing everyone in the Investment Bank for the fact that Bear cost our Investment Bank. And I think our people in the Investment Bank just did an exceptional job assimilating the people of Bear, the systems of Bear, and trying to really manage and de-risk in what turned out to be a terrible environment.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. You talked quite a bit about the loan growth that you have been generating and gave some examples. Could you also give us a sense as to generally speaking how much of the growth is line extension on pre-existing commitments versus new relationships?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're not going to do that right now, but I think we are going to try to give more information about new credit, renewals of credit. Renewals of credit are credit and I don't want to get into the game to act like we're obligated to renew credit all the time. We are going to do that, the reason we said 100 plus is because we want to make sure we get the right numbers out there. But you will see us give some numbers like that. Middle market, large corporate, even our investment portfolios, as I mentioned, we added 50 to $60 billion. Remember, that is extending credit too. We probably bought more mortgage securities than the government did this quarter.</p>
          <p>That's a bit of an exaggeration, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then can you give us your updated thoughts about how you're thinking about the dividend given the [audio skip] for continued difficult environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're exuberant when raising the dividend and this company has enormous earnings power. We feel an obligation to pay the dividend, so we feel pretty good about it and so we're not that concerned about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there anything with regard to how you're thinking about dividend relative to having the TARP and how you think through returning TARP money versus paying the dividend out? Is that all part of the thought process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess one is we feel an obligation to our shareholders that you tell them when you raise the dividend and you intend to pay it. It should be consistent and steady. I guess we never raised it to exorbitant numbers, so it wasn't something that was a yoke around our necks. The TARP depending on how you look at it is a three to five-year preferred or something like that, and so it's not directly comparable. We will eventually repay the TARP and move on when we get through this. Right now you can't repay the TARP because part of the agreement was that it wasn't repayable without being replaced and you can't replace that kind of think in today's market.</p>

          <p>Can you talk about Investment Bank strategy? Are you looking to contract, maintain, or expand in absolute terms and relative to peer? Are you looking for big market share grabs? And the reason I ask, it looks like your compensation is going down a little bit year over year. Are you willing to pay a little bit more to get better talent and get better share?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think part of the compensation does relate to what I mentioned about Bear Stearns. We hope to gain share, but there will always be tough competitors in the investment banking business. I think the investor side, trading, client trading, we have &#x2013; and it's hard to tell that we gained share, but if you look at surveys and Greenwich and other things and anecdotally, it looks like we have. We certainly have in equity cap trading. So we hope to gain share there.</p>
          <p>And the investment banking side, covering corporate clients, ECM, DCM, M&amp;A, and stuff like that, we gained share. This is a hard &#x2013; this is a tough business. We don't assume that it will be easy going forward. And we'll keep investing in the parts of the business that we think will grow, and obviously there are parts of the business which have changed and you disinvest a little bit and that would be in areas you know about: partially securitized products, some structured products, et cetera. You're just not going to have the volume you had before.</p>

          <p>Getting back to expenses and highlighting on stuff that you talked about with the Investment Bank, given the fact it is such a large percentage of your overall comp structure and the environment is so different and the business is going in such a different direction, how do you resize that business? And a larger question which is you guys are the poster children for realigning so many businesses, integrating so many businesses, how long do you imagine the restructuring of the core expense structure within the banking industry takes and that's important to relending of course. And I have a last question after that, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Investment Bank, obviously a lot of the change you see taking place in the Investment Bank and I think Steve Black and Bill Winters have been pretty aggressive in resizing and responding to the environment. What we don't want to do is overreact and not do a good job servicing our clients. Job number one is to make sure that we are in the market servicing the client, trading, calling on clients, and so we're not going to have an overreaction. We don't think those businesses are going to go away. Like I said, we think some of them are. I think the way you look at it and I don't have the head count numbers in front of me, but when we added Bear Stearns, we said it would add 6,000 people to the IB net. I think the head count looking forward is going to be more like as if you didn't add Bear Stearns at all. So we probably eliminated somehow in all the things we do another 6,000 jobs, and that will come also down during the course of the year as some of the plans we put in place are implemented Does that answer your question? <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That sounds consistent with what you said before, yes. And then lastly, given change, given the fact that obviously everyone is looking to monetize and get as much capital to their core franchise as possible, do you have additional spare parts, divestitures? And conversely, do you have appetite for spare parts, acquisitions, meaning a prime broker that comes available? I'm just throwing out situations. Can you comment on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so acquisitions, we would never say never, but obviously we're busy with Bear Stearns and WaMu, both of which we think are important to do and to do right. The hurdle rate would be really high to do an acquisition. The price would have to be really good, the ability to execute unquestionable, and the business logic unquestionable. So we're not out there looking. If that happens, obviously we'll think about it over time. And the second one, divestitures, there is nothing on the table that we plan to divest.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, you spoke about bringing down deposit costs in WaMu franchise. Can you just tell us how generally you're doing that? Are you doing that by product or by region, and what has the reaction been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll get deeper into it in terms of Investor Day. But as you know, the need to hold deposits was causing WaMu to be a price leader on particularly time deposits, but really across the board. As we model the deal and as Charlie and team are actually executing, we're looking to just bring pricing state by state, region by region, into better line with the way we do it in Chase markets in terms of the company's overall cost of money with a view to the local market conditions. So anywhere state by state, we both look at overall cost of money to the company together with franchise value when we price things.</p>

          <p>It's about money. We're attracting hot money and we don't need it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Despite that, we are doing okay, keeping total balances pretty flat to where they were with some churn away from fast money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just give us your very rough impression in the quarter of whether the pricing reductions at WaMu, I mean how much they kicked in to NIM or took away from NIM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I'll point you to on the retail slide, you can see it's embedded in here, but it's part of the impact of overall deposit margin in the retail business, which stayed around the 3% type of level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's within what we expected because we knew we would do some of that. Obviously, there are a lot of changes in the rate curve and deposit cost. But net-net, it's all probably a wash.</p>
