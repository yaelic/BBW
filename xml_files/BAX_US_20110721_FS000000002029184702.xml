          <p>Thanks Sean, good morning everyone and welcome to our Q2 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International and Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product development and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and of course our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, in today's call non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, thanks for calling in. We're pleased this morning to announce financial results for the second quarter and also provide you with an update on our full year 2011 outlook.</p>
          <p>As you all saw in the press release that was issued earlier this morning, adjusted EPS of $1.07 per diluted share exceeded guidance for the quarter and increased 15% versus the prior year. This performance was a result of double digit sales growth, operational leverage, foreign currency favorability and the benefit from our ongoing share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Second quarter sales growth after adjusting for FX was 6% as growth improved on a sequential basis across multiple categories in BioScience. Year-to-date sales growth again after adjusting for FX and the revenue adjustment in 2010 was 5% and EPS accelerated 10%. While Bob will provide more details on Baxter's financial results for the first half of the year in just a few minutes, as indicated in the press release issued this morning, we have raised our full year sales guidance on a reported basis as well as our full year earnings guidance before special items.</p>
          <p>While we're pleased with improving fundamentals an enhanced financial performance as evidenced by our first half results, I'd highlight that we continue to navigate through a challenging macro environment that's evolving on a global basis and continues to exert ongoing pressures on our business and the healthcare industry more broadly. Having said that, we're particularly vigilant in monitoring the external environment and remaining focused on accelerating future growth by leveraging the broad and diverse nature of our product portfolio, our geographic reach and capitalizing on the unique opportunities for expansion that our new product pipeline affords. In fact during the quarter, we did achieve a number of mile milestones that reflect enhancements to our commercial, operational and scientific effectiveness and I'll mention just a few.</p>
          <p>For example, the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump received the Best in KLAS award for smart pumps in the 2011 Top 20 2011 Best in KLAS Awards for medical equipment and infrastructure report. This award represents the aggregate opinions of healthcare executives, purchasing managers and clinicians for more than 4,500 hospitals and reflects the high level of customer satisfaction with the Spectrum Pump, which scored the highest in overall performance, reliability and delivery of technology.</p>
          <p>We also completed the acquisition of Prism Pharmaceuticals and launched NEXTERONE, the first and only ready to use premix formulation of the antiarrhythmic agent Amiodarone. Given this drug is typically administered to patients in extremely time sensitive situations, the benefits of a ready to use premix form allows for immediate use and reduces the potential risk of medication errors. We believe this unique product satisfies unmet clinical needs, offers an opportunity to expand the current market and has the potential for application in additional geographies outside the United States.</p>
          <p>We're pleased that data from Baxter's Phase II CMI adult stem cell program was recently published in circulation research. Results demonstrate that injection of the patient's own CD-34 plus adult stem cells into targeted sites in the heart have therapeutic benefits such as reduced angina episodes and improved exercise tolerance. More than 850,000 individuals in the US experienced refractory angina associated with CMI and have not responded to other therapeutic options. We look forward to moving into Phase III clinical trial later this year.</p>
          <p>We also continue to be successful in driving differentiation of GAMMAGARD LIQUID by offering various dosage presentations, enhancing delivery options and expanding the number of indications. For example, earlier in the quarter, we introduced the first and only 30-gram dose vial for GAMMAGARD LIQUID in the US. This new dosage form is the most frequently prescribed dose for primary immune deficiency patients and enhances user convenience, and we're pleased with the rapid pace of customer adoption since the launch.</p>
          <p>I'd mentioned that FDA approval for GAMMAGARD LIQUID 10% Sub-Q is imminent. We plan to launch Sub-Q in the US during the third quarter and participate in this fast growing segment of the market. We recently submitted the biologics license application to the FDA for approval of HyQ, allowing for the enhanced subcutaneous administration of immune globulin with recombinant human hyaluronidase for patients with PID [primary immunodeficiency]. This submission is based on results from a Phase III trial which met both its primary and secondary ends points. We're currently in the process of preparing our submission for approval in Europe and Canada and expect to communicate final results later in the year.</p>
          <p>As you all know Baxter is conducting Phase III clinical trials exploring the use of GAMMAGARD LIQUID as a therapy for two neurological conditions. The first is a trial for the treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy or MMN. We continue to be on track to complete the trial in the US and Canada later this year and submit for approval in 2012. Additionally during the second quarter, we received a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency to include MMN as a new approved indication in all European member states. This represents the first and only centrally licensed indication for MMN in Europe.</p>
          <p>And finally, we continue to advance our Phase III trial for Alzheimer's, as we've now completed enrollment in our first Phase III trial with more than 360 patients. With an 18 month follow-up period, we currently expect to complete the trial by the end of 2012. In addition we plan to initiate a second confirmatory trial before the end of this year.</p>
          <p>As we previously stated, accelerating innovation is the cornerstone of our future success. Given this important strategic imperative, we expect R&amp;D spending to ramp in the second half of this year as we further advance our pipeline with continued development of hemophilia therapies including our longer-acting factor VIII therapy and recombinant <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:49) programs and initiate several clinical trials such as the second Phase III trial for Alzheimer's, a Phase III adult stem cell trial for patients with CMI, and also begin the first trial evaluating our home hemodialysis device.</p>
          <p>As always, I'd be happy to address any questions on these programs and others during the Q&amp;A, but we look forward to updating you on the achievement of additional R&amp;D milestones throughout the remainder of the year. So with that, I'd now like to ask Bob to review our second quarter financial results and also our guidance for 2011. Bob.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob and good morning, everyone. Let me briefly walk you through the P&amp;L by line item for the quarter before turning to our revised financial outlook for 2011.</p>
          <p>Starting with sales, worldwide sales totaled $3.5 billion in the second quarter and advanced 11%. Excluding foreign currency, sales grew 6% which compares favorably to the guidance we provided of 4% to 5%. This is primarily the result of robust growth in plasma proteins and antibody therapies as well as better than expected vaccine revenues and the benefit of unplanned sales of approximately 20 million related to the US multi-source generic injectables business divested in early May.</p>
          <p>In terms of individual business performance beginning with BioScience, global BioScience sales of $1.6 billion increased 14% in the second quarter. Excluding foreign currency, BioScience sales increased 10%, reflecting a sequential improvement in the growth rate of 6 percentage points versus growth in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Within the product categories, recombinant sales of $570 million grew 9%. Excluding foreign currency, sales improved sequentially on a global basis and increased 3% driven by improved growth outside the US. Excluding the impact of the UK tender, which has now been substantially annualized, recombinant growth was in mid single digits globally and international growth was in high single digits.</p>
          <p>Moving on to plasma proteins, sales in the quarter were $363 million and increased 16%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales rose 11% due to strong demand particularly outside the US for FEIBA, Albumin and plasma derived factor VIII. More than 70% of our plasma revenues are outside the US where growth on a constant currency basis was 20% and offset lower sales in the US. The 6% decline in the US was driven by a short-term backorder situation for ARALAST and the impact of higher rebates on FEIBA due to a significant increase in patients reimbursed by Medicaid.</p>
          <p>In antibody therapy, sales of $381 million increased 23%. Excluding foreign currency, sales climbed 21% driven by robust demand. This performance continues to reflect the success we have had with our commercial strategies and the benefit related to meeting volume previously served by Octapharma which for the quarter was an incremental $30 million to $40 million in sales.</p>
          <p>Sales in regenerative medicine, which includes our biosurgery products, totaled $147 million and increased 11%. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 6% driven by double digit growth of surgical sealants and hemostats. This growth was partially offset by lower ACTIFUSE revenues triggered by a temporary disruption in the channel resulting from a recent integration related decision to transition from the ApaTech distributor model to primarily a direct sales model which is consistent with our current go-to-market strategy within the biosurgery business.</p>
          <p>Finally, revenues in the other category, which includes vaccines totaled $92 million, increasing 21% versus the prior year. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 12% due to strong growth of FSME vaccine in Europe.</p>
          <p>In Medical Products, global sales in the second quarter totaled $2 billion reflecting an increase of 8% on a reported basis. After adjusting for foreign currency, sales increased 3% and after also adjusting for US multi-source generic injectionable divestiture, sales growth was 5%.</p>
          <p>Turning to the product categories, renal sales totaled $633 million and increased 8% on a reported basis. Excluding foreign currency, sales growth improved sequentially as PD growth globally accelerated to 5% due to continued momentum in patient gains in the US, Latin America and Asia. This performance was offset by expected loss of PD patients to another US service provider and lower HD revenues.</p>
          <p>Sales in the global injectables category advanced 7% to $506 million and excluding foreign currency sales grew 3%. Excluding the divestiture, growth of this category was 10%. Contributing to this performance was very strong growth in our contract manufacturing and compounding businesses as well as strong demand for MINI-BAGs. IV therapy sales totaled $452 million and rose 8%. Excluding foreign currency, sales were up 3% driven by low single digit growth of IV solutions and double digit growth in the US nutrition business as a result of continued share gains related to competitor supply shortages.</p>
          <p>Infusion system sales totaled $233 million, reflecting growth of 8% and sales were up 5% excluding foreign currency. Growth was driven by expanded placements and sales of the Spectrum pump which reached a new high in the quarter. Finally, anesthesia sales of $143 million increased 10% and excluding foreign currency sales grew 8%. This performance was driven by improved demand which was somewhat offset by competitive pricing pressures for generic Sevoflurane.</p>
          <p>Turning to the rest of the P&amp;L, gross margin for the company was 51.9% in the second quarter which exceeded expectations and reflects a sequential improvement of 90 basis points versus the first quarter. Compared to the prior year, gross margin improved by 60 basis points as a result of mix improvements, primarily driven by strong sales of high margin vaccine and anesthesia products and a modest benefit from foreign exchange. These items more than offset incremental costs associated with a Castlebar PD solution issue and the impact of manufacturing inefficiencies incurred in the plasma business during 2010.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A totaled $765 million in the quarter and increased 10% versus the prior year period, with the impact of foreign currency driving nearly half of the year-over-year growth. We continue to aggressively manage general, administrative and discretionary spending areas across the company while making select investments in a number of key promotional areas aimed at demand creation and new product launches. In addition, we continue to recognize the incremental savings associated with the actions we announced in January which were offset by incremental pension expense and the pharmaceutical drug tax.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D spending accelerated in the second quarter to $239 million, representing an increase of 9% in the quarter as we continue to advance our pipeline and fund many of the exciting programs we've discussed with you over the last several years.</p>
          <p>The operating margin in the quarter was 23.5%, reflecting an 80 basis point improvement both sequentially and over the prior year period. Interest expense was $15 million compared to $25 million last year. This reduction is primarily the result of a benefit from higher rate debt that matured in the second half of 2010 and higher interest income. Other totaled $13 million this quarter compared to $3 million last year with the increase driven primarily by the impact of foreign exchange on balance sheet positions and non-controlling interest.</p>
          <p>The tax rate was 21.7% in the quarter, 180 basis points higher than last year's rate of 19.9% and is the continued result of a change in earnings mix between higher tax and lower tax jurisdictions.</p>
          <p>And finally, as previously mentioned, adjusted EPS increased 15% to $1.07 per diluted share which exceeded our guidance of $1.01 to $1.03 per share.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $632 million compared to $783 million in the prior year period. The reduction year-over-year is a result of an increased outflow related to working capital and $87 million in payments for the infusion pump recall and business optimization actions we announced earlier this year. The working capital outflow is driven by higher receivables particularly in Europe, and increased inventory levels to meet anticipated demand for infusion pumps and PD solutions given the Castlebar situation. In addition, over the last six months we have ramped internal plasma collections and purchased significant quantities of third party plasma.</p>
          <p>DSO ended the quarter at 58 days, which is higher than last year by 4 days. This is largely due to the challenging macro environment and our international country mix as DSO in the US remains at approximately 30 days. Inventory turns of 2.5 are comparable to the prior year. This is primarily driven by improvement in BioScience versus the second quarter of 2010 offset by lower turns in Medical Products. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $210 million versus $237 million in the prior year period and are also trending below 2010 on a year-to-date basis.</p>
          <p>And lastly, during the second quarter we repurchased approximately 8 million shares of common stock for $478 million. Through the first six months of the year we have repurchased 21 million shares for $1.1 billion or on a net basis 14 million shares for approximately $824 million, in line with our full year objective.</p>
          <p>Finally let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2011. First for the full year, we now expect earnings of $4.27 to $4.32 per diluted share. By line item in the P&amp;L and starting with sales, we expect full year sales growth excluding foreign currency of 3% to 4%.</p>
          <p>We currently expect foreign currency to benefit sales growth by approximately 2 points, therefore we expect reported sales growth of approximately 5% to 6%. This outlook includes the first half sales of approximately $60 million related to the US multisource generic injectables business and $60 million to $70 million of incremental sales related to Octapharma. The impact of these non-recurring items depresses our second half sales growth by approximately 2 points.</p>
          <p>For full year, we continue to expect gross margin in the 51% to 51.5% range, with a modest improvement over the gross margin rate in 2010 of 51.1%. We now expect both SG&amp;A and R&amp;D to grow in mid single digits for the year. The projected increase in the growth rate is primarily due to foreign currency impacts and a ramp in R&amp;D spend in the second half relative to our original guidance.</p>
          <p>We expect operating margin to improve modestly year-over-year. We now expect interest expense of approximately $60 million to $70 million and other expense which includes non-controlling interest to also total approximately $60 million to $70 million. Given our mix of earnings, we expect our tax rate to approach 21.5% and finally we expect a full year average share count of approximately 575 million shares which assumes approximately $1 billion in net share repurchases.</p>
          <p>From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect cash flow from operations of approximately 2.8 billion. This includes a 2011 pension contribution of $150 million and an outflow of approximately $300 million related to the execution of the COLLEAGUE consent order.</p>
          <p>Now to expand on full year sales assumptions for each of the businesses. First on a constant currency basis, we expect low single digit sales growth for Medical Products. Excluding the impact of the generic injectables divestiture, sales growth is expected to be mid single digits. Within the product categories, there is no material change from our previous guidance. We continue to expect renal sales to grow in low single digits, anesthesia sales to grow in low to mid single digits, infusion system sales to be approximately flat and IV therapy sales to grow in mid single digits. In addition, we expect global injectable sales to increase in low single digits. Excluding the generics divestiture we expect sales in this category to increase 10% to 12%.</p>
          <p>For BioScience, we now expect sales excluding foreign currency to grow in the 5% to 6% range which is at the higher end of our prior guidance. For the recombinant business, we now expect sales growth for the full year to be in low single digits. Second, we expect plasma protein sales to increase in high single digits and antibody therapy sales to increase approximately 10%.</p>
          <p>Our current guidance assumes as modest benefit in the third quarter related to Octapharma as we currently assume that they will return to the US market by the fourth quarter. As a reminder, due to year-over-year sales comparisons related to Octapharma, we expect antibody therapy sales growth to moderate in the back half of 2011. Third, we expect regenerative medicine sales to grow in the low to mid teens and finally we expect the other category within BioScience to decline approximately 10%, reflecting the better than expected sales in the second quarter and the difficult comparison from pandemic revenues generated in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter as we mentioned in our press release, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.07 to $1.09 and sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of 3% to 4%. Based on our outlook for foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to increase in the 6% to 7% range reflecting a 3 percentage point benefit from currency.</p>
          <p>Thanks. I'll now open up the call for Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I wanted to come back first to the financial guidance, and Bob, probably going ot ask you a product related question. As you go through kind of the numbers for the second quarter and the first half of the year and look to the back half of the year particularly on the gross margin, it look as though for the balance of the year you're sort of saying that things will be consistent with where they were in the first half. Could you maybe walk us through some of the items that positively affected gross margin in the quarter that you're thinking may not recur in the second half? Because it sounds like business trends by and large are improving from a top line perspective and why we wouldn't then see that flow through to the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure, David. So a couple of things. We mentioned one of the areas of out-performance in the second quarter was the vaccine business, that is a high margin business for us. The FSME product in particular is primarily a seasonal vaccine, so the second quarter is by far the peak and the back half of the year the contribution of FSME to our top line is much, much smaller than it is in the second quarter. So the positive benefit we saw to margin in the second quarter won't repeat there.</p>
          <p>Recall that anesthesia underperformed in Q1 related to finalization of a distributor agreement in the US which we did execute in the second quarter. Saw some catch up there again on some higher margin product and so that was a bit exaggerated in the second quarter. And then FX, we did get a slight benefit to margin related to foreign exchange in the second quarter as the dollar weakened against the euro and many other currencies, particularly emerging and developing markets.</p>
          <p>In the back half of the year given recent events that are going on with the US debt crisis and the situation in Europe, we've seen the dollar strengthen a bit so we're not assuming that modest FX benefit to margin in the back half of the year. Other than that though, the underlying dynamics of our higher margin products growing faster and the mix benefits we see persisting and adjusting for some of the items I mentioned, we do see some improvement operationally in margin in the back half versus the front half in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 basis points, somewhat masked again by the dynamics that I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if you look at growth outside the United States this quarter, you highlighted that in your prepared remarks, almost every single business showed a sequential improvement in year-over-year growth rates. Can you maybe help us understand where that's coming, from especially when you square that up against some of the challenging dynamics that are happening in Europe and what we hear about pricing trends in Europe across, from many of your pharmaceutical peers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Bob Parkinson, David. A number of pieces to that. The reality is the European markets continued to be challenging, particularly the more developed western markets. But having said that, we continue to benefit significantly by emerging developing markets, China, Brazil and so on. Also generally speaking, the plasma proteins across the board including developed Europe were very strong in the second quarter. So it's tough to generalize regarding all markets outside the US. We are pleased by the overall strength in growth of our sales outside the US. But it is really, the dynamics are very different between developed Europe which continues and we anticipate is going to continue to be challenging versus our expanding investment and presence in emerging and developing markets which consistently has been a growth priority for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, could you just update us on where you are with respect to IVIG supply? I think on the last call and on the fourth quarter call you talked a little bit about supply constrained and I think at one point you were on pretty significant back order in the first quarter. Can you maybe sort of give us some sense to where we stand on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our position today is much better than what it was I think at the time of the last call. But having said that, we're really not flush with inventory right now. As a result of the Octapharma situation and again, my comment a second ago particularly in growth outside the US, meeting demand we're doing everything we can to do that. So while our situation, David, is improved dramatically, it's still not flush. And we're continuing to monitor that very closely throughout the rest of the year, particularly in view of some of the anticipated approvals that we're going to get some. We continue to put everything behind making sure we have adequate supply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I might also add, just as we mentioned last quarter that as long as Octapharma is out, there could be periods where there would be temporary shortages or we'd be in a backorder situation for throughout the rest of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And first off, congratulations on a very nice quarter. I wanted to maybe just dive in a little bit more to your thoughts on the back half of the year. You're coming off a strong quarter. It did sound like there were some maybe one-time items that might have helped out a little bit, but still underlying a very strong quarter. But you didn't change your constant currency revenue growth outlook for the year, which is 3% to 4% and you are seeing   some slowdown in the back half. And I think it would be helpful to get a sense of where you think you might be conservative in that forecast. Is part of it that you are assuming that Octapharma does make some inroads back into the market and that's why you're being a bit conservative? Are there parts of your business where you are being conservative or am I just pushing and 3% to 4% is the right type growth level to be thinking about right now?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just, I'll turn this over to Bob because there's a lot of moving pieces. You're right, the Octapharma piece that you mentioned, Mike, is in fact part of it, but it's just one of a number of pieces. So I'm going to let Bob walk the group through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, starting out first on the constant currency guidance, recall that the multisource generic business is out and so that is driving about 1.5 points in the back half of drag on our growth rate as we work through trying to annualize that out over the next four quarters. So I think that's a key one. We are assuming while Octa is back in Europe at the moment and we are assuming they come back in the US in the fourth quarter as well. So that takes another 0.5 points or so out of growth rate, so I think adjusting for just those two items, you're back in the 5%-ish range and I think that's consistent with -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and FSME given the seasonality we talked about earlier. So as we adjust for some of these impacts and look at the growth rate, it's pretty consistent through the quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, just to put it into perspective, first half growth constant currency was 5%. Second half we're guiding to about 2% to 3% to get to our full year 3% to 4%. And as Bob mentioned, that's 2 points of the generic injectable business and the assumption that Octapharma is back. And we're pretty conservative with our assumptions there that we cede that share back to them. And also I'd point out that in the back half of last year, plasma proteins was particularly strong. You might recall first half last year plasma was down about 8%, and in the second half of the year it was up in call it the 7% to 8% range. So we have a difficult comp in the plasma protein business as well.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, good morning. So first a question on Sub-Q which you said was imminent in terms of a launch here. How much are you assuming for Sub-Q in your back half guidance? Is that a major contributor? And maybe just help us frame the opportunity and launch strategy. And then finally one specific point on Sub-Q. We have heard from some doctors that your Sub-Q product has a lower injection site adverse event rate than the competition as per your clinical trials. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that as well and the degree to which you think that might help the launch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, why don't you take the first part of the question and Mary Kay, the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, so given we're very excited about the Sub-Q launch we think that again is going to allow us to participate in a fast growing segment of the market. But as we indicated, given our current inventory situation, we'll balance how we penetrate that market with serving existing customers here in the back half as we work to get our inventory situation back up to more normal levels. So it's a very nice opportunity for us and will be a growth driver going forward, but I wouldn't say that it's a significant contributor in our assumptions at the moment to the back half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the infusion site infection rate, Bob, we do have a lower rate I think as you saw the data in our posters that have been presented. We're at about 2.5% which is significantly lower to other subcus on the market that are in the 60% range. We believe that that's really due to the purity and the tolerability of our product. And obviously we do believe that that could be a potential competitive advantage to our product versus the competition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks that's helpful. And then I just wonder if we could go through some of those puts and take on the top line this particular quarter that you were talking about earlier and I'll rattle off what I heard. Obviously Octa, $30 million to $40 million. You talked about I think a $20 million benefit in unplanned sales from business to be divested. In the regenerative line some channel disruption, I was wondering if you could quantify that. In US plasma proteins on ARALAST, you talked about a temporary negative, I believe. Could you quantify that and then any of the other sort of the smaller puts and takes in the quarter that you ran through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, why don't you expand on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure, so consistent with the Octa amount that we have been talking about, the generics injectable that we divested in early May, so we didn't have the month of April in the numbers, we didn't expect. The channel disruption in ApaTech for the quarter is less than $10 million, so a smaller base in the biosurgery regenerative medicine line, so it does affect the growth rate but not a huge number overall. And ARALAST similarly less than $10 million of an impact in the quarter due to the back order situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one other comp I'd also mention is the UK tender. Although we've basically annualized that, we did have a small impact in the quarter. I'd put it in the $5 million range. And WinRho also affected us in antibody therapy slightly but not material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so those are the major puts and takes in terms of one-time items in the quarter. Great. Thank you so much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just to make sure, the sales guidance you had provided by product line, that was all on a constant currency basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The growth rates. Okay and then can you just walk through maybe the interest expense and other change because both of those changed relative to your last updates. Is that just kind of foreign exchange on the other expense line item? I know that bounces around a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Foreign exchange does bounce around a little bit but also the non-controlling interest in the sundry line as well. As we look at that primarily relates to the SIGMA relationship and as they ramped up production on their end. We own 40% and consolidate them in our results up above and have to adjust for their 60% ownership through the sundry line. So if activity is ramped up, that becomes a bigger number on the expense side for us in sundry.</p>
          <p>On the interest front, we took a strategy in the middle of last year to move to slightly more floating rate debt than fixed through interest rate swaps. We're benefiting from that and that's driving some of the interest income. But also in the first half of this year we have collected some late interest on outstanding receivables in Spain. These are hard to predict because there's a whole legal process you have to go through. So it tends to be lumpy and we did collect $5 million to $10 million in the front half of the year related to that which we're not necessarily counting on in the back half of the year to repeat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on SIGMA, can you just maybe help us again, depreciation for just how far through you think you have locked in some of the pumps that are still outstanding into kind of how much is outstanding in the field for COLLEAGUE?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure I'll jump in and Mary Kay you can. So at this point we're fairly far along with the discussions with our customer base. Approaching three quarters of the customer base has indicated a firm interest in either staying with us or moving to a competitor and we continue to be in a position of the majority of those staying with us. So we're pleased with the progress there. SIGMA continues to do very well on the production side, providing the adequate level of pumps for us to be very competitive in offering the free pump to replace the existing COLLEAGUE. So getting pretty far down the track and pretty consistent with the outcomes that we had expected both within our reserve and what we have been indicating up to this point.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, good morning everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Larry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First on margins, I'm wondering, Bob, if you can quantify what Castlebar, the impact of Castlebar was in the gross margin. And then as I think about the second half of the year and your gross margin specifically, it would seem to me that your plasma protein business obviously is a extremely high fixed cost business and as you start to ramp that up, you're increasing collections, you indicated. I suspect your fractionation capacity is running pretty full at this point given your attempts to increase your inventory and then you mentioned that you purchased plasma as well as frozen plasma at I assume attractive prices. So at some point I would think that that has to start to come through the margin. So I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about those two things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So Castlebar in the quarter was $15 million impact, negative impact to margin in the second quarter after $25 million in the first quarter. So we are working it down a bit. We do expect another $10 million to $15 million of impact in the third quarter and hope to be running at normal operation by the fourth quarter. Still yet to be fully resolved in Europe but that's our assumption at this point.</p>
          <p>As it relates to plasma, we have been running very well, ramping up both collections and production to meet not only the Octa demand that became available but also strong underlying dynamics both in the US and outside the US. In terms of dynamics going forward, you mentioned the purchase of third party plasma, so we purchased both plasma collected by third parties and plasma directly from, frozen plasma directly from Octapharma. But as you might imagine, our internal cost to collect is actually below what a third party would do because we feel like we are the most efficient collector in the industry given the BioLife network that we set up over the years. And so we actually are incurring a slight negative related to running that plasma through our operation.</p>
          <p>We really just purchased the first bolus here in the second quarter. There will be additional purchases both third party and from Octa in the third and fourth quarter of this year. So actually over the next six to nine months we'll be working that through our manufacturing network and putting that product into the marketplace. And again, that will be a slight negative in fact as we work that product through. But given the demand and the inventory situation, we felt it was the right thing to do for us to put us in the best position to service customers going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing that I would add to Bob's comments, Larry, your observation is right. As we utilize existing capacity, we do get favorable absorption on both collection and fractionation. But as you know, I commented the last quarter, our current plans are now to leave old LA frac in operation for an extended period of time to meet the demand. But in order to do that, there will be some cost going forward associated with that that were not earlier planned either. So that in addition to the comments that Bob just made would be an offset to the improved efficiencies in terms of capacity utilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. So when you net out the positive variances that you had in the 2Q and you think about the increased volume coming through on IVIG and other plasma proteins in the second half, how should we be thinking about just the progression of gross margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned earlier, operationally we do see some improvement in the 40 to 50 basis point range in the second half versus the first half. But the benefit we saw from the mix related to vaccines and anesthesia in the second quarter and FX, we're not counting on those three in the back half, so those tend to offset the underlying operational benefit that we're talking about here. And that's why we didn't change the margin guidance for the back half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Then just lastly, just any thoughts on what you think the US and O-US market growth is currently for IVIG, how you're look at that. And with Octa now out in Europe, what sort of observations are you seeing relative to price? How they are behaving out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our outlook in terms of market growth really isn't any different than what we have communicated, kind of mid single digits in the US and higher single digits O-US, Larry. So our view in that regard hasn't changed. Relative to Octa's reentry, it's speculative and so I'm not going to speculate on that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on the last question, I was wondering if you could perhaps just reconcile the additional purchases of plasma with Octapharma as well as some of the third parties. With respect to their return trajectory, that would seem to imply it's somewhat measured but I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I hate to speculate, but I think the facts are &#x2013; I think the facts are that clearly more product, more raw plasma has become available on the market over the last nine months basically. But what we don't know is what they continue to collect themselves and how much they process. So again, I would simply be speculating at this point. What we really were focused on is on ramping up the, both the collections and potentially accessing this third party plasma in order to ensure that we had product available to meet what has turned out to be very significant demand for our product, in the 20% range here the last couple of quarters. And so that's really the approach we've taken, and anything else I'd say would be speculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just follow up, perhaps you could also share some perspective on how you've thought about the accounts that you have selected and perhaps the patients that you have selected with antibody therapy given some tightness in the market and just how you thought about that in terms of patients that &#x2013; or excuse me, accounts that may be somewhat stickier than others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We certainly focused a bit more on the US versus Europe in terms of the Octa demand gap that occurred when they went out of the marketplace. And given the touch-up pricing exercise we went through last year with our US customer base, we feel very good about the position we're in with the customers we have and we're very focused on continuing to grow those relationships. I think as we go forward here with the Sub-Q launch and HyQ in hopefully in 2012, we'll have a further opportunity to be even more selective. But from a &#x2013; we certainly have focused on trying to avoid particularly price sensitive accounts in the US and outside the US as we look to fulfill some of the demand needs in the marketplace.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Just wondering on the NEXTERONE product that you acquired, can you maybe comment on to what degree that contributed to revenue in the quarter? And then just I guess the more important part of the question would be how big is that market opportunity currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The contribution was &#x2013; we just launched the product. There was virtually no contribution to the results in Q2. Our outlook for that product, the initial reception is very good and I don't know if we've quantified when we did the deal, Mary Kay, what we think the long term projection is. It's material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean given the fact that it's a premix form, we are out with the a price premium on the product which will help expand the current market potential as well as we're looking at additional geographies to launch in. We pegged the market opportunity at about $150 million to $200 million globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then you obviously had strong gross margins this quarter. It looks like you are getting back relatively close to kind of the recent peak of around 53% from that you saw in 2009. Is there any reason that you couldn't in the long long run go well beyond sort of that low 50s range maybe into the mid 50s or even the high 50s?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think the big driver long term, Mike, is the timely and successful launch of our pipeline now as it comes to fruition. Because obviously, and I'm generalizing now, but most of the new products that we have invested in will generate higher gross margins than our overall existing portfolio by design. And so if you look out over the next five years I think the most significant driver in GP appreciation will really be associated with successful new product launches.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then finally, just given the presentation of some of the early data on Biogen Idec's longer-acting factor VIII product this summer, I was wondering if you had any updated thoughts on kind of how that product stacks up against your existing product and kind of what you have got in your pipeline for your longer-acting product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I don't know that our view's changed from what we've communicated previously. Obviously it's still early on the Biogen Idec trials, a limited number of patients. But already we know that in terms of frequency of dosing, it's been reduced I think in terms of the current expectation versus the original goal. So already the gap and therefore the added utility of the extended half life has already been shortened significantly, even though it remains very much in the early stage of the clinical development. So we've talked about that before. I don't know that there's anything new there. We continue to believe as evidenced by our own internal products that there is an opportunity for longer shelf life or longer half life products, but still early. Mary Kay, you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, I would just add, there was no surprises in the data that we saw and we expect to enter our Phase I clinical trials here before the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one final question. Given the increase in your receivables days, particularly outside the US and I guess the comment in the Q&amp;A about the Spanish I guess receivables, is there any risk that you'd have to write down any of this money that you're owed from some of these countries with fiscal issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, that risk is out there for all of us given the current situation. But historically, while the governments have paid on a longer timeline in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy, they have paid. Greece I think is a bit more of an acute situation and we did take a charge in the second quarter of last year to recognize the valuation on the bonds we received in lieu of payment at that time. So that's a risk we monitor very closely. We work very closely with the local teams. In some countries like Italy there is an ongoing factoring program that we in the industry take advantage of, so we're less exposed there.</p>
          <p>So again, I think that is an inherent risk that we're dealing with and monitoring very closely and we are seeing a bit of slippage there in the DSO. That is one of the drivers. But I would also tell you, of that four days, FX as the euro has appreciated over the last year, that tends to drive the DSO up just based on how the calculation is done. So FX in and of itself is contributing a bit of that four day increase.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question here for Bob. On US plasma proteins, it was a little weaker than we expected in the quarter. And I guess my question is, given the IVIG stabilization and what I would imagine would be US stabilization in your antibody therapy business, I guess I was surprised to see plasma proteins being a little weaker. And I wonder, is that simply utilization of Albumin or is that pricing getting a little softer within that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take that, David. First of all internationally, plasma proteins was up 20% so very, very strong. I think as Bob mentioned in the prepared remarks, ARALAST we were on a backorder situation which was temporary in nature. And we are seeing no impact to user demand given the reconstitution device that we are providing an alternative for our patients with going forward. So that is resolved here as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Also in FEIBA, I would mention that sales were down in the US close to 10%. Really we have seen a significant increase in Medicaid patients. I think going back a couple of years, our Medicaid population on FEIBA was in, call it the 40% to 50% range and now that's ramped up to about 60%. And given healthcare reform and the increase we're seeing in Medicaid rebates, that had a significant impact on our overall FEIBA sales in the US. That was really what happened in the quarter, it was more US focused and on those two products, FEIBA and ARALAST.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mary Kay, maybe as follow up on the Medicaid side, I mean since healthcare reform and the implications on pharma, what have the changes been in terms of access in the 340B program across the organization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On 340B, we are seeing more hospitals elect to be 340B. As you know, that was part of our healthcare reform impact that we took last year and that will grow as our 340B sales grow going forward. But that's pretty much in line with our expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one last question internationally. There was some stabilization there but can you update us on any specific tender processes either won or lost in the last three to six months on O-US recombinants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did have some wins in the second quarter. It was, I would say, in the $10 million to $15 million range in terms of international sales. We wouldn't provide what country, what countries those were.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. And thanks for the good quarter. Bob, both of you have talked about the Med Products integration. Where are we in the process of completing that? Will we see at some point operating margin benefits? And Bob, you mentioned the offset this quarter from pension and I missed the second point. But is there a point when those factors, those drags go away and we get a net benefit? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first part, Bob Hombach can take the second part, Rick. Yes, I think some of the operational leverage that I commented on in my prepared comments was really associated with early stage efficiencies derived by the Medical Products integration. But as I think I have commented previously, these are benefits that are going to be incurred over time. It will be more evolutionary in nature. It will be material, but there's not going to be a big event or a big pop where you'd see it. But we already are getting efficiencies which as I said was the basis of my comment and those are going to continue out over I think a multiple year period of time. Bob, you want to take the second part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So within the issues that I highlighted, we talked about the benefits we were getting from the actions we announced back in January being offset by both pension and the pharmaceutical drug tax, particularly in SG&amp;A. So that's the other big one that's impacted us this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then I wanted to follow up on just one other point, back to the, actually the two aspects on the new product front. I want to make sure I understood how big the Sub-Q opportunity is in your mind as you launch and what the incremental impact could be. I mean, I have heard a variety of estimates of how big Sub-Q is as a percentage of the total market. I'd be curious to hear that.</p>
          <p>And maybe just a little more follow up on the home hemo side, Bob. It helps to understand what the delay has been. Has it been a technology issue? Has it been securing IRB approvals to start the trials? And can you give us any more color on the trial itself, how long it's going to take to complete and possible timelines to approval? Just update us, thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me jump on the second question. Mary Kay, you can maybe address the first in response to Rick's question. There really hasn't been a significant delay on the HHD from what we've, the expectations we've set all along. I mean, this is a complex system, a new system that's being developed. And there's always challenges on the timetable but actually we have been very pleased with the pace of development with our partner DEKA. To get to the point as I said, we'll be starting the clinicals very shortly in the US which is basically in line with &#x2013; so no significant deviation from what we've messaged from the start.</p>
          <p>And because it is a totally new system and not one that's an adaptation or modification to an existing system, you clearly want to have a high confidence level on all operating aspects of the system. Even though it's a clinical trial, you're putting a patient on the system and we want to be as confident as we can be that we have addressed all the issues. So as much as anything, Rick, I think it's about being cautious and disciplined and rigorous about how we do this. But again just to reinforce, I mean we have not incurred a meaningful deviation from the timetable that we have communicated from the start. I don't know if you want to add to that Mary Kay or address the first part of the question or both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I would also add, Rick, that we are in the process of identifying and selecting patients for the HHD trial, which as Bob mentioned we're going to start in the coming weeks. It is a trial that includes 24 patients. It's a ten-week trial. We expect it will take about six months to complete the trial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way let me add to that and maybe just a higher level perspective on this aside from the timing of the clinical trial. We continue to be if anything even more encouraged about the opportunity that exists with the whole area of home dialysis, whether it's PD or HHD. I think this is one where the external environment that we talk about all the time is presenting challenges, is an area that provides a significant opportunity for us. Because whether it's lower cost, enhanced patient convenience, and we believe particularly in the case of home HHD enhanced clinical outcomes, this is a product that I think is, it will benefit and a therapy that will benefit by the external environmental pressures and changes. So we continue to be very encouraged by that. Okay, Mary Kay, back to you then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Sub-Q question, Rick, we estimate today that the global market is anywhere in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion for IVIG. And today the Sub-Q market has about call it 7% to 8% share of that global market. Remember that Sub-Qs are really approved for use in primary immune deficiency and primary immune deficiency represents 25% of the overall global market. And within PID today about 30% of the usage is Sub-Q. So you can kind of draw your own conclusions on the size of that market and the potential for Sub-Q and HyQ going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So again and you all know this, the constraints to expansion of the subcu segment as much as anything has to do with the administration complexities and inconvenience incurred by patients in terms of multiple injection sites and so on which then of course gets to the heart of our HyQ program and our recent regulatory submission in that regard. So again our longer term view and you all know this, is that when that gets approved, it will be an expander to the subcu segment significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And just a tiny follow up. And the Sub-Q launch is reflected in your numbers. And on the home hemo, did you, I forget, have you said to us when you hope to get approval, actual final approval and launch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sub-Q will launch in Q3 and that's included in our guidance. And in terms of HHD, Rick, we expect to get CE marked next year in Europe in 2012. We will have to do another trial that we're planning to do in Canada. The Canadian trial as well as the US trial we're doing here will be used to support a nocturnal indication filing in 2013 in the US.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I have got just a follow up on one of the other topics you were just talking about, Sub-Q. Just, Bob, to be clear and Mary Kay, you mentioned a planned launch in Q3 for Sub-Q. Without approval in hand, you have been talking about this as being imminent for a while. Can you maybe just provide a little color on your level of confidence on Sub-Q? And then I have got a couple of follow-ups.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, it's not a guarantee until you get the approval. I think we're very confident we'll get approval soon. And soon and imminent means like very soon and very imminent. But until you have it you don't have it and that's the best I can do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. That's okay, I realize it's tough to predict, I think, the FDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The trends in the pump business, just a follow up on how things are going in infusion systems. Saw some strength relative to our estimates in the quarter, and yet you're still looking for flat growth this year. I think last quarter you said maybe flat to down. So I guess two questions here. Is this a modest improvement in outlook or is it that you're just really holding the line on outlook given the process you're going through with COLLEAGUE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well a big piece of it is, and Bob and Mary Kay can add to this, is the comps because we launched SIGMA in the second half of last &#x2013; or at least the significant ramp up. So as much as anything, the guidance and percentage increase in the second half is more associated with the strength last year. And of course, any time you're launching a product, you get a bolus effect up front. And so I think Bob and Mary Kay. would you add anything to that, I mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's &#x2013; again we had the strongest quarter this quarter that we have had. We had a strong back half last year, so the growth rate I think will be moderated. Modest improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The key takeaway on this, as Bob commented earlier is that the device is being very well received in the marketplace and we're very pleased with that. So we continue to make very good progress in converting the COLLEAGUE base to SIGMA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one on recombinants, similar I guess but going the other way, 3% constant currency growth in Q2, 2% in the first half. Comps getting significantly easier in this case in the back half. Does your low single digit outlook contemplate any other potential risks to the back half, macro or O-US market related and so on? And then maybe just looking beyond the back half, is low single the right number for that market or do we see some moderation and recovery going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a couple of things, Matt. I would say starting with the US, if you look at the rolling 12-month data on PPTA, the growth rate has moderated in the US across the board basically. And so we're sort of in line with that in the US. Outside the US, we are anticipating given the results of the Australia tender which was recently announced, where we will not be one of the two providers for recombinant factor VIII going forward. There is a 12-month transition period, so there is a little bit of uncertainty about how this will move forward. We do expect a negative impact in the back half of this year. The majority of the impact though will be realized in 2012 related to Australia. So that is reflected in our guidance. But longer term as we mentioned in my prepared comments, we do see nice acceleration adjusting for the UK tender outside the US. So far this year, we would expect other opportunities to continue to emerge. We're excited about getting ADVATE approved already in Brazil but in Russia and China over the next 12 to 18 months. And so emerging markets I think continue to offer a nice opportunity for growth for us.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Sure Sara, Alzheimer's we did complete enrollment in the second quarter. We've enrolled more than 360 patients which was required. And so with an 18-month follow up, we expect to complete the second Phase III the end of next year. And in the second half of this year we'll start the second Phase III and we'll keep you posted on that. In terms of Dr. Relkin, he did submit his manuscript on Phase II data to a journal and I think the end of the first quarter and once that journal is accepted for publication, it will be published. Other than that, we can't really control the timeline of that. We would expect that hopefully before the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Recombinant factor IX is in a Phase I/III trial which will end next year in 2012. So it will be probably sometime before the end of next year that we'll have data available.</p>
