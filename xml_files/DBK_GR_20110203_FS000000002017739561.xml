      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon from Frankfurt. This is Joachim M&#xFC;ller, Head of Investor Relations and on behalf of Deutsche Bank, it's my pleasure to welcome you all to our conference call on fourth quarter results. We have with us our CEO, Josef Ackermann, and our CFO, Stefan Krause, both of which will lead you through the presentation slides, which you will find on our website along with all the other documents which we issued this morning.</p>
          <p>As usual, let me remind you of the cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements at the end of this presentation.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to hand over to our CEO Mr. Ackermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. M&#xFC;ller. Good morning or good afternoon wherever you are. I will start with my own presentation on page two first, namely talking about some of the key actions we have taken in 2010.</p>
          <p>Some of you or probably everybody is familiar with it. CIB, we fully integrated investment bank under single management team, so merging markets and corporate finance. We maintained the risk discipline and of course we increased the market pressure in the Netherlands via the ABN AMRO acquisition in GTB, in the global transaction banking.</p>
          <p>In PCAM, we accelerated the Postbank takeover. We acquired the Sal. Oppenheim Bank and of course accelerated the alignment in Sal. Oppenheim and we completed the restructuring of Asset Management. In Asia, we continued to build out the platform and we also decided to increase our stake in Hua Xia Bank in China.</p>
          <p>We successfully raised capital and raised of course our Tier 1 capital ratios and our complexity reduction program is on track. So as I said this morning, 2010 for us was really a year of preparing ourselves for the next level. But let me make it very clear from the beginning. We are not going to maximize 2011 for whatever reasons and then we see no continuation of that trend in 2012, or 2013. We just want to jump to a higher level in terms of profitability and from there on, hopefully we can continue that trend.</p>
          <p>Now page number three. Here you'll see a little bit what we did in 2011 in that context I just described and what our adjusted numbers would have been. First, on the group level. The reported pre-tax number is as you know EUR 4 billion. We had the Postbank related charge in the third quarter EUR 2.3 billion, and we had other impact from acquisition made in 2010, which added another EUR 200 million. So adjusted for acquisitions, the number would have been EUR 6.5 million. On top of that if you take into account specific investments and other special one items, especially the Cosmopolitan project in Las Vegas and Ocala the pre-tax profit would actually have been over EUR 7 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>If you're now on the right-hand side of this chart, what our target comprises where we said our EUR 10 billion is the sum of the business contribution. So here we start with the group reported and then we add corporate investments and the C&amp;A reco columns, which are not included in our EUR 10 billion, and the reported business divisions would have been then EUR 7 billion. If you exclude or take into account the impact from acquisitions, the EUR 200 million I mentioned before can be added, so that adjusted business division's contribution would have been EUR 7.2 billion. So we came from EUR 5 billion in 2009, to EUR 7.2 billion in 2010 and our target as we said many times is EUR 10 billion.</p>
          <p>Now on page four, the most important chart in the -- for the fourth quarter. Why did we have this adhoc release? Based on the German law and directives we had to issue an adhoc because we were below consensus estimate. I don't think we would have had to do that in most countries, Europe rating in turn we had to do it. It's not because we were below previous years, but because we were below consensus estimates which were roughly EUR 1.2 billion pre-tax and about EUR 800 million after-tax, and you remember our numbers were at EUR 760 roughly pre-tax in 2009, and EUR 1.3 billion after-tax because we had a tax credit of EUR 790 million in 2009 which of course we couldn't repeat in 2010.</p>
          <p>But the major difference didn't come from the revenues, in revenues we were actually ahead of consensus estimate, nor from the provisions, but it came from the cost side. And here I would like to demonstrate what we did in the fourth quarter. We had a EUR 5.1 billion cost base if you take into account the old Deutsche Bank group. We had then additional EUR 1.2 billion, which all added up with the EUR 6.3. Where does that come from?</p>
          <p>About EUR 450 million are one offs specific items because we accelerated certain programs and you see them, Complexity Reduction Program, severance measures in GTB, the CIP integration and severance, and also IT, and occupancy optimization measures which we accelerated into the fourth quarter. But on top of that, of course we have EUR 750 million additional expenses, and they stem from the three acquisitions. And it even has to be highlighted, that of course Postbank is only in for one month. So these are costs, which will stay, and of course we have to demonstrate that revenues will then will go up in parallel as well. But the, there is an adjustment based on the acquisitions, and then there is an additional EUR 450 million which comes from the acceleration. Without that if you added now the EUR 700 plus EUR 450, we would have been very much in line with consensus estimates for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now on page five, the update on our pre-tax profit potential. As you see in December '09 Investors Day, we talked about EUR 6.3 billion for Corporate Bank and Securities. We have actually slightly increased that and I'll give you some points why we did that later on to EUR 6.4 billion. In Global Transaction Banking, we are somewhat lower then at the Investors Day namely from EUR 1.3 billion to EUR 1 billion, primarily because of the lower than anticipated interest rate level. In asset wealth management we are in line with what we said two years ago. And private and business clients, we are slightly higher because the Hua Xia Bank and the Postbank contributions although Postbank will add net a relatively small numbers. So actually the improvement primarily comes from our own retail banking operations, and from Hua Xia Bank.</p>
          <p>Now on page six, you will see the assumptions what we had at the -- at our Investor Day and what we changed in the meantime and not much actually we have somewhat slower growth in the fee pool. But more importantly interest rate remains at the lower level than anticipated remember, we said that interest rates will normalize from the second half 2010 on this has not happened. Now we are assuming that they remain at the current levels although my personal view is that, given the inflationary signals that we probably see some sort of more receptive monetary policy in the quarters to come, certainly in some parts of the world.</p>
          <p>We have a global GDP growth of 4% in 2011, that's our research best estimate. We have the efficiency gains, our net savings from the complexity reduction program of EUR 600 million, but on top of that, we have EUR 500 million net benefit from CIB integration. So part of it cost savings and revenues, net EUR 500 million and that compares with the EUR 1 billion we had in our plan or in our Investor's Day presentation out of the infrastructure complexity reduction program.</p>
          <p>Now if you go on to page seven to the different businesses and what we did, 2010 number is EUR 5.1 and our target for '11 is EUR 6.4. Let me just give you two numbers we have a 400 million charge in 2010 from the one of the transactions, which went wrong, the Ocala side and we have EUR 300 million of severance partially related to the CIB integration so that adds EUR 700 million. On the positive side, we have now a -- the CIB integration the EUR 500 million I mentioned before, then we have a stronger global GDP growth than anticipated time, I said before slight, above 2%, now we have 4%. And we think that we see a more positive market environment right now than what we had expected in 2009.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, spreads have tightened probably more than what we originally expected, many banks have come back and are competing in investment banking, something where we felt it would take a bit more time. And we may have a slower growth in the fee pool, but that's something of course we will have to see during the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Page eight, you will see the GDP numbers. We had EUR 200 million impact in 2010 from the bad will we have efficiency measures, which especially severance measures, which added EUR 100 million. And you'll see that for 2011 we are EUR 300 million below the original target primarily because of the interest-rate level I mentioned before. But on the positive side, we are expecting a better contribution from ABN AMRO than we originally had planned.</p>
          <p>Leverage in Asia is going better because Asia in general of course is growing very fast, but also our existing capacities are strong. And we will also capitalize on synergies from the CIB integration especially in the sense of being a distribution channel for products from investment banking. Asset management, a slightly higher target for 2011, part comes from now that you see the full benefit from the improved platform efficiency, which we have seen in the last two quarters. We think that the equity and the real estate market will improve, and that will help us also in terms of performance fees.</p>
          <p>The products in PWS, especially for retirement products where we have a very strong position, and we pursue opportunities in equity and real estate infrastructure commodities and climate change. But also I have to say that we're also benefiting of course from a lower cost base out of the complexity reduction program, which is true for all of the businesses.</p>
          <p>Then on page 10, Private Wealth Management. Of course 2010, we had a very strong hit from the Sal. Oppenheim cleanup and also from the BHF disposal that will not happen again. Based on our assumptions, we will hopefully achieve a break even result in Sal. Oppenheim, and we should then benefit in all other areas from the higher asset base and also from the stronger position we are having, especially also in Asia, but also among the older high net worth individuals and are also achieving more synergies out of a better cooperation with investment banks.</p>
          <p>On page 11, the retail bank, a little bit higher than originally planned from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 1.6 billion. There was very little contribution of course from Postbank in 2010, but we had costs from the Berliner Bank integration and IT investments and again severance efficiency measures that is now behind us and we will see a higher contribution from the Chinese Hua Xia bank. We will now of course benefit from the efficiency program and we will start seeing some positive contribution from Postbank but as I said, we have not softened the target in that sense that we are now including Postbank because the net contribution will not be very pronounced.</p>
          <p>On page 12, finally you have a few numbers of the new bank after the integrations, which we are now doing. We will have a core Tier 1 ratio in Basel in January 2013 based on Basel 2.5 and Basel 3 and with all the derisking of over 8% core Tier 1. Our earnings mix will be different from roughly 70-30. We should be closer to 40-60, maybe even closer to 45-55. We will have a better efficiency cost/income ratio after all these programs, where we also always have cost to achieve will be behind us so from 75% to 65% and you are seeing that we have clearly strengthened our home market leadership in private wealth expansion for those in retail and continue to benefit from now a top five position in corporate finance globally.</p>
          <p>That is my introduction. Now Stefan Krause will continue with his more detailed presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Joe, and good afternoon to everybody. I'll start with our highlights on page three of my presentation and after Joe comments I will run you mainly through the results of our fourth quarter. And as a reaction to the feedback we just received from you, I will try to be now very crisp and focus on only things that require some additional explanation. I assume that you have had some time to read our releases and that you may have listened in to the conference earlier this morning as well.</p>
          <p>So if I move on to page four and page five, I wanted to give you a detailed overview of the consolidation impacts from Postbank, which obviously became effective on the 3 of December of 2010. Included in our group P&amp;L for just one month of the year, Postbank contributed EUR 30 million after roughly EUR 50 million of transaction related cost that we had to also absorb in this quarter. With obviously now the addition of approximately 20,000 employees of Postbank, the group has now more than 100,000 associates.</p>
          <p>If I move to page five, I think you have already seen the key numbers in our adhoc release on Monday, and in the release you received today. Joe mentioned, Hua Xia profitability down in the quarter which was mainly our operating expense or cost development to which I will come back later in my presentation.</p>
          <p>Let me make some comments on taxation at this point. In the fourth quarter of the previous year, the high net income figure was positively influenced by tax effects in the U.S. Here, improved profitability and income projections resulted in material recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax effects, Joe gave you the number of EUR 790 million that was the number that we benefited from in the last year, the previous year. There was also positive effects impact in the fourth quarter of 2010, but it was much smaller. This time it was due to improved U.S income tax positions.</p>
          <p>Looking at the full-year, if you adjust our full-year effective tax rates for the Postbank related charge of EUR 2.3 billion, which did not have the corresponding tax benefit, you arrive at a very favorable tax rate of 26%, which mainly benefited from the aforementioned U.S. income tax positions, and also a favorable geographic mix of income in general.</p>
          <p>Currently, regretfully we do not provide a mid-term guidance for the bank ETR due to the uncertainties that we continue to battle with around the UK and German bank levels, which as you know are still in discussion.</p>
          <p>On page six, we show -- this chart shows you our non-interest expenses. In the box provided, we disclose now in detail the impact of the three acquisitions we made last year. Postbank is in all is included for one month; ABN AMRO Netherlands for nine months, and Sal. Oppenheim for eleven months to just give you a flavor for your projections.</p>
          <p>On page seven, that's our classical capital ratio chart. We had obviously only two major events hitting our capital &#x2013; in the development of our capital positions, obviously, we had the largest rights issue Deutsche Bank has ever made, and the consolidation of Deutsche Postbank. The two events resulted in a net increase of our Tier 1 capital by approximately 80 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the next page I show again the Tier 1 capital development in the risk weighted asset development, here you see again the effects of the capital rate and the Postbank consolidation that I just talked about. The increase in the risk weighted assets for credit risk by EUR 7.5 billion was driven primarily by two effects. Two-thirds of the increase are the result from the maturity of a derivative hedge trade and the remaining third was due to the increases on the risk weighting of pension fund assets.</p>
          <p>On page nine, the chart discloses to you, and shows to you that not only has our CDS developed very favorable, favorably in the last quarter but most importantly our actual issue spread has been significantly tighter than our CDS on average by more than 40 basis points. I think this continues to show our strong position on the funding, which is the result of our broad funding mix, including obviously also our strong access to retail deposits that now with the Postbank acquisition got further strengthened. In 2011, we have a modest funding plan of only EUR 26 billion, more than a quarter of which as we speak has already been completed.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to the agenda results and let me start with page 11, our segment overview. The contribution from CB&amp;S increased versus the fourth quarter 2009, due to an EUR 850 million revenue increase, as well as the EUR 270 million decrease in risk provisions as there were no IAS 39 related provisions in the fourth quarter of 2010. Effectively, this was really the first quarter where we had no credit related cost to this portfolio.</p>
          <p>The positive effects on revenues and provisions in CDS was partly offset by higher cost, driven by the basis effect from the fourth quarter 2009 changes in compensation structure. As I would like to remind you, we had increased the proportion of deferred compensation, and the fourth quarter 2010 integration related cost, which obviously mainly hit severance and investments in relation to our integral projects.</p>
          <p>GTBs fourth quarter results was very good, when you consider the EUR 130 million of severance measures that they took in the fourth quarter. As it was mentioned it was heavily impacted by the Sal. Oppenheim acquisition where we took several measures to align and derisk the franchise.</p>
          <p>Two main reasons for the negative contribution in the corporate investments were an EUR 83 million mark-to-market loss on the put call options related to Postbank prior to its consolidation, which obviously now will not recur, and higher operating costs related to our consolidated investments, obviously here particularly the Cosmopolitan project in Las Vegas. And finally in the consolidation adjustments, in the fourth quarter 2010, included the positive accounting effects driven by movements in our short-term interest rates.</p>
          <p>On page 12, turning now to the revenue contributions of the different market businesses. Overall we continued to improve the risk efficiency in our business. On debt revenues in the fourth quarter, we had a solid performance in a very difficult market environment as you know, and our results also reflect the usual seasonality that we experience towards the end of the year. However given that our business mix is more skewed towards Europe, the credit and rates business were impacted significantly from reduced client and investor activity as a result of the European sovereign crisis. This was partly offset by good results in our FX, commodities and RMBS businesses. We are proud to report that according to a recent ranking by Greenwich Associates, we are number one in global fixed income.</p>
          <p>If you looked at the full-year, revenues are up even on a very good development of 2009, a good performance we had in 2010 as well, while our peers are down. And that I think shows the sustainability of our debt franchise. This sustainability is obviously based on the good diversification we have in this platform.</p>
          <p>On page 13, we show the sales and trading equity. We are very pleased with the results that we had in the first quarter, especially if you also look at the VaR development this is a very successful and sound business, it's become a very successful and sound business for the bank. Revenues were significantly higher quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, driven by increases in the cash and derivatives and the stability in our prime finance franchise despite as you know a more competitive environment.</p>
          <p>We're pleased with our equity performance. We're one of the only banks that have higher revenues versus last quarter. The significant momentum going into 2011 as our equity sales and trading business continues to work closely with corporate finance on transactions such as the AII IPO and Fifth Third equity raising to give you some examples of how this new corporation in the investment bank is already delivering first results.</p>
          <p>On page 14, we have our origination and advisory revenues. We announced at the Investor Day in December 2009, our goal was to achieve a top five position in corporate finance in terms of fees, which we achieved and maintained throughout 2010. According to Dealogic, we gained the most market share in 2010 versus peers, reflecting the success of our counter-cyclical investment in this franchise. We improved significantly in ECM and M&amp;A and we were involved in some of the largest deals both in 2010 and initially. So we had a really outstanding and we are very pleased with the performance here as well.</p>
          <p>On page 15, I showed GTB our transaction bank. In GTB, we made a deliberate decision to bring forward severance measures worth about EUR 130 million to execute on the part of the one side the complexity reduction, as well as the integration efforts within the investment bank. That action obviously had a negative impact on the division's bottom line, as well as its cost income ratio and ROE. In terms of revenues, we're pleased to report the GTB's best full year results ever, even if we exclude the contribution from ABN AMRO in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>On page 16, here we visualize the Asset and Wealth Management operating profit by showing you the impact of the Sal. Oppenheim acquisition, as well as the BHF impairment that was a result of our sales agreement in December as well as some remaining severance costs in asset management. During these one-off effects, asset and wealth management earned roughly opened 5 billion for the full year 2010 as we show here.</p>
          <p>We go to the separate parts of asset and wealth management, this time I will start with asset management and pre-tax profit showed a very nice upward trend. We expect this to continue because this business has undergone a very comprehensive restructuring over the last two years, which we believe will generate tangible results this year and on a going forward basis. 4 billion net new money in the fourth quarter came from institutional businesses, primarily in cash products, repeating a similar trend we saw in the third quarter. On the revenue side, we now see clear light at the end -- on the real estate front, which will be beneficial obviously for our REIT business.</p>
          <p>Page 18, here is the part of the private wealth management. As mentioned previously, you can see on this page that the acquisition of the Sal. Oppenheim group has had a substantial impact on the results of our private wealth management business. As shown, the total impact was a EUR 368 million loss, which included an impairment of EUR 62 million on BHF, for which we, as you know, are currently finalizing the sale negotiations.</p>
          <p>The losses were recognized in the purchase price and are flowing through the P&amp;L as expected. So none of these losses come to -- as a surprise to us and we actually are tracking quite well versus our assumption on the purchase price.</p>
          <p>Joe mentioned in his presentation, we are confident that the Sal. Oppenheim business, the remaining Sal. Oppenheim business will come out breakeven in 2011, for Deutsche Bank for the group.</p>
          <p>Cost realignment of Sal. Oppenheim is now being completed. Going forward, we will report the Sal. Oppenheim result as part of PWM and not disclose them separately any more. PWM business excluding the Sal. Oppenheim group had a very good performance in 2010, and increased its revenues in all business lines in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We're also pleased with the performance of our retail business on page 19. The pre-tax profit of EUR 222 million includes a net as I said already of EUR 30 million positive contribution from Postbank after certain costs related to the acquisition, and EUR 25 million costs for non-Postbank related efficiency measures.</p>
          <p>Beyond the statistical results in the investment products, PBC saw a strong revenue momentum from deposits, driven by net new money of EUR 4 billion, which mainly came from the very successful transfer deposit campaign in Germany.</p>
          <p>Going forward, PBC results will include the full benefit from Postbank, net obviously of integration costs, as well as the amortization impact resulting from the purchase price allocation, which I will discuss, in detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>As Joe mentioned in 2011, there will be a higher contribution from our stake in the Chinese Hua Xia Bank, we expect the closing of the stake increase to 19.9 to become effective in March or April of this year from the date of closing it will be carried at equity.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to some current issues, and let me start on page 21, with a quick introduction to the operating expense increase, and the operating expense theme. We here provide you with an overview of the changes we've made regarding our compensation structures to respond to regulatory requirements mainly the steps, guidelines in the German institutes <mark type="inaudible" /> which became effective at year-end.</p>
          <p>These are some of the key features we introduced for our regulated stuff, and fees covered by regulations. We increased deferral percentages, which vary between 40% and over 75%. We introduced an additional retention period for 50% of the so-called upfront component, and we introduced new claw back features, which are tied to division of pre-tax profit.</p>
          <p>The total amount of deferred equity and cash which will be awarded in a few days is the same as one year before which is about EUR 2.5 billion which is deferred over three years. In terms of guidance, you can assume that between 20% and 25% of this amount will be amortized in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Net of the deferred compensation into equity and cash has generally been changed to a 50-50 for all employees receiving a deferred award which is everybody who gets a bonus above EUR 75,000. And I would also like to remind you that we have undergone a substantial payment adjustment that has already affected our 2010 results. This will obviously now remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to the cost development and because of the fact that Joe already has gone in some detail and explained to that, I'm just going to go quickly over this. In this chart we showed you our fourth quarter, you see approximately half of the increase quarter-on-quarter relates to the consolidation of Postbank for one month, and the remaining increase is due to the upfront cost for ongoing efficiency measures as Joe has also highlighted.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to page 23. Here I show the cost development now not for the quarter, only but the comparison for 2010 versus 2009. In addition to the impacts from the three acquisitions, and the Complexity Reduction Program, there were three other factors which had a material impact compared to the quarterly view.</p>
          <p>First, we had specific items, which we had to adjust to make the cost base of 2009 comparable. On a net basis, it was a debit of EUR 300 million, which did not reoccur in 2010.</p>
          <p>Second, a EUR 645 million foreign exchange impact, which increased cost versus 2009. I will be fair here, there was also a benefit to revenues from exchange rate, which was roughly twice as high, but still the impact in the cost the negative impact of the cost of foreign exchange, something you need to take into account.</p>
          <p>Incremental amortization of deferred compensation added another EUR 500 million to the cost base, and we want to caution you will note there will be an additional incremental increase in 2011. The remaining increase of net EUR 600 million is due to significant investments into the efficiency, and into the growth of our platform. Roughly half of these are IT investments and the remainder are mainly professional service fees for growth and efficiency projects. The fact that the group head count rose by approximately 25,000 employees, is reflected in the cost growth and has to be taken into account for the cost line going forward obviously.</p>
          <p>On page 24, I want to visualize an effect that we have to consider when looking at operating expense at Deutsche Bank going forward. You will visualize the mid-term aggregated impact of all three efficiencies programs that we have launched. That's the Complexity Reduction Program, we then had the CIB integration program, and obviously the Postbank integration. All these three programs obviously generate cost achieved and obviously will then subsequently provide the savings that we expect.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we target net savings of around EUR 1 billion in 2012, this will rise to approximately EUR 1.8 billion and move into EUR 2 billion magnitude thereafter. Given the difficulty to predict market developments is obviously a crucial element for profitability for us on a going forward basis.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to page 25. And let me take a few minutes to walk you through the Postbank PPA as this will help, but this has a significant impact on our performance and on the numbers that we showed you.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the under IFRS. So let me start with this under IFRS. An acquirer has to perform a PPA by taking all assets and liabilities at fair value on this balance sheet upon change of control. In line with the accounting requirements Postbank has to carry more than 80% of its assets and liabilities at amortized cost and not at fair value. The resulting difference between Postbank's carrying value and Deutsche Bank's fair value from the PPA are recognized through the so-called fair value adjustments upon consolidation. Fair value adjustments directly impact the goodwill calculation, and thereby drive the immediate capital consumption upon consolidation at Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>As you can see now on this page, the capital consumption from Postbank upon consolidation is very close to the initial estimate we communicated in September last year, even though the markets have moved quite conservatively in the meantime. So from a qualitative point of view, we came in much better than expected. To quite some extent, this is a testament to how Postbank keeps its accounts and values its assets and liabilities.</p>
          <p>As the CFO of Deutsche Bank, I was pleased to see that our new subsidiary sets up its accounts in compliance with the rigorous standards that Deutsche Bank also applies. The higher net negative fair value adjustments impacting the goodwill and thereby the capital consumption on Deutsche Bank level are primarily driven by a few factors. Firstly, market movements. An example, interest rates have increased and hence significantly reduced value reserves for example, on the mortgage portfolio. And as I alluded already to, the European sovereign crisis has lowered the value of sovereign bonds.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the improved information transparency after the change of control for example on pension and tax provisions. And thirdly, obviously some methodological differences due to the requirement of our continuity and consistency in cost expense alone in books and records. In this context, I would like to emphasize that the requirements of flight to value to Postbank's assets and liabilities as of December allowed us to achieve P&amp;L protection on Deutsche Bank level in the degree of EUR 4 billion against future impairments or losses from Postbank's corresponding investment securities and the commercial real estate portfolios.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to the last topic, I wanted to highlight it's the last item is we address the situation with regard to the mortgage related litigation in the United States. From 2005 to 2008, we sold approximately 79 billion of loans into private label securitizations and 61 billion through Whole Loan Sales, including GSCs.</p>
          <p>As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately 588 million of outstanding repurchase demand and we have established reserves that are adequate and you see not a very material number. As of December 31, 2010, we have completed repurchases and otherwise settled claims on loans with an original balance of EUR 1.8 billion. In connection with those settlements, we have now obtained releases for another EUR 21.9 billion.</p>
          <p>From 2005 through 2008, we or our affiliates have also acted as an underwriter of approximately of 110 billion of RMBS for third-party originators. Invalid repurchase claims, we will continue to contest, and loss of actions will continue to be defended. Based on these numbers involved and our current loss experience, we feel comfortable. Looking at the numbers above and looking at the numbers I provided in the chart, by the way, we're in a much, much better situation than many of our competitors.</p>
          <p>So, thank you very much and I hand over for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Philipp Zieschang, UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Three questions if I may. The first one is, could you share your thoughts with us on the, a normalized result in corporate investments division following that Postbank has been moved to PBC. So should we then cut the EUR 10 billion by a certain amount, given that you have the casino in Las Vegas there and other positions also do you think basically we should look through corporate investments, as we should also look through consolidation adjustments given the cost allocation.</p>
          <p>The second one is, listening to the press conference today, you had a, I thought a fairly confident speech. Is the investment bank do you think or is mitigation at all something you worry about in terms of revenue impact throughout 2011 and potentially 2012, because it didn't pop-up there at all as an issue which might could offset the market share gains and all these positive developments you were highlighting in terms of the investment bank.</p>
          <p>And third one, could you just comment on your net -- on your non-performing loan or problem loan reduction in the Actavis stake or if you, how that position has developed and what the actual exposure actually is now to that firm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we still didn't get quite get your second question. What was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was basically on the, when I look at the revenue development within the investment bank, is the huge mitigation program you have. Is that something you expect to offset revenue growth or because I thought at the press conference you were actually highlighting a rather positive outlook on the total CBS revenue line. So is that something we should bake in in terms of revenue losses or is that a rather a minor event according to your plans on -- essentially I'm asking about gross revenue growth and then net of your mitigation budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me ask you Stefan to start with the CI results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two observations. The first observation CI is outside of our EUR 10 billion projection. Our EUR 10 billion projection is the result of our business division, corporate investments is not part of our business division. So no matter what number positive or negative you might have in CI it does not affect the EUR 10 billion number. Only to clarify again, that we are measuring at a different level here. CI use to obviously have positive results from the strategic decision that Deutsche Bank took many years ago to start to build down its strategic investment portfolio which has happened over the last couple of years, now we have rather run the shop costs, we have now CI mainly is the home of some of the legacy assets in terms of the Cosmopolitan Resort or the ports et cetera that we kept in this business section.</p>
          <p>So we expect some minus 300 run to shop costs in 2011 in this area to give you some guidance around the size. And we obviously will not have positive effects from either the sale of industrial participations or obviously valuations effects as you correctly alluded to the Postbank effect.</p>
          <p>If I answer your second question, if we understood you correctly, do you mean with mitigation our results and our integration of CIB. We honestly see a growth in our revenues, in our investment bank. We obviously see therefore also a contribution from the costs from the Integra project. And therefore, our view is that both parts will support the step-up that we would see in the investment bank between the years 2010 and 2011 profit achievement.</p>
          <p>And to Actavis, to your problem loan and definition, Actavis, what we did with Actavis is we completely restructured it. We restructured the capital and loan side of it. And by restructuring, we could move it out of the reclass portfolio. It's not an asset anymore in the IAS 39 reclassified portfolio. And moved it therefore out. So our impaired loans were down by EUR 1.2 billion, primarily driven by this one restructuring case in Actavis, whereas the previous non-performing loans have been restructured into an exposure accounted under the equity investment method. And the remainder of the Actavis exposure that we kept is performing quite well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one word Philipp to the integration again. This is primarily done because we want to exploit more synergies on the revenue side. And I mentioned that in GTB, as well as in corporate finance and I will say, so far, excellent results with that. Already many of the major deals we won, just talk about in Hong Kong and the U.S., but also in China have actually, their origin in a much better and closer cooperation between corporate finance and markets. And I think that is a key to increase our revenues. It has been the -- to increase our revenues in the advisory business and capital market business in the last few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry if I haven't been clear, just quickly on the mitigation, the question primarily related to the risk weighted asset mitigation in terms of your budget, which you presented in the third quarter, basically of these 280 billion gross increase in risk weighted assets, you took out 2.5 and 3. You flagged back then a mitigation of 90 billion. And I was just wondering also in light of your comments this morning, whether this 90 billion are a negative revenue item in terms of the reduction of your risk weighted within the investment bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Integration instead of mitigation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now that's a different answer then. No, it's clear that we said all along that reducing our risk weighted asset or our newly risk weighted assets, because many of these legacy assets have been different. The impact on the revenues are relatively small and much more important to reduce capital requirements as a consequence of that, then the revenues which for instance I give you the -- which is a more simple example than the trading book is Postbank. They have a 30 billion core business for risk weighted assets with a return on equity over 25%, and we have a investment portfolio of 30 billion risk weighted assets with a return on equity of almost nothing. So if you can free up the 3 billion and reallocated it to the core businesses, we are doing much better, and that's a bit the same in many of the other legacy assets we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I have three questions. The first one is coming back to the IB in particular, at the Investor Day there were some assumptions clearly for the targets given, and you outlined some of them, Dr. Ackermann. I was wondering how you think about the global revenue pool, as there were some indications given at that time in order to reach your pre-tax target.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to Sal. Oppenheim and BHF. I was wondering how should we think about the losses in the businesses that we see in AWM, and how should we think about that going forward into the next year? I understand from the press conference that number should become zero, I'm just wondering what is actually one off besides the severance and the impairments in BHF? And how much is really ongoing restructuring expenses or real expenses that are running through the P&amp;L in 2011?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on IAF 39 reclassified assets. You have slide 35 and 36 in Mr. Krause's presentation, EUR 27 billion under IAF 39 impact on CIB book. I was wondering, how would, what's the mark to model on this book and it looks to me that based on slide 36, you have another EUR 15 billion coming on commercial real estate from Postbank. And I was wondering, how we should think about mark to model on that book? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the first question. You remember that we said at the Investor's Day a global revenue fee pool should grow to a level slightly below the first nine months 2007 annualized. So that was the roughly 9%. We are now seeing that we see a somewhat slower growth in the fee pool than the 9% we had. So -- but that is overall -- the question of course, are we more confident in relative terms, namely gaining market share in certain markets and I think the more recent experience in the United States, but also in Asia have demonstrated that. That's why for us, despite a global &#x2013; a somewhat slower growth in fee pools we think we can offset that, thanks to our broader regional diversification and that we have entered the more strategic dialogue with many, many clients, especially in the U.S, but also in Asia. Okay then the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the second question, what was the question, related to the SOP/BHF and how much is one-off and how much will be the ongoing restructuring in 2011. For BHF, obviously we are mostly concluded because with the sale, obviously we will finalize the agreements there. BHF has been running well, they have been able to maintain their customers, they've been able to maintain their business and obviously we will expect now some slight restructuring in order to get BHF ready for the agreement that we struck with AGT on the sale. So, I would say that there will be some, but not a significant amount of one-off and then ongoing, obviously BHF will not be part of the group although, it may take a few months and a year for that to happen.</p>
          <p>SOP, as we told you, for our P&amp;L estimate for -- in the plan has been that we will achieve breakeven. We now believe that most and that was the idea of the acceleration of the expense that by some, most of the expense we needed in order to derisk and restructure that platform has been taken in the last year. Obviously, there's always a little cost to take off, but it should not be material.</p>
          <p>And on your question regarding the mark to model impact on the IAS 39 book, I think we have this attachment in the -- on the presentation on page 39 in which we disclose how the development of that portfolio has been. As you see in the fourth quarter and especially for the year, we saw a further narrowing of the difference between the market valuation and assumed mark to market, which has been very positive, the reduction in the amount is mainly driven through the 27 billion by the way.</p>
          <p>It's mainly driven by this one transaction there, which is Actavis that we classified out of the book. We were, if you know or not, we started the year with a good amount of sales in that portfolio and successful sales in terms of selling even slightly above our marks. And now obviously then throughout the rest of the quarters because of the crisis and concerns and the market uncertainties, we had obviously a slowdown in the reduction of this portfolios and the main event that happened was the reclassification of Actavis in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up on the PPA of EUR 4 billion that you have on an earlier slide on Postbank, is that mainly related to the EUR 15 billion book in commercial real estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's one of the assets, that obviously that PPA takes is related to all the assets and liabilities that were fair valued, but it provides limited protection for all the book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on page 33 I think we have a good overview of -- we told you which -- as we saw the assets and liabilities and value since the quality effects were allocated to the different assets and liabilities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a potential there of EUR 4.8 billion to add to that information, so a total of EUR 15.6 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick clarifications please. Firstly on the bank taxes, the liability taxes, I assume those are not in your 10 billion targets because they will be through consolidation and adjustments, and I realize it's a bit of a moving target at the moment, but I penciled in a cost of about 300 million. Does that sound like it's in the right kind of ballpark for 2011? And the second question is just on your Basel III roll forward to the greater than 8% target for January 2013. Am I right in assuming that that doesn't include any of the 8 billion in deductions which phase in from 2013 to 2019? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all to the levies as you rightly say, we still don't know I mean we can add it all up what is theoretically possible, but we still assume that there is some sort of a consolidation between, a reconsolidation between Germany and France and the U.K. and others. So in that sense it is unclear. Even the German directive is not yet detailed enough to say how much it will be. So any number would right now be wrong and could give you the wrong indication. That's also the reason, we haven't factored that data in any numbers yet. So, now the second on Basel III.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me say that about the Basel III question is correct. The 8% does not include the items that will be phased in until 2019.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Yes, first question was just a quick recap on something you said earlier, actually. The guidance that you provided on corporate investments, now taking into account, obviously the impact of Cosmopolitan.</p>
          <p>Secondly just wanted to try and get a feel actually on the investment bank, in terms of the rates in the credit business, which obviously suffered in Q4. Whether this was worse in Europe or whether it was worse in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just to try and understand kind of what your views are on both the kind of CC capital surcharge and the LCR ratios, going forward actually, clearly that could impact a bank like Deutsche, but just generally the large wholesale banks to a greater extent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Stefan first just to repeat what you said about CI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on CI again our guidance there is that, it will be about a 300 million hit ongoing run the shop costs because as you know, we have allocated lots of legacy positions of work out situations that obviously we all intended over time to sell and I alluded some it was Cosmopolitan, it's included there, but that's not the main part of it. There's many other assets as well like the harbors as you know, the ports that we have in Canada and in New York, et cetera. So those operating expenses hit this and then obviously the run to the shop of the costs and there's many, many, many other assets smaller in size and permanence than the Cosmopolitan and Maher Terminals that are included in the segment.</p>
          <p>And again the main reason why this number now will turn to the negative is that we don't have compensating effects that we used to have in terms of the Postbank valuation as an example or the sale of industrial holdings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear, it's EUR 300 million PBT level as a rough guidance?</p>

          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Negative, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Negative of course, yes. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now -- what you said is that the equities business did very well as you have seen. The debt business did well, was in line with market, actually better than the average, but was below one bank. And of course one bank, they are more considered, compared with we are aware of that. Now, the reasons are in our view that primarily the European business suffered more in the fourth quarter than the U.S. or Asian business. And as we are particularly strong of course in the European business with all this debt crisis discussion around us, we suffered probably a little bit more than one other U.S. bank in rates and credits in the fourth quarter, but that is our explanation of why we think we are slightly behind that bank, but we are still better than the average. Now to the fitness question.</p>
          <p>Well first of all, nothing is decided, but some people think we should make some progress in the course of this year. I mean there are different aspects, one is systemic surcharge. The other one is bailing in CoCos and many other living will and so on. First of all even if there were a systemic surcharge, that would not happen in the first three years of implementing Basel 2013 the way it looks. On top of that of course if you say we will be already at or above 8% in 2013, where the minimum would be 4.5%, even if you had some sort of an additional incremental surcharge for Cifis, we would of course be capable of coping with that within the regulatory framework.</p>
          <p>I know there is strong opposition against Cifis from several European governments, so actually I'm a little bit more optimistic about the whole question right now than I was some months ago. So in that sense even if some sort of Cifis regulation will happen, assuming we are on a Cifis which I would assume. I think it will not have a major impact on us in the next few years.</p>
          <p>The liquidity ratios are still pretty unclear, we are working with that I mean, that will be a burden for many of us, but as you said many times that's something we are preparing ourselves, and I think we are well advanced in coping with this challenges.</p>

          <p>Thank you, and good afternoon. I just have two quick number questions if possible. The first one goes to CB&amp;S where in the quarter total assets were down 15%, while the risk weighted assets were actually up 6%. And just wondering if you can give a little insight there. Is there some methodological change or is this the result of the derivative hedge expiry you were talking about earlier, a shift in business. What's going on to see such a disparity or if you could. And then, also in his presentation, Mr. Krause gave a total amount of EUR 2.1 billion in deferred compensation and that was unchanged in the last year. And I just -- just from my understanding, is that EUR 2.1 billion, that's the total amount of deferred compensation you have, that's not what was awarded for 2010, but not expensed if you will?</p>
          <p>And then, you gave EUR 2.1 billion for this year and also last year and just order of magnitude, I mean where would that number have been if we were to go back to the beginning of 2007, just so I can understand that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. To start with your last question firstly, it would have been about half so it has a significant deferral impact if it were to go into a run rate we had pre the crisis and pre the changes in the structuring. So that's mainly the affected change of all the regulation that's really resulted into an ongoing as we discussed in the past, and you are right, there was obviously in the moving from, the about EUR 1 billion deferral level to this EUR 2 billion-deferral level. Obviously, there has been now a transition, which somehow has impacted many of these ratios negatively, has kind of really changed and it's actually that when we saw in the comparison, it was one of the topics of discussion this morning.</p>
          <p>Is your comp really up, because the comp number show it is up. But it's mainly up because of the way how this deferral portions now are working through until we find, let's say the new compensating even development that we will have. Then again, in the future, where then the comparison is and it's really this is the deferred compensation. All the deferred compensation as you ask the question, it doesn't -- you can't deduct from that what the expense, the effective VPE the, the payments, what, that's really the deferred piece.</p>
          <p>To your first question, IFRS assets are showing derivatives, growth which have come down and that's mainly principal to market moves. While risk-weighted assets obviously use the net derivatives, hence the reduction obviously in the IFRS balance sheet that has come through and doesn't show. It's a result of how derivatives are accounted for in a RWA basis versus in the balance sheet basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just seems like there was a reduction in volatility or something like that that brought the derivative portion of your total assets way down, is that right?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Couple of questions. Firstly, on the Postbank integration restructuring charge of EUR 1.4 billion, could you let us know if any of that's yet been taken, and if not when you expect to see that flow through and how and whether that's incorporated into your EUR 10 billion target. Next question just coming back to Kian's question on the fair value of the IAS 39 assets, I think the EUR 26.7 billion is a carrying value at the end of 2010, could you give us the fair value of those assets, so we can see what the unrealized losses are on those transferred loans? And then finally in the past you have given some comment at this stage on how January went for the investment bank, so would it be possible to do that again maybe in the context of last January? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start with the last question, which is the easiest one. We went off, have been off to a good start and inline with our expectations, but that is something which happens almost every January. So never an unrealized January, but this time it's also true for all the other businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I'll give you an answer now to the fair value of it. I really -- if you look at my assessment on page 39, I think all the numbers you are looking for are there. We saw that the current status, if we look at the life to date we have a favorable EUR 2.3 billion through the P&amp;L and the EUR 285 million in capital which is substantially reduced from the starting ground from the 3.3 that we had at the beginning when we reclassified to the 1.8 in capital and the 3.3 in P&amp;L. I think just refer to page 39, I think all the numbers that you are looking there are quite clearly outlined there, if not give us a call, but I feel it's all in there.</p>
          <p>And then the PBC integration restructuring charge is something that we said as soon as we take over Postbank, we would start the project of the integration and the 1.4 billion is a number that will flow through P&amp;L over the next three years more or less. Yes, that's the current plan as we then also achieve the results, and that's why we also on questions that we received this morning whether we ease our EUR 1 billion target, it's true <mark type="inaudible" /> part of this 1.4 billion will obviously flow through our 2011 results being offset by then hopefully a positive contribution on the P&amp;L side from Postbank. That's why we said the Postbank consolidation for the plan itself has no major significant material impact but more or less between its profitable -- its profits and the cost the share of this EUR 1.4 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of timing should we think it split evenly over the next three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have -- if you go to -- to help you a little bit, we will direct you to page 24, where we've shown the net cost savings on how they flow through and if you look at the line items on how this will occur.</p>
          <p>It's obviously all the three programs we're running.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have two questions please. The first one is on your risk appetite. I mean I'm guessing right now it's kind of keep it tight given the uncertainties in the markets, but your leverage is 23 times, you've got 145 billion of liquidity portfolio. In your assumptions, are you assuming you can take your risk appetite up during the course of this year. And then the second question is on Sal. Oppenheim. I think when the deal was announced, Mr. Krause said that you thought it could kind of make the profits it made in the olden days, which were around about EUR 300 million pre-tax. And I think this was somewhere today that you're talking now about EUR 140 that is the medium-term target. I wonder is that old guidance is dead Sal. Oppenheim and if so why? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the first one. No, we have no intention to increase the risk appetite. I think we changed the business model. We want to reduce volatility in that business and that's why we keep the risk appetite which we have. Sal. Oppenheim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the Sal. Oppenheim, you are correct. The original estimate was that we were going to keep the EUR 100 billion in assets that the Sal. Oppenheim group took. Subsequently we made a decision after looking at the portfolios in the business and the business of BHF. As you know, subsequently, we made a different decision on BHF. We decided to go through a sales process and we are selling obviously a large part of these assets and that's why the profitability of that has obviously come down as compared to the level before. That's the main explanation as to the fact that we took out this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that EUR 140 million figure that was on Bloomberg today, that's the new profit guidance for Sal. Oppenheim here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not issued a profit guidance, but it's lower than the 300 that I usually had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was in my speech 100 to 140 million but that's of course in 2013, 2014 we said. But this is also on a much lower purchase price, I mean take out PAS, take out BHF, so you get a much lower number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. That's fine. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Dirk Hoffmann-Becking from Sanford C. Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Three questions if I may. The first one is, I still don't completely get the RWA increase in the investment bank, because if I strip out the IFRS U.S. GAAP differences, I still come to sort of 4% drop in assets and I come to a drop in VaR as well during the quarter and nevertheless the RWA's are up. So if you can give me a bit more insight on how that happened? The second question is on the guidance for CB&amp;S. I understand the 500 million are in addition to what you have given us in 2009, so have your market expectations actually changed. And in particular by how much and in particular in global markets. And then lastly the impact on GTB on the guidance of EUR 300 million, is this entirely interest rate, so if the interest rate trend actually goes back to what you previously expected, should we put back the full EUR 300 million into GTB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the last one, yes, absolutely GTB is, has a tremendous leverage in terms of inexclusively and of course it will go back. Second question, yeah, it's obvious if you add EUR 500 million and you stick to the more or less the same number, obviously, other revenues have been lower, that's true that's why we reacted the way we acted. Remember that some years ago when we said we are achieving 25%, we do everything to achieve the targets and of course if we see that markets are changing, then we are taking management actions. That's exactly what we did, okay. Risk weighted assets, Stefan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I can only say that the main effect is the accounting different effects and we'll have to get back to you, but honestly we don't see any further issues, its really the RWA development its really only very remotely linked to our balance sheet development. And therefore obviously especially in the trading business as you know that risk the way how we measure risk weighted assets and the base of it is very difficult. And then the only other information I gave you earlier was that on the Q4 result, I showed you the impact on the credit risk side that was 7.5 billion of this one hedge trade which expired, that was the only other major effect in it. But be careful there is no link between an IFRS balance sheet in that sense and the risk weighted asset development as we mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And even the U.S. GAAP adjusted one because that takes out a lot of the derivatives volatility?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then by the way the other topic I should get here from -- let's not forget that we also have Postbank in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>The next question is from Christopher Wheeler, Mediobanca Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First of all on capital again. Sorry to go back to this. But if we look at where you are on Basel III, this -- over 8% without deductions, clearly you're sticking to the laws of going to 2019 both in terms of that and in terms of any counter cyclical buffers, et cetera. But, obviously, a lot of your competitors in recent weeks have focused on 2012, beginning of 2013. And they're looking at considerably higher levels of Basel III core Tier 1s. Does that worry you at all from a competitive perspective or are you pretty relaxed on that? But you are worried about it in terms of what it might do to your share price rating. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is pretty straightforward. BHW could you just tell us what are your plans now for BHW post the consolidation of Postbank. And then finally again on Postbank, you have obviously put all of the revenues for the year, the fourth quarter into the other category. Presumably, you'll be reallocating that in a more elegant fashion across the various categories in 2011. Could you tell us whether you'd be able to give us some indication of what it would have looked like on 2010 Postbank numbers using the same categories? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question. No, absolutely not. Over 8% core Tier 1 in 2013 where you have a regulatory minimum of 4.5. In my view, we are very well capitalized and most banks by the way I talk to are saying we are approaching similar numbers because it will only be maybe six months from now, where you will start focusing more on the return equity again.</p>
          <p>We want to be well capitalized, but we would like to meet the financial markets requirements in terms of return on equity. And not to be overcapitalized and then you will say what are you doing with the capital. So, in that sense, we are very happy and more and more we get this kind of feedback from our investors as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Ackermann, I'm not sure which banks you're talking to. But in terms of the investment banking space, I think they said, it will be heading higher. I appreciate what you're talking about on return on equity. That's obviously really, really important, but I'm just intrigued.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not important point for what you're saying. I mean we have to differentiate between different business models. If you are a pure investment banks, maybe we have some different ratios. But we are a universal bank. If you are just a retail bank, you will probably be even below that. In that sense, I think it's very important to say, if you are a bank where you have primarily a private banking business and very little risk weighted assets, because you're not in retail or commercial banking, you're home markets had to be small like the Swiss bank then of course, you can have a higher capital ratio because you need that in terms of attracting private wealth management clients.</p>
          <p>If you are a pure investment bank, you may have to meet higher requirements from financial markets. I think if you are a hopefully one day and not that far away a 50-50 bank between the traditional business and investment banking, I think an 8% number is a good number, and if we split up the bank and allocate this number, we think it's the right one for the traditional businesses, and the remaining piece is to the investment bank. We will have a much higher number in the investment banking space, and I think that is something we probably will do one day.</p>

And on Postbank please understand we've had just one month of consolidation we didn't do a split in December.

        <plist>
          <p>And the last question is from Michael Rohr, Silvia Quandt Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, very good afternoon. Actually just two add on questions from my side please. Firstly, on the cost reduction programs that you have. You've said that you're going to achieve a roughly EUR 1 billion net saving in 2011. And looking back into your programs that will obviously come from the CIB integration, and the Complexity Reduction Program, so nothing from Postbank. And also coming back on Matthew's question on the EUR 1.4 billion costs you achieved at Postbank. Certainly that will be offset by the Postbank P&amp;L probably in 2011, but given that you want to achieve an additional EUR 1 billion of synergies, I just wonder how we should handle that and plug that into our models going forward for 2011 and 2012, probably you can give some more light on this in terms of the modeling there and in terms of your targets going forward.</p>
          <p>And the second one, once again relates to the page 33 of your presentation where it says that the amortization of positive fair value adjustments will burden future results. And obviously we might have a good idea on the EUR 1.1 billion fair value of owned debt on the liabilities there. Could you possibly guide us on the EUR 3 billion of fair value adjustments on the asset side as well. And very final one relating to the PPA, and the losses that you're protected against off the 4 billion. It says in the footnote that EUR 2.6 billion of the EUR 4 billion relate to Postbank's structured credit portfolio, and investment securities. And if you can possibly explain what your assumptions are in the back of that and why they differ that much from the Postbank assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start with the cost reduction programs. Here, we have three ongoing cost reduction programs as we outlined and you are correct in terms of the guidance we've given for the Postbank related ones, it will be more or less a wash, yes. So in terms of the net impact, obviously the PBC division. PBC themselves are participating obviously on the Complexity Reduction Program and some efficiency initiatives they have started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>PBC, itself, the old PBC may have some benefits obviously from this program. The 500 million that we are guiding around the CIB integration will obviously accrue to CIB. There is some costs achieved there as well, by the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That obviously is going to impact CIB performance. And then complexity reduction will be a net of 600. Complexity reduction to the largest part refers to our infrastructure division. And our infrastructure division savings are allocated back to all the divisions. So all the divisions across, Joe talked about for example this morning as well benefited. Asset management will have, the same as private wealth management, out of this production, that is a result of allocated cost from our infrastructure groups back into the divisions that will obviously below our 500 to 600. I hope that gives you some help on how to do the math.</p>
          <p>On the fair value of Postbank and the PPA protection, we have two effects. We have positive values and negative values. Those ones that were positive, obviously amortize over the time into P&amp;L because the positive value means we have taken a gain to capital and now depending on how it gets realized, there will be an impact. But on the other hand, we have had significantly higher negative ones that are providing the protection that I just alluded to. So that's how we said in the net effect of positives and negative fair value adjustments, number one, we have protected ourselves and obviously we have built in case that we have a positive development some upsides as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I hope that helps you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It definitely does. And you gave some details also on the third quarter presentation, I guess on this Complexity Reduction program. Just coming back on the structured credit portfolio of Postbank the 2.6 billion you've protected yourselves against, is that a full fair value assumption of the book, which was I guess mainly a level 3 hold maturity book at Postbank?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I will have two questions please. The first, do you intend to increase your return on risk-weighted assets at the CB&amp;S division into medium-term, despite the implementation Basel 2.5 and 3. And if yes, how can you do that with such an increase in the risk weighted asset base? Second question, could you give any guidance on the pace and magnitude of the debt arranging process at Postbank. For instance, should we assume a 10% reduction in risk-weighted assets per annum in the corporate banking, financial markets and other divisions at Postbank? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yeah thank you let me -- we have under capital account we have provided you an overview with the mitigation effects across the whole group and we've talked about it, so we don't allocate it in our disclosure to specific business divisions. We have only given you some specifics on Postbank, which we believe over the next couple of years, obviously, in the next two to three years, we have a significant potential of risk weighted assets reduction, which by the way we already had some success even in the first month of it's consolidation in terms of derisking, but we don't allocate direct to the different divisions in that sense and have not disclosed it any further. And to the return on risk-weighted assets, it's obviously difficult to say, we'll have a substantial charge on risk-weighted assets and additional risk weighted assets to deal with. Of course I'm sure our business -- will need to provide the ROE's, and therefore that we expect for the capital of the bank. And therefore, we'll have the manage that. To make a prediction at this point it's very difficult in what magnitude or how the development will be there.</p>
