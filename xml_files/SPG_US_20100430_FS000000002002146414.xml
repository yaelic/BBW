      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us. We'll give you the highlights and then open it up for questions. First of all, we reported FFO as adjusted for the first quarter of $1.41. FFO after the loss on extinguishment of debt related to our January tender offer was $0.94 per share, $0.09 above First Call estimates. Per share amounts reflect the impact of the issuance of 52.1 million shares of common stock through public offerings and dividends in '09. In the first quarter of 2010, the impact to FFO per share of that activity was $0.17 cents per share.</p>
          <p>It was a good quarter operationally and financially. The consumer is spending more. In our centers,  our retailers are feeling better about their business, and the debt markets are strengthening. We're clearly seeing the impact of an economic recovery, and it's beginning to surface in our results. However, we continue to believe that the recovery may be slow, and there will be challenges in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
          <p>I'll walk you through some of our key operating statistics. Beginning with this quarter, we modified the reporting of statistics of our U.S. business by combining our malls and outlets. We made this change for several reasons including it is more representative of our entire enterprise performance. Combined together, these assets represent over 86% of our net operating income.</p>
          <p>The historically bright line between malls and outlets is becoming more blurred every day. Many tenants are leasing space in both property types. Tenants that have historically operated in outlet centers are now leasing space in malls as well as other venues including strips and street level shops, and traditional mall tenants are now opening concepts in the outlets.</p>
          <p>And we also consolidated the back office of the Premium Outlet business into our Indianapolis infrastructure last year. We believe this is an improved methodology, but understand that it may take time for you to adjust your models. Therefore to assist in that process, we have provided historical data for occupancy, sales, rent and leasing activity on a combined basis for 2005 through 2009 in the 8-K we filed this morning.</p>
          <p>We continue to lead our peer group in comparable property net operating income growth, generating 2.5% growth in the first quarter. Drivers of that increase in comparable NOI include much improved bad debt expense as well as a reduction in the bankruptcies in 2010, higher overage rent through the sales growth, as well as our continued focus on cost control in the home office and field.</p>
          <p>As of 3/31 comparable sales on a rolling 12-month basis was $467 per square foot. Sales growth accelerated in the first quarter with tenants reporting sales 6.6 higher during the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009. We also saw a very strong improvement in the month of March with sales growth of 10.6% as compared to March 2009, partially aided by the shift of Easter.</p>
          <p>Sequential quarterly occupancy changes from 2009 &#x2013; 12/31/09 were in line with historical trends and were consistent with our budget. As of 3/31, occupancy was 92.2%, 10 basis points higher than a year ago. And now beginning with the first quarter of 2010, the re-leasing spread is being reported on a rolling 12-month basis. This spread was $2.11 per square foot or 5.2%, and we're seeing improvement in leasing activity in 2010. The first quarter spread under our old reporting method for the first three months of 2010 was at $2.69 per square foot or 7.2%. Demand for space continues to improve as the economy recovers and tenants continue to experience positive sales trends.</p>
          <p>In January we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash outstanding notes maturing in 2011, '12, and '13. $2.285 billion of the bonds were tendered at a weighted average interest cost of 5.76%, and are duration of two years. We recorded a loss on this of $166 million, which is what was recorded in our first quarter with this transaction, and obviously we told you about that as soon as the transaction was done in January.</p>
          <p>Concurrently, we sold 2.25 billion of senior unsecured notes, our largest ever notes offering. We had a great book. Our orders totaled $10 billion. The average duration was 14.4 years and the weighted average coupon was 5.69%. As a result of this activity, we extended the duration of our senior unsecured notes with no overall increase in our weighted average interest rate.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we paid off $300 million of senior unsecured notes that matured on 3/18, and unencumbered two malls totaling $282 million of mortgages, as well as paid our cash loss on the extinguishment of debt of $166 million.</p>
          <p>Subsequent to the completion of the company's new unsecured corporate facility in December of '09, five additional banks have added a total of $280 million, increasing our borrowing capacity to 3.845 billion. The facility has accordion feature, allowing borrowing capacity increase to as much as 4 billion.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, 2010 we had 3.6 billion of cash on hand, including our share of joint venture cash, approximately $10 per share, the availability of our corporate credit facility of 3.2 billion, for a total liquidity position of 6.8 billion. Additionally, we anticipate generating over $750 million of free cash flow after the payment of our dividend. We also declared an all-cash dividend of $0.60 per share.</p>
          <p>At this time I would like to make a statement regarding our acquisition of Prime Outlets. First let me say that we expect to close this transaction per our definitive agreement. The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the transaction. We have met with the FTC and are fully cooperating in that review. As you may know, the U.S. antitrust authorities have consistently recognized that the retail real estate industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and is one of the only industries exempted from Hart-Scott-Rodino filing requirements, and it's whether they are discount retailers, manufacturers, or otherwise can and do lease retail space in a variety of locations.</p>
          <p>According to recent estimates, there is approximately 14 billion square feet of retail space in the U.S., approximately half of which is space in shopping centers of all kinds. Our assets comprise only 3.5% of the total shopping center space.</p>
          <p>In addition to the wide variety of physical sites, e-commerce websites and mail order catalogs have become established in powerful retail outlets. And only a small percentage of U.S. off-price retail sales are conducted through retail outlets located in the properties owned by SPG and Prime. This will be my only comment today regarding this transaction.</p>
          <p>Just let me conclude, as I stated in the morning release, the year is off to a positive start for the company. We reported solid results and are encouraged by the trend of the retailer sales. Our retailers are exhibiting more confidence in their business, and we're seeing increased inventory in the stores. The environment for new store openings is slowly improving.</p>
          <p>Going in the secured debt market has significantly and positively changed in the last two quarters with the re-emergence of structured secured lending and the continued activity from life companies. Strong sponsorship remains a critical component for lenders. With that in mind, during the first quarter we have circled two 10-year transactions totaling $515 million at an average interest rate of 5.95. We expect to lock rate within the next month on two more 10-year fixed rate transactions, comprising approximately $550 million, at even lower rate spreads than in the first quarter. And all of our 2010 secured debt maturities are done.</p>
          <p>While we do not believe demand exists for any new non-outlet development projects, we're selectively spending capital dollars on expansions and selective international activities, all with expected double-digit returns. We're adding 116,000 square feet to Houston Premium Outlets. We're adding anchors and big box tenants at more than 20 regional malls, mills, and community centers. We started construction on our second Premium Outlet center in South Korea, as well as expansions at two Premium Outlets in Japan.</p>
          <p>And once again, we believe we're well positioned to continue to deliver solid results in 2010. And as a result, we've increased our bottom end of our 2010 FFO guidance by $0.05 per share.</p>
          <p>And so with that, Operator, we're ready for some questions.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. <mark type="Operator instructions" />. And your first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to ask some questions on the General Growth sort of for perspective. What's been the feedback as you guys have had your discussions as far as the warrants from the Board's perspective? Are they viewing the warrants as something that would disrupt the bid? Or are they viewing that as an integral part of the alternative proposal for the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't really know other than to say, Alex, that there's no reason to issue warrants when you have a better deal economically, more certain better sponsorship, a better diverse group of investors. So I don't know why they would issue any warrants given the current state of play. It doesn't compute from my perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second part on the GGP is &#x2013; what's the dynamic? I think earlier the unsecured creditor committee came out in support of you guys. But given that Fairholme and Pershing own a good chunk of that, what's your sense of the dynamic between the unsecured creditors committee and the respective unsecured debt holders themselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't speak for Fairholme or Pershing Square. I can only tell you that we've had positive support from the creditors committee. They view our deal as more certain, and we think they'll continue to support us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the final question is just on the guidance, just two line items, just for your lease term expectations for the year and provision for credit losses? And then as far as Prime goes, should we be assuming that in our numbers for this year, and is that in your guidance? Or what is your recommendation to us as far as our estimates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Steve answer the first two, but let me just say on Prime, as we said at the beginning of the year, Prime is in our guidance. And when we issued our guidance earlier in the year, we anticipated an earlier close to Prime. So we're not going to pinpoint exactly for you at this moment when we expect it to close. We do expect it to close, but the fact of the matter is we haven't changed our guidance. In fact, we've increased the bottom end even though what we gave you initially, we've been delayed from when we thought we would close Prime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, this is Steve. I'll just talk a minute about the other two items you asked about. The bad debt expense, as &#x2013; you did see we actually had a recovery in the first quarter. I wouldn't expect that trend to continue. Although as I look at the landscape right now, I do think bad debt expense will be relatively muted throughout the rest of the year. But I would expect to see some expense, not necessarily a recovery.</p>
          <p>On the lease settlement side, we did have a spike in activity in the first quarter. Historically, we run about $5 million a quarter, 4 to $5 million of just ordinary normal course of business. And I'd expect the run rate for the rest of the year, the remaining three quarters, to kind of fall back to that historical level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the outlets versus the malls, I think I understand why you're combining them. But &#x2013; and could you just &#x2013; last &#x2013; for 2009 there was about a 500 basis point difference in the same-store NOI growth, and you're up in the first quarter. And could you talk about the contributing factors and whether that disparity is consistent with when you last broke it out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer that. The disparity has narrowed, and we had positive comparable property growth in the mall business, if you just look at the mall assets for the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the lease spreads, the rent on expirations was much higher than what you've reported previously, and obviously your lease terms were way up. I wonder if those are sort of related and whether we might see that number as a blip that comes back down based on maybe some closings of high end stores or if that's not accurate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Paul, it's Steve. We clearly are seeing some positive momentum in the leasing business. I think David mentioned in his prepared remarks, if you looked at just the first quarter activity on a standalone basis, the spread was actually almost $3 a foot. So no, I would not expect it to be a blip.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay, I guess just to clarify, my question was whether that high number on the expiring rent is abnormal &#x2013; your average for the year is quite a bit lower than what you reported in the first quarter of $40.71. Is that indicating anything specific relative to what closed in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, don't forget our business is such that a lot of the leases are still geared towards the retailers' year end. So we have the largest expirations at January 31. But it's not reflective of anything different, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just, Rick, maybe you could talk a little bit about where you're seeing open-to-buys increase and also maybe a little bit of clarity on whether we're seeing more activity from some of the bigger footprint type stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me do the first on the specialty store tenants across all the platforms, it is obviously a more constructive leasing environment. And we have a number of tenants that are now coming back and wanting to open the stores in '10 that they otherwise might have opened in 2008. There are a number of new concepts like PS by Aero that are moving ahead, Sperry and Stride Rite from Collective Brands, and we're looking at a lot of deals with Microsoft. As you know, they opened two stores. One of the two is in our property and it's performing very well, and they're excited and we're excited that they're looking to grow their footprint.</p>
          <p>On the box area, if you look at the schedule we have in the 8-K, you're going to see a increasing amount of activity there as well. And the thing to remember is that development today is probably at 40-year lows as David referenced, so that is certainly playing into our hands to absorb the existing inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I guess I wanted to try to maybe continue the line of questioning from Paul. But if we look at where you opened leases in the quarter and you look at the lease expiration schedule, I guess what I'm trying to really figure out is if Chelsea has historically had 30% rent spreads and we know that the malls were slipping last year...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me interrupt you, Steve. We also had positive rent spreads in the mall business, in the mall assets. And again, remember that there's a lot more activity just given the size of the portfolio of malls versus outlets. So if that's what you're headed to, we've had a positive in both. And again, the expirations for the quarter, maybe there are some unusual...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The mix can change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the mix can change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, David, my question was really &#x2013; I guess I'm trying to think, when you were giving guidance or we were talking about your business, I thought late last year, the beginning part of this year, you thought that the mall spreads would be down and maybe closer towards the single-digit range or very low double digits versus spreads that had been closer to 20%. Now that you're merging these things together and we have to think of them as one number, what do you think spreads collectively for both the malls and outlets will be this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to be consistent with our guidance. The specific number I think we'd have to get back to you on. But we don't see a big change in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess maybe for Rick, talking about open-to-buys, is it fair to assume then that maybe &#x2013; the leasing that was put in place here in the first quarter was done under an environment that was pretty stressful, is it fair to assume that this was reflective of a really tough situation the last six months? And I guess when would you expect to see maybe those numbers start to trend higher? Is that a three quarter event out, or might we see the spreads start to rebound in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to be further out. You have to understand, the leasing that we're doing today is not going to open until the fourth quarter at the earliest, and we're starting to talk about '11 leasing. And obviously the stores that are opening new in the portfolio were done last year with a little less constructive sales and profit dynamics, and so that's going to reflect slightly lower, slower rents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll just say, Steve, we continue to have a lot of pressure put on us by the retailers on the rent, so it is a challenge and we're doing the best that we can. But there's a lot of leverage and pressure the tenants are putting on us in terms of rent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess just lastly, David, you did mention I guess you're looking at some selective development opportunities on the outlet side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you just talk about maybe how return expectations for that business have changed, if any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's not just us. I think generally the outlet properties are attracting a lot of new entrants into the outlet business. And there's lifestyles that are being converted to outlets, there's malls that are being converted to outlets-type tenants, part of the morphing that we see going on in the industry. So that's one of the things that we're dealing with. But it was not just us.</p>
          <p>And I would say generally, the returns are under pressure, not dramatically so. The returns historically, as you know, Steve, have been really, really positive. They're still double digits, but it's not &#x2013; it's probably off a couple hundred basis points if not more, just because the rent pressure in that business &#x2013; even though the demand is good, the retailers are just generally cautious and able to negotiate pretty good deals.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it'll be a little bit better but I'd say 10 to 12, just through it. Do you want to pin me down with a number?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so &#x2013; you know, you probably went from the 14, 15 range probably to 10 to 12.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the other thing is the outlet development pipeline, not just us but generally, is different than it was five, six, eight years ago. The idea of being next to a full price is kind of out the door. Their land costs are much higher because they're really in regional mall locations essentially, and construction costs have kind of stabilized. But I think land costs and tenant improvement costs have certainly gone up.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple of modeling questions first and so &#x2013; for Steve I guess, the same-store NOI number that you're quoting here, is that pre or post lease term fees and credit losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does not include lease termination fees, Jim. It does include bad debt expense.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that very positive variance we had in Q1 is part of that number?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Second on the home and regional cost line, that number was below 20. I think that's the first time since before I retired the first time. Can you just tell us why and where that number's going?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me amplify on that just a bit, Jim. Don't expect the same amount of positive variance because we did have a true-up from a legacy incentive plan related to the outlet business that provided some of that favorable variance in the first quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Most of the favorable variance in the first quarter, Jim, was attributable to the legacy plan.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the favorable variance was about 8 million in the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the final question for me is really a big picture question for you, David. That is, you've obviously been talking with a lot of major institutions in terms of joint ventures, both domestically and overseas.</p>
          <p>And the question I have for you is whether you've seen any change recently that matches what we saw on share price performance over the last couple of days, whereby those institutions are showing a clear preference to invest in North America as opposed to Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think they see the U.S. &#x2013; I agree, and they see the U.S. as having certainly better growth prospects than Europe. We see the same thing frankly, and that's part of what's driving us in some of our decisions in Europe. And I think they see &#x2013; they are also moving toward &#x2013; the alternative investments have been put a little bit on the back burner, and they're looking for core investments. And when you look for core investments, they like a regional mall. So both of those are aligned in terms of what's happening on the capital front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then finally regarding the international side, you announced a couple of projects, new project expansions in Asia. Should we be expecting more of the same? Does that continue to be a sector where the opportunities for new development are going to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but primarily if only exclusively in the outlet format. So South Korea, we've got a few more opportunities. We're very close to starting in Malaysia, which we hope will attract the Singapore market. That is the focus. As you know, we sold our Walmart-anchored malls in China. Could we do outlets in China? Maybe, but at this point, we are very comfortable with the outlet format in those kind of areas in Asia, so we'll continue to push that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it a competitive advantage that you have in the outlets in Asia versus full price, or is it just a lack of opportunities that yield?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say we're good at what we do there. We've got the right partners. We've had success, so it's always &#x2013; success begets success. And full price, certainly in China and other, I think the yield on full price is very, very, very tricky. And the thing that I've seen in Asia is that if the tenants don't produce, they don't really necessarily pay you what they want to pay you. So we just think the outlet sector is actually a little more risk averse. And we've been successful there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everyone. Could you talk about the dynamics of the anchor stores maybe versus the in-line stores and perhaps even some performance by segment? And I guess also, David, you talked about some challenges ahead. Are you worried about store closings at this point, or is it really just more just sort of comments about the slow recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Rick talk about the department stores, but absolutely store closings, our occupancy went down. Store closings are an everyday event. The retailers are &#x2013; if they don't have the right rent as a percent of sales, they will close the stores. We had suffered through that a lot last year. I think &#x2013; I give credit to Rick and the leasing team for maintaining occupancy. But store closings absolutely continues to be an issue. I don't think it will go away any time soon. I'll turn it over to Rick on the anchors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would say to you in addition to store closings, a lot of the specialty stores are downsizing their footprints. So there's pressure in that regard as well as they're trying just like us to do more with less. On the anchors, performance is obviously better. Balance sheets are dramatically better. Virtually every one of them are at stock prices that they haven't seen in years. And they are more optimistic about their future and they're more focused on top line growth.</p>
          <p>That I don't think it's going to immediately transfer into department stores looking to open new units. They're just working on making their existing product better, and it is more productive and that helps us drive more traffic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And David, going &#x2013; just sticking with the store closings theme, do you expect that to happen throughout the year? Or do you think that retailers try to hang on for much of this year and it falls into later Q4 or into even Q1 of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they've already made some decisions. So we know that in '10 when the lease expires, we're going to have to deal with store closings. So look, the environment &#x2013; we've got a better shot at keeping some open given that the world's getting better. But it continues to be a focus for retailers. If they don't have the right rent to sales, they're going to close the store.</p>
          <p>So you've seen our rent spreads compress and our occupancy get dinged a little bit because of that environment. The good news, it's moving better. But it's got to continue to move better for us to be able to deal with the store closings.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just last question for me on the dividend, I know you had to right-size the dividend last year when liquidity obviously dried up. But how do you &#x2013; when do you reconsider the dividend in those conversations with the Board given your yield is now about 2.7% and your payout ratio is as low as I've seen it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, very good question, we're going to address it a little bit with our taxable income at the fourth quarter. It depends on where we see that. I think it's a good question. We'll be able to see how the year shakes out. There won't be a change in the third quarter in terms of the $0.60. We'll see where taxable income is in the fourth quarter. And then I think depending on our view of the world, we'll see what the right number is for '11. Good question though.</p>

          <p>The lean years, yeah, two days ago, okay, right? So two days ago, but in any event, so we struggled, frankly. We've got good momentum. I'll let Rick talk to you about the percentages. But we brought them on at obviously a horrific time, but we're making progress. So I don't know if you have the numbers in front of you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the only &#x2013; I would add that at Domain, we're going to hopefully by the third quarter be about 80% occupied. And at South Shore, Target is opening in October and we anticipate being about 80% open at that time as well when Target opens. And David is right, they were both very well executed, but the timing could have been a lot more fortuitous.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, long term obviously we believe very much in both projects. But we just have to keep pounding away and get it leased.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I know you're not thinking about non-outlet development at this point. But I'm just wondering if the hesitancy of the department stores to open new units continues, might you see something more like a St. Johns Town Center opening from you guys than a traditional mall?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will tell you we just &#x2013; the outlet, there's a good pipeline out there for the industry. I &#x2013; Rick should comment. I just don't see the demand. I just don't see it from our standpoint. Rick?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add is that the discussions we're having with department stores is how we can add them to our existing properties. I don't think any of them believe there are a lot of underserved markets left in the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add that the focus &#x2013; we had obviously a lot of redevelopment stuff that we put on hold. So I think &#x2013; as I said probably the last call is, I think we'll start to see some of that put on the drawing board again. I think that's the first step for us in any event as opposed to ground up new development ex the outlet assets.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, it's Michael Bilerman here with Quentin. David and Rick, I just want to come back to the leasing spreads for a second. If we look at the supp on page 18, for 12/31 for 2009, lease spread was about $5, right? And then 3/31's a trailing 12-month number, which includes most of 2009 in the first quarter. And the store closing rent jumped up from that $38 to 41, which is a pretty massive spread to include just all the first quarter expiries.</p>
          <p>And I think you had said that there was a $3 positive spread in the first quarter. But I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out how that math works when 2009 was positive 5, trailing 12 in the first quarter is $2. Something is just not matching up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hey, Michael, it's Steve. Just from a math perspective, what's happening is the first quarter of last year was very positive. And in fact, if you go look at our 8-K from the first quarter of last year, my recollection was that the spreads in the mall business were $9, so you had a very positive quarter burning off.</p>
          <p>And obviously as David and Rick alluded to, the leasing trend is getting better. We're seeing better spreads in the first quarter of '10 than we saw in the fourth quarter '9. But you're replacing a quarter with lower &#x2013; that has lower spreads, from taking out the first quarter of last year which had very high spreads. That's the simple...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess in the expiration number, that 40.71, the $41, your average &#x2013; I mean, if we go back to the prior supp, the average mall rents for '10 that were expiring were 36, 37 bucks. The outlets are in the high 20s. For the trailing 12-month average to be $41, it just doesn't &#x2013; something is &#x2013; I guess where you're signing rents make sense. I guess where they're expiring doesn't.</p>
          <p>And so I don't know if there's something particular in the first quarter relative &#x2013; the last 12 months from 12/31/09, the expiries were $38, right? So if you roll in the first quarter, for the first quarter to roll to 41, that would mean the first quarter expiries were probably high 40s or even 50s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But don't forget, Michael, two things. One, the closing square footage in our spread calculation is comprised of two things. It's comprised of normal lease expirations, and we disclose for you what our lease expirations are over the course of any period and you can see what the average rent is. But it's also stores that closed prematurely, whether that's bankruptcies or whether that's lease settlements or lease terminations.</p>
          <p>And obviously, as David and Rick alluded to, in the environment that we're in, if a tenant doesn't have the right rent to sales ratio, they're going to close. We had some high rent tenants that closed. As an example, think about all the jewelry stores that have closed over the course of the last 18 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, right, and I think that's what you're seeing in terms of having a pretty big impact in this year, first quarter, because we had a lot of jewelry stores close.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. David, going back a couple months ago, you had said in a release that there was a number of other things that you were working on in terms of growth opportunities and that you were not going to sit on your hands and wait around for a situation. Can you give an update as to where those other situations are, the size of those opportunities, and how you're thinking about that aspect of your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I think it's safe to say we're good, but it's hard to work on one big deal and a lot of other ones at the same time. So our focus &#x2013; let's not forget we have a time deal we're looking to close. But our focus obviously has been on General Growth. And I think at the time that we mentioned it, we were still debating what role and how we might play in General Growth.</p>
          <p>Obviously a lot changed from the last time we spoke, and we've been exclusively focused on that transaction. So if it so happens that there's nothing there for us, which is a distinct possibility, I'm very comfortable with the ability to grow our business externally. But I can't give you chapter and verse as to when and how, I don't think that would be appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess were those opportunities being marketed, and at this point now that you've pulled back from them, they'll go to someone else? Or &#x2013; I'm just trying to get a flavor of what...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think any of these were auction-oriented marketing deals, and it wasn't like that kind of stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly in terms of you mentioned the redevelopment in the malls will probably be the first project that you start looking at. I'm just wondering what you feel is the timing of when that might commence and probable scale? I assume it's still quite a way out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; no, I don't think it's quite a way out actually, Rick. And I will tell you, we're going to end up spending more redevelopment dollars this year than we thought &#x2013; as we were planning at the end of '09 and into &#x2013; last year actually. Our CapEx expenditures, now some of it actually by the time we get it all done will be spent in '11. But there's a lot of activity on the redevelopment front, and we'll spend more in this year than we anticipated and I think that will carry over into '11 as well. Rick...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and if you would just look at page 34 of the 8-K, we've shown you a number of the redevelopment projects that are coming online in the remainder of 2010. And some of these are significant upgrades to our properties, and we have a pipeline of opportunities that we are working on. And as they get to the point of starting, we'll share them with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as retailers looking for smaller store sizes or a reduction in store size, is that something that's going to drive more redevelopment say, over the next five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's a redevelopment as much as it's going to enable us to maximize the NOI out of our better properties because we're going to have more space to lease to more tenants without having to add additional space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question just on the outlet versus the mall, what percentage of the NOI has the cross-pollination or the cross-fertilization of tenants? I know you've been increasing it, but I still thought it was predominantly a separate tenant base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, it's really more &#x2013; I would say at least 40%, 50%, if not more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So 50% of the outlet NOI are also in the mall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, essentially. You have a lot of companies like LIZ that do both, and Gap that does both. That's off the top of my head, I don't know specifically. But the pure manufacturers are more vertically integrated now, so they do retail and manufacture. The pure retailer or Gap does both. And so if you go through the list, I'd say off the top of my &#x2013; the old &#x2013; just like the Mikasas of the world are gone. So I'd say I'm happy to walk an outlet asset with you, but I would tell you it's &#x2013; just off the top of my head it's 50. We could certainly do that math, but wouldn't you say it's around 50?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and just anecdotally, if you look at all the announcements that have been made over the last few months about new concepts coming to the outlets, they've almost been exclusively from retailers that are already operating in our malls such as Ann Taylor LOFT now Outlet, Coach Men's, LensCrafters, Vera Bradley, New York &amp; Co., Christopher &amp; Banks. Those are all mall retailers that are now moving concepts into the outlets as well, which is again an example of the convergence that David talked about in his opening remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just going back to the numbers again, Steve, if you could just help me out a little bit. The recovery of the credit losses in the first quarter, could you explain exactly why that happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we were over-reserved at year end based on an account by account analysis of receivables that we didn't think we would necessarily collect, and we collected them in the first quarter. So when you have a reserve out there and there's no receivable left, you've got to reverse the reserve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then the 20 million lease settlement charges in the quarter, was that specifically from a few concentrated tenants or from a bunch of tenants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bit of both. There were a handful of multi-stores that did normal ordinary course of business as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then operating expenses for the quarter, 98.7 million, that was a little bit light versus 1Q of '09 year-over-year comparable. When I think about forecasting going forward, is that 98, 99 million number more the run rate you're expecting, or did you have a special &#x2013; or did something unique happen in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things. David mentioned trying to do more with less. We've obviously been focused on cost. You do have seasonal costs. As an example, utility costs are much higher in the summer because you're air conditioning the centers. But there's no question that we're seeing the benefit of aggressively managing the costs in the malls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want us to take credit. Not only did we outperform, we also outperformed with all the snow expenses. So we had one goal this quarter was not to use the extra snow as a reason we missed our numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning. David, I was wondering if you can give us your updated view on the acquisition landscape in your sector? Obviously General Growth is the elephant in the room, and you previously commend that you're exclusively focused on this. But I wonder if they end up going with the broker-sponsored re-cap, do they end up selling assets? And also there's some speculation that some of your mall peers could be consolation prizes if you don't get General Growth. I'm just wondering if you can comment on what you're thinking or perhaps expecting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we &#x2013; let me just make a general comment. I have no idea if Brookfield is successful, what they'll do with the company or how they'll run it, so I have no sense of anything on that. And if we're not successful, the last thing we're going to do is just go do a deal to do a deal. When we look at deals, this is really &#x2013; Ben, are you there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, I just got some feedback. When we look at deals, we look at what the value of the real estate is, not what we can pay for the real estate. If we did that, we'd get ourselves in trouble. So look, at the end of the day, if there's good real estate to buy at the right price, we'll buy it. If it's not, we won't, and we'll wait for that opportunity. So that's how we look at things. So it's not what we can afford to pay. That would be &#x2013; it's not the way to run anything. It's really what we think the real estate is worth and what the real estate might be worth in our hands.</p>
          <p>But with that said, I hope I answered your question. I have no idea what Brookfield will do if they're successful. And we'll continue to look like we always have over the last 15 years, 16 years, that if there's real estate appropriately priced that we think is more valuable in our hands, we'll be prepared to buy it. If not, we'll just wait for the right time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then if those good deals aren't there in the near term, I mean do you just use the cash to pay down the debt? Is that kind of the plan at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just going back to expenses, what's your ability from this point forward to further cut the expenses?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you doing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to the expenses and operating expenses in particular, so from this point forward, what's your ability to further decrease your operating expenses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, our philosophy is we hope there's no snowstorm &#x2013; no, I'm kidding. Look, I think we're running a pretty good shop. You got to &#x2013; the number one focus is you can't &#x2013; you've got to have a pleasant consumer experience for the consumer and obviously for our retailer partners, so I think we're doing that. And if we continue to drive those down, I think we might jeopardize that. So I'd say, Cedrik, we're operating probably as appropriately as we can. We've got to be very mindful of the consumer experience, and so I wouldn't expect us to be able to push that much further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in regards to the recoveries on the expense lines, you alluded a couple of times to retailers needing to have an appropriate occupancy cost in the properties. So is the CAM [common area maintenance] recoveries one of the items that is currently going down versus previously? Is this why you're still able to recover as much if not more from tenants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, remember, we've essentially gone to fixed, so it's all part of the negotiation with our retailers on what they pay in terms of gross rent. So there are very few lease discussions. We've still got some older leases running off, but there are very few lease discussions that have pro rata CAM at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so when you negotiate at this point, it's much more of a gross number than trying to divide between base rent and CAM recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still allocate it between operating expense recovery and rent. But it's not &#x2013; there's certainty for the retailer in terms of what they're paying us in terms of reimbursing us for operating expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one final question, I noticed that you purchased the partial interest in two of the mill properties from your German partner. Are you able to disclose the cap rate on those transactions?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. David, I'm not sure if you can break it out, but how much of your interest in GGP is driven by the structure of their balance sheet rather than their mall portfolio per se? Because I guess a pursuit of a platform with above average leverage, abundant long-term low rate secured debt could convey that you might have a view on core growth that will be soft for some time. Or maybe the better way to ask this question is for the cycle ahead, who do you think has the better balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer it this way. I hope you were not serious about that last part. But I think their balance sheet scares me as opposed to &#x2013; there's still a lot of secured debt and a lot of highly levered assets. So again, I hope you weren't serious on the last part.</p>
          <p>So we look at the assets. One of the &#x2013; obviously the big issues here is it's still a very highly levered company with not a lot of financial flexibility. And so the secured market as you know is still, Jeff, not back, and doing big secured deals is tough. It's getting better. But it's not there obviously. Our balance sheet compared to theirs is an apple and an orange.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's fair. I guess what I meant by better is to the extent that you see a more sluggish growth environment or even a rapid growth environment, is having higher leverage warranted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I think that was an argument that was made by them earlier, and you saw the result of that. So I don't think so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To switch gears, in your opening remarks, and I think this was touched on a moment ago, you had mentioned that outlets and full price malls are blurring. I know that shift hasn't happened overnight, but what does that say about the long-term sales growth potential for regional mall sales if brands are willing to effectively open off-price channels and undercut their full price channel? Do you think the next ten years will be weaker than the last ten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. I think everything has to be done in moderation. So I don't know that it'll be dramatic changes. But like we have said before, Jeff, there is retail real estate that's going to become yesterday's news. The retail real estate environment is under pressure. And certainly the Internet and e-commerce has had a dramatic impact on our business, and that's the biggest concern we have going forward.</p>
          <p>There are certain elements of that that aren't a level playing field, for instance on the Internet sales taxation and the ability for the pure Internet retailers to just avoid it. But I think this will cause &#x2013; and the whole environment generally is going to cause some retail real estate to essentially have to morph into something else or go out of business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess one last question on that then is a lot of the lifestyle center activity we saw, whether it's standalone centers or just the new wing on a mall, was somewhat reliant on restaurants as that new anchor, and they're still on their heels. To the extent we do see more shakeout in mall anchors down the road, hypothetically say it's Sears, how do you think of I guess about the alternative use of those big boxes down the road if there aren't a lot of big box users kicking around, and again the anchors for them right now at least seem to be on the sidelines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, hi, it's Rick. Again, I think if you look in the 8-K, you will see our most current thinking on how we're handling these boxes. And frankly, it's a function of the size of the box. Is it a one-level mall in a two-level box, a two-level box with parking on both levels? There are still users that want to locate in our properties, utilizing that real estate, that are going to make our properties better. But it's a lot of work and it takes time to get done, but the demand is slowly re-emerging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say look, at the end of the day if it is good real estate, it's going to get recycled. And the mall's still &#x2013; if you have the right critical mass and the right location, I think we've all demonstrated in our industry the ability to recycle boxes, and that ought to continue.</p>

I think David may have referenced something in terms of locking in some rates. And does it still look like you're going to end up paying off Forum Shops and Copley, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What David mentioned I think earlier was that our 2010 secured maturities have effectively all been addressed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That plan does continue to include paying off the debt at Forum and Copley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one other question, not to beat a dead horse but going back to the closing rent levels of $41, given the comments about higher rent payers and their store closings, the jewelry stores, should we extrapolate from that? What should we put more weight on: that the first quarter spreads were $3 or that you had some high rent payers in the first quarter that seemed like they closed where, if you look forward the spread may increase a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'd focus on the spread, and I'd also just focus on the bottom line results, which is we grew NOI by 2.5%. So that's what I would focus on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's just my personal preference so, you know...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, noted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a simple model. As long as cash flow is growing, then I'm reasonably happy. Yeah, Rick's saying not really, but I'm reasonably happy. If it's not growing, then that's the focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's how &#x2013; frankly, guys, that's how we run the business. We're looking at EBITDA or NOI growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, guys, a question for you on the Mills properties. You have regional malls on one end. You have outlet centers on the other end. Why not put the Mills metrics into the metric mix too? I mean they have the whole cross-fertilization thing that you guys were talking about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, that's a good question. The reason we don't is because that's its own separate company, and we have our partner in there that's got its own separate revolver, its own separate balance sheet. It's one entity generally so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And its contribution as a percentage of NOI to the total enterprise is a fraction of what the outlets and the malls do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do disclose operating statistics for it, but that's the primary reason. Whereas potentially the malls and the outlets are all together, The Mills because of its separate corporate structure is run independent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the metrics seemed a little softer this quarter. How do you feel about the whole Mills venture at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think the actual Mills projects are doing very &#x2013; we're pleased with it. Rick and I are pleased with it. Look, when we bought Mills, there were a couple &#x2013; two or three Mills that were really tough. We knew that going in. Effectively, The Mills' share of that cash flow was de minimis so we don't pull our hair out over it, though we continue to try to improve it. But I would say we've made a lot, a lot of progress on The Mills and improving from Potomac. Rick recited all the stuff that we've done: The Block, Ontario, the Great Mall, so there's a lot of good activity.</p>
          <p>Where we've had some slower results, and we got caught in the significant downturn, is the malls that The Mills owns, where a couple of them had some &#x2013; we were really excited about certain redevelopment opportunities like at Southdale and Del Amo, and that has taken a little bit back burner.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we got a Target deal with Esplanade, and we're working some stuff with Southridge, so we're regaining momentum with the mall portfolio, but that has taken longer. But generally, the results are exactly what we underwrote, despite the significant change in the economy. Tenant demand at The Mills has been good. So we're okay there other than the tougher ones, like a St. Louis, continues to be tough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure, yeah, and so when you guys are sitting at ICSC [International Council of Shopping Centers], these are just part of the mix that you're showing the retailers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just make a comment that we're also finding the convergence. Many of our tenants that are operating in the malls are looking and opening full price stores in The Mills.</p>
          <p>I had a conversation yesterday with a retailer on a space and he said, "Well, we're definitely going to go. We're debating internally whether we want to have a full price store or an outlet store in The Mills." And we're having a number of outlet tenants open their outlet stores in The Mills. It's all things to all people and a very good distribution channel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good, thanks. And then one last thing for you, Rick, you made a comment about the smaller footprints of some of the in-line guys. And I'm curious how much smaller &#x2013; how widespread is that, how far does that go? That could be serious over time if guys are reducing 10 or 20% or 50% or whatever they're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's on the margin, and there are a number of retailers that are growing their footprints. But it gives us an opportunity to improve our tenant mix because in a number of our properties where tenants want to consolidate their concepts, it gives us more space to deal with, and we can drive our NOI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would just add the only one that's really out there doing it in a big way is the Gap. But I think as Rick just said, they have very good locations, so it could be a win-win for both of us. We downsize and we get back decent space and we go from there. That's the only &#x2013; it's not to say there aren't tenants here and there with a store here or there that likes to get smaller. But I would say that's the biggest one out there that wants to do it on a broader basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, guys. I'm here with Ross Nussbaum as well. In your conversations with national retailers as they shift to more definitive plans for taking new space, would you say there's more of a quality and location bias today than in the last two to ten years rather than just focusing on blanket square footage growth?</p>
          <p>And this touches on a previous question, but generally speaking, what do you think is the ultimate fate of some of the classy secondary/tertiary market malls out there that stand today with above average small shop vacancy and maybe an anchor or two gone? Do those malls eventually become obsolete or do they get recycled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer the last part. I would say to you that depending on what's happening in that market, if it's a dwindling, dying market, those malls are going to go away. If there's something interesting, if it's good real estate, and the market could be a small market but it's got good employment, it's got good prospects, then I think it can be recycled. And we've seen it both frankly, where we've been able to &#x2013; Rick mentioned Richardson Square, as you know, a decent infill place mall that we basically tore down and redid it.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we had a mall in Indiana. We actually sold it &#x2013; a couple in Indiana, I won't mention names, but where we &#x2013; it was an old manufacturing town that the employment base was shrinking. The age of the customer was increasing, and we had no &#x2013; it wasn't well located and we had no shot at it. Thankfully we sold it and we went on. So I think you'll see a little bit of both.</p>
          <p>On your first part, I would say to you that it really depends on the retailer. But what they're really focused on is what sales productivity they can achieve from the space, and that's the focus. And then from there, results in the deal or the rent negotiation. But there are certain tenants that love moderate scenario. They have their idea of what they can afford to pay. And depending upon that asset, that may be a perfectly fine deal for that asset. So I do think though, Christie, there's clearly the focus &#x2013; much greater focus on what the sales productivity is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Ross had a question as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in reference to the combination of the operational information on the malls and the outlets, I guess just a comment in that I think, David, I understand your rationale. But I do think that the investment community would prefer to be able to see how those two distinct formats are performing individually, particularly after the Prime transaction closes, so just a thought there.</p>
          <p>But on The Mills portfolio, I'm curious, you don't disclose the same-store NOI growth for the community lifestyle centers or The Mills assets. I'm curious, what's the cash flow there? And how would that influence the 2.5% number that you reported for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ross, this is Steve. They're not major components of the overall enterprise, so they're not going to move the needle much in any event, but I will say that the cash flow for both the strips and The Mills is positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, David, about a month or six weeks ago, I think I had asked you a question at the NYU REIT Conference about what you thought about real estate valuations and REIT share prices. And you had a made comment along the lines that you were a little cautious, thought things might have gotten a little ahead of themselves. And here we sit 10% higher and cap rates have come down a bit. And I'm curious where you sit today on your overall evaluation of REIT valuations and commercial real estate valuations, looking at what's happened in the world over the last 30, 60 days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly other than our company being undervalued, okay &#x2013; look, I think generally we've just got to be very careful. What I don't want to see our industry or &#x2013; and I think it's broader just for all equity markets. I don't want to see us go from one bubble to the next bubble. And there certainly is a sense that we created just another little false sense of euphoria. So I've been surprised. Obviously we think we're in a little different position than a lot of companies. But it's still a &#x2013; it is a great surprise to me. I think we have to be careful as an industry that we don't go from one bubble to the next.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>

          <p>Hi, Nate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually good afternoon. I was just following up on that line of questions, can you talk a little bit about the sales trends you're seeing across your portfolio, maybe the As versus the Bs, and maybe some of the geographies where you're seeing strength versus weakness?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, let me just say on the regional thing, we're just starting to see a little pickup in Florida, California not so much. The outlets are producing a little bit better sales growth than the mall assets. And as I've said repeatedly, the Midwest is just the Midwest. God love us. But the good news is we're starting to see a little bit better trend in Florida. Rick, I don't know if you want to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a couple of &#x2013; little more color. In the outlets, the one area that has gotten substantially better is the international tourist is back, so those were doing significantly better. And in terms of &#x2013; you asked about categories. Home furniture, family apparel, women's shoes, specialty and family shoes are better. Not surprising, books, music, and kids' shoes and women's popular price were a little softer. I think as things got better, people have moved up a little bit on their price points, and I think you're seeing that in the results that are being reported by our retailers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just looking at the Prime portfolio, are you expecting to sell any of those assets, any prime redevelopment opportunities in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have any plans to sell any assets, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are any of them prime opportunities where you could invest some serious dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the good news with Prime is it also comes with a couple development sites that we're anxious to be able to build when the deal closes, so that will be a big focus for us.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of quick things. Do you have a transactions expense number in your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. The 3.7?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't really have that in our initial guidance. But that's what we spent this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's likely that you'll continue to have those, I mean are you...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's likely we'll continue to have those at least for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we should think of that as a downside component, or do you think you're comfortable given that you will have those, that your range is still okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we're baking it into our range more or less. But it doesn't seem like it's going away anytime soon, but it could.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last thing on tenant allowances, they were high in the first quarter relative to the prior year, even the full year last year. Is there any color about that and how are tenants still very &#x2013; how are they thinking about capital apart from rent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Paul, it's Rick. There's not been really any change in the negotiating dynamics on the TA, I think slight increases. Again, if you look at 34, we've had increased box activity, so that's a little more of the dollars. But in terms of the specialty stores, it's the same trends we've experienced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
