        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and thank you all for joining us on this Q3 call at GSK. I'm going to take you through just some headlines on the overall performance of the company and R&amp;D and then Julian Heslop, our CFO, will take you through some more detail before we open up for questions.</p>
          <p>As you have seen from the press release, the sales from the quarter were down 2% and up 4% for the year-to-date. This translates into a quarterly EPS of 22 pence per share and a dividend of 16 pence, up 7%. Now I recognize that it's quite tricky following the underlying performance of GSK given all of the different moving parts. I just want to take a couple of minutes to comment on that.</p>
          <p>First of all, with regard to general macro factors such as U.S. healthcare reform and European austerity-driven measures such as price cuts and delays in tendering. That had an effect of around &#xA3;140 million on sales growth for the quarter. So, in other words, sales would have been 140 million higher if we hadn't seen the additional European price cuts and the U.S. healthcare reform activity we saw earlier this year. If I look at three very specific company issues, I think that's an important opportunity to get to the true underlying performance of the company on a going-forward basis.</p>
          <p>Firstly, obviously Avandia sales which are now set to decline very quickly following the U.S. and European regulatory decisions of last month. Secondly, in this and the next few quarters, we're going to face a tough year-on-year comparison to last year's significant pandemic product sales. And finally, we continue to see, although it's obviously coming to an end, the impact of generic competition to Valtrex in America in this quarter. So although at group level, we therefore show this reported 2% decline, when you adjust for the Avandia, Valtrex, and pandemic year on year comparisons, all of which are finite and will start to wash out of the numbers in the next few months and over 2011, you'll see that the underlying sales growth for the quarter is 6%. And 5% for year to date. And I think we have a real sense that GSK sales performance is beginning to emerge in the daylight after a long period of challenge both from our portfolio and from the environment.</p>
          <p>This underlying growth number is indicative of the progress we're making in the disciplined execution of our strategy to shift investment and resources into key expansion businesses. For example, our emerging market business again performed strongly in Q3 with sales up 14%. Vaccines, too, had a very good quarter, up 19; very good bounce back in our U.S. business.</p>
          <p>Good start in America with our new oncology assets and some good performance in terms of reducing our costs and driving up efficiency of our U.S. business. In fact, since the first quarter of this year, we have increased our sales per representative by 36% through a combination of reduction and reallocation of resources in the U.S. We're very focused on improving the productivity of the U.S. business and I'm feeling that this is beginning to come back into a place we would be more happy with than where we've been for the last few years.</p>
          <p>Consumer healthcare continued to perform very well and ahead of markets in which it operates, growing around 4% to 1.26 billion in this quarter. And within that I'm particularly pleased with the performance of the nutritionals business which grew 12%, led particularly in India &#x2013; phenomenal performance of our India Horlicks nutritional business, up over 20% in the quarter led by a relaunch of the Horlicks master brand. We've now launched foods as well as drinks in India. We now sell noodles, cookies, biscuits &#x2013; all sorts of things under the Horlicks master brand and we are in the process of extending that distribution reach into a further 20,000 villages across the whole of India.</p>
          <p>Horlicks is really a tremendous success story for us and clearly puts us in great position in one of the fastest growing emerging economies. Back in the U.K., over a million consumers have now tried our new Lucozade Sport Lite. That's 4 times the consumption level of our nearest competitor in the UK marketplace. And just briefly on the oral care business, Sensodyne, for the sixth quarter in a row, recorded double digit sales growth.</p>
          <p>Moving to R&amp;D briefly, we continue to see very strong performance in our overall pipeline. In particular, respiratory continues to be very encouraging. We presented positive efficacy data for Relovair at the recent European Respiratory Society in September. And several of the key Phase III studies for Relovair are new fully recruited. We continue to see good progress on the rest of the respiratory pipeline, and I'm sure in the not too distant future you will hear more about that.</p>
          <p>That's important because those assets will really build towards extending our already very strong leadership position in the respiratory business. If we look at the quarter, our respiratory portfolio grew 5% to &#xA3;1.75 billion. We remain the clear market leader and the growth is coming from a broad portfolio of assets. Advair up 5%, returning back to growth this quarter. Flovent, particularly strong performance in the U.S., up 7. Ventolin, now 41 years old as an asset, up 15. And Veramyst up 23. Respiratory business remains very strong. Some movement between brands as we see the impact of changing in labeling in the U.S., but overall our market share and our acquisition of patients appropriate for our class of medication looks very encouraging.</p>
          <p>Back to pipeline, momentum very good. Five assets going into Phase III at Q2. We announced this morning the initiation of the integrase inhibitor Phase III programs. And as I said, I continue to expect an increased degree of visibility of further late stage assets in the coming months.</p>
          <p>What I would like to do now is pass it over to Julian to take you through a little bit more detail of the numbers, but I think overall I'm very content that this quarter demonstrates a very good step forward in terms of the execution of our strategy. Julian?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andrew. As usual, I will focus my comments on the results using constant exchange rates and excluding major restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>You'll have seen that the cost of sales margin for the quarter of 27.5% was almost 2 points higher than last year's figure of 25.6%. This reflects the impact of lower sales of Valtrex and Avandia, both very high margin products, and the inclusion during the quarter of one-off charges related to Avandia. If you exclude these one-off charges, the cost of sales margin was 26.4%. And cumulatively the cost of sales margin is 25.6%. Overall, I continue to expect the cost of sales margin to be around 26% for the full year.</p>
          <p>On SG&amp;A costs excluding legal charges were 9% lower than the previous year and represented 28% of turnover in the quarter. In the U.S. and Europe regions, these costs declined by 21% and 10% respectively compared to the previous year, whilst in emerging markets they increased by 10%.</p>
          <p>Cumulatively, the SG&amp;A margin, excluding legal charges for the year, was 29.5%. And I continue to expect these costs to be around 29% of sales for the full year. R&amp;D costs represented 13.9% of sales in the quarter and were 8% higher than last year. You may recall from last quarter three's release last year, that we benefited from a one-off credit and if you exclude this in the comparator, R&amp;D costs were flat. Year to date, R&amp;D costs are running at 13.6% of sales and I still expect R&amp;D as a percent of sales to be around 14% for the full year.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, other operating income was &#xA3;95 million and included royalty income of &#xA3;76 million. Cumulative other operating income for the year was 375 million and royalty income within that was 222 million.</p>
          <p>You'll have seen that with the exception of the disposal of our promotion rights to Boniva in the U.S., we have not made any significant asset disposals in contrast to the previous year. Consequently, I now expect other operating income for the full year to be around &#xA3;500 million, rather than the 800 to 900 that was my previous expectation.</p>
          <p>We remain financially disciplined as a company in both only acquiring assets at a price that provides good returns, but also in divesting assets at a price where sales offers greater overall value than retention. This year has not ultimately offered us the same opportunities compared to last year to divest assets at prices we considered acceptable. The reduction in other operating income will impact our operating profit margins for the year, which I now expect to be in the range of 32% to 32.5% of sales, excluding legal charges.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4% and reflects our continued progress in settling historic matters and my revised forecast for the effective rate for the full year is now around 29%.</p>
          <p>Perhaps a word on this. When we began the year, I talked about an expected tax rate of 28%.</p>
          <p>And then at Q2, I told you that given the significant legal charges we took in Q2, which had a very low rate of tax relief, that my expectation now was a tax rate of 30.5% for the year.</p>
          <p>And then we've had some success in settling historic tax matters. And that's brought that rate from 30.5% to 29%. But if you put those one-off factors to one side, that underlying 28% hasn't gone away, and it's still very good. So the 29% for the full year is a good estimate for the full year, but the underlying, if you take the one-offs away, is still around 28%.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share before major restructuring costs was 28.2 pence, 6% lower at constant exchange rates. The reduced sales of Valtrex, pandemic products, and Avandia are reflected in these results as are Avandia-related charges of &#xA3;147 million for sales returns, write-offs and other items. Actual rates EPS was 1% lower than the third quarter last year, and that was the result of a 5% currency benefit reflecting the strength of most currencies with the exception of the euro compared to sterling.</p>
          <p>Restructuring charges were 171 million in the quarter, and net of these we reported total EPS of 25.3 pence compared to 26.3 pence last year. The restructuring program continues to progress well and deliver cost savings to support the business' diversification strategy and overall profitability.</p>
          <p>Net cash inflow from operating activities during the first nine months of the year was &#xA3;5.3 billion, some 300 million lower than the previous year despite cumulative cash expenditure in respect of legal settlements totaling &#xA3;1.3 billion over the same period.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, it is worth noting that despite these legal payments, a 7% increase in dividends paid to shareholders amounting to 2.4 billion, and acquisitions and other investments of nearly 400 million, that the business was still able to reduce net debt by some &#xA3;600 million to just under 9 billion.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand back to Andrew.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Three questions, please. First, could you talk about the sizing of your U.S. field force? Whether you think it is now the right size, given it's going to be probably another three more years before you have Syncria on the market. Is there excess capacity which needs to be either taken out or somehow unified?.</p>
          <p>Second, perhaps you could comment on the U.S. scrip trends, the pharmaceutical business, which remains underwhelming, let's say. Even when you add Advair and Flovent together and you combine those with Symbicort, it doesn't paint so pretty a picture. So whether you could give any color on that? And then finally, what, if anything, should we read into the outlook for your GD3 diabetes therapy following the termination of the Lilly MacroGenics compound this morning? I presume you're doing ongoing futility analysis on that agent? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Andrew. In terms of U.S. sales force numbers, I think it's really important to look under the surface of what's going on. So right now we have 5,500 plus or minus people in our U.S. selling organization, but only about 60% of those head count are in what you and I describe as traditional sales force representative roles, is the first thing I'd say. The rest of them are in specialist or new roles around our account management operations.</p>
          <p>So I think it would be pretty big error to just assume that we've got 5,500 people who are operating in the way that we used to and therefore need a big primary care asset to keep them busy. It's not the way the U.S. is structured and it's really what we've been working on over the last few years to redesign how we operate the U.S. business.</p>
          <p>I feel pretty comfortable around that kind of number &#x2013; whether it's exactly the right number, we'll have to wait and see. And we tend to &#x2013; that number does tend to bounce up and down a bit according to how we see opportunities, and frankly, see the responsiveness of different assets to different kinds of promotions. So I'm certainly not going to say that number will never change. I don't think it's massively out of sync with where we believe we ought to be. And as I've said already, only a proportion of what you see as the headline number is actually in the more traditional type role.</p>
          <p>I would say that that overall number, as I've said already, significantly reduced in the last few months. We've taken 1,600 heads out in the summer, and that's moved our, as I've said already, our sales per head up by about 36% on a very simplistic kind of calculation. So there's a lot of change there. We'll see going forward, but I don't think there's any major issue there. It's also embedded in &#x2013; what we've also done is changed a lot the way we sell in the U.S. &#x2013; so much more account selling, much more direct accountability for individual representatives. And we believe that's the right way to go in the model.</p>
          <p>As far as U.S. Rx trends are concerned, actually I think it's very easy to get the wrong message on the respiratory business. If you look at our overall respiratory business, our shares are about flat, down fractionally when you combine Advair and Flovent together. Remember the Flovent &#x2013; the shift, if you will, to steroids is exactly what the FDA are looking for in the asthma marketplace. So I don't think any of us should be surprised to see that, and that's exactly what the relabeling wanted to see &#x2013; it's exactly what FDA wants to see in terms of a change in behavior of the asthma market in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The good news for GSK is we have about 60% market share of the monotherapy inhaled steroid marketplace, so obviously we're picking up a lot of share there. And roughly the two movements in share are countering each other. Not completely, we have lost a little bit of share over the last three or four months. But that's not that surprising given how strong a market leader Advair is. By definition, when any new entrants come in, somebody has to lose share and it's going to be the bigger product. If you look at any analog of the performance of Advair against now two new entrants into the category, it's extremely positive compared to prior analogs.</p>
          <p>If you compare to the performance of Advair in America to the performance of Seretide in Europe, it's very positive. And if you look at the performance of Advair in terms of its share of patients who are appropriate for Advair &#x2013; so its share of patients who ought to be going into a product like Advair, over the last six months, we've actually improved our position there. So there was a period where we were losing share of that type of patient; that's stabilized over the last three or four months, and that's a very encouraging sign.</p>
          <p>Of course, you're going to see new market entrants with higher growth rates than Advair because they're coming off a very small base. So a lot of this, I think, is kind of normal and predictable. There is one other piece in it that makes things look a little darker than perhaps they really are and that's that everything is being compared to a very strong early fall or early winter season last year.</p>
          <p>And if you look at the flu indexes for 2009 versus today, you will see a dramatically lower level of respiratory disease in the U.S. now. So there was a general market suppression which, of course, makes the absolute numbers look less positive than you would otherwise see. But if you look through that, you look at shares, you look at our performance of taking the kind of patient that ought to be going onto Advair, you put this into the context of the relabeling, I think nothing too much to be overly concerned about.</p>
          <p>As far as the Anti-CD3 program is concerned, obviously we've seen the news this week. I think this was the third of our major potential competitors in three different classes which have had problems this week. It's been a busy week for keeping an eye on the competition. There're some big differences between ourselves and this program both in trial design and in how we think these molecules actually work. First of all, we think that there's a potential difference in the way our molecule works in terms of downstream immunological effects. We have a different dosing regime which we think is very important and relevant. We have a different primary endpoint. We don't look at insulin usage. We do look at the C-peptide as a surrogate. All of which were very carefully thought through and agreed with the Agency before we started. And we're placebo controlled our trial, which we don't think theirs was.</p>
          <p>So there's a tremendous amount of difference here. I think it would be very premature to read anything across, and we're all systems go on that program.</p>

          <p>Hi, Kevin, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, Andrew. You've talked a lot over the last couple of years about simplifying the business. So a couple of questions as part of that. How many SKUs do you have? Do you really have 40,000? And how should we think about you simplifying the business going forward? Because I can't believe those 40,000 drive the profit, or whatever the number is. And how should we think about that going forward if you're not going to be disposing of as many bits of business as perhaps you would have thought? So how easy is it going to simplify the business if you can't get the buyers for your businesses? And the second question is about U.S. productivity, if I understood what I thought you said, you say now you're getting to get to where you wanted to get to with making it more productive. And the question is why has it taken so long because you've been working at it for a while?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first things first, as far as SKUs are concerned, yes, we probably do have 40,000 SKUs. Remember we have a vaccine, consumer, and pharma business in 150 countries all of which have more or less different regulatory conditions and it's not that surprising you have a lot of SKUs. Now, is 40,000 too many? Absolutely, and we have a big program to reduce that number of SKUs. So for example, in Stiefel we're taking out a lot of SKUs, in our European business we're doing the same and across the whole corporation.</p>
          <p>It takes quite a long time because it has a lot of regulatory complexity associated with how you do this. It's not about disposal. It's about actually driving standardization across the business. And there's been &#x2013; next time we meet, I can take you through a whole series of very good examples of how that's gone on in areas like Valtrex, the antibiotics and elsewhere, all of which have led to significant improvements.</p>
          <p>It's one of the reasons why actually despite all the price pressure that we absorb and all the loss of the ultra-high margin product in the U.S., our cost of goods remains a pretty decent number because of the tremendous amount of work going on in areas like SKU complexity as well as others to counter some of the pressure. Yes, there will be more opportunity for that and it's very much a kind of ongoing campaign to drive simplification in that area.</p>
          <p>It's got nothing to do with disposals. Disposals really fall into two categories. Sometimes we have, if you will, tail products which we no longer believe we're the best owners of and you see that from time to time. You saw us make disposals like that to Aspen. I think you'll see us make similar disposals, particularly in the consumer business going forward over the next few years as we streamline that portfolio.</p>
          <p>And there are other types of assets like equity holdings that we have. You shouldn't necessarily read across that because we're reducing our expectations for other operating income this year that it's just simply because we don't have tail products to sell. I mean there's a combination of tail products, businesses and equity holdings, and we have just taken the view that at this point in time it's not in the best interest of the shareholder to make disposals which we believe aren't at the maximum value they could be at.</p>
          <p>In terms of productivity in the U.S., I mean, as you know, Kevin, we've been taking a very clear look at the U.S. business over the last two or three years since Deirdre took over. I think over the last two or three years, we've probably reduced by about half our field force. I'm going to say roughly half. I mentioned the latest 1,600. We've been doing that in a measured way as our portfolio has changed.</p>
          <p>I don't think you'd have thanked us too much for getting rid of all the sales force before the products went generic, so we've been working very hard to try and synchronize it with that. And we've also been working very hard to synchronize it with the change in marketplace. Deirdre Connelly, who's come in I think is doing an absolutely fantastic job of a whole series of things, modernizing our commercial go-to market, changing the way our sales force operates and competes, really installing a whole new system of incentives and alignment to make sure our U.S. business operates properly.</p>
          <p>I think we've built a state of the art discounting and pricing capability in the last 18 months which is going to give us a very significant edge as we go into a much more complex price environment in America. And I think we're starting to see some tremendous examples of cost effectiveness and competitiveness of our business.</p>
          <p>If I look, for example, at our oncology business unit, which as you've seen, we're launching a number of new products this year and last year. Tykerb is increasingly beginning to come on-stream as it gets established, lots of exciting new data coming on that in the next few months.</p>
          <p>But we've also now seen a good launch for Votrient, good launch for Arzerra, all doing well, all taking good share against established products in the marketplace and we're spending 25% less on A&amp;P in oncology in America today than we were a year ago. So across the whole business in America, I think Deirdre and the team taking very prudent steps at the right moment to drive up productivity without putting at risk short term sales opportunities any more than is absolutely necessary.</p>
          <p>We all know the U.S. has been an incredibly challenged business for the last few years because they've lost probably $5 billion or $6 billion of business through generics and Avandia at more than 90% gross margin. The fact that they've been able to now start to turn that ship, complete very effectively in a number of new areas, redesign the way they operate, and as a corporation we've been able to absorb all that pain, I think shows tremendous resilience. And I'm looking forward to seeing which other companies manage to do the same in the next four or five years. Next question.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Couple of pipeline questions, one generic question. On the pipeline, Benlysta advisory committee meeting coming up. At this point the committee documents are out to committee members and you guys should have a good idea of what the major issues will be. Can you comment on what you think the major points of discussion will be with the product and your overall confidence level in a favorable outcome?</p>
          <p>Second pipeline question, on your integrase inhibitor I know you're going to begin Phase III trials. What would be the timeframe for finishing those pivotal studies? And then the generic question is just on Advair in Europe. What would be the earliest timeline for a generic entry that you think is realistic?</p>

          <p>Okay, Tim, you're specializing in the speculative, difficult to answer questions. Listen, Benlysta, I'm going to do the smart thing here and I'm going to say we're just too close to the meetings and everything else for me to get into a big speculative mode. We feel very good about this medicine. There's a tremendous profile, but ultimately we have to go through the outcome where everybody is preparing for that on the 16th of November. And let's see what happens there, right.</p>
          <p>I feel very good about the medicine, but we all know we live in a world where you don't take anything for granted, so we're taking a very diligent approach to this with HGS and that's about as far as I'm going to go on it. In terms of how well the drug's going to do, that's going to depend, once it's launched, on patient feedback. I'm convinced in this particular area that if patients really feel the benefit that we believe exists, that's going to be what drives the performance of the drug.</p>
          <p>As far as integrase is concerned, you're right, we announced this morning the start of the Phase III. It's going to be an 18 to 24 month program to get us to filing.</p>
          <p>In terms of Advair generics, that's probably the question you should have been asking the folks in Switzerland half an hour ago. Maybe you did. Maybe they gave you an answer, maybe they didn't. I hold the view I've held for a very long time which is that the generation of a substitutable generic either in America or Europe is very challenging. I think the potential for an available substitutable generic in the U.S. is far away and it's very hard for me to see how it could happen even in the next three or four years in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now can I rule out that there won't be sporadic odd generics popping up in non-substitutable ways in Europe? I can't rule that out. Do I think there's going to be a mass substitutable product? It's very hard to see it. And we've seen across all the European filings this year various generic companies withdraw the files that they've had in there for two or three years. We've seen all sorts of people stub their toe on what everybody thought was a very easy proposition and we're seeing even in the innovative end of the respiratory business, that companies can stub their toe on things like formulation technologies of these sorts of products.</p>
          <p>These are, it's tremendously difficult. I remain of the view that we are likely to have Advair as a very major product for GSK for a very long time. And I am of the view now that it's highly, highly likely that we will have by far and away the substantive proportion of Advair before we start there for all the way through the period where we start launching the successive generations of molecules. And I think that puts us in a good place.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a couple of questions on vaccines, please. Firstly on Boostrix and Synflorix, they're both up very strong in the quarter. Was that just a simple thing of tender timings or was there any &#x2013; is that real true growth going forwards? And then secondly on pandemic flu, somewhat surprised to see any revenues in this quarter from that item given that the seasonal flu vaccine now covers that strain of the virus. So should we be expecting much in the way of pandemic flu revenues in Q4 or indeed Q1 next year? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Kerry, listen thanks for the questions. Boostrix is beginning to catch on in terms of being a product with scale and momentum across a whole wide range of markets in the kind of adult/adolescent segment. There is an evolving interest there and I'd say nothing special but good. So I think that one looks very encouraging. It was a little bit turbocharged by some pertussis outbreaks in three or four states in America, I think South Carolina, California, Missouri all had outbreaks. So a little bit there, but actually if anything, that kind of thing is just going to establish the understanding of the need for the vaccine.</p>
          <p>Synflorix is a lot to do with emerging markets, a lot to do with Brazil. But remember what we've done with Brazil is we've signed a 10-year contract with Brazil on a number of things inclusive of Synflorix. So I think the right way to look at Synflorix is think about the Synflorix number in Q3, think about it as probably being a number which more normally might have been spread over Q2 and Q3 and that will probably give you a sense.</p>
          <p>So you're going to see repeated volumes on Synflorix. It's going very well. We're winning a tremendous proportion of the tenders around the world. We're pretty excited, actually, about the way Synflorix is going. The absolute scale of what you saw in Q3 is probably a bit higher than you would normally expect in a quarter. It's probably a bit more sensible to think about it as a number of over a six-month period.</p>
          <p>Pandemic vaccine, all sorts of bits and pieces. Mostly what you saw in the quarter was Japan. And I would guide you to say don't expect very much at all, but there will be bits and pieces. And some quite interesting governments have started to talk again about pandemic and everybody's got over a little bit what happened last year. But I wouldn't guide you to say it's going to be very material. You will see bits and pieces. So don't be surprised if you see bits and pieces pop up, but I wouldn't go further than that.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I've just got a few on the litigation process. I was just wondering, on the cases that you said you've started to &#x2013; or are continuing to receive in the U.S., could you just give us an update on how many new cases have been filed since you announced the provision in July?</p>
          <p>Second is a question on the legal process. If you can just remind us, if a case has been filed, does that indicate that the statute of limitations has already been deemed by the court not to have passed or can those cases still be dismissed due to the expiry of statute of limitations? And I was wondering, could you also give us an update on the Colorado litigation? I didn't see anything new in the release on that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as far as the Avandia cases are concerned, obviously a lot's happened in terms of regulatory action in the U.S. over the last, since the last quarterly update. And there's also been a lot of advertising from plaintiff's lawyers looking for cases. What we're told is that there are more cases. We haven't had a chance to see all these cases so we don't know whether they are precluded by the statute of limitations, whether the cases are real, or not real. So I think what we've done today is try to take a prudent approach which is signal that we know people are telling us there are more cases. But we have no intelligent way of actually assessing whether these cases are significant or not in terms of our litigation load.</p>
          <p>I mean I think obviously what we'd be aiming to do, and I hope we'll be able to do, is get through that analysis over the next few months before we get to the year end. So it's I'd say, a little bit frustrating for you. I can assure you it's frustrating for us as well. Kind of having that sense that there might be more but we just don't know. And I really can't guide you whether it's going to be a lot or not much at all. So you just have to bear with us a little bit on that. We're trying to get to it as quickly as we can.</p>
          <p>And then as far as Colorado's concerned, there's really nothing to tell you. No particular events to report and we continue to work with the Boston office to try and bring this to a satisfactory settlement, but nothing to report today, I'm afraid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could ask just one follow-up, just on the Avandia returns provision, is that your best estimate for all future returns or do you expect to be booking further provisions in Q4 and into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's our best, I mean, I think so that's our best estimate of everything including returns, any inventory we have, work in progress we have, capital equipment that needs to be written off, leaving really the only question is on the litigation side. Is there, do these cases exist, are they significant, do they go beyond what we've provided or not. So the only area I think you need to pay any attention to really at all in that regard is the litigation element. The rest of it I'm confident we've essentially captured in all these numbers.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have two questions, if I may. Firstly on consumer health in the U.S. business. You've listed on page 5 in your release what you say the problems were in consumer health. I'm interested in what you're planning to do to try and get this important part of the business back onto the strong growth track you've indicated you expect in the longer term?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I just wondered on the seasonal flu vaccine, how you've seen demand this year compared to previous years? Has the swine flu epidemic enhanced demand or has it somewhat dampened it down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great questions. U.S. business, so somewhat affected by general market environment. We feel generally speaking our competitive performance isn't too bad, but there is macro trend and there's a lot of down trading continuing to go on in the U.S. from a higher priced product. So things like alli have got hurt quite a bit. We've done well actually in smoking cessation. Although it's down, the launch of the mini lozenge in the U.S. has really done well in terms of share and competitiveness, but the overall category is suppressed a little bit. The key to going forward in the U.S. is all about innovation. So we're in creating our investment in innovation activities. We're really challenging the organization to step up our brand innovation dimension for the U.S.</p>
          <p>I think there's a lot of interesting stuff coming on the Sensodyne portfolio. That's going to be a major opportunity for us over the next couple of years with some very key innovations coming. So I think that we've got a lot of opportunity to do better there in the U.S., but quite a bit of what we're feeling is more the kind of environmental economic pressure on the portfolios. Quite a bit of that at the higher price points in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>If I look at flu, just to give you a sense of that, we've &#x2013; give you the exact numbers actually. We &#x2013; in Q3 2010 we shipped about 25 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine; that compares to 17.5 million a year ago Q3. We'd also expect to ship more in Q4 than we shipped in last year's Q4. And ex-U.S. we would &#x2013; we've shipped in Q3 17.5 million versus last year 16.5 million and we'd again expect to ship quite a bit more in Q4 this year than we shipped in Q4 last year.</p>
          <p>Now, two things going on. There probably is a bit of an increased demand, so I think everybody's sensitivity about flu is higher. But the other thing is, we've been able to get our production schedules accelerated so we &#x2013; particularly for the U.S., we were able to get significant volumes earlier in the season. One of the keys in the U.S. is to be there early. It allows you to capture higher price and obviously higher share. And so, actually, that's looking like it's playing out to be quite a nice story for us this year in both U.S. and non U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I have a couple questions. On Tykerb, first of all, would you give a general comment on your pricing policies outside the U.S., Europe, and Japan? And to the extent the data in Herceptin na&#xEF;ve breast cancer is positive, just broadly, how flexible would those pricing policies be?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, there was a bit of a deceleration in your emerging markets business in pharma in the quarter relative to second quarter, and clearly that could just be normal quarter to quarter fluctuation, but do you have any view as to whether fourth quarter in terms of obvious factors might be more like the third quarter or more like the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Gbola. A couple of good questions. Tykerb, I mean we basically, just as we do on most of our products, we employ a tiered pricing approach. Higher GDP per head markets pay higher prices than lower GDP per head markets, and so we do have a more flexible approach than many of our competitors to pricing across &#x2013; and I think there's no exception to that with Tykerb.</p>
          <p>It must be fascinating, actually, if you look at India. Had a tremendous takeoff for Tykerb in India. We have priced it lower. It's still a significant price in the Indian context, but we had a tremendous performance from the Indian business. And so &#x2013; and that will continue. I'm a big believer that we need to have a more flexible approach around the world.</p>
          <p>In terms of the performance of the emerging markets, it did come off a little bit &#x2013; a little bit of price in places like Turkey, so you've got some price impacts coming through the system. Little bit of acquisition washout in terms of contribution, because you remember last year we did a lot of acquisitions. We haven't done so many this year. So there's a bit of an acquisition washout in terms of the sales numbers. I think I still feel very confident around the kind of mid teens type of growth rates for the emerging markets. So I'm not unhappy about where we're at. I think sometimes we might drift slightly below that, some quarters we're going to go above it. I'm pretty comfortable about where we're at.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. First of all, regarding the healthcare reforms, could we have an idea of the magnitude of the impact from the healthcare reforms in Europe and in U.S. going forward because you give a number for Q3 but would be great if we can have an idea for going forward.</p>
          <p>Secondly on the rest of the world performance, could you tell us why it was so soft in Q3 after the good Q2? And last regarding the pipeline, could we have an idea of when we will have an update on almorexant and on Promacta CLD? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as far as the last question's concerned, I would expect something sometime next year, so I don't think you should expect anything much before that in terms of certainly almorexant or Promacta. So we'll update you as soon or get results from some of the studies which are ongoing at this point in time.</p>
          <p>In terms of the impact of pricing, essentially let me just take you through that little bit in a granular way. Hopefully, it will answer your question. If I look at Europe, as we said before, we normally anticipate something like a 1% to 2% &#x2013; around a 2% price cut a year on average in Europe.</p>
          <p>What we're seeing for this year, so our full year estimate for 2010, is that that 2% is probably running closer to 3.5% roughly. I mean it's not a super precise science, but somewhere of that order.</p>
          <p>And at the moment we would expect that next year it's probably is in the 5% to 5.5% range given what we know and what we expect. So that gives you some sense for Europe. For the U.S. in 2010, roughly, roughly the impact has been about US$500 million in 2010 and we expect in 2011 the impact to be around US$250 million. Now in 2010 the majority of &#x2013; or a very big chunk of that is the industry assessment, or the so-called pharma tax, which kicks in for the first time at the beginning of 2011 but was part of the healthcare reform act. So roughly, roughly you see a bit of an uptick in rate of price impact in Europe next year to this year and actually see a bit of a deceleration of rate of impact in America year on year. Hopefully that &#x2013; and your second question for us?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. So we're seeing a lot of the accumulation of cash on the balance sheet if we take out the movement on the settlement. And I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about cash deployment as the years move forward? Should we be thinking about acquisitions and partnerships and deals in emerging markets?</p>
          <p>Should we be thinking about more acquisition activities, share repurchase? Again, I just think the possibility that we'll see accumulating cash on the balance sheet may not be reflected in the earnings in terms of how you deploy it. And just wanted to know how you're thinking about that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll make an overarching set of comments and ask Julian to comment specifically on how he sees the current cash position and make sure. I'd like Julian just to go into a little bit of detail around where the legal provision is and what's gone out, what's going to go out and all that kind of thing. It's really important for everybody to be on the same page on that.</p>
          <p>In terms of a couple of overarching comments, let me just lay out very straightforwardly how we view this. Number one, obviously we run the company. Whatever cash is left goes to &#x2013; number one priority, drive a progressive dividend. You've seen that go up 7% this quarter; you've seen over the last three years since I've been in charge we've been absolutely relentless to drive up our dividend in a progressive way to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Cash left after the dividend, we would prioritize towards going the value creating M&amp;A, bolt-on acquisitions, not big classic acquisitions, but bolt-on acquisitions which support our strategic direction, so typically emerging markets, consumer, vaccines are going to be the most likely places. And certainly things to try and diversity our risk portfolio. Those bolt-ones, of course, particularly when you're as strict as we are about making sure we hit our metrics, you can't guarantee you're going to have a flow of bolt-on deals the same year-in year-out. So that will mean over time and particularly as the company strengthens and gets much more into a sustainable growth phase, of course, then there's going to be periods where we have surplus cash. And then that cash we anticipate going back to shareholders either through share buyback or special dividend. We fully anticipate retaining a degree of debt on the balance sheet. We have no intention to pay down that debt. We think it's good to have a balance in terms of how we run the business, and a balance of stress on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So what we'll see is, over time, years where there will be cash available for share buybacks because we haven't done as much bolt-on activity as maybe we would have done in previous years and/or because the business is spinning off a lot more cash. And obviously a lot of the focus on things like working capital is to spin off more and more cash from the business anyway.</p>
          <p>So that's the strategic approach. I just wonder whether Julian could take you through a little bit of detail of exactly where we are, so we all start on the same page because it's easy to get a little bit lost in what's going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, Andrew. Yes, we have net debt at the end of September of 8.8 billion which is clear from the release. Don't forget we have a legal provision as at the 30th of September of &#xA3;2.5 billion and I just simply add that on to the 8.8 billion to get effectively what I see as the net debt position. Because remember we are making rapid progress in settling litigation but also in paying it out. So far this year we've paid out 1.3 billion; we've paid out &#xA3;876 million in three months the last quarter. So I think it is really sensible to add that 2.5 on. So that gives us a starting position of 11.3 billion of adjusted net debt.</p>
          <p>And then clearly, as Andrew said, dividends is our priority, both on acquisitions which are both strategic in nature relevant to our company, but also have to deliver good returns to our shareholders come next. And we're not about to generate significant reductions in debt over time. So we plan is to basically use the rest, to the extent it's not used in the correct bolt-on acquisitions, to other returns to our shareholders whatever the appropriate methodologies we'll decide at the time.</p>
          <p>So that's how we see it. We clearly have to operate in the constraints of a sort of credit rating. We have come out publicly and said we believe in an A1/P1 short-term credit rating as a minimum, which reads across as a minimum to long-term ratings one notch below where we are today. We're very comfortable where we are with our credit ratings, but we certainly &#x2013; the board has set that as a minimum and that gives &#x2013; the A1/P1 &#x2013; and that gives us flexibility going forward to do bolt-on acquisitions that we need to. But in essence we have 11.3 billion of debt. We have a very clear priority as to what we intend to do with our future cash flows: dividends first, value returning bolt-on acquisitions second, other share returns to shareholders third.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have a question for Julian and it comes back down to the change in the guidance. I think, Julian, in the past you have emphasized that disposal gains are part of the ongoing business and that they're also a tool to protect the margins but now you actually sacrifice the margin, because &#x2013; and sorry if I misquote Andrew at this point -but because it's not the best time for shareholders.</p>
          <p>So I'm actually just wondering what this means for going forward? Does it mean that disposal gains will play a less important factor for your margin going forward? And we probably should all assume somewhat lower levels &#x2013; or that actually the suggested 500 million level of other operating income as a more meaningful number to work off for future years, because these things are essentially unpredictable? Or should I actually read this as that the 2011 margin we're still facing significant headwinds and therefore it's actually better to push those disposal gains into 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alexandra, first of all, I think I've always been pretty clear actually. When people ask me about margin, I always say we run the business to enhance our earnings per share on an organic basis and ensure we deliver returns from acquisitions that rapidly deliver and exceed the shareholder cost of capital. So I've never been beholden to the margin.</p>
          <p>And I think the best way to explain that is if you look at our consumer healthcare business. It's roughly 20% margin; it's well below the group. Having said that, we are very focused on taking cost out of our core business. We are very focused on being more efficient as a business. So for a given level of business we make the highest operating profit margin we can, but it's one of the caveats in that context.</p>
          <p>In terms of 2010, by the way, I've never, ever seen actually other operating income as a means to buffer a margin. I think other operating income to me is two things. It's royalty income, which, quite frankly, I see as very high quality income, and our aim is to maximize that, clearly as time moves on. And secondly, asset sale profits which really I'm very keen on where the value of divestment is greater than the value of retention. And we've done some, I think, great deals in the past where there was no doubt in my mind that was the case. If it was more valuable to others, less valuable to us, we sold the assets.</p>
          <p>We'll obviously give you guidance vis-&#xE0;-vis 2011 next year. What I would do, if I look back over the last five years and I average out what ROI has been, it broadly, if you strip out <mark type="inaudible" /> which clearly shouldn't be taken into account, it averages about 500 million. It's purely coincidental. This year's 500 is simply a result of making the right decision for the shareholder, nothing to do with the margin.</p>
          <p>If we found some better assets to sell and we got good value for them, we'd sell them, but our view is this is what it will be for this year. I'll guide you on next year. You've seen our history. I'll leave it at that, but thanks for the question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, thanks for taking the questions. Just two questions. The first one was just on the recent news on rare diseases. I'm just trying to understand the rationale there. I know it's biopharma like but I'm just interested in your comments on scalability.</p>
          <p>And then the second question, Andrew, is just on Relovair. I know it's probably very early to talk about this, but I just was particularly interested in those slightly bearish comments you made on U.S. pricing at the sell-side breakfast a few weeks ago. I'm just trying to understand if there is a scenario where if the data is good you can price Relovair at a premium to Advair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much for the question. Rare disease, so rare disease is a really interesting area. As we've said, we're targeting about 200, 250 areas. It might sound like a huge number, there are actually something like 7,000 rare diseases. And although each rare disease is very rare, I think actually something like 7% of the population have a rare disease, which is pretty staggering.</p>
          <p>So it's really an interesting area, tremendous amount of opportunity. We think there are some really very creative ways in which we can retask historic molecules into this space. So molecules we have very significant data on, we believe can be retasked into this opportunity for various reasons. And we also see some very good partnership opportunities which we can get into without having to do lots of nuts M&amp;A big premier type of deals.</p>
          <p>We see those drugs being potentially developable in quicker ways with harder endpoints than we see in some other areas. So those are all the reasons we like it. I personally, what I want to do and I'm not sure if I'm picking the right analogy or not, but I want to be the Michael Dell to rare diseases. I want to find a way to bring &#x2013; I think there's an opportunity to bring scale and efficiency to this marketplace, bring down the prices in this. I think there's a great model for the company who does that. And so we are not going in this to try and be a Mini-Me version of companies who are already out there. We're in it to do it differently and we think we've got a way of doing it creatively which is exciting. I think it motivates our people enormously and I'm pretty optimistic about it.</p>
          <p>As far as Relovair is concerned, my view on U.S. pricing is it's going to get very rational very fast, And U.S. prices, the days where pricing is essentially set by the company and then there's some kind of argument over discount between the buyer and the seller but it's just an argument and whoever shouts loudest kind of wins. It's going to be replaced by much more of a cost effectiveness value for money type of debate over the next 5 to 10 years.</p>
          <p>And I think you'll see things change pretty quickly over that time period. And therefore, the pricing of Relovair I think will be a direct consequence of the value we can demonstrate from the drug which is why we're investing so much in the comprehensive program. You'll hear more about some fairly interesting aspects of that in the next few months. And actually the price of Relovair will be driven by the profile of Relovair. It will have very little to do with the existing price of products out there. That's what everybody is going to have to get used to.</p>
          <p>Pricing products vis-&#xE0;-vis a product that was launched 10 years ago or 5 years ago isn't going to be the game. The game is going to be around what value can you prove from your medicine vis-&#xE0;-vis the economics of your payor. It's where Europe's going on the leading edge; it's where the U.S. will go. My expectation is the U.S. will go quicker than Europe because the private sector will be much more rapid at adopting these techniques and technologies. That's why we've been changing everything we do in GSK R&amp;D to deliver much greater evidence and rationale for the value creation of the product. And I think we have time for one last question.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thanks very much. Just like to link into that and ask you about some of the commercial challenges faced by new competitors in either the generic respiratory space or the novel respiratory space, particularly with regard to the importance of device? You've talked about Ventolin, an old product but clearly having the right device has made a difference to you.</p>
          <p>Could you also talk about how much friction there is with regard to physician reception towards new types of therapies? I guess that goes to your competitors as well as for you, if you could talk about those things please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Respiratory medicine and drug development is a heck of a lot more difficult than a lot of people will tell you. And one of my favorite kind of statistics, if you think back to the whole therapeutic area for inhaled asthma and COPD drugs, you've essentially got two short-acting bronchodilators that made it and were commercially successful, one of which was from GSK. You've essentially got two long-acting bronchodilators which made it commercially, one of which was from GSK. You've got four inhaled steroids that made it commercially successful, two of which came from GSK. And then you've got the anticholinergics which essentially both came from the same company.</p>
          <p>This is an area where despite all the efforts of all the companies over 40 years, you've essentially got three companies who know how to do this and have demonstrated on a repeated basis they can. That's molecular design and selection. That's a critical area and a lot of people think they've cracked it and they haven't, or they haven't necessarily done it. And we've seen them run into issues. That's the first part.</p>
          <p>The second part is particle size and device development. And the two things are different but completely related. And every time you see a device go down in development what almost always has happened is they haven't been able to figure out the particle size or it's an unpredictable particle size produced by the device, both of which are killers of the program. And you see that time after time after time with generic and novel products. Now then you have to focus on how good is the device for the patient and the physician, to your question of friction or stickiness of your device.</p>
          <p>And it's incredible to me that I'm still seeing companies develop devices which are single capsule devices.</p>
          <p>That's a bit like saying to somebody who takes a 200 dose Ventolin inhaler, why don't we go back to a single dose inhaled rotacap that you have to change every time you want to inhale. People aren't going to go back to that. It's like asking somebody who's driving around in a Ferrari, would you like to down trade to a Mini? No, thanks. So the whole device issue is tremendously important.</p>
          <p>If you look at GSK &#x2013; A, we have been in all the generations. B, we have learned a tremendous amount around things like particle size, where the issues pop up. It's why we've taken &#x2013; and make no apology for the fact that we have done the biggest ever Phase II set of programs on our molecules that are going into our inhaled program because we tried to dismiss all the risks before we got into the big pivotal trials. That is exactly the product of all the experience we've had.</p>
          <p>If you look at our devices which have been developed, we have Diskus out there today, we're just bringing on-stream our high-speed Diskus production lines which have massively improved our productivity on Diskus. And we're commissioning our Gemini production lines which will be the device for the next generation combination product. And if you look at what we're doing there is, we're upgrading our technology, we're developing our technology and then we're bridging it on into the next generation of devices. So we're keeping consistency on the things that we know have to be kept consistent. That's where we have a tremendous competitive damage. It doesn't mean nobody is ever going to be in this space, but I've said from the minute I took over this is a more difficult space than people predicted it to be and it's exactly what's happening.</p>
          <p>There are no guarantees for anybody including ourselves, but quietly and surely we are delivering on what we said we would do, which is bring a significant portfolio of new molecules and new devices in a portfolio of different deliveries for patients. And I think and my goal is for us to continue to grow market share over the next ten years in respiratory, not lose it.</p>
