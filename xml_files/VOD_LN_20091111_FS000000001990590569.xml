          <p>Welcome to the Vodafone Group Plc Half Year Results Conference Call, which took place on 10 November, 2009. You're invited to join this call on the basis that you are an investment professional within The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Order 2005. No other person should act or rely on the information presented. You may not disseminate any recording of this call in whole or in part to any member of the public or to any person to whom the communication may not lawfully be made.</p>
          <p>The presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties because they relate to future events. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements in relation to the Group's projected financial results of the 2010, 2011, and 2012 financial years. Some of the factors which may cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements can be found by referring to the information contained under the heading Other Information, Forward-Looking Statements in the half-year financial report for the six months ending 30 September, 2009, and principal risk factors and uncertainties in our Annual Report for the year ended 31 March, 2009.</p>
          <p>The half-year financial report and annual report can be found on our website at www.vodafone.com. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial information. The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional information in understanding the performance of the Group or the Group's businesses because they provide measures used by the Group to assess performance. Although these measures are important in the management of the business, they should not be viewed as replacements, but rather as complementary to comparable GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>You will now be granted access to the Vodafone Group Plc half-year results presentation.</p>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining today's Vodafone half-year results conference call. As a reminder, all lines will be on listen-only mode. And we will conduct a question-and-answer session during the call.</p>
          <p>At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Andy Halford, CFO of Vodafone Group. Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining the call. We put out our half-year results a few hours ago, so maybe I'll run just through some of the headlines of that and then we'll happily take any questions that you may have.</p>
          <p>So the headlines from a Group point of view, revenues were &#xA3;21.8 billion, which was an increase of 9.3%, albeit that includes a reasonable amount of foreign exchange benefit. The underlying service revenue growth was negative 2.6%, and I will come on to detail behind that in a moment. Data revenues growing strongly, up 20% to 1.9 billion, and in fact now running as an annualized &#xA3;4 billion a year. The total proportion of our customer base grew to 323 million; that was 20 million up on the first half. The group EBITDA grew by 2.9% to &#xA3;7.5 billion; and the free cash flow was &#xA3;4.0 billion, which was an increase of 29%.</p>
          <p>The key themes underpinning that, just briefly going through the regions: Europe, we had the headline revenues up 3%, albeit on an organic basis they were down 4.5%, which was basically the second quarter actually having stabilized compared with the first quarter, so it's despite the fact that we had more MTR cuts <mark type="inaudible" /> cuts. We were stable quarter-on-quarter, which is encouraging. Data voice strong in Europe, up 18%, and good cost control, costs coming down 3.3% in the period resulted in the margin being one percentage point down period-on-period. And the capital intensity, including the common functions, was 8.8%.</p>
          <p>In the Africa and Central Europe region, the Vodacom business continued to perform well, particularly in South Africa, where we saw growth in revenue. Again, it's around the 7% level as in the previous quarter, slightly more pressures in a couple of the other South African markets.</p>
          <p>The turnaround in Turkey is going well and the revenue decline there, which had been about 12% the previous quarter, basically halved to 6%, so encouraging signs on the turnaround in Turkey. And in the Central European region, particularly in Romania, quite a harsh macroeconomic environment causing some pressure on the revenues, albeit with some strong actions on the cost, the margins actually have held up pretty well there.</p>
          <p>The Asia-Pacific and Middle East region, clearly dominated by India, we saw the revenues there up by 20% for the half year, a slightly lower growth rate in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, about 18% up, added 14 million customers in the first half, and now have a customer base of about 83 million, albeit the market a little bit more competitive on the pricing front at this point in time. In Egypt, we saw a very stable revenue performance, with the impact of competitors and economic pressures.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> wireless, which [audio disturbance] you'll all be familiar with, having published numbers about 10 days ago, basically good set of numbers, growth in revenue slightly lower than previously, but nonetheless good growth in the business. The integration of Opal going on track. And the profit contribution to Vodafone is now around 34% of our Group adjusted operating profit. The EBITDA less CapEx is about US$8.8 billion and the net debt level is just below US$29 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving then briefly on to strategy that we talked about a year ago, so key highlights of that. The cost program of &#x20A4;1 billion, we have accelerated that by a year and now intend to deliver those savings by the end of this financial year. And we have announced that we are now setting out to find another &#x20A4;1 billion of savings to be delivered by 2011-12.</p>
          <p>Fixed broadband, which we have been pushing on has come on well, with revenues up 89% over five million customers, and data revenues also coming on well, up 20%, as I mentioned earlier. The turnaround in Turkey was another area of focus, which as I said is going well. And a focus on the cash generation has obviously paid off, with a very strong <mark type="inaudible" /> free cash flow in the half year. Subsequent to all of that is that we have reconfirmed our guidance for the full year, so the adjusted operating profit remained in the 11.0 to &#x20A4;11.8 billion range. And we have said on the free cash flow that we would expect it to be around the top end of that range, given the strong performance on the cash flow in the first half. We have not changed the FX assumptions that underpin that, given the volatility of FX rates. And just as a reminder, those rates will still include &#x20AC;1.12 and $1.50 for the full financial year. Overall, we're expecting the margins to decline in the second half at a similar amount to the first half, which was about two, 2.1 percentage points.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand back over to the operator. And we'll happily take questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Stanley Martinez, Mr. Martinez, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you for taking my question. On the billion pounds in incremental cost savings identified this morning, Andy, for fiscal '11-'12. Just wondering how you see the proportions changing, if at all, from the 50/30/20 proportion going forward between technology, marketing, and overhead?</p>
          <p>And wondering more broadly, in which countries does Vodafone believe it is at or near a lowest cash cost per user position? And if you could just discuss some of the additional strategic flexibility achieving this low-cost position might provide as you look to reinvest these savings commercially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, Stanley. So the one billion, I think roughly the sort of splits that you gave there are what we are expecting going forwards. Bear in mind that around 40% of our total spend is on the network and the technology side of the business. So clearly that is where we are putting the most significant focus. And the sort of initiatives there are pushing out the sharing of sites even further than we've done so far, looking at spare of activities, looking at handset logistics and things like that. But roughly the same sort of split as we had done on the first billion; it is not skewed in any particularly different direction.</p>
          <p>Your second question was on lowest cash cost per customer &#x2013; sorry, could you just maybe repeat your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed. Just wondering, on a, based on where Vodafone is now with its cost structure, are there certain countries in which Vodafone believes that it's in a lowest cash cost per user position relative to other operators like Telef&#xF3;nica and DT or Orange? And if you are not, just wondering if you could talk about the additional strategic flexibility achieving that low-cost position with these anticipated billion pounds of incremental cost savings can provide the Group, particularly as you look to reinvest some of those savings commercially, presumably to reintegrate your share of growth decisions in each of those individual marketplaces?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. So we do a fair amount of benchmarking of our cost base against our competitors, as you would expect. It is not the most precise science, because particularly where competitors are running integrated fixed-to-mobile operators, it's not always safe and easy to do direct comparisons, but generally, the majority of our businesses are sitting in the more efficient end of the spectrum.</p>
          <p>That said, there are always opportunities to get more cost out, and I wouldn't say we are sitting here with absolutely having achieved all the cost savings that we can do anywhere. But nonetheless, we are in a good position on the cost front. The focus now is on how do we get from good to essentially being best of class?</p>
          <p>To your related question, then, of what do we do with the savings. Some of the savings are going to be there because we will have to offset some macro volume increases in our business. We are actually adding more sell-side feature and there is a little bit of inflation going on in the business. And we sort of said that of this next billion, 50% or so will be used to cover those sorts of things, but the rest we've got available for either investing in commercial growth in the market or putting it to the bottom line. Basically, we'll make those decisions as we go along and through the two-year period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that commercial investment, Andy, include investment in new licenses, and if so, wondering what that potentially does to your net debt evolution in half two? There's some additional license payments beyond the anticipated effect of Vodafone Qatar that increase net debt slightly more than I expected, despite the &#xA3;4 billion in free cash flow generated. So do you expect that the balance of these savings are going to offset some of the additional commercial &#x2013; additional spectrum licenses that you may be acquiring in the second half of the year, and what does that do to your net debt balance? Do you see it staying relatively flat at about 33 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The focus of the cost initiatives is to get the cost out of the operating base so that we have got flexibility in terms of where we invest. Spectrum costs, so looking at those a little bit separately, the only near-term spectrum costs are likely to be in India, where there is an auction that comes up in January, and then probably the next one after that is likely to be in Germany.</p>
          <p>It is very, very difficult to put numbers on the cost of the auctions, because frankly, until we know how many competitors there are, until we've decided which of the licenses we want to go for, until we fully understand the rules of the game, all of those just have such a significant impact in form of valuations that we do not forward guide on those, nor would we want to indicate to those competing in the auctions as to where our lines were on the values. But suffice it to say we go through those very, very rigorously and we make sure that where we can do we are getting the absolute sort of best prices we can in the auctions, and where we decide actually we don't need the spectrum, then we'll find other ways to actually build the capacity into our networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from William Pickett. William, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Hi, Andy. I just wanted to ask a few questions. One, if you could elaborate on the top three reasons why group EBITDA was down 2 percentage points in the first half and why <mark type="inaudible" /> down another 2.1% in the second half? And I heard a lot of reasons, but if you could just sort of rank, order what you think are the top three, that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is: there was some analysis I saw by one of a sell-side reports that your European revenue market share appears to have declined given the, I guess it was nearly 5% of decline in revenues versus the kind of minus 1% decline in the market overall. If you could just address why you think you're losing revenue market share in Europe and what you're going to do to address it, that would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. So the margin was down by 2.1 percentage points and clearly the biggest issue we've had in that has been the revenue line and the sort of 4.5% or so reduction, particularly in Europe, that we've had off the revenues. A large part of our business cost base is bad FX, and therefore taking the costs out as quickly as the revenues come off has proved more challenging. So order of magnitude in Europe, I'd say that the revenue's coming off by 4.5% and the costs coming off by, or come down by 3.5% is factor number one.</p>
          <p>Factor number two is that we have invested quite a lot into Turkey this year to get the turnaround of the business, and that has taken the margin down in Turkey significantly and overall on the Group <mark type="inaudible" />; that's the second reason.</p>
          <p>And then the third one is in India, and this is not really new news because we talked about this at the end of May. The margins in India have come down sort of across the sector, and also in our businesses we had invested in more new circles, which in their early days start off with low negative EBITDAs before they work through to positive. So the three factors there has been the sort of revenue side issues in Europe and then Turkey and from India.</p>
          <p>In terms of the European revenue market share, I'm not sure exactly which stats you have got in front of you, but I would say that we have been holding our own in Spain recently, albeit Telef&#xF3;nica have got their results tomorrow, so I won't try and second guess that. Performing ahead in Italy and against the best players have fallen behind in Germany and in the U.K. I think it is not a surprise that we have in both of these markets not, sort of got the iPhone, and clearly in the U.K, we've announced that we will be getting that shortly and that we have increased significantly the retail distribution reach in the U.K, which is coming onscreen sort of pretty much as we talk now. So I think those will make a tangible difference in the U.K market as we go forwards. In Germany, we have not presently got the iPhone, but we'll be pushing very hard on the smartphones and on other high-end devices and aiming to close some of that market revenue share gap.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the EBITDA because the explanations you gave are great for explaining second half, but would the same things apply towards your guidance for second half? Or would you say there's other factors that would explain that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay, maybe my comments probably more explained the first half than the second half, but I mean in the second half factors, there will be some benefit coming through from the cost reduction program contributing more. But against that, the second half, typically because of the seasonality has higher customer acquisition and retention, so therefore there will be more investment on the commercial front. The Turkish investment sort of will be fairly equivalent I think between both halves of the year, and then on India, it's a little bit more price competitive at this point in time, which may put a little bit of pressure on the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question is from Gary Slate. You may proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andy, it's Gary Slate from Capital World Investors. I had some questions on the interest line, if you could please clarify the 500 and something odd million pounds, and if you could please split that out between regular interest on existing debt. Within that I think there is also some interest on the positive sides from revenues from the SoftBank convertible or preferred and there are also some costs for the Hutchinson put and if you could please break that out among those three.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the, Gary, the 559 number is basically a pure debt number. So it is not confused by put options and by other things like that; it is purely the interest cost on the external debt. The SoftBank accretion is sitting in the income-from-investments line, and then the put options and the revaluation of the put options actually appears below the table I used in the presentation today. So the 559 of pure financing cost, which was 436 a year ago, is up about 28%, and that is essentially the debt levels being up around 30% in part from the FX effects offset by the average cost of debt having gone down from 4.6 to 4.0%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. So when we calculate the cost of debt in the first half, we shouldn't think about 34 billion as the base. We should think about 34 minus the put, so that's 31.5, and against that the 556  interest cost. Is that correct for what was actually paid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And going forward, when you look two years out, how much of the debt is short-term, either commercial paper or other revolving out of the &#x2013; out of the 31.5 when that's <mark type="inaudible" /> and what do you expect the average cost of debt to be two years from now, given everything we know today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's about two billion sterling of commercial paper that is sitting in the debt number. The rest of the debt is on &#x2013; well there is some cash balance, but the core debt, the average life by memory of debt maturities is between six and seven years. So we've got a pretty even profile, no more than about three billion repayable in any one year. On our debt management, we're typically fixing forwards on a rolling basis about 18 months forward. So we would expect the interest costs for the next 18 months or so, they might be a little bit higher than where they are now, but not a huge amount higher than that. And we will take views on longer-term fixing as we move through progressive quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then second question on JV accounting. I think now that the ISB has published the &#x2013; their views on JV kind of I think for 2012, what impact will that have on the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are still going through and analyzing what they are doing. I think they're still awaiting comments on some of that. The key question, I think, will be on the Italian business and the extent to which the rights of the minority partner there will enable us to account for it in the same way <mark type="inaudible" /> has to move to the way that we account for <mark type="inaudible" /> Verizon Wireless.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would the Indian Towers business also potentially have to be de-consolidated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It may have to be, but again we are going through the detail of those at the moment and given that there's still some comments being received, we think from a number of parties, I still think there is some way to go on this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And just a last question on tax. In this global environment where governments are desperate for revenues, you have been able to every year successfully lower your tax rate. How much pressure are you getting, and how much risk is there that the tax rate might go up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the tax rate &#x2013; the first one is the tax rate we've actually got in the first half is about 21.5%, which is lower than we are expecting on average for the year because of some settlements. So we still think it will be mid-20s for the year, but to the heart of your question there are one or two countries who not necessarily making changes to the corporate tax rate but occasionally bringing in sort of the sales-type taxes and things like that, which is hitting higher up in the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>So I think the general answer is there are some countries that are doing one or two things in this space. At the moment there isn't anybody who is doing anything other than a more structural basis. And hence we remain of the view that mid 20s is roughly where we should be on our tax rate going forwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you Andy .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Mark McKetney. Mark, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I appreciate your taking the question. Three question actually, and the first is on the CapEx. I want to make sure I understand your guidance right now, you are talking about flat for the year, and so by my calculations you need 2.6 in the first half to get to 5.9. I guess that looks like you'd be up maybe 20% in the back half of the year to 3.2, 3.3. Is that, are my assumptions right there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what we said was that we expect the CapEx of the full year to be similar to last year adjusting for FX; last year it was around a six level and therefore if the rest of your logic flows entirely, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then second is, I also noticed in your slides you said the network utilization is up at 30% up from 20% about a year ago.  How should we interpret that? Is that &#x2013; and where do you suspect, at what point are they getting hot? It seems like you've got plenty of room left on HSPA; when you talk about capacity, do you mean your capacity in available slots or actually deployed equipment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So first of all, the 20%, 30% comparison actually is a two-year comparison not a one year. So we're not going up as fast as that. Secondly, it is all installed capacity and it is literally taking averages, which aren't enormously meaningful because clearly it is the peaks on capacity, which clearly are the bigger issue for us. But if you do it on the averaging basis, it's about 30%, but we have got a number of opportunities there to be able to put more capacity in.</p>
          <p>The actual proportion of the sites where we have got near to capacity, sort of 90% or so capacity at their peak is around 5%. And that's possibly actually slightly lower than it was a year ago. So I think there are lots of options available to us to actually deal with future capacity increases, including using more carriers and cell stocking and things like that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, that's helpful. Thanks. And then finally, more of an open-ended kind of a question on the smartphone side, you had mentioned the iPhone, you're getting it in the U.K. soon, Germany no plans for it. But how do you balance your smartphone portfolio between the iPhone, the BlackBerry, the new Android phones, Palms, others? Can you just say a few words about that and kind of which you're kind of seeing will be your drivers here in the next foreseeable future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The trend that we are seeing at the moment on devices generally continues to be a move away from the middle tier and more going at the low end, but more going at the high end. Smartphones, roughly 20% of the phones that we sell at this point in time, but expect that percentage to be increasing fairly progressively over time. We have got about a dozen markets where we are selling the iPhone, and alongside that we are selling clearly a number of other devices. The Storm2 is now out over here as well, a 360 device which we just launched. So they will be coexisting side by side. Some of them are aimed at slightly different audiences. Some of them are aimed at similar audiences. But overall, our philosophy is that the more that we can offer variety of good smartphones, then the more choice there is available to customers. And the better that will be for them and the better it will be for us.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Scott Chipman. Scott, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi Andy. I have three questions. Number one, back to the balance sheet, are you able to provide us with a net debt EBITDA target in terms of if you have an expectation to de-lever over the next several quarters? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, can you just provide us with any update on any discussions you may have had with Verizon about a potential disposal of Verizon Wireless? And if there haven't been discussions, could you just address whether or not under what circumstances you would entertain monetizing that stake if Verizon does indeed have interest?</p>
          <p>And last question, just around the Essar put. What are your expectations around the put, the period of time is a few months away, and what are your expectations at Essar, how they'll be regarding that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the balance sheet, first, we have looked to a low single A credit rating as being our target rather than a specific debt-to-equity multiple &#x2013; debt-to-EBITDA multiple, I should say. At the moment, we, if you do do that calculation, are a multiple about two or thereabouts, just over two. But the way the rating agencies look at it, they don't just purely look at that one ratio, they look at other factors as well. And the simple answer to your question is I think the level of debt we've got at the movement is about right for the business, about right for where we are in the economic cycle. And therefore I would not expect a big change on the overall debt level.</p>
          <p>Secondly, your question on Verizon, Verizon Wireless. We are very happy with the performance of the business. Obviously, we're regularly reviewing whether we're doing the right thing holding on to the business. At this point in time, we remain at the view that continuing to own part of the business is the right thing to do. As you know at some point in time, hopefully we will see dividends coming through from there. But it is being reviewed regularly, and at this point we are comfortable that holding is the best of the options.</p>
          <p>And your third question was on the Essar put; that is exercisable by the <mark type="inaudible" /> between May of next year and May of the year after. And frankly, we have no indications in either direction as to what will happen there. And clearly that is a question for them at this point in time rather than for us.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question is from William Pickett. William, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Andy, just a follow-up question. On the Verizon Wireless being, representing 34% of the Group operating profit. I believe I saw a stat that that was up from 22% half-over-half. Can you just explain, I mean, the assumption would be that it was the relative amount of profit from the other parts of the Group that caused the percent to go up so much. But if you could just explain, what were the factors in terms of that significant increase. And obviously, if that's the case then you would think as the other groups improve, given the economic cycle, that it would come back down as percent of total, but if not, that's a little bit alarming that, you know, so much to the Group operating profit is essentially shared with Verizon Wireless. Can you address that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. William, the 34% number, we have been moving progressively toward that number over a period of time. It hasn't been a huge jump in the one quarter. The contribution from Verizon Wireless in a percentage since was a little bit enhanced year-on-year because we &#x2013; first of all the contribution of the underlying Verizon Wireless business. Secondly, they've now got <mark type="inaudible" /> the comparable quarter a year ago did not have. And thirdly, there is some FX movement, which actually leaves the percentages further in our favor. But the key was I think we've been moving progressively up from high 20s through low 30s to 34 over a period of time.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you very much indeed for all joining the call. I think the key for me is seeing some stabilization in the revenues in Europe. Data still performing very strongly and free cash flow now being comfortable that we will be at the top end of our guidance range at the end of the year. Thank you all very much for joining the call.</p>
