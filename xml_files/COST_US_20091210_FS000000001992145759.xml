        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Brandy and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Operating Results for Fiscal 2010 Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brandy, and good morning. This morning's press release reviews our first quarter 2010 operating results for the 12 weeks ended November 22, about two and half weeks ago.</p>
          <p>As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, as you know, we reported earnings per share at $0.60, same as last year's reported first quarter earnings of $0.60. Last year's first quarter results included a few items of note. The first, a 28.4 million pre-tax charge to SG&amp;A, related to the stock market's fall last November and a mark-to-market hit, if you will, to the cash value of life insurance policies covering about 800 Costco management and employees.</p>
          <p>A second smaller item, a 5.8 million pre-tax charge to interest income, related to security impairment of our short-term cash investments. Together, these two charges total 34.2 million pre-tax or a $0.05 per share hit to last year's first quarter earnings.</p>
          <p>In last year's earnings release, it was pointed out that, one, we had very, very strong gasoline profits. And two, the strengthening U.S. dollar last fall, relative to foreign currencies, which at the time we termed FX headwinds, resulted in our foreign earnings, when converted and reported into U.S. dollars, effectively hit us last year in the first quarter by $0.03 a share.</p>
          <p>In this year's first quarter results, gasoline profits were actually pretty good, but still about $0.04 a share lower than in the first quarter of fiscal '09, when the results were really unprecedented, as gas prices were dropping precipitously. And with respect to last year's first quarter FX headwinds, we are now of course seeing strengthening of many of the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, such that this year in Q1, we actually benefited by about a penny a share from what you could now call FX tailwinds.</p>
          <p>The last item I'll point out is ongoing higher employee benefits cost, mainly consisting of higher U.S. healthcare costs. I mentioned to all of you actually last December 11 on our &#x2013; on fiscal '09's first quarter conference call that such costs hit first quarter results by an estimated $0.01 to $0.015 a share above what they have been running, mostly in the last month to month and a half of Q1, which is coincidentally when the stock market was plummeting. And we had a sense from some of our third party providers that part of the reason of increased utilization had to do with that. I don't know that.</p>
          <p>We also saw more higher than expected healthcare costs in Qs 3 and 4 of this past fiscal year, and that trend continued in Q1 with such expenses still coming in a bit higher &#x2013; probably an incremental one to $0.02 higher than expected.</p>
          <p>On balance, this year's $0.60 figure is just under last year's. If you look at last year's 60, add back in the $0.05 for the unusual charges, you get to 65. If you look at this year's 60, of course, we had no charge. Gas was $0.04 less, so that's 4 of the $0.05 of where it is at least. Then, of course, we had a $0.01, as I just mentioned, benefit from FX this year, compared to last year's base case. That $0.01 would essentially imply about $0.02 less year-over-year, which is about what we estimate on the healthcare side. So those are the reasons, not excuses, but just the fact that's where we saw it.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the first quarter, our 12-week reported comparable sales figure for Q1 showed a 3% increase, a plus 1% in the U.S., and a plus 13% internationally. Excluding gas price changes and the impact of FX, the 1% reported U.S. comp would actually be plus 2% for the first fiscal first quarter, and 13% international comp would be a plus eight. And all told, the combination of those two, the 3% total company reported comp, would remain at plus 3%.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest I'll review this morning &#x2013; our opening activities. We opened a total of six new locations during first quarter of fiscal 2010, which ended, again, two and a half weeks ago on November 22. All six openings were in the U.S., including one in Phoenix, in the Paradise Valley Mall, one in Redwood City. We actually had closed that unit a little under a year ago, and on the same premise, with a little bit of extra land, built a newer and bigger location. One each in Colorado, Missouri and Ohio. And, of course, on November 12, we saw many of you in Manhattan when we opened in &#x2013; at 116th Street and East River Drive in New York City.</p>
          <p>For fiscal 2010, overall, a plan of 16 to 18 new locations, 13 or 14 which would be in U.S., including the six I just mentioned as well as certainly one and maybe two re-locations. It looks like it's one at this point.</p>
          <p>Since Q1 end on November 22, we've opened two new locations, one new warehouse in Hayward, California, and one re-location in Warrenton, Oregon, on the coast. We currently operate 566 locations around the world, including the 32 in Mexico with our joint venture partner.</p>
          <p>Also this morning, I'll review with you our online results, membership trends, further discussion of margins and SG&amp;A in the first quarter, and give you our balance sheet information.</p>
          <p>Again, with sales, total sales were up 5.5% in the quarter to 16.9 billion, up from 16.0 billion. Our comp's plus 3%, and again, taking in all the noise from gasoline price changes and FX issues. The U.S. comp was a 2% plus without gas and the international in local currency was a plus 8%.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, our reported 3% comp was a combination of an average transaction decrease of about 1.5%, with FX and gas being about a wash to each other that year. But we are still seeing deflation, which I will talk about in a minute. And average frequency increased, continuing strong and a 5% increase in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales by geographic region, no big surprises in the U.S., looking over the last couple of quarters, Q4 and Q1. Probably the biggest &#x2013; in actual percentage points improvement had to be in California, although it was also the weakest in Q4, and slightly positive in Q1.</p>
          <p>International, again, has remained &#x2013; in terms of local currency, is our strongest. 7% in local currency in Canada, our biggest international operation, and a little over 8% in local currencies among the other international operations.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales results by merchandise category, in the past few months, essentially we've reported September and October and November, those 13 weeks for retail reporting calendar. Within food and sundries, comps are in the low single digits, with tobacco, candy, and alcohol being relative standouts. Keep in mind that throughout food and sundries, along with fresh foods, is where we've been continuing to experience fairly hefty consumer price &#x2013; consumer products price deflation, also impacted, of course, by our increasing penetration of private label.</p>
          <p>Our hard line sales showed positive mid single digit comps in majors, HABA [health and beauty aids], sporting goods, and hardware. Within the soft line's comps, which overall was in the low double digit range, apparel, housewares, and jewelry were up in the low to mid single digits, with many of the other departments, like small appliances, domestic, media, furnishings, up 10 to 20% each, recognizing some of those really strong improvements are comparing against relatively weak numbers a year ago.</p>
          <p>Fresh foods up low single digits. A standout continues to be unit sales increases, both in meat and produce, which we continue to enjoy strong unit increases. The challenge again is deflation in fresh foods. We have seen a little let up in deflation in the last month in the meat side of the business. Produce continues to be somewhat in the 10% plus deflationary area.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, which we are now two and a half weeks into, we are enjoying positive impact of sales from year over year gasoline prices, as well barring any future dramatic shifts in foreign currencies, which of course we certainly cannot predict, versus the U.S. dollar, the negative impact of sales earnings that we experienced since last fall are now reversed and are currently positives to sales and earnings. Again, we don't know what will happen in the future with gasoline prices or with FX ratios relative to the dollar.</p>
          <p>Moving down the income statement line items, membership fees were 377.4 million, up 2.23%, one basis point lower than a year ago in the quarter, up 5% in dollars or almost $19 million. Again we, since we talked about it last year, when it was hitting us the other way, the positive FX, that 18.7 million, would have been about &#x2013; just under $14 million up, without the benefit of FX, still a good showing, we feel.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership overall, we continue to benefit from strong renewal rates overall and continuing &#x2013; continued increasing penetration of the $100 a year executive membership. Our new membership sign ups for the first quarter company-wide were almost exactly flat year-over-year, actually an improvement from recent prior fiscal quarters, when new sign ups were down 5% year over year in the third quarter of last year and down 3% in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Overall, fewer openings do impact new sign-ups. I believe where we offset a little of that weakness is in the strong new sign-ups in places like Australia and Asia, where in the last couple of months of fiscal -- in late summer, we opened one each in each of those four countries, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea.</p>
          <p>In terms of number of members at Q1 end, it was 21.9 million Gold Star members, up from 21.4 million at year end. 5.75 million primary business, up from 5.7. Business add-ons remained at 3.4 million. So all told, 31.1 million households at Q1 end, up from 30.6 million at fiscal year end on August 30. With spouse and partner cards, 56.4 million at the end of the first quarter, up from 56.0 million at fiscal year end.</p>
          <p>As of November 22, paid Executive Members were just shy of 9.3 million, an increase of 341,000 in just the past 12 weeks. That represents about 28,000 a week increase. We did introduce the Executive Member program in the U.K. in Q4, so now that we operate that in the U.S. and Canada and the U.K. The U.K. accounted for about 25,000 of those 341,000, so even without the U.K., the weekly number of increased Executive Members was a little over 26,000 per week in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of renewal rates, they've continued strong. Essentially the same rate of renewal as it was at fiscal year end, 92% in Business, 86% in Gold Star, and 87.3 for the company. And that would be U.S. and Canada.</p>
          <p>Now going on to the gross margin line. Our gross margin in the first quarter was lower by nine basis points at 10.88 versus a 10.97 last year. As we always do, we'll jot down a few numbers. The line items of these numbers are merchandise core. Second line item, ancillary businesses. Third line item, 2% reward. Fourth line item, LIFO. And then total.</p>
          <p>Looking at three columns. All of fiscal '09, Q4 '09, and Q1 of fiscal 2010. Going across core merchandising and for all of '09, we were up year-over-year 18 basis points. In Q4 '09, up 48 and in Q1, up 15. Ancillary businesses in fiscal '09 was up seven, in Q4 down three, and in Q1 down 20. 2% reward, minus six, minus nine, and minus three. Of course, a minus there reflects the increasing penetration of the 2% reward program.</p>
          <p>LIFO in all of last year was plus nine basis points. In Q4, plus 22, when we took the big credit at the end of the year. And in Q1, minus one, a reflection of that there was no LIFO charge or credit in Q1 this year versus a small credit last year. And all told, all of '09, 28 basis points up. Q4, 56 up. And Q1 fiscal 2010, nine basis points down.</p>
          <p>As you can see, while our overall reported gross margin was lower year-over-year by nine basis points, our core was up 15. Our lower margin gas business represented 9% of sales a year ago in Q1 and 8% this year in Q1, reflecting a little bit of gasoline deflation there. That -- the sales penetration of our higher margin core merchandise business was up year-over-year, that 15.</p>
          <p>Now the actual four major departments here -- food and sundries, fresh foods, hardlines, and softlines, which comprises a little over 80% of our business, those -- looking at just those sales and those margins, were up 11 basis points. Again, the 15 relates -- reflects the fact that those represent a little bit higher mix this year than last year. But nonetheless, up well.</p>
          <p>Of the four major departments, food and sundries, hardlines, and fresh foods were up year-over-year in Q1, with softlines coming in a little lower year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In terms of factors impacting gross margin going forward, gasoline -- of course, gasoline margins last year in Q2 were substantially lower than first quarter, which was again an unprecedented positive last year in Q1. We'll see where it comes out this year. We won't have that kind of comparison, though.</p>
          <p>In addition, as you know, in last year's second quarter earnings report, we took a significant number of markdowns during the &#x2013; really during the four weeks of December, trying to drive sales as commodity prices were quite deflationary, but many of the procurement costs to us hadn't been reflected yet. But we chose to take a little over $30 million of markdowns that weren't protected. This is not currently happening this year.</p>
          <p>Moving to SG&amp;A, our SG&amp;A percentage Q1-over-Q1 was higher by 4 basis points, coming in at a 10.50 this year compared to 10.46 last year. Again, I'll ask you to jot down the following line items for a little three columns chart here. Operations, central, the third would be stock compensation, RSUs, quarterly adjustments, and total. Again, the three columns would be all of '09, Q4 '09, and Q1 of fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>For all -- going across -- operations for all of '09 was a minus 47 basis points, being higher year-over-year by 47. Operations, minus 61. And for -- for Q4 rather. And Q1, minus 16. Central, minus 7, minus 8, and minus 3. Stock compensation, minus 1, minus 1, and minus 3. Quarterly adjustments, minus 3, plus 7 in Q4, and plus 18 in Q1. That of course relates to the $28 million mark-to-market charge that we talked about earlier, last year that hit us versus nothing this year.</p>
          <p>All told, about 58 basis points higher in '09 overall, 63 basis points higher in Q4, and 4 basis points higher in Q1.</p>
          <p>A little editorial on these numbers. While SG&amp;A operations was higher by 16 basis points year-over-year in Q1, a big component of that, about 10 basis points of the 16, was gas mix change in the quarter. Our central expense was higher year-over-year in Q1 by 3 basis points, which is actually an improving trend from the fourth quarter when it was minus 7. Central payroll, by the way, in the first quarter year-over-year, was actually lower by 1 basis point. That of course offset with what I mentioned earlier, the higher healthcare costs.</p>
          <p>Our stock compensation expense again was slightly higher. Benefits. We talked about this. Q1 year-over-year, the percentage of benefits dollars had increased by 17%. A little bit lower rate of increase than the past two quarters. About a third to a half of this increase is due, as I mentioned, last quarter to the greatly reduced employee turnover, and therefore a smaller percentage of employee base who were yet to be benefits eligible.</p>
          <p>A little over a year ago, the percentage of U.S. employees who were benefits eligible was in the low to mid 80s. Today, it's in the high 80s to low 90s. We don't see a lot of relief right now, although again, the rate of increase of dollars in Q1 was a little bit lower than in Qs3 and 4.</p>
          <p>I mentioned the quarterly adjustments. The positive 18 was simply a fact that there was no unusual charge this year, whereas in Q1 last year, we had that $28.4 million pre-tax charge for life insurance.</p>
          <p>Overall, not a bad SG&amp;A performance, given sales levels, a little gasoline deflation, and increased benefits costs. In terms of preopening expense, last year was $12.8 million. This year, 10.8 million, so 2 million better or 2 basis points lower. No big surprises. Last year, we had 8 openings in the quarter. This year, we had six, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>In terms of provision for impaired assets and closing costs, last year, we had a charge of $6.8 million in the quarter. This year, we had a charge of 2 million. So an improvement of 4.8 million year-over-year positive swing. All told, operating income in Q1 was up 1.6%, from 420.9 million up $7 million to 427.7 million this year.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was about the same in both first quarters, with Q1 this year coming in at 24.1 million, actually a shade lower than the 24.6 million last year. These amounts mainly reflect, of course, the interest expense on our $2 billion debt offering that we did in February of '07.</p>
          <p>Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $3 million. 18.2 million this year in the first quarter versus 21.2 a year ago in the first quarter. Actual interest income was up about 400,000. The other big change was our half of Mexico's earnings. Since we don't consolidate Mexico, half of the earnings of that operation go into that line. Our half of those earnings were lower year-over-year due to &#x2013; principally due to the weak peso. Again, there was about 3 million U.S. dollars less of income. In pesos, profits for the Mexico operation were up in Q1.</p>
          <p>Overall, pre-tax income was up 1% this year in the quarter, 421.8 million this year versus 417.5 million last year. Our tax rate -- not a big difference -- a shade lower. This year, the tax rate came in at 36.1%. Again, slightly lower than 36.4% a year earlier.</p>
          <p>A quick run down on the balance sheet. The cash and equivalents and short-term investments, 4.189 billion. Inventories, 6.223 billion. Other current, 1.215 billion. All current assets, 11.627 billion. Net fixed assets, net PP&amp;E, 11.115 billion. Other assets, 736. And total assets, 23,478.</p>
          <p>On the right side, short-term debt, 81. Accounts payable, 6.318 billion. Other current liabilities, 3.886 billion. Total current liabilities, 10.285 billion. Long-term debt, 2.292 billion. Deferred and other, 470. All liabilities, 13.047 billion. Minority interest, 86. Stockholder's equity, 10.345 billion. Again total side of the right of 23.478 billion.</p>
          <p>We'll have a cash flow later. Not today, though. But depreciation and amortization, so when you put that in your model, for the first quarter it was up to $184 million.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, again, quite strong. Debt to cap, 19%. Plenty of financial strength there. Accounts payable. Per the balance sheet, accounts payable as a percent of inventories last year at first quarter end was 99%. It was three percentage points higher this year to 102%. That includes, of course, all construction payables and other payables.</p>
          <p>Looking just at merchandise payables to merchandise inventories, we improved five percentage points from 83% a year ago to 88%. Average inventory per warehouse, up about 2% to -- and of course, we built up for Christmas both years, but that's a little higher than during the year, as well. But on a quarter over &#x2013; first quarter over first quarter basis, it was up $245,000, averaging 11.000676 billion [sic: 11.676 million] versus 11 billion -- I'm sorry -- 11.431 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>The main reasons -- strong FX represented actually more than 245,000, it represented $372,000. Within the core merchandising areas, the notable three departments, toys were down about 160,000. I think a big chunk of that just has to do with the less big ticket electronic toys, relative to a year ago. Less quantity. Jewelry was down about 115,000. And majors, what we call majors, which is electronics, was up 138,000. Very prominent in our locations.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, in Q1, we spent $307 million. For the year, we'd expect it to be right around $1.3 billion, maybe a shade higher, if we get a few more warehouses open. We are working on some. We are not sure when they'll close.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion overall, as I mentioned, in the first quarter, we opened six new units. No relos. That Redwood City, I mentioned, was not considered a relo because we actually closed it outright a year ago, and it went out of the number last year and put it in this year.</p>
          <p>In Q2, we expect to open two new units, and &#x2013; one of which is a relo, so a net of one. In Q3, one new one, no relos, so a net of one. In Q4, eight new, no relos, so a net of eight. All told for the year, that would be 17, less one relo in Q2, for a total of 16. And as I mentioned, we'd expect somewhere in the 16 to 18 range this year.</p>
          <p>In fiscal '09, we added about 3% to our square footage and ended the year with 543 locations in operation. In fiscal '010, assuming the 16 here, another 3% square footage increase and be at 559. As of Q1 end, our total square footage in operations stood at 75.815 million square feet. Again, some of you had asked for that. So that's the number there.</p>
          <p>Two final items, before I turn it back over to Brandy. As usual, later today, later this morning, you'll see the supplemental information packet online, which includes some useful stats and our detailed balance sheet. That will be posted on the Costco Investor Relations site later this morning.</p>
          <p>One other little quick thing. This year, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement related to the accounting and disclosure for non-controlling interests, formally referred to as minority interests. The results of this adoption on our financial statements is to separately list, on the face of our P&amp;L, the amounts of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests below the net income, to arrive at a new subtotal referred to as net income attributable to Costco. This amount was previously included in the interest income and other line. Additionally, on the balance sheet, minority interest, which was formally outside of equity, is now included in the equity section, listed as non-controlling interests.</p>
          <p>Again, I think this is just a small accounting announcement, but we did it. And so if you're questioning why there is a new line item in the income statement, that's it.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll open it up for Q&amp;A and turn it back over to Brandy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Richard. Just on the gross profit, the core was up 11 basis points, I think you said, and in the fourth quarter, it was up 6. Just wondering if you can give us some color by category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as I recall in Q4, two of the four sub-departments were up and two were down slightly, but still net positive, whereas we had three of the four this year, in the first quarter. There's really nothing that discernible there. Overall, I think the trend in the core business has generally been up for the last several quarters. Up slightly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you eluded it on your prepared remarks regarding the cycling of items, the seasonal markdowns, the aggressive pricing. How should we think about gross profit margins and SG&amp;A over the next couple of quarters? I know you don't want to give guidance, but just can you hold our hand a little bit on how we should think about those two line items?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, a lot of it depends on sales, of course. Underlying sales. We've got our fingers crossed. I think overall Q1 was good. November was a little shakier than September and October, but nonetheless overall was pretty good.</p>
          <p>Clearly the biggest item is the fact that we took $35 million of commodity price markdowns on milk, cheese, butter, chickens that wasn't covered, and we haven't seen any of that to date. And I'm not suggesting tomorrow either, but again, so far so good there.</p>
          <p>The fact that we lost a little money in gas last year, and so far we haven't this year, but again, tomorrow is another day there, too. But those are at least directionally positive for us.</p>
          <p>If Jim were sitting here, I think he would say margins aren't our problem &#x2013; our challenge. We feel that we've been able to do a little of both here, to be able to be competitive and to improve margins slightly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just last question, on deflation, you spoke to still seeing it in produce. Meat's letting up a little bit. Can you talk about dairy, and then also maybe the center part of the store? Kroger talked about their grocery deflation getting worse. Are you guys seeing that? Or did you see that earlier in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we probably talked about it earlier than the supermarket chains did. I think they probably were starting to incur it as well.</p>
          <p>We of course probably have been pushing a little harder private label, which does two things. One is you replace some &#x2013; even though the gross margin dollars are generally pretty good there, the average private label penetration is down 20, 25% versus the price we sell the branded good. Once that drives business, the brands come back and lower prices a little bit, too.</p>
          <p>Again, this is not consistently perfect, but last quarter, I know we took -- or a couple of months ago, we took a look at the top 20 highest volume like items in each sub-department, which is probably half of our sales in terms of dollars. And it was in the five to 6% range on pricing. Now, I don't know if that means it's four or five, but it's certainly not one or two.</p>
          <p>But has it gotten worse? I don't think it has gotten worse. We're still cycling through this major year of big deflation. I think once we get into January, February, hopefully that cycle will be broken a little bit and it won't be ongoing.</p>
          <p>I will tell you that talking to Tim Rose, who is head of the 50% of our business which is food and sundries in the U.S., his view is, when asked, I've been asked by many of you about the competition with the supermarkets because of all the pricing. And his view is, look, any lower prices is not a positive, but we really don't see &#x2013; feel a lot of impact from the supermarkets.</p>
          <p>It's -- I mean most customers, most members, are shopping in both places. And sure, they're going to pick up some sale items there and some smaller sizes or whatever, but from a competitive standpoint, he doesn't feel that our pricing has been impacted by what the supermarkets been doing.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Richard. I wanted to dig in a little more on the private label. You had a slide on that at your Analyst Day up at the Harlem store opening. You're talking about getting the private label to go from 22% to 37%. What's a realistic timeframe to get to that number, and what are you thinking about for private label penetration category-wise in the year ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think when Jim showed that slide and there was a couple of follow-up questions on it, I think he acknowledged that was a slide that was done about a year, a year and a half ago, and looking out I think three and six years, at the time. And so now, four years from now, I believe that was correct, the implication we would go from the low 20s to the mid 30s.</p>
          <p>I think he chuckled and said those are our goals &#x2013; those are our stretch goals that we are shooting for. The timing is probably longer. And I think when pressed, he obliged that who knows how long. It's certainly more than four years. I think trend-wise, we will keep &#x2013; private label works for us. And so does branded goods, by the way. We want to be able to sell both. And it'll keep going in that direction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all of the above. I mean on the food and sundry side, particularly. There's probably a little less on the non-food side. You see it -- you certainly see growth in apparel in the private label. We've seen growth in private label in even some of the holiday items. A lot of the Trim A Home and things like that. Again -- we've already done luggage. More of it's on the food -- on the traditional supermarket side, I would say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a couple of quick questions. First, Richard, I was hoping, I see that Coke is going back into your stores. Was there anything you learned for that brief moment of time it was out of there? If you could share with us about what cycled up when that was pulled out? Was it your private label; was it other national brands? And are there other brands like Coke that we could see a similar situation with?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is the slowdown in your traffic growth in November. Is there anything anecdotal you can speak to, and whether there's been a rebound from that in December at all? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Coke thing, I think it was just, I don't think we've announced anything, but it is correct. I think effective this coming Monday, Coca-Cola products will be back on our shelves.</p>
          <p>Look, I mean I think our sign that we had in store everywhere, basically said it all. It says until we can provide our members with these products at competitive prices and provide our members with value, we are not prepared to sell it. And we're now going to sell it. So I think that's really all I can say at this point. We have a long time relationship with Coca-Cola. They're a great brand, and we're happy to have them on our shelves. I don't think it, I know everybody wants to know a little bit more dirt on it, but that's all you're getting.</p>
          <p>The, on the transaction traffic side, when I looked at September and October and November, traffic was huge in September. It was like, what, 6.5, 4.5, and 3.5, basically, Bob? Traffic? Almost 4 in November.</p>
          <p>All those are great numbers guys. Robby, I can't say anything about December so far until early January, but again, we've &#x2013; everybody &#x2013; given September and October was pretty darn good relative to where it had been, everybody wanted a little more in November, so did we. We thought all three months, including November, were pretty good. And going into Christmas, we felt pretty good. Going into Christmas, we feel pretty good.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Building on the traffic question, what do you think is the normalized run rate for traffic? And given the exceptionally strong volume growth you had in fiscal '09, do you think we should expect it to be somewhat lower in fiscal '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you look at -- and some of you have heard this before -- at 10 years of monthly comps, up until when gas prices really started going through the roof in the spring of '08, it was never below minus 1 in a given month or above 2, and generally between 0 and 1.5. And never was it above 2, other than a timing difference of how a July 4 fell or something like that.</p>
          <p>All of a sudden, it was in the 2.5s and the threes, and of late, the last several months, it's been in the threes to 5.5s. One month, six.</p>
          <p>So I don't think we can assume that on a four -- let's say a four average over the last 12 months, we can keep doing fours on top of fours, given that, for 10 years, we were doing ones on top of ones. But I also would hope that it's still a positive number, not a negative number, meaning that we kept this frequency level, and people that have gotten used to shopping with us more frequently, arguably -- for food -- arguably this economy has helped enhance that frequency. I think we would hope that it would at least be have a plus sign in front of it. But yeah, we can't sustain fours and fives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, as we think about leverage point on expenses for comps, to the extent that deflation moderates at some point. I know it's tough to call that exactly. But should we think about some moderation in the leverage points for which expenses could be favorable versus sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I clearly -- I know I've said it before, and I just read it somewhere else yesterday. A little inflation would be nice from a bottom line standpoint here. Not a lot of inflation, but a little. Again, as it subsides, it helps us. Or hurts us less, in the case of it's still deflationary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My last question. Looking at the November sales relative to the 12 weeks, it looks like the 13th week grew quite a bit faster, so the beginning of fiscal second quarter. Was anything unusual around the timing or your Thanksgiving, post-Thanksgiving experience? Because it looked like it picked up quite a bit for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the math does work out that way. So good analysis. There is nothing unusual in that.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Dan Binder. A couple of questions. First with the obviously -- the lull in store growth here, can you just give us a rough idea what you think the membership growth dollars should look like, and excluding FX, so local currency membership growth dollars in the next couple of quarters?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you can give us a little bit of color on the new store productivity, particularly in the newest stores -- Harlem and I think also the mall-based store in Arizona? That would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't give you any direct guidance on membership dollars. The drivers of course are increasing conversion and penetration of executive membership, which we do every quarter, and we just did give out those numbers. And the fact that we're still adding &#x2013; even net of the U.K., which is brand new. Just in the U.S. and Canada, we're adding 25, 26,000 either conversions or new sign-ups a week, is pretty darn good in that regard. That helps.</p>
          <p>There are no current plans to raise the base membership. As you know, historically, we've done that every five or so years, and we did it I think three &#x2013; almost four years ago. So it's still a while off before considering that.</p>
          <p>But again, I think, certainly -- and then in terms of the slowdown of openings, I think one of the things we talked about -- I think it was at the New York opening -- that while we opened I think 15 or 16 in '09, a net of 16 or 17 this year, 16 to 18, that we would expect -- we were hoping and planning for that number to be in the low 20s in 2011 and 12, and at the mid to high 20s beyond that.</p>
          <p>Now, before, but certainly our efforts are to push that number upward in terms of openings. That doesn't impact the next two quarters, of course, but that's where that is.</p>
          <p>And what was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was just around new store productivity. Just curious how your early results on the Harlem store, and then any additional color on the mall-based store in Arizona?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not giving you specific numbers. But the malls overall have done well. I mean, we opened a year and a half ago in Houston, Galleria, which has been a great opening for us. We're in Cumberland in Atlanta, North Atlanta, which has been very good. I think, so far, the results have been fine. I can't give you specific numbers.</p>
          <p>New York is doing as we expected. Now that doesn't help you a lot. I can tell you sign-ups are good. We're getting very strong weekend traffic as expected, because people actually go out and do stuff rather than on the way home from work, say, hey, let's go to Costco, like they do in the suburbs. And we're building that small-business business.</p>
          <p>So we are pleased with where we are. This is &#x2013; it's not like a Tokyo or a Taiwan opening, which is mass hysteria of positive. But it's so far, so good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given that that store is a bit smaller and the results are as you expected, would you consider opening up smaller stores and markets where real estate is a little bit tougher to get? Maybe the size of store that you'd want? But would you think about duplicating that elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, never say never. I mean, Manhattan is unique. I can tell you that several years ago there was a great location in a very affluent part of Atlanta that was a six or seven acre site, not a 10 or 12 acre site, and it required two floors of parking. And at the end of the day, as much as we wanted to do it, because there was really nothing in that area, I think the discipline of saying no was due to the fact that, when you've got double decker anything, it's more expensive. And we should not allow ourselves to go down that road unless we're -- it's the last thing that we can possibly do. So I think will there be more in the future? Yes.</p>
          <p>This, by the way, recognizing in Manhattan you don't sell a lot of patio furniture and 50 pound bags of dog food. So some of the bulk was taken out of it. Bulk items. Clearly, it's smaller. But in addition, we are fortunate that given this is a five story retail structure, we have the ground floor. On the ground floor, there is basically two things, us and the receiving docks for the entire facility, the entire five floors of retail.</p>
          <p>So we have great receiving without freight elevators, without escalator ramps because of two floors of retail. And so there is some -- for a city like -- relatively speaking, it's great relative to what we thought we could ever do in Manhattan.</p>
          <p>Could there be some more? Yes. I don't think we're going to be rushing to do a lot, no. If there were two more sites in Manhattan, in other parts, would we do it? I think we would do it in a second.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Richard, you talked about you're not really being impacted by the Supermarkets in terms of pricing, but us a sense of what you are seeing in the competitive environment out there. We've obviously heard a lot of chatter about Wal-Mart getting more aggressive. Give us some thoughts especially as you're heading into that easy margin comparison into Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I don't want to belittle the supermarkets or Wal-Mart. They are both -- the industry of the supermarkets and Wal-Mart are both incredible retailers.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget the fact that our average markup is 11% and supermarkets average markup is in the mid 20s, and Wal-Mart's, depending on the format, is -- not Sam's, but the Wal-Mart stores -- are probably somewhere from the high teens to the low 20s, depending on the format and the departments. So at the end of the day, it's hard to beat our pricing overall.</p>
          <p>We recognize that people still shop at a Wal-Mart or Target every week. We recognize that everybody still shops at a supermarket a couple times a week. But we are getting more of that dollar than we've ever gotten before, given our frequency, and given the people -- that's what people are looking for, first and foremost.</p>
          <p>So in terms of pricing, I don't want to be arrogant about it, but -- I can't predict what the future will hold -- but we've held our own pretty well in quote/unquote very tough times. And as I mentioned earlier in this conversation about the supermarkets, we don't believe that they've impacted us a lot on our pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So really no change in the competitive landscape this holiday season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are your words. I'm not trying to say yes or no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just talking about the categories. Obviously, we are seeing some encouraging non-food trends versus food. Give us a sense of what you are learning in the basket, where the interest is, and what you've done in terms of the mix to perhaps improve that non-food trend?</p>
          <p>I mean we've seen actually TV unit sales have actually started to come down pretty dramatically, the plus 30s. I think last month it was only up 15%. So give us a sense you are obviously seeing some recovery in the non-food, but where is it coming from, and have you done anything in the mix in terms of pricing to spur that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've done nothing with regard to pricing. Again, there's no new sale items or new lower price items on stuff.</p>
          <p>I think part of it has to do with the fact that we are starting to compare against the weakness from a year-ago. Part of it is the fact that people are staying home a little more. I mean, if you look at some of the categories like housewares and domestics and things like that -- I think apparel, it's a combination of what I just said as well as availability of goods. There's still a lot of great availability in there, and continuing better brands and what have you.</p>
          <p>If anything, a lot of the focus -- I think that our non-foods buyers are just relieved that it finally turned after suffering something that they haven't suffered forever. Not even something with a negative in front of it. Bob was just saying here, it really is all categories across the board.</p>
          <p>And then on the electronics side, I think we are doing okay, given the fact that it was even 15 or 18 in the last month or two. That's on top of up 40s and 50s a year ago. Clearly, we can't sustain that, but fortunately, as the unit growth has come down some, still growth, so has the level of deflation in those categories.</p>
          <p>Again, electronics has helped by the fact that people -- our camera business is quite strong. Deflationary, but unit sales still make it a positive. And PCs, with the netbooks and everything else. Deflation is strong, but unit sales are stronger.</p>
          <p>Frankly, I think it really is all of the above, and the continued improvement in our fresh foods area. Every day we feel better about our fresh foods selection and growth, and how it separates us from the rest. I mean people brag about our stuff because of the quality, the size, and the price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then your point about some of the opportunistic buys. Any change there? Everyone seems have been focused on leaner inventory. Is that still as flush as we saw, or is it getting tougher to find those buys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the direction, throughout this time, even a few months ago, as we are getting ready for the Christmas and the fall seasons, the message from the Jim to the buyers was be aggressive. We are in a unique position that when we make a mistake, it means we've got six or eight weeks of inventory instead of three of four. And the stuff we sell aren't &#x2013; you got to be a little more careful let's say on gift baskets, because there's a short window before Christmas on those, not a twelve week window. But you can afford to be aggressive relative to our complementary retailers.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; there is less -- a year ago, there was some really unique things out there because some of the really high end apparel and related goods and electronics. Remember we were selling the two pack of TVs at ridiculous prices relative to what they'd been a week before. That had to do with the fact there was inventory backed up as traditional retailers were canceling. And we -- there is not as much of that, because the manufacturers have planned better this year, knowing what the economy was doing.</p>

          <p>Hi, Richard. The question that I have is on the electronics business a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about demand and pricing, and sort of how the lower price points or the lower screens are doing versus the larger ones, and how you see that playing out?</p>
          <p>The second question that I have is when you look around at the business from the perspective of the gasoline business, how competitive has that been, or what are your expectations around that? Because the supermarkets also have talked a little bit more about their gas pricing and the challenges there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the trend overall in gas has been -- it's still volatile and still requires a thick stomach lining. I think the bad weeks are not as bad and the good weeks are better than they used to be.</p>
          <p>So overall, it's become a little bit more profitable business, and I'm only speaking of the last 15 months or whatever. And I can remember when we had -- not a lot fewer stations, but fewer stations, two or three years ago. A bad week, you could lose 3 million or more. Today, it seems like a real bad week is in the low 2s. And again, that's anecdotal, but at least it's -- directionally, it's been still volatile.</p>
          <p>If you look at last year, again, in Q1 we had great profitability. Q2 and 3 we lost money, not a lot., And then in Q4, we made a decent amount.</p>
          <p>So for overall, we did fine for the year, our best year ever, but it was certainly volatile. And as I mentioned earlier on this call, Q1 is starting out -- I'm sorry -- Q1 did actually pretty good, but it was comparing up against ridiculous from a year ago.</p>
          <p>And Q2, we lost money last year. Two weeks into it, we are making a little. But again, nothing -- you never know what can happen tomorrow.</p>
          <p>The other part of that question? Oh, flat screen. Electronics.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our sweet spot actually is still the bigger TVs. Those still are cheaper. I mean there's lots of 40 to 55-inchers in the 800 to $1,600 range.</p>
          <p>And are we selling some of the smaller ones? I think on the TV side, our chart, our graph would be skewed to the right with price points going up to the right. On the netbook side, they are doing fine. We still sell more of the full line laptops and desktops, recognizing a really good full line laptop now is six to 800 bucks. Our challenge is to keep putting more into it, so we can drive the price point up a little and still be a great value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. Really just wanted to focus on SG&amp;A dollars. So if I back out the $28 million charge from last year, and then I don't know if my math is any good or not, but try to adjust it for currency, it looks like the SG&amp;A dollar growth year-over-year was about 6.5% adjusted for currency. A little bit faster than in the fourth quarter, obviously the sales, the underlying sales improved a little bit.</p>
          <p>But you managed to leverage pay roll. Now can you just give us any more color on anything you were able to do to kind of keep the SG&amp;A dollars in check during the quarter, and maybe how to think about that growth rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, for those you are on the phone that have known this for a long time, I used to always say that there aren't a lot of silver bullets. We're pretty efficient. I think in the last year, we've gotten better. Everybody is looking everywhere else. Every set of supervisors is looking to see where they can save a little bit. It's hard.</p>
          <p>But I think we've taken our -- we've tested this in some regions, taking our ratio of full time to part time in the warehouse from 50-50 to maybe 55-45, recognizing, if you have more full timers, you have a few less full time equivalents. You had the same payroll dollars, perhaps, but a few less people on benefits because you have -- everybody's still eligible, but it's a few less full time equivalents.</p>
          <p>That's not everywhere. And it does work. But -- I'm trying to think what else.</p>

          <p>What do you think about healthcare going forward? You are now beginning to anniversary some of those higher costs. It looks maybe the employment situation could be bottoming just from a year-over-year change in employment. How do you think about that going forward in terms of the impact of healthcare cost and the SG&amp;A dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know if we have all the right answers, or any of the right answers yet. One of things we are talking about. Again one of the things is moving slightly the ratio of full time to part time, recognizing as you do that, it's harder to manage the business, because part timers allow you a little more flexibility. We are -- what was the question again? I'm sorry. Somebody was asking me something.</p>

          <p>Hey, Richard, couple of questions here. First, on private label. Can you remind us what the penetration was for fiscal 2009 in total? And then what it was in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's up about 2 percentage points year-over-year. I would say it's approaching 20. Right at -- I need to get a better look at, but I think it's probably right around 20, up from maybe 18 year ago. On the food and sundries side, it's disproportionate. It's probably up 300 plus basis points on that side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's for the first quarter or is that for last fiscal '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am just thinking of year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Right now &#x2013; okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, on getting back to the previous question about healthcare. There is two other things.</p>
          <p>One of things that have hit us hard in the last year that has added insult to injury here in dollars is the increased percentage of employees that are eligible because we haven't opened as many units, and because people aren't leaving. And again, for years, we were in the very low 80s in terms of those eligible because your new hires generally are part-time hourly. They take on average six and a half months to become eligible. Having opened a fewer number of units and having existing -- our annual turnover has gone from a very attractive low 20% number to 12% in the past year.</p>
          <p>Now as the economy gets better, it's not going to just jump back up to the low 80s in the case of -- from the low 90s, in terms of eligibility. My guess is over the next three to four years, we will get incremental improvement in that number. That will help you a little bit or help offset some of the increases.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that, in these tough times over the last year, and we've done &#x2013; this is anecdotal, but in just costing this with our third party administrators like the Aetna's of the world, it's not just at Costco. What is just at Costco, I sometime think is that we have a very generous plan where the employees pay a small piece, so we're getting hit with a little bit more of the burden.</p>
          <p>But what has happened over the last year, there's increased frequency in utilization. The stress on people's lives, at least on a surface, it would appear that people are doing more. It's not that we're -- we are still devoting as many dollars to safety -- workers' safety in the warehouse. People are just doing more things. I am not talking about workers' comp in general. Whether it's stress, accidents, you name it. And so that, too, I think as the economy gets a little better, anecdotally should improve a little.</p>
          <p>We are being very proactive and these are longer term issues, like all companies out there, on things like weight loss, smoking cessation. How do you incent your employees to do that without being punitive. What we don't want to do is say, if you smoke, it's this much more. But at least what about if you try? Try to do a cessation plan. You don't have to succeed, but you have to try.</p>
          <p>These are the types of things that we are doing and looking at. These are more long term than the next quarter or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sticking with the healthcare theme, then, you said earlier in the call that it was 1 to $0.02, I guess, higher than expected. I recall on your prior call you expected the hit to be $0.03, so was the hit four to five, or was the hit just one to two, and so a little bit better than what you thought it would be?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem. And then on the trend to California that have been getting better, can you kind of maybe break that down between kind of the core business, because I am sure some of that is gas getting less negative. If you strip out gas, how has the California market been performing, 1Q versus 4Q?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Ex gas. And then lastly &#x2013; thanks for that. And then lastly, the depreciation number you gave, I think that was about 19% higher than last year. It has been growing more like 11%. Any reason why depreciation accelerated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably the single biggest thing is we &#x2013; historically, we had used outside disaster -- for our IT, we had used disaster recovery sites. And we finally took the plunge about six months ago, eight months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Three or four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little over that. Maybe nine months ago. And in eastern Washington rather than in Sterling Forest, New York or Boulder, Colorado, using outside parties.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Washington, we basically expended I think close to $30 million on computer equipment. And that facility over there that's a dedicated facility for many companies, that's a disaster recovery center, where we have our caged in areas. And we're also running some things over there. But unlike a lot of the banks that have mimicked the IT systems all over the country or world, we historically have been here, and used third party disaster recovery.</p>
          <p>Most of that equipment has five year life, I believe. A little of it may even have three year, but let's say most of it has &#x2013; let's say on average four, to be safe here. So that alone is a chunk of it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the other thing that we have really pushed in the last couple of years, which I think we're seeing a little bit of increase, so you'll still see it, is remodel activity. We're -- one of the things that we're notable for historically is all the places look pretty good and have the latest and greatest, and that's &#x2013; we're taking the offense on driving business. And when things were &#x2013; we're spending a lot of money like on fresh foods and refrigeration and frozen foods. Those penetrations -- those are profitable departments, of course, and penetrations are up, and we're devoting lots of money to things like that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. Could I get just a clarification on an answer that you gave to another caller? When you said the comp is unlikely to stay up in the sort of 4% plus range, but you're hoping to have a positive sign, it seems like you might get to 4% plus just on currency and gas having a better impact. Were you talking about the total comp or you were talking about the merchandise comp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually the -- what I was talking about was the traffic frequency -- the frequency. So in other words, comp is always the product of average ticket and average traffic, average frequency. And we've been enjoying, for 10 years, the frequency component, the shopper frequency. So for every hundred shops that existing members did this year, they would do a 101 or 101.5 next year. So frequency was up, 1, 1.5%.</p>
          <p>Since gas spiked in the spring or early summer of '08, we started seeing the frequency improve like never before. I think it's improved even more with the economy, and with people, with our MVM mailers, with people shopping more often to keep more cash in their wallet, with people -- with the penetration of food and sundries, certainly unit penetration, people are shopping for that versus bigger ticket discretionary items, they're coming into Costco more frequently.</p>
          <p>So what I was saying was is that frequency in the last year has been in &#x2013; has started in the three range and headed up towards five plus. Clearly, we're not going to see it go five on top of four, on top of four, on top of four, on an annual basis. I'd be happy if it was &#x2013; if we maintained it and were able to keep growing back to the good old days when it was one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the end of the wire, and I guess we're going to call it an afternoon. But on the fourth quarter call, Richard, you talked about, for holiday, you brought in some seasonal items a little early, I think into mid August rather than early September. Did that change the cadence of sales? Did that give you an early read-through? What did that allow you to do differently, let's say, holiday '09 versus holiday '08, if it did?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, less markdowns. I think it gets back to what Jim talked about as being aggressive, and if you've got great merchandise at great prices, let's get in there a little earlier and people see it here first and buy it first here. And we have the luxury in our model to be able to do that. So I view it as it was, again, more being -- taking the offense. And also, in fairness, giving us a little more time, if we did need to sell-through, to sell-through without markdowns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then at the Analyst Meeting that you held in New York, you elaborated on your central fill initiative. Can you provide some additional details in terms of what that has allowed you to do in terms of improving your pharmacy operations? And are there additional plans to open up more central fill facilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we talked about was, A, there is a shortage of pharmacists in the country because everybody has pharmacies. Not just pharmacies, the Walgreen's and the CVSs of the world. But the supermarket chains and the Targets and Wal-Marts and the Sam's and the Costcos.</p>
          <p>And so in that regard, there's a shortage. The average cost of fill -- and so these central fills can do high volumes very automated for the most popular prescription drugs. And we can cut by almost two-thirds the all-in cost of filling a prescription. We're not the only ones doing it, but given our volumes, it's kind of like we take most advantage of a cross stock operation versus traditional distribution centers in the retail industry. We take more advantage and our feeling is here because of the volume. We have a couple of these places doing in upwards of 15,000 prescriptions a day, with three or four pharmacists and a number of pharmacy techs supporting it, but it's a highly automated system.</p>
          <p>And so will we do more? I'm sure we will. I think what it has enabled us to do is to maintain our very strong profitability in that business over the last few years, particularly in the markets where we have these three on the West Coast, while everything in that business is tougher.</p>
          <p>The 100 pills for $10 and Medicare Part D, which I use one of my relatives as an example, who takes several different prescriptions of more expensive, state-of-the-art drugs. And the annual cost at Costco before Medicare Part D was about $6,300. Overnight, it went to the low fours, about 40 to $4,300. That came out of the retailer's gross margin.</p>
          <p>So I think with those kind of &#x2013;  notwithstanding all that, this has helped us maintain a good profitability in that industry, which is an ongoing &#x2013; it changes daily.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And I know there was a lot of questions on this call about deflation, et cetera, but what are you seeing with regards to list prices from your vendors as input costs are coming down?</p>
          <p>And then I thought you had some very interesting insights with regard to your approach to private label and how that's also changing some of your vendor relationships, so how might that also might be changing some of your list prices?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>When you say list prices, you mean on branded goods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, look, it's a circular thing. I mean, one plays on the other. I think the fact is, people always ask, are our buyers better than some other retailer?</p>
          <p>One of the things that makes our buyers better in some regards or good in some regards is the fact that we have to manage fewer things. We're managing two SKUs of canned peaches, not 30. We're putting all our buying power into two SKUs, not 30. Which allows our buyers to get much more in depth and understanding of every component of production cost.</p>
          <p>I think sometimes we drive vendors crazy with that, but it has helped us, and has given us, in our view, an advantage out there. And not to take anything away from other retail buyers at other companies, but we spend a lot more time focusing on the costs, the component costs, from direct labor, electricity, packaging, where you're getting your resin from, you name it. And all that goes into helping, I think, us do a good job.</p>
          <p>As Jim has said a number of times, we want to be both a seller of great private label goods, which does a lot of good things for us and the customer, great value and prices to the member, allows us to protect our margin and enhance loyalty, because the only place you can get our product -- the Kirkland signature is here. But it also allow us to be more competitive. Time and again over the years, as we've introduced the Kirkland signature item, that very strong, very brand loyal brand item has had to come down in price from already great prices to regain some of the lost market share.</p>
          <p>And so it's -- ultimately it's what our mission is, is to provide our members with the greatest products and quality at the lowest prices. And so we think there's plenty of opportunity.</p>
          <p>We also, as you've heard us say, we -- there's a lot of great branded manufacturers out there. And everybody can say it makes them better too, but it does. We all know who some of the best branded suppliers out there are in terms of innovation. And as they lose an item or a portion of a sale of an item, they are coming out the next day with something that's the third level up, or ultra this, or improve that, or completely new items. So that makes it better for all of us.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I think that if memory serves me correct, in the last few months, you started &#x2013; or you rolled out EBT to the New York city area. I just want to confirm that you're going to roll it out to the rest of the chain, and if you can maybe provide any color around what you've seen in the New York area as a result?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is now everywhere in the U.S. The only place it may not be, there was a time delay in the State of New Jersey, and it had to do with some regulations of how you do it. So it's more of a timing issue, not an issue of not doing it. And I could be wrong that it may already be in there, but I know it wasn't in the first few weeks after we announced them.</p>
          <p>Look, it's a slight net positive. It's still a very small percentage, but we've gotten a lot of positive responses from -- we've also gotten some new members. You got to believe on a macro basis there were some members that preferred to shop at Costco, but chose not to for one reason: they were on food stamps and we did not accept them. So from that perspective, we are gaining incremental new business. And at the end of the day some of our reasons for not doing it historically had gone away.</p>
          <p>Is it still a small percentage? Yes. But has it slowed the front end up a lot? No. It used to, when you had to separate the basket into food stampable and non-food stampable, do two separate transactions. You had paper value coupons, not electronic debit cards, effectively. And so we probably waited a little too long, but it's a good thing we did it.</p>
