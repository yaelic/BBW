          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Conference Call of Intesa Sanpaolo for the Presentation of the First Quarter 2011 Results hosted today by Mr. Corrado Passera, Chief Executive Officer. My name is Marina and I will be your coordinator for today's conference.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Corrado Passera. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marina, and good morning and thank you for joining me to discuss or joining us to discuss our first quarter results. It is just a few weeks since we had another meeting to present our business plan. And since the presentation on &#x2013; of the plan, we had our shareholders' meeting, a lot of people, a lot of participants, a lot of investors from all over the world, the reaction and to the plan and to the capital increase has been quite positive.</p>
          <p>We had the support of more than 98% of those participating in the meeting in favor of our rights issue. That's another evidence of the rightness of the decision of the timing of the decision taking action now and fixing this component of our bank has been, in our opinion, the right thing to do at the right moment.</p>
          <p>Many &#x2013; very many of the 150 projects, action plans, programs that the business plan includes have already been launched. Thousands of people are personally engaged and committed in the implementation of such projects. The plan, as you know, is very much in line with our base philosophy. We call it sustainable profitability. There is the combination of sustainable revenues, high productivity, very strong liquidity, very low risk profile and the right level of capital soundness.</p>
          <p>The numbers we are presenting today on the first quarter results are perfectly in line with those targets. They are in line, even a little bit ahead, of our expectations. So let's move to the presentation and let's go rapidly through it in order to have as much room as possible for your questions.</p>
          <p>Page number 3, the summary of the summary, we start obviously with sustainable profitability as our flag and we had further evidence of the soundness of what we are providing to our shareholders. Pre-tax income at &#x20AC;1,267 million, the highest in the past six quarters, that's an important point, 35% above last quarter and almost 9% above first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>If we look at net income adjusted for the main non-recurring items, so the real net income, we are at &#x20AC;762 million, again, the highest in the past six quarters, 57% higher than last quarter and 7% higher than the first quarter 2010. And you might remember that our first quarter last year was a very strong one, the strongest in the year.</p>
          <p>Second perspective, cost of credit and the quality of the portfolio. If we annualize the cost of credit of the first quarter, we are down at 72 basis points. That is quite an improvement versus the 89 basis points of the last quarter and 81 basis points of the first quarter 2010. But what is another strong evidence of the fact that we are moving in the direction we were working for is the total amount of non-performing loans. The net non-performing loans amount after many years, after several years have gone down and this is something that again is the evidence of what we expected.</p>
          <p>Operating costs, down. We have a minus sign also in the first quarter this year after a very consistent trend in the last four years. We will give you the figures about liquidity, funding capability that proved to be strong also in the most difficult part of the crisis, very low leverage, and a capital base that is becoming stronger and stronger. In terms of capital ratios, they are stronger, even a little bit more than we expected and if we &#x2013; pro forma, the Core Tier 1 also in the light of the very, very, very close rights issue, we are getting very close to 10%.</p>
          <p>Page 4, the two points I made before on the pre-tax income, you see we are well above last year &#x2013; last quarter and well above also first quarter last year on the left hand side. And in terms of net income adjusted for the main non-recurring items, but we're talking about a very limited amount that the elements of that have to do with the merger, we are almost 60% above last quarter and 7% first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Page 5, the point I made before, a year-on-year decrease in net non-performing loans after many quarters, several years of year-on-year increase in a row. You know that in our country the total amount of non-performing loans tend to keep growing because of the very long life of doubtful loans because of the length of the procedures. But despite these effects and before even considering the sale of part of our doubtful loan portfolio we are eventually down on the total volume. Cost of credit down, unrealized 72 basis points already said before.</p>
          <p>Page 6, efficiency and productivity. Cost/income down at 53%. You know that we have in mind quite an aggressive target on this part of the management and after the four years with strong minus signs we are, again, with a minus sign in first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>Page 7, liquidity. Liquidity even will remain strength of ours. We are two-thirds already done in terms of medium-term placement. All the wholesale maturities have already been covered with very good results, especially in the last few days, so nothing real important on this part. The usual balance between direct and deposit &#x2013; direct customer deposit and customer loans, but these will remain an area of high attention for us because we believe it's a competitive advantage of ours.</p>
          <p>Page 8, capital ratios. We have to talk in terms of Core Tier 1 as of today and if we add to the accounting figure that are in any case very much moving in the right direction, if we add the right issue and the extraordinary deals that have already been completed that simply have to be implemented and we get close to 10%. These figures already embed a pro forma dividend in line with what we have paid this year for last year.</p>
          <p>In the last few pages, we'll go very rapidly through it &#x2013; through them. We have a summary of our business plan because every time we have in the next quarter our results we will have to remember to remind everybody the kind of targets we have for the three years and for the five years of the business plan. The formula is very clear. I do not go through it any more. It's our formula of sustainable profitability.</p>
          <p>Page 10, you remember we have a plan to keep costs more or less flat with a growth that is more or less 3% real growth vis-&#xE0;-vis what we expect in terms of economic scenario, gradual reduction in terms of net adjustments to loans, quite the same balance in terms of customer deposit to customer loans. And the idea is &#x2013; and then what is happening actually &#x2013; is to get to 10% pro forma equity, common equity ratio during 2011 and then stay at that level. Whatever we make in terms of profit in excess of this figure, it will be paid to the shareholders. If &#x2013; these are the components very basically of the business plan.</p>
          <p>The targets of the business plan are the ones you have on page 11. Return on tangible equity close to 15% at the end of the exercise, &#x20AC;5 billion worth of dividends in the first three years and about &#x20AC;13 billion worth of dividends in the five years of the business plan plus the projections, a company, ours, that will have to get back to something in the <mark type="ph" /> round (11:36) of between &#x20AC;5 billion and &#x20AC;6 billion worth of net income.</p>
          <p>Each of the levers of the management are described in the following pages. I will not go through them any more. Page 12 is the growth, the number of projects, investments we're going to do, the kind of costs we will take to foster growth in our bank.</p>
          <p>The only page I would just stop for just a second is page 13, where we remember to ourself that a market scenario assumptions we have included in the business plan are proving quite conservative. As you'll see, the left-hand side, at the top left of the page, we assume a growth in Italy in the <mark type="ph" /> round (12:32) of 0.8% and the growth in Europe of about 1.3%; inflation, compound inflation in 1.6% and ECB reference rate at the end of 2013 at 2.5%. Forward rates are already about that level, but as we discussed during the previous presentation, we wanted to have quite a level of prudence in the market scenario.</p>
          <p>Page 14 is what we expect in terms of costs and productivity. It's probably better to go to page 15 where we have probably more effectively described what we have in mind. We want to keep our costs practically flat, but change in a major way the mix of costs within the company.</p>
          <p>We are looking and we have already found at least &#x20AC;800 million worth of cost savings. Partially are people, partially are other kinds of cost and we want to use these savings to finance cost for fostering growth in all the divisions of the bank. And a large number of the 150 projects I was mentioning before has to do with these efforts, this exercise to bring more energy to the commercial activity while at the same time savings on the more administrative back office not any more unnecessary kind of costs.</p>
          <p>Page 16, to confirm that during the business plan we will keep a very low risk profile. Page 17, the liquidity target we have given the bank. Not only balanced between customers and deposit and customer loans, but also quite a significant amount of eligible assets in case of need. We have reduced them last year.</p>
          <p>The interbank position will remain within the limit we have given the bank. We believe that &#x20AC;10 billion is a very prudent kind of position for a bank like ourself. We have used the interbank position to replace part of the institutional deposits, CP and CDs that in the last few months were a little bit too expensive, but that's the limit we give to the bank. In terms of short term liquidity, one is the magic number and in terms of long term liquidity ratios, 100 is the magic number that has already been achieved and will have to be defended.</p>
          <p>Page 18, capital requirements, capital ratios, but there is nothing new to say.</p>
          <p>Page 19, to remember that we have in mind to be at 10% core &#x2013; common equity already at the end of this year, obviously on a pro forma basis, after taking into account all the negative effect of Basel 3 and all the actions that we have already identified and implemented to compensate for the Basel 3 new rules.</p>
          <p>Page 20, all the advantages of the capital increase, the only one I want to mention here, because we had the evidence of it a few days ago, lower funding cost is a reality. And the way our CDS moved after the capital increase announcement, also vis-&#xE0;-vis the country CDS, is an evidence of what we expected by the business plan.</p>
          <p>Page 21, only to remember especially to ourself, that we want to remain a very low-risk kind of bank, we want to increase gradually our profitability, but it has to be in any case a sustainable one.</p>
          <p>Page 23, the summary of this quarter results, that we will go &#x2013; that will analyze more in depth in the following pages, but certainly the fact that revenues are the highest in the past four quarters is a good piece of news. In terms of cost, the fact that we are down vis-&#xE0;-vis last quarter is quite obvious, given the seasonality of our costs in the last quarter of the year. But the fact that we are down also vis-&#xE0;-vis first quarter last year is a good point. Operating margin up 15% versus last year and 8% versus what we have delivered on average during 2010. And in any case, after the first quarter that was a particularly high, also for nonrecurring reasons, today this quarter results is the highest in the last four quarters.</p>
          <p>The net adjustment, we already made a comment. We're very much in line, even a little bit ahead of our plans in terms of portfolio quality &#x2013; asset &#x2013; loan portfolio quality. But the two strong points are the pre-tax income at the highest level in the past six quarters and net income at the highest level, adjusted net income at the highest level in the last six quarters.</p>
          <p>Page 24, the comparison between last quarter 2010 and first quarter 2011. Revenue is a little bit higher.  Obviously, here we have &#x2013; not obviously, but here the main positive component is trading. The fact that commissions have gone down are very much related to the lack of performance fees that they are concentrated in the last quarter of the year. We decided not to place third-party bonds. And that's a decision for at least these quarters. And investment banking commissions were concentrated in the last quarter while they were a little bit lighter in the first quarter, while they'll come back in the next ones.</p>
          <p>In terms of costs &#x2013; and here I can say obviously we are lower than fourth quarter last year. Operating margin up 15%, good trend in terms of net adjustments to loans, even if the last quarter is typically a high quarter, but better than we expected. 35% increase at the level of income before tax and more or less the same at the level of net income.</p>
          <p>If we want to compare page 25, the adjusted figures for net income last quarter and this quarter and we take away the very positive effect we had through the consolidation of Intesa Vita in the fourth quarter and the prudential provisions we made in the same quarter, we see that the comparable figures and the increase, the effective increase in net income that is almost 60%.</p>
          <p>Now the comparison with page 26, with first quarter last year. Here we have net interest income that are more or less in line with one year ago. Then we will elaborate more on this figure that is certainly in line with our expectations. Net fees more or less in line despite the lack of third-party bond placement.</p>
          <p>Income from insurance business has gone down. But as you might remember, the first quarter 2010 benefited from the sale of some securities belonging to the reserves that had a very positive effect first quarter 2010. So more or less revenues despite the number of negative effect  in line, costs down 0.3%, more or less <mark type="ph" /> lowered (22:38) operating margin stable, good performance in terms of provisions, higher income before tax and higher, if we exclude main nonrecurring items, net income, if we consider all items nonrecurring included, we are about 4% lower.</p>
          <p>The comparison in terms of net income and different components of the net income are at page 27. You see that which are the items we consider nonrecurring. In the first quarter 2010 we had the deferred taxation that had a very positive effect on our accounts. If we take that into account on that quarter and we consider at least the Hungarian tax that we do not consider a stable and definite one, we are in the positive sign also in terms of growth of net income.</p>
          <p>Page 28, loan to customers, positive sign. It's important. It has not been the case for a long time, and only in the last two quarters we have this year-on-year trend. In terms of direct customer deposits, as I said before, we have replaced some institutional CDs and CPs with interbank position that is well under control. Positive figure in terms of assets under administration, and very positive management of risk-weighted asset that you see go down despite the growth in loan to customers. We have only recently given the sufficient attention to the management of risk-weighted asset, and the results are coming.</p>
          <p>Page 29, net interest income. You'll see the trend. We are more or less in line with last year. The comparison with the fourth quarter has to take into account the number of days and the first quarter, as you know, lacks two days vis-&#xE0;-vis the fourth of the year. In terms of the comparison between the two, &#x2013; the first quarter 2010 and the first quarter 2011, page 30 is probably the best page to use.</p>
          <p>What I like to point out is that the sensitivity works in the sense that we have the effect of the growing mark-downs, obviously hedging participate and contributes less and less to our results, but in line with what we expected. Hedging provided contribution to our results in the first quarter this year in the round of &#x20AC;330 million, more or less the &#x2013; no, exactly, actually, the amount we had in mind. In the two figures regarding the hedging contribution, we have highlighted the effect coming from the hedging reduction. As we have already discussed on several occasions, given the new curve of yields, we tend not to replace those facilities that expires month after month.</p>
          <p>So on a yearly basis this effect accounts for &#x20AC;37 million. If you take &#x20AC;37 million, the figure in the yellow cloud, out of the &#x20AC;97 million, you'll see that the effect on mark-downs and hedging contribution is consistent with the sensitivity we have in the business plan. Actually, the sensitivity is still a little bit higher than what we have in the business plan.</p>
          <p>And to these figures we will have to add in the next quarters the effect of the very heavy, in-depth exercise we are making in terms of pricing and EVA pricing culture. This is an effort that will give the best of its effect only during the period of the business plan, but it has to be mentally added to this figure in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>Net fee and commission, page 31. As I said, we have more or less the same amount than quarter one 2010.  The decrease with the last quarter last year has to do mainly with investment banking fees, pro forma fees and the total absence of third-party bond placement. That's a decision that we have taken at least for the time being. We will see what the market will be in the next quarters, but certainly in these two quarters we will not have third-party bond placements.</p>
          <p>Page 32, the usual monitoring of net inflows from assets under administration to assets under management, and to commissions coming from both assets under management and insurance products, the trend is consistently positive. We are moving in the right direction also in terms of the mix of mutual funds we own on behalf of our customers. This movement is still quite slow, and we'll speed up only when retail customers will have more confidence in the market, and today it's not yet the case.</p>
          <p>Page 33, the quarterly analysis of the trading profits say that we are at the highest level, but still within the amount we had in mind. As you know, we want to &#x2013; we always keep a very low risk profile also in this kind of activity, and the figure we have in the first quarter is within the limits we have given the bank. Certainly it is an increase vis-&#xE0;-vis both last year first quarter and last year last quarter.</p>
          <p>The analysis of the trading profits is reported on Page 34. A good part of the money comes &#x2013; the fees come from customer-related activities. In the first quarter, we did not have any specific deals coming from the merchant banking activities in the second line. In the third line, proprietary trading and treasury benefited also partially by the maturity of government bonds that had to be devaluated during 2010, but as we said, in the &#x2013; at the end of second quarter and at the end of the fourth quarter, we said it's only a matter of time; as soon as these securities get to the maturity date, they will be repaid at 100% so we will get back the value. Probably, we have regained back what &#x2013; we have already gained back &#x2013; gotten back half of what &#x2013; of the devaluation during 2010.</p>
          <p>Income from insurance business, page 35, a low figure but keep in mind that extraordinary things that I mentioned before account for something between &#x20AC;60 and &#x20AC;80 million and that explain fully the difference. Eventually, we have been able to put together all our insurance companies, page 36, and we are creating the leader in this area in our market. The integration project of the life insurance companies is already underway and it is proceeding very successfully. As you remember, we have quite strong targets also in terms of damage and liabilities, retail lines, and the pension-related products will be another area of growth for our bancassurance business.</p>
          <p>Page 37, the usual figures on cost, trends quite consistent in all the different components of our cost portfolio amount. As you know, we have a target of containment already in this year, but the plan provides for a total stability of the &#x2013; at least for an overall stability of the cost line for the three years of the business plan &#x2013; actually for the five years.</p>
          <p>Page 38, provisions very much in line, the adjustment to loans better than usual. The net provision for risk and charges, you might remember that on &#x2013; during the fourth quarter last year we had a 100 provision decision that has increased in a significant way the total amount at the end of last year but for sure the amounts of the first quarter were lower than &#x2013; a bit lower than what we expected.</p>
          <p>Page 39, the good news about the non-performing loan portfolio. Past dues are down. Substandard loans are down. And, the total amount of non-performing loans, the net non-performing loans are down. So, in a way the pipeline is reducing itself and for the first time, the new inflows are more than compensated by other exits and the overall result is overall decrease in the total amount of net non-performing loans.</p>
          <p>Page 40, the usual figures we monitor on a quarterly basis; the coverage &#x2013; the total coverage of doubtful loans. Specific means the financial provision we make; the total is the overall coverage taking into account also all the collaterals, more than adequate and the performing loan reserves despite the strength of this reserve has kept growing also in the last &#x2013; in this last quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 41, the new sub-standard loan and the new doubtful loan gross flows quarter by quarter at &#x2013; and also at the divisional level. Everything is moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Page 42, the figures &#x2013; the analysis in terms of breakdown of our portfolio of credit in terms of business area, in terms of industries, and the usual analysis we provide on our residential mortgage portfolio.</p>
          <p>Page 42 &#x2013; page 43, sorry, the analysis we always provide in terms of exposure by country. The Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain exposure amount all together at 2%, only 2% of the total.</p>
          <p>At page 44 and at page &#x2013; from page 45, we have the analysis division by division. We can certainly go through them if you're interested. I will go &#x2013; I will just postpone it to any further questions.</p>
          <p>In summary, we consider the first quarter results sound; in line with our expectations, a little bit ahead of our targets; certainly in line with the business plan targets, both in terms of sustainable profitability, liquidity, and asset quality. We confirm what we said for the whole 2011 in terms of the increase we expect in operating income, the containment we expect in operating cost, in terms of declining of cost of credit and in terms of growth of recurring profitability.</p>
          <p>So, I tried to go as fast as possible through the presentation. It's a busy day for a number of you, and I wanted to have enough room for your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> we have now our first question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everyone, three very quick questions. The first regarding net interest income, there seems to be sluggish volume growth still in Q1. I was wondering if you are seeing a return to demand growth in Italy and how much loan growth do you expect for 2011? Following on from this, on the hedging position, can you give us the updated sensitivity to rates following the reduction of the hedge? And, can you tell us by how much you have reduced what I recall being between &#x20AC;50 billion and &#x20AC;60 billion of deposits being covered?</p>
          <p>The second, very quick, Banca Monte di Parma should be consolidated from next quarter on or the &#x2013; if you can give us the details on the P&amp;L impact of this acquisition?</p>
          <p>Finally, positive evolution of asset quality stocks, I was wondering if you're happy with the specific coverage that you have reached and given that you said this was even better than expected in terms of evolution, how much are you keeping into your pockets on the asset quality front for this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:28) then let me go through a number average, no &#x2013; okay, net interest income; volumes still not very high, certainly positive. And we consider very positive the fact that for the second quarter in a row we have a year-on-year increase in good credit demand. As you know we have always been very selective in accepting credit requests. And that's the main reason why we are now benefiting in terms of provisions. Credit demand, in our opinion, will keep growing at low one-digit level for these two quarters and then we will have to see for the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>Sensitivity is a good piece of news. For the &#x2013; as you might remember, we have included in the business plan a sensitivity of EUR150 million for each 100 basis point market yield increase. Actually in the first three months, we have kept the sensitivity slightly above EUR200 million. So it's a bit better than expected.</p>
          <p>The Banca del Monte di Parma will be in &#x2013; consolidated as soon as possible. We hope it will be done by the end of next quarter. It's a bank with something in the round of EUR80 million worth of revenues and EUR70 million worth of cost. So the kind of effect that before the treatment, that is, before the improvement that we expect to have in the results is for the time being quite negligible.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; if I understood correctly the last question, it's about what we expect for this year in terms of provisioning on our loan portfolio. We do not provide any other guidance in excess of what we have already done. Probably the three-year target we have in the business plan might prove to be a little bit prudent, but let's wait some more quarters before confirming such a statement.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I'll keep to two questions. The first one, I quite didn't catch how much the total hedging of deposits has changed? And also I wanted to confirm that if you unwound a part of this hedge, I thought you should have booked a capital gain if there is any near trade-in result?</p>
          <p>The second question is the RWA reduction that you pointed to. We have seen this as a bit of a trend in several Italian banks that have reported over the last couple of days.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sorry. You pointed to potential for RWA's optimization and reduction. Is that something that comes on top of the 70 basis points that you originally indicated in slide 19 as optimization/mitigation, is it something different? Or we should assume that it's part of those 70 basis points? And if it's different, could you quantify? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the hedging volumes; in the first quarter we have reduced in the sense that we have not renewed some of the facilities that got to expiring date, and the debt has been in the round of &#x20AC;4 billion. And, so that is the answer as far as the first quarter is concerned.</p>
          <p>During the rest of the year, we might find ourselves in the position, as you said, to sell or to divest from some of the position and whenever we decide &#x2013; whenever we realize that the net present value of the sale is higher than the expected benefit we can get from the maintenance of the position, obviously we will do it. And that might happen at least for some billions.</p>
          <p>Risk-weighted asset reduction; what we have in the business plan is the total we think we will reach according to the limits we could have in that respect, but there is room theoretically for even a stronger reduction. But that has to be &#x2013; has to go through a number of changes that are not still available in terms of authorization. So as of today, we are growing more rapidly than expected within the limit and the target of the business plan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon <mark type="ph" /> together, (46:44) a few questions. First one, could you give us an update on the trends on product margin? So what do you see in the front book on mortgages, what do you see in sort of small to mid caps and then large cap business? And how do they compare to the back book?</p>
          <p>Second, in your capital change this quarter, was there included the removal of the goodwill filter similar to what UniCredit reported this morning? And thirdly, on Hungary and there's a lot of debate right now to kind of fix FX mortgages, et cetera, could you give us an update as to where you stand on that debate, and when we can expect news from the regulator here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat your questions about Hungary, because I did not understand it. And I hoped our &#x2013; my colleagues had understood, but it was not the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in Hungary, there was a lot of debate that the government wanted to speak with the banks to fix at least a good part of the FX mortgages. And to find some sort of resolution mechanism for defaulted loans, et cetera. And I just wanted to see where we stand there, whether you have any insight to share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question is a wide one. Product margins have gone through a heavy stress during the lowest part of the market yield reduction. And now we see a number of them moving back to, not a reasonable yet, but certainly to a better position. What we expect, the most important action and the most important managerial exercise we will have to go, is what I called &#x2013; what I defined before, the EVA-based pricing.</p>
          <p>What we realized last year is that a very large number of colleagues of ours at the different organizational levels, account managers, branch managers, area managers, still look only at volumes and prices, and it is difficult for them to quantify the effect on the overall EVA of the group, the effects coming from their pricing and then credit decisions. So what we are going through is quite an investment in terms of reporting mechanism to provide everybody with the right kind of figures.</p>
          <p>At the same time, on the parallel way, a very heavy training exercise has been launched to develop, to diffuse this EVA culture that actually and very, very clearly is not yet part of the culture of the bank yet. So we still have at least 30%, if not more, of micro and small and medium-size customers that have too low margins in terms of &#x2013; on their loans. And that is an area of significant improvement vis-&#xE0;-vis today in terms of margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How big of an improvement could we look at? I mean, if you bring them to the proper EVA base pricing, I mean, how much do we talk about in basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basis points, I do not &#x2013; I cannot tell you, but for sure, even if we reduce the area of loss and probably cannot be done 100%, we are talking about several &#x20AC;100 millions worth of interest, especially with the so-called small business and SMEs segment. So about one-third of these improvements are included in the business plan, and we hope we will be able to do more than that.</p>
          <p>The second question was about the removal of the Bank of Italy filter and the answer is yes. It holds true also for our bank. And in terms of...</p>

          <p>Hungary is a country where there are a number of issues pending because we have this special tax that has been included, but I mean, let's forget about it. In terms of the foreign exchange exposure, we have overall in those countries a balanced position between credit loans and deposits, assets on the other side. So we're not particularly worried in that area. But certainly we have introduced, since quite a long time, very rigid limits in terms of growth of foreign exchange mortgages.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Mr. Passera. Thanks very much. You've answered already in a quite &#x2013; some of my questions. But just to go back to growth a little bit and to compare also your comment on margins, which they will be, they'll have to increase on a broader basis, especially for SME.</p>
          <p>What is the trade-off between effectively increasing some of the spreads, underlying rates are going up a little bit, and the actual growth that the SME sector can sustain? I mean, so far we really have seen a very little. Can you tell us a little bit more how you are thinking about that and how you're actually seeing the growth there? Is there less competition and therefore that is also what is happening and helping you being very capitalized, better funded to take market share from the other banks, or is there really more growth underlying because so far really all we have seen is retail effectively? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is quite an important and very serious question. And it is something that has to be &#x2013; the answer has to be adapted to the different situations in the different country &#x2013; in the different regions of the country and in the different countries outside of Italy because both the competitive situation is different and the potential growth area, where growth available is different in the different regions. And it is the different districts sometimes it's even more important. What we realized is that we are, let's say, quite good at pricing with the top rating companies and with the worst bottom rating companies. While there is quite a large amount of mid kind of rating companies where we tend to under price their loans.</p>
          <p>At the same time, what we're talking about is a change that can be significant in terms of our results, but is relatively non-meaningful in terms of effect on these customers' results, because given the level of margins and spreads today, even if we adapt a little bit more, the pricing and the spreads to the new ratings of some of these companies, we do not expect any real effect in terms of their solidity and their sustainability. So, for sure the big &#x2013; the strongest competitive pressure is on the very best ratings, and &#x2013; but there I believe we have already gone to the lowest possible levels in terms of margins and &#x2013; but where we expect to find room for improvement is in the mid area.</p>
          <p>As I said before in answering to a colleague of yours, the demand for good credit, and when I say good credit I mean export-related, production-related, is consolidating in a good part of the country. So we see &#x2013; we consider the business plan target, 4.5% on average, an achievable figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And as a very one last point, on deposits, we're hearing smaller banks effectively driving more of the competition for pricing, which is understandable given perhaps the tightness of their funding. What is your view there? What are the trends? How are you responding, if at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's a very different situations with &#x2013; in different situations. A lot of banks still behave in a very rational way, and even if we feel some pressure here and there, we do not think we will change our sensitivity estimate. You might remember then that we introduced a &#x20AC;100 million reduction in our sensitivity forecast, because of this pressure on deposit cost. As of today, it has not happened. And so that's the reason why we do not expect, we will have to change this forecast.</p>
          <p>When you look at the overall customer deposit volumes, the decrease you will see on that &#x2013; you probably have already seen in the report has to do not that much with commercial customers, but it's totally concentrated with international customers &#x2013; yes, institutional customers and that &#x2013; the amount that we have replaced with interbank deposits.</p>
          <p>Final answer, we are not using the price lever. And we believe it is in the interest of all the system not to do it. And for the time being we don't see any real reason for changing our policy.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question on net fees which were flattish in the first quarter and seems to me from your comment that also in the second quarter you will refrain from placing third-party bonds and so on. So I wonder if the <mark type="ph" /> ADRs (1:00:06) were they <mark type="ph" /> flattish here (1:00:09) in terms of net fees? Seems to you reasonable or too conservative, given that the first, at least the first semester will be flattish? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the time being, we do not expect any other effect beyond the third-party bonds, non-placement in this semester. So we expect actually the second quarter we might enjoy a much better performance in terms of investment banking fees. So that might compensate for the lack of third-party bonds placement. So as of today, we don't see any real structural change. And the targets we have in the business plan are, as far as we are concerned, confirmed.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I'm looking at slide number seven, and you said that you already completed the two-third of the maturities to be funded for the year and the totality of the wholesale maturities. So in that respect, I would like to ask you, if it is possible to quantify the impact on net interest income for the quarter from this funding that you've done? And also, I don't know if it is possible, but if it is possible to quantify the impact that you would have today? Because clearly funding spreads for you have strongly improved.</p>
          <p>The other question is related to something you said in the presentation, you mentioned the ambitions that you have to get back to earnings of about from &#x20AC;4 billion to &#x20AC;6 billion, which lead me to the business plan. Your best-case scenario, you're using a GDP growth of 0.8% over the next three years, which is below what we see from the IMF is 1.3%. It's also below what you will see from the Italian government in their budget, which is I think 1.4%.</p>
          <p>So the issue that I just wanted to ask is, it seems to me that really the base case according to normal economic forecasts is probably your improved scenario rather than your conservative economic scenario. And under your improved scenario your revenues are some 8% higher, but I guess you probably also have some positive impact in terms of cost of credit, if you are under the improved scenario. So I don't know if it is possible to answer this question, but it seems to me that probably your business plan target in terms of earnings could be at least 15% higher? I don't know if it makes sense, but I just wanted to ask you to see what is your comment on the earnings impact under the improved scenario? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood correctly your first question, the 20, 30 basis points we paid in the first &#x2013; in the last few months, before the right-issue <mark type="ph" /> fair (1:04:29) positive effect, obviously I already included in the business plan and have already been compensated by the new pricing we are enjoying. As you might remember in the business plan we decided to include the worst and the highest prices we paid.</p>
          <p>So as of today, we might consider a theoretical room for improvement in the round of 20 &#x2013; 20, 25 basis points all included at the end of the business plan. But we will have to see what happens. We are quite optimistic in this area of the management of the bank.</p>
          <p>As far as the base scenario and the improved scenario, we have made this calculation very clear also in the presentation of the business plan because the likelihood of the second scenario, the improved scenario are certainly not negligible. But our methodology is always to stay on the prudent side. So what you said is absolutely not impossible. But as of today, we stick to the base scenario. And we will have to see in the next quarters if a new one becomes the real one.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Pier Passerone from Intermonte. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one is on fees. Taking into account that you already made a material slice of your funding need for the year, is there a reason for not assuming fees from third-party product placement in the second half of the year? Because it seems to me that you sacrificed such an item in the first half of the year in order to make more funding which has already been achieved.</p>
          <p>Second question is a follow-up on the sensitivity. Maybe I'm missing some points, but if I understood properly you said that the sensitivity has increased from &#x20AC;150 million to &#x20AC;200 million based on an increase of 100 bips of interest rate on the back of a reduction in the hedging facility, by around &#x20AC;4 billion out of, roughly, &#x20AC;50 billion. Is that correct? Because if I understood properly it seems to me quite strange that the sensitivity has been increased so much based on only a marginal reduction of the overall hedging? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you're right. But I probably mis-described the phenomenon and then I will come back to that.</p>
          <p>As far as the fees trend, you are right. We are very, very well ahead in terms of placing our bonds both on the retail and on the wholesale market and that's why I said that the closing of the third-party bonds placement activity is only for the first two quarters. By the end of June we will decide whether or not there is room for some deals in that area also this year. But that &#x2013; it is something we will discuss together at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Sensitivity, now what I tried to say and probably I did not do it clearly enough is a different story. In the business plan in order to be as prudent as possible we said let's include all the negative effects that we can imagine and let's include a sensitivity reduced to 150 basis points. The two negative effects we included in the sensitivity were, on the one side, the very high cost of funding and, as I said before, we decided to use this top cost also for the rest of the business plan. Second, we decided to reduce the sensitivity by &#x20AC;100 million in order to take into account the pressure that we might have on the deposit cost side. As of today we have not yet gotten to the &#x20AC;150 million level. We are still well above &#x20AC;200 million and that means that we are not yet, and maybe we will never, but we are not yet suffering from those two negative effects I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>The other part of your question about the reduction in the total hedging facilities has nothing to do with it. We simply said that during the first quarter, given the trends in market yields, we decided that it was not in the interest of the bank to renew &#x20AC;4 billion worth of facilities that got to their maturity during the three months of the quarter. But these are two separate elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. If I can just follow up, what's your feeling, what do you think about foreign competitors? Did they become extremely aggressive since the beginning of the year based on say cheaper funding that they can achieve thanks to a lower account risk? Or you didn't see any material change in the habit of foreign competitors? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For sure, especially in the first months of the year, the pressure on spreads with large corporates coming from banks, international banks, who are benefiting from lower, country CDSs and then cost of funding was perceived and was perceivable. It was a period of time when in any case large corporates were very much in the position to source their funding directly on the market, and the reason why we have not suffered in a major way, vis-&#xE0;-vis other international banks is because most of our customers have been able to go directly on the market by issuing bonds where we played, obviously, an important role.</p>
          <p>Second part of the answer, after the right issue, you might have seen that our CDS has gone very close to the one of other banks, also belonging to countries with better CDSs than Italy. So the fact that our CDS has over performed, say the &#x2013; of our country CDS has put the bank in the position to be to a large extent competitive also with a number, not all of them, but a number of international banks very active in our country.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon Mr. Passera and colleagues. Many questions asked on NII, so I'm not going to repeat them. I'd just like to put together the pieces and also elaborate on one comment you made at the beginning of the presentation when you said the relationship between deposit and loans will become a very competitive advantage. So I just &#x2013; and then I'll ask you the question.</p>
          <p>So the question is we have on NII we have <mark type="ph" /> ureba (1:14:05) rates up by 41% year-to-date. We have a very prudent bank like you having done most of the funding for the year and sacrificing the fees on the bonds to do that. We have a re-pricing, which obviously you have tried to do. You're going to do a significant right issue, &#x20AC;5 billion, which means you'll have return on free funds. And the unwinding of the derivatives will contribute less positive but still positive to the NII. So I come to the question, and the question is, do you agree with my view, my impressions of a view that given a lot of the banking system, except the top six, top nine banks, being struggling still on liquidity, they haven't got the access that you do have, they haven't got &#x2013; obviously they will be squeezed out. When do you expect, and if do you expect a polarization between much stronger banks like you in the NII, especially after the right issue and the rest? Because it looks to me if you are growing loans at 4% let's say this year and you start to see all these positives kicking in we should start to see your NII growing, maybe if not Q2 significantly, but Q3, Q4 much more especially if you exploit the situation which your beginning of the presentation comment indicated to me at least that the deposit-to-loan relationship will be very important? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have a career in the investor relations business and I tend to agree and to appreciate the effective synthesis you have made about some of our competitive advantages. Having said that, we will have to see how the credit demand will be, because embedded in your question there is a sort of assumption of very high loan demand. That might be the case, but it's not yet in the figure of the market. So the polarization you are rightly mentioning as a possibility will be a function of how many banks will be strong enough to follow this demand and how strong will be the credit demand. So I would prepare to wait for the market to develop. Sooner or later it will happen. Will it happen this year? Who knows. Very, very, very difficult to say.</p>
          <p>The only point I want to add to the positive element that might make our interest income stronger during the second half of the year and in the following years, I would like to add the effort we are making in terms of training and in terms of pricing EVA pricing. I already mentioned it so I don't want to repeat myself, but if we put our 30,000 people in the position to better evaluate the EVA contribution of their pricing decision, the final effect can be a very significant one. But it's only to say that your diagnosis is very acceptable by us.</p>

          <p>Okay. So the key variable here for your earnings, at least over the next 12, 18 months is really volume growth, all other things being equal; I'm not talking about cost, asset quality, I'm talking about NII, so it's really volume.</p>

          <p>Now, let me say that the key lever we have whatever is the scenario is pricing, is EVA pricing for small, very small, small and medium-sized companies. That's lever number one. Second is certainly loan demand and then all the other things you mentioned. I would not underestimate the room for growth in asset management and in bank insurance. If we convince ourselves, if our 11 million customers convince themselves that the market is back to normality and that at least part of their asset under administration, &#x20AC;200 billion worth of money, can be at least partially switched back to asset under management products. These are the main levers for our revenues.</p>

          <p>Okay. Sorry, the very last question since I'm the last, do you see that a number of banks including Populaire who has been on the news for different reason and whose profitability <mark type="ph" /> stayed (1:19:36) very low, do you think that this will trigger more significant changes that ever happened so far from the regulators and the politicians to redesign this world? And if yes, do you think that Intesa might &#x2013; I know you're already very big in Italy so it's not really where you want to be &#x2013; but do you think that this could create some positive momentum for you if this happens? Thanks.</p>

          <p>I personally do not expect any real change in that part of the industry. I do not see any interest by us in that part of the industry. Certainly there are a number of banks that should need some strong interventions but that's none of my business.</p>
