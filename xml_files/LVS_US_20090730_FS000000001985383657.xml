          <p>Good afternoon, my name is Michael and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Leven, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Rob Goldstein, Executive Vice President and President of the Venetian Las Vegas and the Palazzo; and Ken Kay, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to remind you that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor Provisions of Federal Securities laws. I would also like to caution you that the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption "forward-looking statements" for a discussion of risks that my affect our results. In addition, we may discuss adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted property EBITDAR, which are non-GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>A definition and a reconciliation of each of those measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Adelson.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dan and thank you all for joining us today. I want to begin the call today by making a couple of interesting points, a couple of very important points. First of all, there is no doubt that the operating environment in both Las Vegas and Macao remains challenging. Our properties are holding up quite well. People are continuing to visit our properties in great numbers, and we are generating solid cash flow from a diverse set of revenue streams in both markets. The implementation of our cost-savings program has enabled us to significantly enhance cash flow generation, and has positioned us to deliver greater operating margins when the economy eventually recovers. As we have stated in the past, we are continuing to advance five or six different options to increase our liquidity. We look forward to updating you about this in the near future.</p>
          <p>And finally, the management team here is the right team to execute our plan. I'm extremely pleased that Rob has now formally extended his contract with us, and will be an important member of our management team in the years ahead. In addition, Mike is implementing additional leadership in Asia to add depth and strength to our management team there.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, and he'll tell you more.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sheldon, and thank you all for joining us today. Let me provide a quick update on the three principal components of our plan. First, to maximize cash flow from our current operating profits in Las Vegas and Macao by rightsizing our business, and implementing cost control and efficiency measures, we have now increased our cost saving initiatives to more than $500 million of annualized savings. This is $30 million more than we had previously targeted, and we will continue our efforts to identify additional opportunities to increase that $500 million number. As of June 30 we have successfully implemented approximately 69% of these identified costs, eliminating $345 million of cost from our running rate.</p>
          <p>Turning to the second element of our plan, the delivery of our Singapore and Bethlehem developments as scheduled, we were pleased to have successfully opened Sands Bethlehem on May 22, and to have turned the focus of our efforts to its building operating momentum at the property. At Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, construction, development, and pre-opening activities continue on pace and we are targeting an opening of the property in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The third component of our plan is to generate sufficient liquidity to enable us to execute our de-leveraging and growth strategies. As Sheldon mentioned a moment ago, we are advancing a number of opportunities that would generate additional liquidity. We are pursuing a diversity of options, and we look forward to updating you in the near future.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Rob, to provide an update on our Las Vegas operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Despite a difficult environment in the Las Vegas marketplace overall, our properties delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $78 million in the second quarter. We generated $107 million in adjusted property EBIDTAR in last year's second quarter. The primary driver of the reduced performance in Las Vegas was lower hotel revenues, which were down by nearly $30 million, principally as a result of lower ADR across our suite product due to competitive rate reductions in the higher segment of the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Visitation of both our Las Vegas properties remains healthy. Occupancy for our combined 7,100 rooms was 90% per quarter, with an ADR of $195. Our strategy to maximize cash flow in this environment remains the same, maintain high levels of occupancy at both hotels, fill as many rooms as possible with segments that are less rate-sensitive, such as group and corporate meeting business during the mid-week periods, and FIT business on weekends.</p>
          <p>Our table games business, and particularly our High-end Baccarat business, has held up well compared to the Las Vegas marketplace overall. Second quarter table drop was $386 million, compared to $408 million in the second quarter of last year; a decrease of approximately of 5.4%.</p>
          <p>Slot revenue was $48.2 million, a decrease of less than 4% compared to last year's second quarter. Despite the relative stability in our business overall, we remain cognizant of the challenging operating environment, particularly with respect to room revenues. We are thus continuing to reduce our costs, and right-size our Las Vegas operations and have eliminated approximately $135 million from our run rate as of June 30, with the implementation of our cost savings programs.</p>
          <p>Although we are making cost cuts which principally involve back of the house functions, we continue to strive to provide a five star, five diamond experience for our guests. Customer service excellence remains at the center of our culture; it is what we do, and what we stand for. We believe these cost initiatives have been implemented with no degradation of the customer experience. We expect to have fully implemented approximately $200 million in annualized cost savings across our Las Vegas operations by end of this year. We will continue to seek additional opportunities to reduce our costs, but will maintain our philosophy of maintaining our award-winning customer service.</p>
          <p>So in summary, people are still visiting our Las Vegas properties in large numbers, for both leisure and business purposes, but they are spending less once they arrive, particularly on rooms and other non-gaming activities. In this environment, we believe our all-suite asset base, with its luxury, yet approachable appeal, diverse dining, retail and entertainment offerings that appeal to a wide range of customers, consumer tastes and budgets will continue to generate solid cash flow. As our cost savings programs are fully implemented, our properties will be positioned to perform well when the environment turns in the future.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back over to Mike, and look forward to addressing your questions after the completion of the prepared remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Macao, and start with the Venetian Macao, which generated approximately $110 million of adjusted property EBITDAR for the second quarter of 2009. The property generated a record $140 million in EBITDAR in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter, compared to last year, was negatively impacted by $10 million due to the impact of entertainment losses related to the Cirque du Soleil production, and the write-off during the quarter of certain retail receivables.</p>
          <p>Visits to the property have remained very strong, with the Venetian Macao enjoying more than four &#x2013; 5.4 million visits during the second quarter. That visitation drove healthy mass play and hotel occupancy for the quarter, while rolling play has also remained solid. Our CotaiJet ferry service carried nearly one million passengers in the second quarter, while our Convention and Group business accounted for approximately 13% of our room nights sold.</p>
          <p>The three-pronged strategy for the Venetian Macao will continue throughout 2009, with the first initiative, the rightsizing of our business, and the full implementation of our cost savings program as well as other efficiency initiatives, front and center. We have now expanded that program to target at least $300 million in annualized cost savings across our Macao operations. The program is designed to reduce our operating costs while preserving as many Macanese local jobs as possible, and maintaining a high quality customer experience for our guests.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, 2009 we have implemented approximately 70% of our targeted savings. That adds up to $210 million from our annual run rate. The impact of the cost savings will become more pronounced in the coming quarters, as the savings from recently enacted cost reductions are realized, and as we continue to execute on additional initiatives.</p>
          <p>Other important areas of the cost reduction program include transportation, utilities and general hotel operating costs. Although we have accomplished a great deal, our work will continue on pace, and we will update you on our progress as the year continues.</p>
          <p>The second strategy is to grow our mass table and slot business. Our CotaiJet ferry service remains an important infrastructure component in support of visitation to the Cotai Strip and the Venetian Macao. We expect the eventual ramp up of City of Dreams complex to add further critical mass to the Cotai Strip, increasing our ferry occupancy over time, which may have been impacted in the quarter by the effect of the H1N1 virus, and ultimately to increase visitation to the Venetian Macao.</p>
          <p>The promotional offerings of the CotaiJet are being targeted to casino customers, and the service continues to drive traffic to the property. The direct service to Cotai Strip is an important contributor to strong slot play for the quarter, which was up nearly 20% compared to the second quarter of 2008, and to healthy non-rolling chip table games played.</p>
          <p>The third initiative is to manage our VIP business. The Venetian Macao's rolling ship volume of 9.8 billion during the second quarter was consistent with the second quarter of last year, and up over 13% sequentially from the first quarter of 2009. VIP revenues in the market overall for the quarter were down 19%, so we are pleased with the Venetian Macao's relative performance.</p>
          <p>While the VIP business remains an important part of our business, it contributes less than 12% of our adjusted property EBITDAR for the Venetian Macao. Although that figure was impacted by lower hold this year, compared to last year. That 12% compares to approximately 25% during the second quarter of 2008, and illustrates the increasingly diversified nature of our cash flows, with over 30% coming from non-gaming sources, principally hotel rooms, entertainment and retail, and nearly 60% coming from mass gaming play and slots in the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our principle objectives for the VIP rolling business remain the careful management of the business and the control of credit risk, while we focus on the development of more profitable direct play. During the second quarter, our non-junket VIP play at the Venetian Macao represented 16% of our total rolling volume, compared to 13% in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>So in summary, these three strategies have contributed to a solid performance for the Venetian Macao during the quarter. The full implementation of our cost savings program will contribute additional EBITDAR in the coming quarters. Let me spend a moment on the Sands Macao</p>
          <p>The Sands delivered $61 million in adjusted-profit EBITDAR for the quarter, compared to $54 million in the second quarter last year. The results reflected healthy mass gaming volumes and expanding EBITDAR margins on a smaller revenue base. The cost savings initiatives we have implemented at the property to date are positively impacting both The Sands EBITDAR margins and its financial performance. The Sands remains a leader in mass play on the Macao Peninsula, delivering non-rolling drop, greater than $595 million, and nearly $300 million in slot handle. Rolling volume of $4.7 billion was down compared to the quarter one year ago. We will continue to implement additional savings and other efficiency measures to further reduce The Sands cost structure.</p>
          <p>Now a comment on The Four Seasons Hotel. The property generated nearly $6 million in adjusted property EBITDAR during the second quarter. Although we have experienced a slower ramp-up of the property than we'd planned, awareness of the property is growing, with weekend play and visitation in particular gaining momentum. The Four Seasons Hotel reached 44.5% occupancy with an ADR of $291.00 for the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we hope to benefit from both the launch of new marketing programs at the property, and the natural increase in visitation to Cotai as our neighbor, the City of Dreams, continues to mature. We should also benefit from the recent addition of our 19 luxurious Paiza mansions, which have been full since they have opened. These exclusive suites, among the most luxurious in our portfolio, are being marketed directly to VIP customers residing throughout the region.</p>
          <p>So that covers our Macao operations. Let's spend another moment on Sands Bethlehem in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The property opened on May 22, and has received a wonderful reception from the City of Bethlehem, the people of the Lehigh Valley, and the wider region. Visitation to the property, particularly on weekends, has been very healthy. We expect to increase visitation and play at the property as our player development, promotion and busing programs mature in the months ahead, particularly in the mid-week business situation.</p>
          <p>Turning to our development activities at Marina Bay Sands at Singapore, construction, development and pre-opening activities continue on pace, and we continue to target a first quarter 2010 opening. We are working closely with the Singapore Tourism Board, and we will continue to do so throughout the summer and fall, as we collaboratively work to finalize our opening business.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Ken to provide an update on our liquidity initiatives and capital resources overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. As Mike mentioned previously, advancing opportunities that will generate liquidity, enhance our credit position, and enable us to execute our de-leveraging strategy is an important aspect of our plan. We are advancing a number of options to do just that, which may include the sale of a minority equity interest in our Macao operation, and we look forward to providing you with an update of our progress on these opportunities in the near future as they come to fruition.</p>
          <p>With respect to our $500 million of cost savings, we have achieved approximately $345 million in total cost savings across Las Vegas and Macao. Of the $70 million in savings realized in the second quarter of 2009, approximately $35 million was realized in Las Vegas, and approximately $35 million was realized across our Macao operation.</p>
          <p>An important point with all these cost savings measures, is that we view them as permanent. We expect to realize significantly improved EBITDAR margins as revenues expand.</p>
          <p>Turning to liquidity and capital resources, as of June 30 we have approximately $2.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the balance sheet. In addition we have approximately $1.3 billion of availability under our undrawn credit facilities at current exchange rates principally through our Singapore credit facility. So together we have approximately $4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and available sources of liquidity. The uses for that $4 billion includes approximately $2 billion of capital expenditures for the opening of Singapore. Total debt is $10.8 billion, of which no significant maturities occur until May of 2011, when approximately $570 million related to our Macao revolver comes due, and then in May 2012 when our U.S. revolver is due. Scheduled principal payments required for the remainder of 2009 and in 2010 total $63.3 million and $198.8 million respectively.</p>
          <p>In addition to not having near term maturities on our outstanding debt, the cost of borrowing is quite low, with a current weighted average rate of approximately 2.97%, which reflects a healthy reduction from the weighted average second quarter rate of 5.6% in 2008.</p>
          <p>With respect to our debt covenants, for our domestic credit facility our trailing twelve month EBITDAR at June 30, 2009, for compliance purposes was $452 million. At June 30, 2009, our total gross domestic debt for compliance purposes was $5.2 billion, our cash balances within the U.S. restricted group were $2.2 billion, and our calculated net debt for covenant compliance purposes was $3.1 billion. Our leverage ratio for covenant compliance purposes was 6.76 times compared to a maximum leverage covenant for our U.S. credit facility of seven times.</p>
          <p>For the Venetian Macao restricted group, our trailing 12-month EBITDAR at June 30, 2009 for compliance purposes was $827 million. At June 30, 2009, the Venetian Macao restricted group total gross debt for compliance purposes was $3.17 billion. Our leverage ratio for covenant compliance purposes was 3.83 times, compared to a maximum leverage covenant in the Venetian Macao restricted group of four times. Our cash balances within the Venetian Macao restricted group were $473 million.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sheldon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ken. Before we go into the Q&amp;A, let me make a couple of final points. First, we are singularly focused on the execution of our plan, and that plan is quite straightforward.  To maximize cash flow from current operations, open Singapore, and generate additional liquidity to enhance our credit position and our balance sheet. We're executing on these things, and have complete confidence we'll complete them. From there, we will be very well-positioned to resume our industry leading growth trajectory.</p>
          <p>We possess very high quality assets and differentiated operating strategies in each of our markets. Our assets have broad appeal across diverse customer segments, and our highly profitable mass business in Macao positions us quite well. And our Singapore property, an asset with the potential to generate the strongest growth in our entire portfolio, is targeted to open approximately six months from today.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to make another point that seems to get lost in the shuffle of figures, and that is our original business plan. Our original business model was to build core and non-core assets, sell off the non-core assets at the right time, and pay down or pay off all of the financing related to building the core assets. So when we talk about owing $10 billion plus, first of all we break it up into three groups. About a third of it &#x2013; a little under a third, in Singapore, it's totally reliant upon the Singapore asset, that is its primary collateral, and we feel quite good about Singapore. The leasing activity in the recent past has really undergone a thrust in demand, so the activity and the GDP in Singapore is improving quickly.</p>
          <p>So we expect overall that our original business plan will be amply executed in Singapore by selling the cash flow of the retail mall in Singapore and either substantially reduce or eliminate the total debt to build Singapore.</p>
          <p>In the case of Macao, the cash flow in the sale, of course we have to wait until the commercial property market improves, but it's going better in Asia than it is in the United States, and we expect it to &#x2013; when everybody reasonably expects it to get back to normal.</p>
          <p>When it gets back to normal, we will consider selling our retail, if we can get the exaggerated price we're looking for. And we do intend to start selling the Four Seasons Apartments, serviced apartments as condominiums, hopefully by the end of this year, and I was in China this past weekend on Sunday night, and the South China Morning Post saying that there was becoming a shortage of apartments in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>So people are opening up their &#x2013; they're picking up their mattresses, taking their money out and they're starting to buy apartments and they made reference to old style of Hong Kong apartment sales that several projects have sold out within two or three days of their being exposed to the market. So we do expect a very good response on the Four Seasons Apartments.</p>
          <p>In Las Vegas, as the market returns to normal, and your guess is as good as ours, but things appear to be appearing more normal in today's &#x2013; currently than it has been over the last six to 12 months. Then we will be able to hopefully restart our condominium project, the St. Regis project for condos, and then substantially reduce our debt in the Las Vegas market, plus upstreaming money from Macao and Singapore.</p>
          <p>What I want to say is that, our business plan &#x2013; our business model is just completely different from other business models. Other business models rely upon paying off the debt to build the properties to only two operations. So we're not looking to only two operations to pay off our debt. We're looking to our very unique fundamental business plan, by selling off our retail and our apartments, and reducing or eliminating all of our debt.</p>
          <p>So we don't feel as uncomfortable as just a superficial look might encourage some people to look, where they would say, "Hey, they've got a lot of debt, and how are they going to pay that off quickly from operations?" Well, we have the non-core assets that we build to make a substantial dent in those debt numbers. So with that now, I think it's time to move to Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I have a couple of follow-up questions on the second quarter results, and then I'll, if I could ask some big picture strategy questions of you, Sheldon and Ken on liquidity. The 10 million write off that you refer in the press release, Mike, I believe you said that was in the 110 million of adjusted EBITDAR in the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yeah, it's probably in the, I would say &#x2013; well, there's two ways to answer that question. In an environment in which we're also including cost avoidance, meaning limiting salary increases and not paying bonuses, it's probably in the, I want to say about the $20 million range. Obviously, when business conditions improve, and then you'd expect bonus compensation or incentive compensation to come back. The number's a little bit higher than that. For the time being, it's probably around about $20 million a quarter.</p>

          <p>Great. And then, Ken and Sheldon, what's sort of the time table for you that you think you can come through and figure out a liquidity situation before the Venetian Macao covenants start to put a noose around your neck?

          <p>In terms of doing an IPO in Hong Kong. I mean, if you were to &#x2013; had everything set like I think you guys are, what is the earliest that you guys could do it, assuming the market is receptive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great fishing expedition, Joe. I'll just repeat. We have not finally decided &#x2013; when we finally decide what route we're going to take, we will announce it. Until we do announce it, no final decision, and none of the five or six approaches that we're taking are decided upon. We may do, we may take two or three steps of the five or six that we're considering.</p>
          <p>I know there's been a lot of publicity about &#x2013; since Wynn filed his IPO in Hong Kong, it's been almost a given that we're going to follow on. So I would just like to caution that that final decision is not yet made. We are still talking to all the people with whom we've spoken before; we're talking to construction companies about putting money up for five and six. So I think that the decision as to what route to take, hopefully we'll make it within the next month &#x2013; within the next 30 days, and start to implement those decisions before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We are anxiously looking forward to starting lots five and six, and have a reasonable feeling that we'll be able to get the financing to do that, and we'll announce if and when we're going to do an IPO. Otherwise if and when we're going to do private equity or any other form of financing. But I can tell you this: negotiations and discussions are going on virtually every single day and so &#x2013; but there's no final decision yet. The opportunities become more plentiful and more palatable as each day goes by. I wish we had a year or so to wait, but we shouldn't do that. We should &#x2013; we'll get money and improve our liquidity position as soon as we can.</p>

          <p>The next question will come from Janet Brashear with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; Sheldon Adelson: Hi, Janet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you? Thanks. First question if I could ask this without incurring Sheldon's wrath. I'm curious about City of Dreams; it appears that it posted some significant share gains in July. I'm curious as to whether you would characterize those as market expansion or share shift, and if it's share shift, who's losing to them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I could tell you that we have, the fellow who runs all of Macao was just here for Board meeting presentations that have occurred over the last couple of days, and he said we put up a camera to watch the traffic going across the street. And he said, for every one person that goes from our property to their property, two people come back. Now, you have these, we just don't have somebody there with a clicker. We have these, I don't know, these high-tech gadgets that count people as they walk in, and that's how we get counts.</p>
          <p>You won't incur my wrath, Janet, you were absolutely positive in your prior report that the City of Dreams was going to cannibalize us. The fact of the matter is that our attendance is going up. And I'm very happy to say that because the traffic had, I think, to all of Macao had sunk a little bit because of the H1N1, or let's call it the swine flu, scares. We think that's abating now and that there are more people coming. And I think we're back to &#x2013; for instance over the past weekend on one day we had 94,000 people at the Venetian Macao, and the next day we had 98,000. And a normal high-demand peak period for a weekend would be, give or take, 100,000 for each of the weekend days.</p>
          <p>So the City of Dreams is contributing to the solidity of the Cotai Strip location. And we feel quite comfortable, so we're going to allow them to connect to our overpass walkway, raised pedestrian walkways, to go over the main street. So we're not concerned about them taking traffic from us, we know that our properties will be the must-see properties. And whatever people they get that go to the, that come to Cotai to go to the City of Dreams will also go to our properties. The Venetian, the Four Seasons, and when we open five and six which we hope to do within a year from the time we started. We'll be the major beneficiaries of the cross-traffic.</p>

          <p>Can I ask about the Sands on the peninsula? All of the revenue components are down, and yet your EBITDAR margin is up an impressive six points, and your EBITDAR is up 13%. How do you do that?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the Sands situation has been, some of the planning on how we're working the floor, and also some cost reductions that have gone in and have been implemented in the Sands that have produced better EBITDAR. Also a significant degree of mass market gaming which &#x2013; it's highly profitable on a margin basis. So that's why you're seeing I think the margins are so much better. And they are continuing, as well.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks for that. Sheldon, as you meet with the casino associations, it's been reported that some of the topics were tax rates and junket commissions. Are there other issues at the forefront of those discussions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I wasn't at the last meeting. Steven was. I was there a couple of meetings ago, and we all signed a document at the time saying that we all agreed to put a cap on the junket rate commission. But in the interim we've agreed with City of Dreams, and we're both holding. And we're staying at 1.25 including comps. There, to the best of my recollection there was no material, there was no discussion of any other material issue. I brought up discussion about the, getting better handling at the airport and talked about the other issues about the light rail and adding onto the, and accelerating the completion of the Taipan Ferry Terminal where we bring our ferries into. But there was no substantial discussion of any other materials.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We've been refiguring for the last three four quarters to reflect less poker play and our goal is to &#x2013; as you see by the numbers, our hold percentage is increasing, our handle is off, but that's calculated in our thought process. Because we just don't see the value on all the poker play we've taken previously and we still drove &#x2013; I think good results in this market, we're down very little compared to the market, very pleased with it. And it's our belief the poker business gets tougher and tougher, and so we're deemphasizing. We still have poker play available, but some of the team play and some of the tougher customers we've passed on, and we've just gone for better margin and better results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. So how should we think about slots going forward? I mean, are the volume numbers you've posted this quarter indicative of what we might expect in the going quarter &#x2013; in the coming quarters or was there some degree of disruption in there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll continue to, we're hoping to be flat or improve last year's results of the third quarter. One thing that's happening in the slots side of our business is that we're giving more rooms away, we never did in the past, complimentary rooms to the slot segment. We're able to do that because of &#x2013; it's available to us, obviously occupancies are off a bit. But we're &#x2013; if there's one part of our business I feel good about, it's our slot business. We grew our numbers versus our competitors. I'm very pleased, and I think we'll continue just to move upward. We just want to manage the costs, because our goal at the end of the day is to make money, not just drive revenue.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, couple questions. First Mike, could you just talk a little bit about the expense reduction program and I guess I would &#x2013; what I'd say is that the company LVS has always been very return-focused and pretty tight-fisted. So to find $500 million in expenses is impressive and I just want to know the strategy of how you're doing that, and how it's not impacting the consumer in any significant way. And then Rob, maybe you could just talk about the convention calendar over the next 12 months and also what your plans are to react to the City Center opening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve the answer to the &#x2013; thank you. The answer to the first part of that first question regarding the millions of dollars that we have found, first of all let me say that the previous management before I got here had identified a significant amount of that. We just went into a different situation starting around the beginning of April of finding more. That's split about, roughly $200 million in Las Vegas, $300 million in Macao.</p>
          <p>We track very, very consistently guest satisfaction, customer complaints and what have you, and we have seen absolutely no increase in customer objections or problems with what we've done. We have carefully gone through every potential savings situation in order to identify those non-customer related activities. Some are what we call soft costs. Advertising, marketing expenses, things of that kind. And some are high cost, which represent payroll activities and payroll situations, changing where we do business, and the cost of call centers and things of that kind that represent savings that don't affect the customer whatsoever.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the number sounds very, very large. But one has to recognize that these operations are enormous in size. When you're dealing with 7,100 suites in Las Vegas, or 3,600 or 3,500 suites between the Sands and the Venetian Macao, the numbers of employees, the numbers of transactions, the numbers of activities are gargantuan in size. So we've been able to very carefully find ways to do business differently and to achieve those numbers.</p>
          <p>We're very, very aware of the fact that we can't absorb customer complaints, and we monitor them. But I would say we've done a really good job. We've seen nothing that indicates that we've gone too far. And frankly, I think we're pretty close to the end of what we're doing in that particular situation, with our identification. We'll find some more stuff around the edges because you always do, but we're watching it every day to make sure that we don't go too far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, as to the group side of the business, there's demand. The demand is certainly there, it's returning, it's getting better for both the balance of this year and then '10, '11. The issue is going to be rate, because obviously, we'd love to go back to running 45% of our mix being group driven, if it enables us maybe to fill, and fill it, and ADRs and the bank revenues with it.</p>
          <p>I don't think we're going to get there because of the rate issue. We can fill the hotel, and get the 40, 45% again, but we're not seeing the rates we're used to. So we're holding back a bit, trying to be more judicious and look at other segments including wholesale. We can't tell until we see rates return to a place we're comfortable with it.</p>
          <p>That being said, the July bookings this year, have really increased, and for '11 we're happy with what we're seeing. Demand patterns are strong. It's simply competitive pressures on the rate that has us concerned. And we believe we'll come back. But it'd be wrong to say that it's back to levels we'd like to see it at. And again it's a function of rate, not a function of demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, this is Sheldon, hi, Steve. I think that, and knowing the convention market like I do, I think that what we're seeing is people are seeing rates that hotels are willing to sell at today to different groups. And they think that that'll last forever. But we're not succumbing to those low-ball rates and low-ball offers, because as the market gets back to normal, and we're seeing it move faster back to normal. As Rob just said, we've had a very good selling July, I mean to sell for future months. I think that as people understand that we expect the market to go back to normal, the room rates will go back to normal. We've just got to hold in tight and not cave into the low-rate mentality that the show organizers, show producers want us to cave into. Listen, we can't be as strong as we were in the past. We'll have to take a little bit of time to ramp up to get back to normal.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask Rob about the Palazzo and Venetian hold percentages. Noticed that there was a big difference between the win per table at the Palazzo versus the Venetian, that would indicate to me that the Venetian had a very low hold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'd be correct to assume that. But again, look, it swings dramatically. Same thing's happening this month. It just swings dramatically. And some months we play lucky one place versus the other. Look, there's two types of business on the Table Games side. There's the mass table, and there's the high-end. On the high-end side, we do have on the high-end side a lot of volatility. This month we've had extraordinary months of high-end play in the Palazzo. And it depends where it's at. You can almost assume that our mass play table will come in at 15, 16, 17. And at the end of the day our high-end play will come in in the high 20s. I mean we've handled over $10 billion in Las Vegas since we opened the Venetian, and the truth is, we always held in the high 20s, 28, 29, 30, and in the end, that's where we'll be at. But you'll have volatility, and we kind of expect that. It's not surprising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And why are there so many more tables at the Palazzo? And more important than that, the trend sequentially, you added tables at Palazzo in the second quarter, and dropped the Venetian by about 15 tables.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're moving &#x2013; we're conscious of our mix. We're not looking at this building anymore as a Venetian versus Palazzo or vice versa, we're looking at it as what's the right mix of tables and slots on both sides. You can see we've downsized our slot floor dramatically from the opening of Palazzo. We keep looking at what we need to have on the floor. As you know, in Las Vegas, the capacity issues, I think in every hotel in this town, there's probably too many slot machines relative to demand. And I think the table games we're trying to right size it there as well, looking at staffing where demand's at.</p>
          <p>But at the end of the day, we're going to have enough tables and slots to satisfy the busiest weekend, the busiest night. We're just trying to staff intelligently, and honestly, buying slot machines these days, it's obviously expensive if we don't have the right mix, but there's no magic to it. We treat it as one large gaming floor. We look at demand patterns. Look at the traffic. We're constantly looking at our cost side. And frankly, it's just simply a day in day out exercise, of trying to right-size the tables and slots.</p>
          <p>But getting back to your earlier question about volatility. Volatility is what it is. And you're going to have nights where you're going to win money at table games, especially off the high-end baccarat play where they're betting a lot of money, and you have nights where you're going to lose a lot of money. But I don't think there's any magic to it. It doesn't matter if the Venetian flops, in the end, it's the same building to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you had mentioned that, I think in the Group business, that when things are good, you get about 45% of your rooms from Group. What has it been the last six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've dipped down in the first quarter, or for the year, we've dipped down below 25%. And again, the interesting part of the equation is that demand is there. There's demand coming back online from especially the pharmaceuticals, the fast food. We're not seeing a return in the financials, obviously, or the automotive, but there's demand on the Group side, and it continues to get stronger.</p>
          <p>The problem we're having is rate pressure. So in a perfect world, back in 2007, 2008 until the third quarter, we ran 44% occupancy of our total mix was, was Group. And we're now dipping down below 25%, which is not where we want to be at. But again, we are not going to take rates that are simply silly relative to the values we can achieve in the wholesale FIT market. We'll move more into casino free comped rooms with slots...</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, can you give an indication of what the Palazzo's contribution &#x2013; EBITDA contribution was under that 78? Usually each quarter you sort of break out the two properties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't that handy, that cumulative, if you hang on one second we can dig that out for you. We didn't break it out, so you can just go to our numbers and pull it out. One second. Ken do you have it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While he's looking for that, I want to expand on the answer that I gave before about the liquidity. So I want to emphasize that there is no question whatsoever that in the near future we're going to have a decision on which is the best opportunity for us to create the liquidity that we'd like to have. So there's not a question of if, it's only a question of when, and what are the most favorable terms for us. So when we come out with the answer it'll be an answer that'll be the best answer available in the market today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question of Palazzo contribution, it's actually $45 million EBITDAR for the quarter, up from 34 7 Q2 of 2008, and the leading factor there would be our ADR climbed to 207. The Palazzo is getting stronger every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It seems like the Palazzo is becoming the place of choice. If the handle is higher, you got more tables, your room rates are higher, it has to have to do with the location closer to the higher end properties than the Venetian next to the Harrah's property?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the Venetian is a ten year old product; the Palazzo is newer and fresher. The room product in the Venetian is extraordinary, as good as the room product. We spent $100 million to make the room product in the Venetian compete. We're working on looking at the casino floor, but you're right, the Palazzo has become a very successful product, and it's sandwiched between Wynn and Venetian, it's got great cross traffic from Mirage TI but we always knew Palazzo would get there, and it's gotten there. It's arrived.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The original plan for the Palazzo was to create a property that appeals to different tastes, and not just to duplicate taste of people who like the Venetian. And since it's newer and it took a lot longer to get it open from the &#x2013; compared to the &#x2013; relative to the time we first opened the Venetian, so obviously we got a higher rate out of that, because it's newer and people expect to pay higher rate. So it's really accomplishing the basic purpose for which we established it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, you save the best for last. A couple of things here; one, the commission cap agreement among the various operators. Sheldon, is there a method set up for enforcing that? And how do you expect it'll affect your bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it affects the bottom line &#x2013; Ken, can you give us an estimate of how the commission affects our bottom line?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, it should be an improvement that's probably north of about 30 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the first half of the question, Larry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Whether there's enforcement for that since in Macao not everybody follows the rules it seems like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that's a good question. There has been no, when I was there, I committed to do it on the honor system, the breach of which will be reason to beat people up with a wet spaghetti noodle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just don't know how it's going to be. Well according to quote Fernando Chui, head of the Economic and Finance Ministry, said that there will be, they will suggest that a half-a-million-dollar per occurrence, breach of the regulation, because this will not be just an agreement amongst the operators, it will be embedded in the law. So there's been no final agreement on it. The most that I've heard is the possibility of that half-a-million-dollar penalty. But who knows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then as far as the new administrator coming in, Sheldon, what are your expectations hopefully?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the new chief executive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Fernando Chui, we visited. I don't have a lot of experience with him but the experience we do have with him is very positive. He's a very bright guy; he earned a PhD in the U.S. and he is a very, very bright person, very, he's not going to be a bull in a china shop, or at least that's what the press says. He's going to continue a lot of the same policies, but then change some of them.</p>
          <p>The one thing that Edmund Ho was quick to point out, that he won't open the door on the question of reducing taxation. What I want to point out there is the taxation is 35%. And that's what they think of it. We think of it as 40 because there's a 4% additional tax, but it goes to the Macao foundation. They don't call that a tax, they call that a contribution. That can be easily removed by just a dictate from the chief executive. He doesn't have to go to the legislative council for that like you would have to go to reduce anything from the 35. So we round it out at 40% because there is small taxes on the per machine, per table that probably equal 1% of the roll.</p>
          <p>Actually what we're looking at is number one, he's stated repeatedly that tax reduction is on the front burner. And even Stanley Ho was talking about tax reduction at the Gaming Association Meeting to compete with Taiwan, to compete with Singapore and the Philippines. So it appears as though there's a lot of momentum in favor of a tax reduction. Did I answer the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as far as Pennsylvania tables timing? I know the government made some comments when you opened. What are your hopes for that? And what kind of upside could you see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My last memo from our government affairs guys, came out two days ago, said that it appears pretty likely that it will pass before the end of the summer. And that, I remember when I was there for the opening the head of the Gaming Commission said it'll take like nine months to implement the rules. That will be a big game changer for Bethlehem. It will be the closest casino, full casino to New York City.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So they said, they said it's likely to pass by the end of the summer. And if it doesn't, it will pass for sure in the fall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question, General Growth, what's the final result on that? Did you guys end up getting the mall back? What exactly happened there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well General Growth, that's a misnomer right now. It's General Shrink. We, discussions and positioning is still occurring. We don't know, we don't know what we're going to be able to look for us there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks gentlemen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our final question will come from Rachael Rothman with Wedbush Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add on to what I said before, our general counsel tells me that General Growth is in bankruptcy. So it's up to the bankruptcy court.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Rachael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just had a bigger picture question on Las Vegas, if I could, specifically, I guess on room rates and RevPAR and occupancy. Looking kind of out to 2010, as we think about the three buckets of your business, the leisure traveler, gambler and then the convention or association business, and then the individual or FIT business, I guess you guys have cut rate enough to sustain occupancy. But historically, it's been pretty hard to drive rate on leisure guests, and conventions and associations and FIT being a late cycle play, how should we think about rate improvement? And then, as we look at the cost containment, with the costs already having been taken out of the business, will any further rate declines &#x2013; how should we think about the flow-through from RevPAR to EBITDA kind of in years two and three of the downturn? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a tough question to answer, but what I want to point out to you is that our property is substantially differentiated from other properties. We're not just a hotel. We're an all suite hotel that has amenities with an integrated resort that other properties don't have. So first, since we have like many hundreds of thousands of square feet of shopping, where other hotels have either none or small amounts. The only property that connects with a &#x2013; there are two other properties that connect with large shopping malls, that's Caesar's Palace connected to The Forum, and the Dessert Passage that connects to the Planet Hollywood, or that surrounds the casino at Planet Hollywood.</p>
          <p>So, we have four showrooms here, and most other hotels, however, have only one. We're a different value proposition. So, when people look at paying &#x2013; we think we can get away with something, 50 to $75 more than what just a plain hotel room can get. So, not all hotels, not all Vegas properties are created equal. We think we're created a little more equal than others, and our ability to get back to normalized ADR is probably better and faster than our competitors. Of course, Bellagio and Wynn still have a very, very high level of appreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll continue a balance of the segments you referenced, and obviously we got to look &#x2013; your point about the booking timing is an issue for us. We can fill the hotel if we want to, going into '10 or '11 to do so, but the rates aren't favorable. We'll watch the rates in all segments and play to them.</p>
          <p>The one thing we are doing now is moving more into leisure FIT, the expansive casino, because we think there's an upside there for us. It's better to have a, more of a balance towards those two segments, but when the rates return in the Group market, that'd be our first choice because of the mid-week booking and also because of the banquet, but we're watching all of them closely. We believe rates will move up this fall, and as everyone realizes, Las Vegas is too discounted, it's too cheap, and the products are too good to be selling at these rates. I think hopefully post-labor day, we'll see a return to a better place in the rate issues in those segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess on the margin flow-through, if we could just use an analogy from the hotel industry, yourself being from the hotel industry, looking at the progression coming out of the 2001 recession and September 11. By 2003, RevPAR declines had moderated, if I recall correctly. Maybe they were just down 0.5%, but EBITDA margins in the industry overall fell 300 basis points as the flow-through was pretty severe, most of the low-hanging fruit out of the cost structure had already been taken. So how should we think about the potential relationship between RevPAR to EBITDA margin flow-through, as we enter years two and three of the downturn here, without material rate uptick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have a lot of upside in this company, because we have great size of building. I think every dollar that hits as the ADRs decline, it should go through pretty healthy. We have a structure that 20 or $30 increase in ADR would be very impactful for us, and I think 90 plus percent would flow through to the EBITDAR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, having been through those years and seeing what's happened, what you've seen in the hotel industry and the hospitality industry as you look at it on a non-casino basis over those cycles, and actually since 1990, what happened in the business over the last four or five years is that room rate had dramatic increases all over the place, and now what you're seeing is it coming back, but it will never go back to where it originally started from.</p>
          <p>It generally comes back and then goes forward. It's sort of two steps forward and one step back kind of situation. What you see is rightsizing going on in a lot of situations, but some are not as pliable as we are here to really gain the maximum advantage. Because we have so many rooms and so much demand, it simply, we think any problem is more psychological than it is actual, and basically, just a couple of weekends ago, we had a $241 weekend rate here, and so that's available to us, and at these costs of operations, the flow-through is positively astronomical.</p>
          <p>I mean you're going to get almost $0.90, or $0.90 on the dollar is going to come right through to the bottom line at the EBITDAR level. It flows really right through, so I think that's really our hope is that we're very well-positioned to be able to take advantage of any kind of improvement in the marketplace, some of which is created by the market and some of which is created by the operators themselves who are willing to take the risks and go higher. And we're already implementing some of those strategies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12">
        <plist>
          <p>Closing remarks. I just want to go back to what I said earlier about the liquidity issue. This is something that's first priority on my mind, on our minds, and we expect to have an announcement about that in the near future. But it's a, I forget the expression, but it's a something of plenty. We have five or six different opportunities to mix and match certain opportunities that are out there. For instance, to have partners what to have, construction companies front money for lots five and six. We were talking to two companies. We're still talking to both, although one of them is getting very close.</p>
          <p>There's a possibility that a new market has opened up, and the possibility of selling bonds, which was not on our schedule before, has popped up. There's the possibility of private equity and of course, there's a possibility of doing an IPO that also comes along with something that we're not used to here in the states, and that's called pre-IPO financing. And in some cases, some of the IPOs in Hong Kong sell pre-IPO financing for very significant amount, percentages of what they anticipate for an IPO. So there's also financing for lots five and six. And there's not one of these issues that are turning more solid, and they are turning more positive.</p>
          <p>Each one of these issues are turning more positive. The terms are looking better as each day goes by. So we don't want to make a final decision until we feel that we're at a plateau of improvement in the deal. So we're focusing on, we're going to have &#x2013; we'll have the liquidity. We do have liquidity now, and we'll have even much more liquidity later, and we hope to restart a couple of the projects, so maybe all of them that we stopped in the not too distant future, for which we'll have adequate financing. So I want to thank all of you for being part of this call, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.</p>
