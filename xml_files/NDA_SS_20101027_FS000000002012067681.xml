          <p>Good day, and welcome to the Nordea Third Quarter Report 2010 International Telephone Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and welcome to this international telephone conference, where we will present the third quarter results. With us today, we have Group CEO and President, Mr. Christian Clausen; we have CRO, Mr. Ari Kaperi; CFO, Mr. Fredrik Rystedt; and Senior IR Officer, Ms. Andreas Larsson. We will start with the presentation, and then we will open up to Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So please Mr. Clausen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will give a few introductory remarks, and then Fredrik Rystedt will continue presenting the financials and I will come back later. But I'll start with the slides you have in front of you probably and say that it is indeed a strong quarter with record earnings, it's based on strong customer inflow and high customer activity and a successful execution of our initiatives which we will come back to.</p>
          <p>The solid trends we see is of course as we see net interest income up, we see total income up, and we see operating profit up, the number of gold customers is up significantly, 7% on an annualized basis, lending volumes are up and net loan losses are down.</p>
          <p>The total report and the environment does not make a change in our outlook statement, so we still expect a macroeconomic recovery to continue and we see that actually the Nordic markets outlook has improved during the year. Then of course on the global scene they look somewhat fragile, so we have not changed our outlook in terms of cost growth, in terms of loan losses and in terms of risk-adjusted profits.</p>
          <p>I'll come back later with some business trends, but Fredrik will you present the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Christian. I will do that starting on slide seven, you can see that we had a new record level of income at 2,363, which is an increase of 9% versus the last quarter. There we are pleased to say that net interest income increased, and fees and commission stayed at a good level and particularly big increase in net results from items at fair value.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased by more than 30% in the quarter and it's also been in comparison to last year, very strong development of 15%, because of the &#x2013; partly because of the loan losses market lower this year.</p>
          <p>You can see on slide eight that the currency impact is not significant in the third quarter, compared to the second quarter. Operating income is growing with 8% at unchanged currencies versus 9 and costs similar, and those &#x2013; that is the same for the other lines. Whereas of course, the impact on currencies is much larger as you can see in the table year-to-date, the comparison.</p>
          <p>If I then go to the different lines, and starting with net interest income. As I said, it was up by 5% and we have a strong trend in the customer operation. So more customers, of course, bringing also more business in general. Lending and deposit volumes are up, as I'll come back to, and we have in particular increased deposit margins, Sweden in particular and to some extent also Norway.</p>
          <p>As before, we have a negative impact from higher average funding costs as we continue to prolong our funding maturity. However, this is much smaller this quarter than it has been in the previous quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 10, you can see that we have a continued growth in total lending and in particular this quarter you can see in the table of slide 10 that new European markets continued to grow by 4% in the quarter, and the household lending both for mortgage and consumers are continuing a very strong and good trend, whilst the corporate lending, as can be expected in the seasonally lower activity of Q3, is flat. Also deposits continued to grow and we are particularly pleased to see in European markets and FID deposit increasing but also from the households and corporate sector in the Nordic regions.</p>
          <p>Looking at the next slide, we can see that we are now clearly benefiting from that increased margin and the impact from margin pick-up is 90 million in the quarter versus Q2, but we also had some good growth from particularly the household lending volumes and their contribution as you can see is 8 million.</p>
          <p>So in all, the balance is more tilted towards the margin pick-up of the deposits and particularly so from Sweden and Norway, but also continued good contribution from volume. One particularly interesting subject in times when interest rates increase is, of course, the interest rates sensitivity, and as you can see on slide 12, there is very little change to our interest rate sensitivity in terms of net interest income. It remains approximately at the level we also had in Q2 at &#x20AC;450 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to net fees and commissions, as you can see on slide 13, we are remaining at a high level despite the normal seasonal effects we had in Q3. So it's a strong &#x2013; continued strong performance within the asset management side, and savings, commissions in general, and we maintain a good activity level in the corporate advice side. We were exceptionally high in the second quarter, but we maintained the level at very high &#x2013; a very high level also in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at assets under management on the next slide: we have, consecutively in the last several quarters continued to have an increase in strong inflows, and this quarter was no different. The inflow was 3.3 billion or pretty close to 8% on an annualized basis. And asset under management is now off to 180, which is the highest it has been ever. And we can see that that inflow is coming pretty much from all the different areas, but in particular from institutional clients and also retail clients so, again, a good development.</p>
          <p>One area that was relatively weaker in Q2 was the fair value &#x2013; the fair value results, and this quarter we have a more normalized profit in Group Treasury and hence the fair value results have increased by 32%. So a good momentum in capital markets business to customer &#x2013; in customer areas. A good and continued strong performance in life and pension results, and now a more normalized contribution from the Treasury and capital markets, unallocated profit.</p>
          <p>Turning a little bit to the cost side: we remain with, what is really important to us, a firm cost management, and if we adjust for the currency impact and also for the strategic initiatives, the underlying expenses are actually down in the quarter by 2% and that has resulted in cost/income ratio improvement to 51% from 55% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Leaving the P&amp;L, and just a few comments on the balance sheet. Risk-weighted assets actually decreased a little bit in the third quarter in comparison to Q2 despite the lending growth, and the reason was -- there were many reasons -- but we had among others a more efficient handling of collaterals, making the balance sheet pricing more efficient, and as a result of this, and is also a result of the improvement or the good result, our Core tier 1 ratio improved 10.4% and it's roughly about 40 basis points up from where it was one quarter ago.</p>
          <p>We are, as far as we understand it, fully compliant with Basel III, already at this point of time we expect in the Basel III environment when that gets implemented the risk-weighted assets would be increasing with approximately 10% out of which half roughly in the CVA related exposure and the rest in market risk and some other minor issues. So largely the impact on the core tier 1 ratio is approximately 100 basis points or thereabout.</p>
          <p>Also on the liquidity management side, we continue at prudent stand, our AA rating is maintained. We continue, as I will come back to, with high long-term funding issuance, liquidity buffer is still increasing and as you can see on that upper graph on slide 18, you can see that, the liquidity buffer is actually larger than the short-term funding at this point of time.</p>
          <p>The maturity on our long-term funding has also continued to increase, and as you can see on the next slide, the issuance level so far this year is close to what it was for the entire year of 2009, so we have had a high issuance level and the average maturity of all new funding is close to six years.</p>
          <p>One particular pleasing thing is that we have now established the Covered Bond Program for both Norway and Finland, we have done our first issuance on the Norwegian market and we expect to do our first issuance on the Finish covered bond market in this quarter, Q4.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I'll leave over to you, Ari.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. And moving to credit quality, starting from positive macro factors on slide 21, you can see that in our main markets Nordics, a good growth in GDP mostly in Finland and Sweden, but also nicely positive in Denmark and Norway. And we see the same pattern also via forecasting the same pattern going forward in the next years.</p>
          <p>We had low inflation in these countries, and also as you can see from the lower graph strong public finances, all our countries are better than the Euro area on average they mark more or less equal, as I said, with Euro area, but other countries are in particular shaping in this respect.</p>
          <p>Moving to next slide, you already heard of what <mark type="inaudible" /> development in our lending book, these are nominal figures and as we heard if we exclude the FX and also repos then the lending growth was little bit lower it was 1%, but that we can see still the growth is diversified coming from all segments, all industries. So, that we don't foresee any kind of areas of new concern.</p>
          <p>On the following page, you can see that actually our credit quality is clearly improving. This is the corporate rating distribution, so that the existing corporates, they are operative now and then the new corporate customers we begin, they have strong ratings, so that you can see their exposures in the good rates they have increased.</p>
          <p>And that is visible also in our loan losses on page 24, now we are down to 22 basis points in our quarterly loan loss ratio. Still we have <mark type="inaudible" />, loan losses now that scheme ended in September.</p>
          <p>And as is page 25, you can see little bit of more information on these 207 million loan loss in Q3 on the upper graph, you can see that the new loan losses they were more or less in the same level as in the previous quarter we're at the recoveries for the earlier made loan loss provisions they were higher. And as a result, the net loan losses were lower. It is very typical of course, that when the funds are getting worse then you build up provisions for individual loans loss provisions as well as collective provisions, and then when things are stabilizing we do see higher recoveries. This is the first quarter our collective provisions were down.</p>
          <p>You can also see from the lower graph that actually the Sweden and Norway in this graph they are non-existing for the two last quarters, so that still our areas for loan losses from the Nordic countries, they are Finland and Denmark, but also &#x2013; already now the ratios are quite low, and the European markets and shipping, they also have been quite stable and then coming down. The loan loss ratio in Baltics was 88 basis points. So that also there we see a clear stabilization.</p>
          <p>The next slide is showing impaired loans. As you can see there was some increase over impaired performing loans. That is due to few medium-sized customers in Finland and Denmark, which were new customers for volume net loss. But all in all, as you can see the credit quality from the whole group that is clearly improving. So that now you can see that we had a positive rating migration of 1% measured into risk-weighted assets in this quarter. And what is important to realize is that this positive rating migration that is coming from all the countries and also from all the customer segments, so that we see the positive rating migration in corporate book as well as in retail book and financial institutions, and as I said, in all countries.</p>
          <p>And still of course we have increased our provision so that the total allowance is they are up, but here you can also see that the collective allowances, they were little bit down first time this quarter.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I move back &#x2013; turn back to Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Ari. And I would give a few comments of the business development starting with our income side, and moving to strategy. But first of all, it is worth noting that we have a very well-diversified income and distribution and the top segments are actually from which &#x2013; are our key relationship segments, which we focus and our strategy are actually a very significant part of the income, only the other in this graph on 28 is outside the relationship strategy.</p>
          <p>So clearly the part of the income more than 80% comes from the key segments, these segments also deliver significant growth as you can see year-on-year on the bottom part of the page, only other household clients do not deliver growth and that's obviously because its mainly deposit customers, there is no margin right now with low interest rates, and which is Baltics which did not deliver particular growth during the past year.</p>
          <p>And the way we do it, relationship banking and on the private customers, we focus on the 360-degree meetings to maximize the number of meetings because there is a linear relationship between the number of meetings, products sold and the suspension of customers. And we see clearly the effect we had a steady growth this quarter, we had a 7% annualized growth rate and it seems to be a very strong momentum underlying in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>The strategy is clear, household top segment, corporate the two big segments where we proactively go for expanding the wallet and penetrating the wallet of these customers with all types of products. European markets is focused on Poland now and then the three initiatives which focus efficient value chain delivery to all customer segments, which is extremely important to have a smooth efficient way of handling the services. The IT structure, and the back office operations and then the product platforms which we've replaced by new ones, which both gives efficiency and possibilities of expanding the customer offering in these areas.</p>
          <p>The household relationship strategy is clear, it's rational have been through several times is obvious, theses segments have higher income, higher potential, we talk about three times higher income in gold versus silver. They are more loyal. We could talk about customer satisfaction being sort of seven percentage points higher and efficient to serve, which we have 360-degree meeting is very efficient tool as it proactively take care of the customers and low risk, we have virtually no losses on these type segments.</p>
          <p>And the big initiatives here, which we mentioned last time on the future distribution and that is very interesting it's already showing results. The new pilot, we run 39 pilots now in the Nordic area where we have divided into advice franchise and service franchise, it's clearly more efficient from a cost to serve point of view, but also the customers appreciate it a lot. I can say, I just listened to one of the branches and one of the customers grab hold of me and said, now Christian you won't change back to the old format because this new one is a much better way of doing banking and all the other banks are doing it. So I think we have some clear points here.</p>
          <p>Customer acquisition smooth and efficient and growth plan Finland because we in Finland had a particular big issue to solve in our distribution because the branches are not particularly distributed around the country in the right way.</p>
          <p>And the deliveries are clear at 32, lending up 14%, deposits up 9 and retail funds up 22%. So the savings power of the bank is very big as you can see, most people tend to save in funds but still. Corporate relationship strategy is exactly the same, penetrating the wallets, the size of the wallet and also the share of the wallet. And here we have the growth plan CMB, which is clearly delivering both in Sweden and the other countries, and then their advisery business in markets and the risk management business and there we can see also the effects Q2 &#x2013; Q3 was made the asset weaker, the reason mainly seasonal and also the fact with Q2 was particularly strong 23% year-on-year growth rate and that is a very strong trend. We win several mandates and we're winning them in Sweden and here we can clearly see the effects from the strategy we have launched back in December '06, we see the CAGR on since 2007 here which impressive growth rates in my opinion. Relationship banking and share of the wallet is key here.</p>
          <p>New European, markets same story once again. We focus on growth plan Poland and we have proven that we can do this since 2007, we had very solid growth rate of 38% and with the cost/income ratio is 39 is obviously strong growth. We are opening probably around 40 branches in Q4. So we will still reach the level we have set all the time of around one branch per week.</p>
          <p>These initiatives are key because they are going to deliver on our long-term ambition and target and we are just now after '09 we are bit ahead of this target and just now after this quarters we are bit below of the target and that's mainly due to the lower interest rate level, which impacted our deposit income.</p>
          <p>Initiatives are delivering and we have on the next page some numbers, 200 million in income, 50 million on efficiency, but we also invest quite a bit of money in the initiatives and we'll continue on that as you can see.</p>
          <p>So the key messages, strong quarter, record income, one of the highest operating profits ever. We only have one slightly higher and that was mainly due to one-offs and then we have very high customer activity as we've gone through and I like to highlight the trend in assets under management with a very strong inflow in the number of customers and then of course, these were all that we execute on our growth initiatives and deliver on the strategy.</p>
          <p>That concludes our presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Christian. And now operator we are pleased opening up for Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question today from Nick Davey from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everyone. Thanks very much for the time taken on this conference call. It's Nick Davey from UBS. Three very quick questions, if I may. The first on the Basel III guidance, I appreciate that you've been very ahead of the cycle really throughout the last few quarters in guiding on Basel III, so I appreciate the guidance there.</p>
          <p>If I back out, I think the 5% RWA growth you're guiding to from increased market risk-weighted assets. I think it leads me to the conclusion that you're talking about &#x2013; roundabout a three times multiples your market risk RWA. So I just wanted to get a bit of color if I can, I realize the market risk RWA is declining slightly Q-on-Q, but bigger picture, I think your market risk-weighted assets are around 30% higher than they were Q3 last year. So I just wanted to get a flavor from you as to really what direction you think market risk-weighted assets will go on a absolute basis irrespective of the regulatory picture, whether you might look to actively bring down the market risk in the business based on the regulatory focus? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And second very briefly back on slide 12 when you talk about group sensitivity to rising interest rates. If you could just give us a flavor of really the offsetting impact of the &#x2013; to the trading line, which I think isn't guided to on the slide or whether I'd be far off the mark in thinking that the negative impact of trading would be similar to what you guided to at Q2.</p>
          <p>And then finally, very briefly, I realize it's relatively marginal in a group context but briefly on Baltic NII, it looks around 50% higher year-on-year just for the quarter isolated or on relatively stable volumes. If you could just give us a flavor around the kind of trends you're seeing in the region? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah let me start with the first question on the market risk. Of course the market risk is a function of the growth we have in our business and of course, this is a key growth area for us and also part of the group initiative. So it has grown and it will continue to grow to some extent in line with our growth of this business. Of course, it varies over time. And the indication you &#x2013; we have given on risk-weighted assets is a total number of 10%, and I indicated approximately half of it is DDA and the rest is many things including market risk. So the multiple is roughly about 2.5, not quite 3, that you mentioned, so giving a forecast on the market risk development, I think is quite difficult. We have an ambition to continue to expand on that business. Baltic NII, would you like to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The main explanation is increased margin both in the lending side and also in the deposit side. But also one factor is that we are now little bit down in impaired loans and that has also impact in non-performing impaired loans. That has also impact on NII. But as you say, that volumes have been stable &#x2013; that is not the reason for what is given.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah then final question there, your mid question was relating to what impact on the trading. The reason why we are not providing that any more was that the NII is a revolving impact, so to speak, it will come back year-after-year whilst the other line, the impact is a static one-time impact. And of course, it always it's a fluctuating number in the sense that it can change depending on the positions. But it's roughly about somewhere between 250 million and 300 million, roughly at this point of time. So that's the order of magnitude and that is the number we provided approximately last time as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We take our next question today from Jan Wolter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A couple of questions if I may here: the interest rate risk seems to have increased in the quarter. And this is the follow-up question from the presentation earlier today. Is it &#x2013; how much have you used the risk mandate on interest rate risk this quarter, have you used that to a maximum in the third quarter? Could Nordea take more interest risk without changing the current mandate? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one is in what businesses and/or portfolios do we have the main interest rate risk? And the first question is on &#x2013; the third question is on cost growth. I think, I saw something on the news here Nordea being quoted saying that underlying cost base will not grow going forward; would that be correct or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jan, if I can start may be with the interest rate risk exposure. We were, as previously stated, we were low on the interest rate risk in Q2, so this is more of a normalized level, and it will of course vary over time, and this is mainly an issue with the liquidity buffer. We are at approximately at this point of time 40% risk utilization <mark type="inaudible" /> so to your question, can we &#x2013; increase that exposure within the current mandate, yes. The answer is simply yes. And as I said, the portfolios we're taking about is mainly liquidity buffer and Treasury. Of course there is also borrower risk within the market trading inventory, so to speak. And the cost growth, should I or should I--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But I can say you that, I tried to explain it earlier today, but it's very difficult equation because there are three components: the first one is underlying cost including wage increases. It is actually unchanged right now, meaning that the efficiency gains are actually, you can say, taking out increases due to the wage inflation. Then we have coming on top of that unchanges, strategic investment programs. But we have ambitions to continue that, that would of course not be a straight line, but we will continue and I have full momentum now. So it will continue at least until '11 or '12 and we can of course just to speak, but we intend to go for full here, because it's delivering so strong results. And that is adding maybe 2% or 3% or whatever like it did this year, as you see from the figures.</p>
          <p>And then third element is of course ultimately the huge number of new customers and the huge volume increases we are seeing will eventually of course demand a bit more advisors and a bit more people to handle all these customers. It's only about 7% annualized. So of course in three years, we are talking about 20% more customers, which does not come for free, of course.</p>
          <p>Exactly how that will materialize is more difficult to say, so the guidance for this year was the one exactly reflecting this. We had dips of 3%, 4% and then underlying cost unchanged and maybe we will be looking into same levels next year. We haven't finalized the plans, but I think the logic of all for the next three years and are quite easy to see from there. So it's not like we are not controlling cost; it's more like we are investing in these very interesting genesis we have in the nine initiatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, many thanks. And just Fredrik was that 30% or 40% of the risk mandate being used?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, it's <mark type="inaudible" /> from DnB NOR Markets. I have three questions, the first one is the shipping losses, elaborate a little bit on the tank side in your quarterly report <mark type="inaudible" /> improving here. Could you shed some light into what kind of areas you're really looking to take some provisioning into on the shipping side. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Number two, is the corporate lending growth; is it any difference between the four Nordic countries on the large corporate lending growth? Actually on the SME side, I can see some differences. The third one is the Danish guarantee scheme; could you shed some light on to what's going to happen after the September end in 2010? And the fourth one is life insurance into Basel II or III of whatever you call it now. Now as you are above 10% is it so that you're not deducting that into the capital tier 1 ratio? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start on keeping loan losses, as you saw our losses were very small. Actually it's only--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Some 30 basis points or something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. <mark type="inaudible" /> it doesn't have more or less anything to do with <mark type="inaudible" /> win customers and dealing with the spot markets in various segments and we of course made business on those. So all in all, yes you are right. What we wrote in the text is that we see that the tanker market is a little bit subdued, the freights are quite low. <mark type="inaudible" />. The bulk market is more or less stable where it has been and are now of course there is a positive trend in the containers, so that that is going to rock of the way we see. As you can see that we don't <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the corporate lending growth I think your question was really related to the large companies if I may answer in a slight...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...different &#x2013; slightly different way. Corporate growth was relatively flat in &#x2013; slightly down, you can say in Denmark, pretty much flat in Finland, the same goes for Norway and up in Sweden. So it was largely constant throughout all these four countries. We are not making that split for specific large companies, as you asked, but this is the general picture on <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may continue then with the Danish guarantee. Nordbank factor one is of course out in picture as of 30th of September replaced by a new version, which is more exempt payment for defaults in the Danish banking system so there is on commission payments under 45 roughly that we have paid on a quarterly basis will no longer be there. We cannot exclude on loan losses that we will have to pay exempt for defaults.</p>
          <p>However, there is one distinction here and that is that, in the new bank partly set up in Denmark also the depositors will take up the cost of the possible default, so the expected cost is of course much lower, as we go forward. So I think that's clearly an advantage for us in many different ways.</p>
          <p>And finally on the life insurance, we expect again that's part of the Basel III package so to speak, a general deduction possibility, which really fits the life insurance investment fits into that to a large extent. However, there is going to be some small impact on core tier I. We expect that to be approximately 10 basis points and that's part of the 100 basis points that I alluded to before, so in order of magnitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just on the Danish bank guarantees, so that it will go away both the commission cost and into the loan loss line. Both will be gone in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I said on the commission, it goes away partly. There is a default deposit guarantee, which is a fairly small one in Denmark, and that is fully funded, we cannot exclude the popping up of that, but that's a very, very small amount. So that's not an issue on the commission side. However, as I said, on loan losses we cannot exclude the future defaults in the Danish banking system. And we will have to pick up a certain share of that cost also going forward. However, having said that, just to make that distinction, which is different to what it has been in the last two years, depositors &#x2013; where depositors will also pick up a certain share of that cost. So, really it is not a full guarantee as there has been under the bank factor one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add up to that <mark type="inaudible" /> the same scheme we have in all countries, so that this can happen in all countries, so that then Denmark is same as that.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We'll take our next question today from Jacob Kruse from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jacob from Autonomous. I just had a couple of questions. First on the net interest income position, we had another two rate hikes in September and this month. Could you talk a bit about how they are affecting your deposit margins in Sweden relative to the first hike? Do you get more out of these two or do you &#x2013; or is it roughly the same impact?</p>
          <p>And also on the mortgage side in Sweden, it seems like people are switching over to fixed rate or longer-term mortgages. What is the possibility difference between the short-term and the longer-term mortgage in terms of NII? And then lastly on the &#x2013; on Norway, could you just talk a bit about trends you're seeing there, it seems like the growth is substantially slower in Norway and the margin progression is also a lot weaker? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me start with NII perhaps. The impact on the Swedish rate hike in the first quarter was approximately &#x20AC;8 million. And of course, we have not the biggest part, it's approximately 25% of the current account deposits that we have in &#x2013; on the household side on the Swedish market, so it has an impact, of course, from that. Whether this last rate impact will be bigger than that, good question. Probably yes, probably it will be bigger. Mainly for time reasons actually because it happens earlier. So we did not pick up the full rate hike in the third quarter, we will pick up now that remaining portion and of course the new rate hikes that we saw yesterday, so yes, there would be a bigger impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mortgage margin switch, the margin is typically slightly better on the longer end, so we should be positive margin wise for the fixed rate, slightly better for the fixed rate in mortgage margins. Norway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right that the growth is little bit stabilizing in Norway, <mark type="inaudible" /> these macro trends so that in Norway, it's been more stable with the pickup in other countries has been higher. But I don't see that this is any kind of dramatic change in the Norwegian growth opportunities. Market risk is there nevertheless we have been able to keep up relatively high margins, especially in the corporate lending side. So that specific return stabilizing to this high growth in Norway, but nothing more than that in my mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the margins in Norway, you see that the mortgage margins are down something like 16 basis points and large part of that or at least 10 basis points are explained by technical factors and that is that the difference between Nordea's portfolio and internal interest rates was down 10 basis points in the quarter. So the underlying margin pressure is not that bad as it seems like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry how much does that make for your NII for the Norway division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at the margin, it's down 16 basis points and 10 of that comes from these technical factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our next question today from Fridtjof Berents from Arctic Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just following up on the previous question here, could you just elaborate a little how you see the competitive landscape, is there any differences between the four countries both on the corporate side and the mortgage side please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a broad question. You can say that in general the competitive landscape essentially the same on the corporates. The large corporates use the same banks more or less and stiff competition and we're also seeing some banks are not factoring in the full cost of funding and full cost of capital, but that is something we have to come back, because I think that will happen. So, of course there are local competition for smaller corporates, but there the probability is of course very high.</p>
          <p>On mortgage, the difference is more related to the setup of the different mortgage systems. So in essence you can say in Denmark, we have pass through system where we pass through the actual funding cost of customer <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So there the competition is more like getting the mortgage rather than on margins and whereas in Sweden and Finland, we have fierce competition on margins. Of course everybody is realizing that the maturities of the funding of these government bonds needs to go up further due to the new regulation. So that is the pressure of what's there as well, but the competition is of course pretty <mark type="inaudible" /> on mortgages and the reason is that, it is anchor product in the household relationships typically having the mortgage also have the customer relationship and there by all the other products and that makes this competition pretty tough and that's the reason why we see margins and at the levels we do which are not impressive. But then generally there is pretty strong competition on all areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just may follow up, it seems if you go 1.5 year back it seems like the margin pressure has been slightly higher in Norway relative to the other countries. Is this the picture you also &#x2013; you also share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you're right. I think we see some effect in some countries of the new regulation where margin pressure is seasoning off somewhat in Norway. This is an example, the Norwegian mortgage margin is fixed and there is lot of technicality in that, so that is the margin that move up and down through the quarter because of these lag effects and other things. We hopefully see the same movement in the other countries where margins seems to be edging off but we need to see the proof, I think we will see that absolutely into the New Year when the new relation is very visible to everyone and has been finally decided.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our next question from Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken here. Two questions, first one being kind of more broader one regarding Denmark, obviously the loan losses haven't come down in Denmark the way they potentially might have. What's your view on when will we see a kind of broader based recovery in the Danish credit quality and loan losses coming down?</p>
          <p>The second question is actually regarding the covered bond issues in Finland and Norway. What kind of impact do you expect that this could have kind of ballpark figures for your funding costs in these countries? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start from your question relating to Danish loan losses. Actually this was the third quarter in our Danish group, we <mark type="inaudible" /> positive migration, rating migrations. So that's of course is the first quarter, that we see this as an indication that we are not getting more volume through this. So that's whether we could peak remains to be seen, but at least now what we experienced and as you saw that's actually &#x2013; our loan losses also in Denmark are not coming down and because of these improved rating migrations, of course it means that we have quite a big amount of quality loan loss provisions made in earlier quarters, they will start to also come down in Denmark. Here we see that instead of loan loss, individual loan losses will very likely remain for the certain period of time, relatively high because still <mark type="inaudible" /> are not being sold in the SME segment in Denmark. Still there are lots of SMEs working or functioning <mark type="inaudible" /> on this market and then they need to be restructured before they are able to recover. So that is more or less the large piece.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the covered bond side, it's of course difficult to fully give you an answer we have as I alluded to the <mark type="inaudible" /> was done in Norway during Q3 and Q4. We are <mark type="inaudible" /> The first issue was approximately 10 basis points lower interest rates than the financing it actually replaced, and we indicated some Finland is at a similar kind of level, may be bigger than that and hopefully, I think it could be bigger than both Norway and Denmark as we go along. I think one needs to remember <mark type="inaudible" /> are extremely well functioning, has been in operation for long time, has very broad industrial base, then it will take time to develop both the size and the functionality of both of these new markets, so to speak for us. But we have high hope both in terms of volume and eventually also funding cost. But as I said, the first indications are <mark type="inaudible" /> for Norway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. If I just may follow up so these plans to expand the covered bonds have nothing to do with the recent turbulence we have seen in the Swedish covered bond market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. On the cost rate you can say we had in the Finish markets typically long lending, we are funding this with the normal funding structure of the bank, so we are not neutralizing those assets for &#x2013; we are not utilizing a covered bond set up and of course covered bond set up is from a bonding perspective superior in <mark type="inaudible" /> so we have typically haven't utilized that potential before and very few have, so it's a matter of over the longer perspective build those markets and create that functionality that's been existing for so many years in the Swedish and Danish markets and of course other European like Germany and Spain. So we &#x2013; as I said, it has nothing to do with Swedish market, but it's fair to say that the Swedish market has been continuing to function extremely well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a quick follow-up question here on the malformation this quarter. If I look at the &#x2013; in fact I wouldn't say that the malformation is mainly happening in what you call consumer staples including food and agricultural and mainly in Denmark here, so that those NPLs are up, 20% last quarter and now 35% or something this quarter Q-on-Q. Is that some sort of lag effect or what is driving that from malformation now, is it collateral values in the agricultural sector or something else? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is more or less <mark type="inaudible" />. It'll be in some weaker companies in these industries and farms and of course there is a certain period of time when you can protect these and help by low interest rates <mark type="inaudible" /> to a starting point with good solidity and <mark type="inaudible" /> of improving and of course, it will be end of that story and there are these type of weaker companies who are still turning little bit worse in those segments <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So it's very typical, of course, what happens during the cycle, so that when the cycle is turning down, <mark type="inaudible" /> when cycles are turning up <mark type="inaudible" /> they are recovering quite fast and no new customers are entering to that but some weaker ones will remain. And then of course then we're prudent in repairing this loss and then we make provision as soon as we feel that there is a need for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have to also note perhaps that's the whole reason why we have to collective provisions, they were build exactly because we knew we would meet those problems as we exit the crisis, but we couldn't individualize them now and we can then in the reality what will happen going forward to some extent that this would <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
