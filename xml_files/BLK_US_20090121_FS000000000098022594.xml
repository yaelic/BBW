          <p>Good morning, my name is <mark type="inaudible" /> and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer Ann Marie Petach, and General Counsel Robert P. Connolly. <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Thank you. Mr. Connolly, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Good morning. This is Bob Connolly. I'm General Counsel of BlackRock. Before Larry and Ann Marie and Sue Wagner, our Chief Operating Officer is here with us this morning as well, make their remarks, I want to point out that during the course of this conference call we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call to your attention the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements, and as you know, BlackRock has filed with the SEC reports, which list some of the factors, which may cause our results to differ materially from these statements. Finally, BlackRock assumes no duty to, and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ann Marie.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. My comments are going to be on an as-adjusted basis unless I note otherwise. Starting with the facts, full year operating income was 1.662 billion, or $8.37 per share; that's up about 9.5% from a year ago. Non-operating losses net of minority interest were 381 million or $1.92 per share. Net income was 858 million or $6.45 per share &#x2013; that's down 21% compared to a year ago. Full year revenues were up 5% year-over-year, including a 6% increase in base fees. While we are proud of our relative performance, we are disappointed in the market effects and our absolute results.</p>
          <p>The 9.5% improvement in full year operating results and the 5% revenue increase reflect very strong net new business flows in the first half, exceptional growth in the advisory business, a balanced business model and strong cost management discipline, dampened by extremely negative market effects in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. As mentioned, the results reflect proactive cost management. Our GAAP results include a 38 million restructuring charge associated with a reduction of about 500 people or about 9% of the workforce. This action was taken to align our workforce for present market conditions.</p>
          <p>The full year as-adjusted comp to revenue ratio was about 35%. That's equal to a year ago, despite market effects on revenues and full-year effects of employees added in the second half of 2007. In addition, full year G&amp;A improved over 100 million compared to 2007. Half of the improvement is explained by balance sheet-related foreign exchange effects of almost 50 million &#x2013; that includes about 30 million in the fourth quarter. 26 million of the improvement relates to lower expense related to 2007 support of cash funds, and 26 million relates to lower closed-end fund launch costs.</p>
          <p>We also managed to lower marketing and T&amp;E expense, despite a major rebranding in Europe. This was offset by higher occupancy costs related to the Quellos transaction. Full year operating margin as adjusted was 38.7%, an improvement compared to 37.5% a year ago, driven by revenue growth combined with aggressive expense management.</p>
          <p>As we've discussed before, BlackRock utilizes its balance sheet to co-invest capital alongside our clients and to seed new products. The majority of these commitments are invested in alternative products and are invested alongside with clients for the duration of the product. These co-investments are generally long-term commitments in real estate, distressed products, hedge funds and private equity. BlackRock also seeds new product. These investments are a much smaller portion of the portfolio, are shorter term in nature, and are hedged as appropriate. Almost all of the balance sheet investments are marked to market. The extremely negative markets in 2008 have affected our clients and BlackRock's results.</p>
          <p>This alignment is important to our clients. 2008 markets, particularly the fourth quarter, were not kind to anyone. The full-year non-operating loss of 381 million represents about a 25% decline from the peak investment portfolio of about 1.4 billion in June, and is in line with market movements on underlying assets. This brings the portfolio to about a billion, distributed as discussed previously. The hardest-hit asset classes included distressed credit, which represented about 140 million of the loss; real estate, which represented over 120 million &#x2013; and that was across multiple investments; hedge funds, which represented over 50 million loss; and private equity, which represented about 30 million.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, many of these investments are long-term in nature, while the marks represent the market valuation of the portfolio at a point in time. The majority of the marks do not reflect BlackRock's expectation of holding these investments for a long period, nor, in our opinion, the true economic value of many of these investments.</p>
          <p>As a result of the magnitude of the U.S.-based non-operating losses recorded in the fourth quarter, the mix of our pre-tax income shifted, such that a greater percent of our income than originally anticipated was realized overseas in lower tax jurisdictions. This resulted in us making a fourth-quarter adjustment to our full-year tax rate, bringing it down from 35 to 33%.</p>
          <p>I want to share with you a few other thoughts regarding the fourth quarter. This period most clearly reflected the headwinds of adverse markets affecting our results. Fourth quarter as-adjusted operating income was 371 million, or $1.81 per share. As-adjusted non-operating results were loss of 270 million, or $1.32 per share. The change in full-year tax rate from 35 to 33% contributed $0.19 per share. As a result, net income for the quarter was 91 million or $0.68 per share.</p>
          <p>As-adjusted operating results were down 15% compared to the third quarter, and down 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Revenues of 1.1 billion were down 19% compared to the third quarter, and down 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter market and foreign exchange movements drove revenue declines compared to the third quarter and compared to a year ago. The most material and important effect was on base fees, particularly on equity products.</p>
          <p>Base fees, which represent 80% of total revenue, were down over 20% compared to prior periods, and equity and balance declines represented 80 to 90% of that total. In addition, we earned lower performance fees, which are often dependent on absolute performance &#x2013; a difficult threshold in this market. Finally, we saw a decline in other revenue, explained by a decline in securities lending and the disposition of our Metric Property Management business &#x2013; basically a zero-margin business. These factors overwhelmed the strong growth in our advisory revenues.</p>
          <p>Aggressive expense management in the fourth quarter explains the average asset operating margin of 41.6% and the 30% decline in compensation expense compared to prior periods. Fourth-quarter G&amp;A expense of 154 million is down 16 million from the third quarter, again reflecting the effects of our cost control efforts, particularly in the areas of marketing, promotion, T&amp;E and technology. We plan to continue to aggressively manage costs as appropriate for the environment, and for strong long-term business results.</p>
          <p>In summary, hostile markets have affected all segments, including our business results. The fourth quarter showed the headwinds on revenues. We begin 2009 with market-affected assets under management. We are proactively managing our cost base and will continue to do so. Still, the overwhelming market influence on revenue will affect our operating margins.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to co-investing in alternative products with our clients, which facilitates us being a full-platform provider, though it has introduced earnings volatility. At the same time, we are pleased with our relative position. Our business has grown and our operating results improved compared to 2007. We have a diversified business by asset type, plan type, and region. We believe this will continue to provide balance to our results and growth opportunities over time. Our Solutions and Advisory businesses have grown, and we are seeing continued opportunity in an adverse market. Our risk management and diversified assets sales are bringing in significant new opportunities. Our pipeline remains strong at 59.5 billion.</p>
          <p>I believe our 2008 operating results are reflective of our business platform and approach. This approach puts us in a position to do relatively well in adverse markets, and exceptionally well when markets turn around.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ann Marie. Good morning everyone. I said recently in an article in one of the newspapers that 2008 was the best and worst of times. It's obviously one of the worst of times because of asset value destruction, collapse of liquidity, and outright fear. We have seen all this create a paralyzed global market, and we expect that to continue, as I said in the article, for the next three to six months, until we see some stability from, essentially from our global central banks providing liquidity and buying troubled assets.</p>
          <p>These are the best of times in terms of BlackRock's position. I believe more than ever before our business model has proven to be, on an absolute basis and most certainly in a relative basis, to be resilient and responsive to our client needs globally, domestically, institutionally, and retail. I believe we're in a better position to work with our clients than ever before.</p>
          <p>Our clients worldwide are struggling &#x2013; not just our small retail investors, but our sovereign</p>
          <p>wealth funds, our pension plans, our insurance companies. Everybody is asking questions, looking for help, looking for a complete analysis of what should be done with their portfolios. And I believe our platform, our unified platform, is as well positioned to help our client navigate this than many, if not most, of our peers. And most importantly, I believe we are being asked questions by our clients more today than ever before as to how we can help them navigate these turbulent markets.</p>
          <p>So, these are the best of times for us on a relative basis; these are the worst of times in terms of the relativity in the marketplace and the results of the marketplace and the destruction of asset values.</p>
          <p>Let met review the fourth quarter in a little more detail, and I should note that I believe our fourth quarter release is pretty exhaustive in terms of information we are providing to all of you. We took a lot of time in trying to explain everything by asset category, and I believe it's more transparent than ever before, and we are trying to give more information on a timely basis. Obviously, there's going be lot more information provided as we issue our 8-K and our other financial reporting. So let me go over one, some important points about BlackRock.</p>
          <p>We are very thrilled about where we ended up in terms AUM. We had growth in AUM. Most firms exhibited massive destruction in AUM in the fourth quarter. Because of the resiliency of our business and the diversity of our business products, we exhibited about a $49 billion net increase in assets. So, we have crossed over again to the $1.3 trillion asset base.</p>
          <p>Now obviously, we saw a very large swing in assets. We saw large outflows, at times, in long-dated funds. We saw large inflows in liquidity. I'm going to go into a little more detail. But importantly, our BlackRock Solutions and Advisory business has really transformed our asset growth and helps us continue to grow, and I believe once again our business platform of having a complete product profile of alternatives, equities, fixed income and advisory, is going to allow us to continue to drive new business growth.</p>
          <p>So $49 billion is net new growth. That was on top of an $80 billion market decline in just our portfolios. $80 billion is pretty shocking, but it also exhibits how hard the markets fell in the fourth quarter. That is entirely beta, and actually, in most of our equity accounts in the fourth quarter, we outperformed, so if we did not have positive alpha in our equity accounts in the fourth quarter, we would have had even more price destruction. And so I know these numbers are shockingly large, and yet it just exhibits the pain and suffering that the capital markets had in the fourth quarter. But we've been able to navigate through that. We've been able to build business and we &#x2013; as a overall platform we have been able to transform ourselves and build more relationships.</p>
          <p>I would like to also say we have more clients today than we did at the end of '07, and we have more clients today than we had at the end of the third quarter of '08. So we are winning business. We're picking up clients and we're picking up multiple clients activities with our clients.</p>
          <p>As Ann Marie noted, our pipeline remains robust, with close to $60 billion in new pipeline, which $21 billion are long-dated mandates. I'd like to note that in the last week or so, we are starting to see more clients' activity and this is one of the reasons why we've seen an increase in these long-dated mandates in the first quarter. We are still seeing clients restructure. We expect to see clients restructure in a great way. Some clients are going to be moving more and more out of alternatives, as they are short liquidity, which I'll talk about in a while. They just have too much of illiquidity in their portfolios , so they're trying to simplify their portfolios.</p>
          <p>Some clients are taking a more active approach to try to buy more, I would say, riskier assets now, and some clients are looking to immunize portfolios by buying long-dated credit. Some clients are looking to now sell bonds and fixed income and to go into equities. So, we are seeing, depending on the clients' needs, depending on &#x2013; the nature of their liabilities, we are seeing tremendous changes in client behavior.</p>
          <p>Let me just talk -before I get into the details of our different businesses , let me just firstly hit on non-operating. Ann Marie told you, really, where all the hits were, and I think our release does explain it pretty carefully , down 25% from the high level of our assets that we achieved in '08. It is reflective of the market. Most of these investments are investments with our clients.</p>
          <p>I would like to also just note, and very strongly note, we do not have portfolios that are held to maturity. Everything we have in our balance sheet we flow through income. And so, as Ann Marie said, it does put some earnings volatility. And yet, I would tell you, our strong position with the clients necessitate sometimes to co-invest with our clients, and we are going to continue to do it. We believe it is the right business model in the long run. Obviously, if I knew we were going to have price destruction like we've had &#x2013; we are bearish, but not that bearish &#x2013; we would have probably thought a little differently.</p>
          <p>I would also say, we do not hedge any of our exposure in these products. We do hedge, at times, the beta of equity markets, when we are seeing equity-like products. But in the alternative space, like real estate, like co-investing in our fund of funds of hedge funds and the fund of funds of private equity and real estate, we do not hedge. We are going along with our investors on these products, and at times, when we had great returns on the upside, we benefited. And obviously, a 25% decline in these assets are quite startling, but we believe we have been very aggressive in terms of marking these assets.</p>
          <p>If there is still more price destruction in '09, we will probably see some disruption in those asset categories. So, I am not here to tell you that it's going to be upside forever after this. But I will say we have been very aggressive in terms of the marks. We actually like the cash flows that are being thrown off from these investments; certainly, some of the investments are throwing off huge cash flows now. And as Ann Marie said, we do not believe the majority of these assets will have permanent impairment. We do believe, once markets will normalize, that these assets will come back, and we will have some gains that we will be able to recognize as we mark to market the assets upward, when the world stabilizes &#x2013; which unfortunately, I don't believe we're going to see that much stability at least in the first six months of this year.</p>
          <p>As Ann Marie discussed, and it is in our offering, of the losses, $124 million was losses in our seed investments, $91 million loss was in our various real estate products. I should state, we do have about $30-odd billion invested on behalf of clients in real estate , so these are just small components of the seed. So, they're across many portfolios. And we were very aggressive in terms of marking our fund of funds business, especially the private equity area. We don't have the returns back from most of the advisors who we have fund of fund products that we co-invest with. We don't have their results back, but we were taking strong estimates as to what we thought would happen in the private equity area. As Ann Marie also stated that we will continue to co-invest with our clients in this business, and we believe this will be an important component of our future growth.</p>
          <p>Let me spend some time now on our business, on our core businesses in the fourth quarter. Let me start out with equities. We had a great relative year. 59% of our products were above the benchmark, above peers. In a chaos market like it is, like it was in '08 , I believe the returns are tremendous. Our three-year returns, 81% of our products are above our peers and benchmarks. Our large cap series, under Bob Doll, had ended up the year with very positive performance. Our UK equity team, our European equity teams, had very strong performance and I do believe when equities become the product of choice again in both mutual fund and institutional channels, we are going to be one of the beneficiaries of that.</p>
          <p>I would like to also note once again the outstanding performance with our Global Allocation team. I would like to also just identify this is the sixth-largest net fund product in the U.S. in 2008. We are very well positioned. We believe this is a product that is going to continue to grow and could continue to be one of the large new products that are going to be sold when equities become back in vogue. Obviously, this is a product that has an allocation of 40% in fixed products, too, so it's not just equities. So for clients who are looking for a global allocation product, this is one of &#x2013; the best in class; it is recognized, &#x2013; it is in the first quartile of performance now for many different quarters and years. So we are just very well positioned in the equity product areas.</p>
          <p>We also &#x2013; did a very good job in terms of selling our products overseas. We were one of the top net product mutual fund sellers of product in our Luxembourg channel &#x2013; that's where we domicile our European equities &#x2013; and so we're just very well positioned in equities, and I believe once the market stabilizes, this will represent a very positive growth product for BlackRock.</p>
          <p>Now obviously in the fourth quarter we saw large outflows and equities, as people felt frightened of equities and equity performance. A lot of that money went into liquidity products, but we believe over the course of a long cycle, as long as we have the proper teams, the risk management tools and the performance, we will be a huge beneficiary of this.</p>
          <p>On the fixed income side, we had mixed performance. We had actually very strong performance in our specialized fixed income products, in corporate products, in TIPS, in emerging market products; and our UK equity products were very strong. We had poor performance in our multi-product sector portfolios, but on a relative basis versus the index, but we actually did quite &#x2013; much better than lot of our peers, and surprisingly, we are winning a lot of assignments, even in the multi-product area, because of our relative performance versus some of our peers. This is something that we're focused on. Obviously, we would like to have a complete story about all our fixed income products doing well but in some of the areas we did not have this great a performance.</p>
          <p>In alternatives, we're seeing sea changes. We're seeing business changes dramatically in the alternative space. As I suggested earlier, clients, many clients were just overly committed into the alternative space. Clients, in many cases, did not appreciate the nature of liquidity. And so, many clients today are facing real issues surrounding liquidity. Many clients are challenged with their overcommitment in some of the alternative areas. And so, we are working with some of our clients in trying to help them, obviously, in their liquidity issues. This is an industry problem. This is not a BlackRock problem but an industry problem that we are a part of.</p>
          <p>We have no Madoff exposure in our funds, in our products, in our firm. We are well positioned relative to most of our competitors. I do believe the Madoff scandal, I do believe the turmoil with a lot of, many other financial institutions, will put BlackRock in a very good position in the alternative space. We believe as clients reconcile their liquidity issues in alternatives &#x2013; and I'm talking fund of funds, I am talking real estate, I'm talking about specialized products &#x2013; clients will look to firms like BlackRock to have investments in these product areas.</p>
          <p>So I actually believe the turmoil is a long-term positive for us, and we are going to be very aggressive making sure we're well positioned in alternatives with our clients, because some clients are continuing to make large investments in alternatives. I think it was announced in the latter part of December that we won a $1 billion assignment for the PBGC, and this is all in the alternative space, in real estate and fund of funds of private equity. So, we are seeing some large-scale clients who are still looking to be additive in this space, and we believe clients worldwide will do that. And we want to be one of the vendors who're working with our clients.</p>
          <p>Touching on the PBGC assignment, I think it is another good example that clients are looking for complete overall relationships. Clients are looking for partners; they're not looking for product specialists. Clients are looking for partners to help them navigate in different products, whether they're alternatives, fixed income, liquidity, equity. But most importantly, clients are looking for a firm that can provide risk management assessments of all of the products, and they're looking for a complete relationship. And I think the strong vote of confidence by the PBGC is a very good indication, though, in a hostile environment in alternatives, we are winning some large-scale assignments.</p>
          <p>Let me just touch on retail, the retail platform. We had positive flows as the retail platform overall in 2008. I think we're going to be one of the only platforms that can say that. Obviously, the fourth quarter was very hostile. We saw over $7 billion of outflows in our global retail platform. But obviously, we've had great growth in the first half, some growth in the third quarter, and we were able to be in the positive side. I think that speaks volumes about our products. More importantly, it does identify to the management team of BlackRock, to our Board, of our success in branding our platform, continuing to build our retail brand globally, and importantly, to continue to build our third-party channels of distribution.</p>
          <p>We are very proud of the work we're doing with our distributors. We're spending a great deal of time with our distributors, and as a result of that, we believe we are well positioned. I just have a note of caution about our distributors. As we know, there's been some seismic changes with our distributors. Merrill Lynch is now part of the BoA platform, and then we've seen now the Smith Barney platform merging with the Morgan Stanley platform.</p>
          <p>Our job is to work with all our distributors in making sure that their platforms, and BlackRock's relationships with those platforms, are strong. We look forward to working with every one of them, but with these changes in these distribution platforms, it's going to put a lot more pressure making sure and proving to the world, and to our clients, that BlackRock has the skill sets to be working with our clients, and we look forward to working with them.</p>
          <p>Institutional business continues to be a prime driver of our business. Fiduciary outsourcing, liability-driven investments, multi-asset strategy, these are the key terms. This is what clients are looking for. Clients are looking for a very much of a complete relationship. They are looking for portfolio advice; they're not looking to be just an equity wonk or just a bond wonk. They're looking for an understanding &#x2013; they're looking for a partnership to work together, and this is how we are positioned. This is how we are continuing to making sure we are well positioned to handle our clients' needs. And I believe having the one BlackRock platform, the one culture on a global basis, positions us well to handle those clients' needs. So, I believe having that platform will allow us to continue to help our clients navigate these hostile markets. And so, I look forward to building out our client relationships, globally and domestically, institutionally.</p>
          <p>On our cash and liquidity, we are very proud of our team in the liquidity business. I think 2008 clearly tested every liquidity firm. There are huge survivors and huge losers in 2008. Many firms have announced large, either purchases of assets that are taken out of their fund, huge losses associated with some of their portfolio decisions that they tried to make their clients whole. I would say very loudly, BlackRock navigated our positions very well. I think our performance in the fourth quarter, with asset growth in the fourth quarter, with our liquidity business, truly indicated our clients' willingness to work with us. I think the strength of the overall BlackRock platform continued to shine.</p>
          <p>In terms of market share, the data that we just received on 2a-7 funds, our market share was, our business was up 20.7%. The industry was up 17.5%. So we were able to pick up market share in 2a-7 funds. As you separate out, sec[urity] lending in the third and fourth quarter, you could really see the asset growth in our mutual fund liquidity business, and that was a very strong indication of our growth.</p>
          <p>We are very excited about the continuation of our liquidity business. We believe it's going to continue to be a large driver of our business. We are continuing to build our third-party distribution channels in liquidity in the United States, and we are looking to continue to build our international liquidity business. We believe there's great growth opportunities internationally.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, let's be honest: the liquidity business in 2009 is going to be challenged because of low interest rates, and low interest rates are going to put pressure on the liquidity business, at least in the retail business. Institutional business, we are not seeing any pressures to date. On a positive side, we hope one day clients will start moving money out of liquidity business and go back into long-dated assets, go back into alternatives, and hopefully, as BlackRock's platform allows us to work with our clients to be that navigator of the asset allocation, that we will be a part of their reallocation, whether it's in equities or fixed income, if there is a greater stability in our marketplaces.</p>
          <p>BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. I think everybody somewhat understood our business but I think people really did not understand how important this business has become to the BlackRock platform. 2007, our revenues was about $195 million; in 2008, the revenues crossed over $400 million. This is a portion of our Advisory business that we are doing and the Aladdin business that we are doing. We are proud to say we had 72 new assignments in 2008, 20 new assignments in the fourth quarter. We completed 46 short-term mandates in helping clients during 2008. We've had expanded Aladdin assignments. We won a new Aladdin assignment already this year, and we are working on a number of other large-scale Aladdin assignments going forward in 2009.</p>
          <p>We hope to be rolling out &#x2013; a part of our Aladdin product is our equity platform. Mid last year, we did buy Impact, which was more of an equity analytics that we are now going to be attaching to the strong analytics we have in terms of fixed income and alternative assets. And so, we look forward to building out our platform, our risk management platforms, with our clients to provide a more complete service with our clients.</p>
          <p>We believe our Advisory's platform, it's been very visible in the United States, working for some official institutions. We have just as much opportunity internationally, as official institutions are going to be looking to ring fence assets, ring fence banks, and we intend to continue to expand our Aladdin and Advisory BlackRock Solutions platform overseas in 2009. So we look forward to continue to building that out, and we are quite constructive on that platform.</p>
          <p>Let me just go into three or four more other points. I know I've been speaking a long time; we had a lot to say. I believe BlackRock's business model is positioned very well for 2009. We will be able to navigate ourselves quite successfully, I believe, in 2009, working with clients. I'm not here to predict what will happen in 2009. Obviously, it started very hostilely, and so, much of our business is a window of the market, so if beta continues to be hostile, it will be a hostile environment for financial institutions, including BlackRock. If beta stabilizes, and BlackRock continues to build our presence, retail, institutionally, internationally and here domestically, we will be very well positioned this year.</p>
          <p>I am very proud of the branding initiatives we did in 2008. I believe we are very well positioned to pick up more share globally. I believe our branding will continue to grow dramatically here, domestically, in the United States. I do believe there are going to be huge opportunities in the United States. I think historically you've heard me talk about more opportunities domestically, but I believe the opportunities will be just as large here, as we are seeing a transformation of the financial markets; as we are seeing a transformation in the financial institution arena. I believe we will be a large survivor in this, albeit the marketplace may force us to be smaller, but we will be a large survivor and a big winner in this.</p>
          <p>There are very large M&amp;A opportunities for BlackRock in 2009. I promise you, if we do anything, it will be for strategic and product expansion opportunities. But we do see large opportunities in front of us. We've had initial discussions with many different institutions. Obviously, the sea change is so dramatic that conversations come and go because of the problems associated with different firms, but I do believe ultimately we will find something that will be quite additive to this platform. But we're going to be very selective, if we end up doing anything.</p>
          <p>I would like to just also say two welcomes. We are very excited about the build-out of our relationship with Bank of America, as they are now a very large strategic partner of BlackRock. We believe this will be a very big business opportunity for BlackRock and Bank of America. We see huge opportunities already. We have been working with the management teams of the old Merrill and the new management teams of Bank of America to try to build products and revenues together, and we believe during the course of the year we will continue to build those opportunities.</p>
          <p>It would be wrong for me not to talk about our new Administration, with President Obama and his economic team. We believe the challenges that confront our economy are severe. We believe there's going to be great need to firewall assets. I've publicly stated in the past that I believe that TARP should have been used to ring-fence and firewall troubled assets. I don't believe putting equity in institutions is the first order of business. You need to stabilize balance sheets before equity has any virtue. If you don't stabilize assets, that money goes into equities doesn't help; you can't leverage that equity. So, once you stabilize assets, and then you infuse equity, that equity then can be used with 10:1 leverage, and lending will occur.</p>
          <p>So, I know Congress will be spending a great deal of time asking questions, why aren't people lending? Well, the main reason people aren't lending, we've seen, as we witnessed in different fourth quarter announcements, extreme destruction in asset quality &#x2013; you saw that in our non-operating earnings. And so, we believe there is a great need for some form of aggregator bank. We believe there's going to be a great need to stabilize balance sheets. And once we stabilize balance sheets, private equity and public equity will be very available to invest in financial institutions. And with that, that new equity will then be used to leverage and to lend.</p>
          <p>And so with that, we welcome everyone to 2009. Hopefully, the first few weeks are not an indicator of what we're going to look forward to for the 50-odd weeks. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I do have a couple of questions, though, big picture in nature for the most part. Larry, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the distribution. I thought you're going to go down this and you didn't flesh it out as far as I thought. There's been some significant consolidation: obviously, you highlighted Bank of America and Merrill, but we're also seeing it elsewhere &#x2013; the new joint venture that's about to be unfolded with Morgan Stanley and Salomon, Wachovia-Wells Fargo, etcetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you think the implications are for the industry from this historic consolidation: good, bad, or indifferent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think one other point that I think that, before we just talk about the consolidation, if anything, we've seen expansion of distributing channels, because we've seen the rise of the independent distributor. We're seeing more and more platforms pop up in the &#x2013; the independent FA [Financial Advisor] is now a very viable business and platform. And so I would say, obviously, the dynamics are changing. I would say as an industry, I think you're going to see a need to have stronger relationships with fewer manufacturers.</p>
          <p>So I believe that type of consolidation is a very big positive for a firm like BlackRock and other large-scale platforms. I think it's a very negative for the specialists or small mutual fund platforms. I think they're going to be choked in terms of the distribution channels. The distribution channels will probably extract more leverage. They're going to probably try to extract more fees, but I believe the large-scale platforms will manufacture; they're going to be the net beneficiaries of that.</p>
          <p>With some of the names, without getting into the details, we saw in one of the cases &#x2013; one of those third-party distribution channels away from the Merrill B of A &#x2013; we went to, I believe, the number one net sales with one of those third-party distributors, and I think we are now ranked third, maybe even second, in terms of net sales with one of those aggregators of &#x2013; one of those firms that are combining. So we see this is a real positive. We see these firms are going to be looking for a more complete relationship, and are looking &#x2013; they're looking for more partnerships, relationship. They're going to become institutional, with the gatekeepers, and so I think we'll be a beneficiary of that consolidation.</p>
          <p>As I said, I think, in the third quarter &#x2013; and I didn't mention it this time &#x2013; we have, despite our downsizing in personnel, we have one of our big growth areas is to continue to expand our distribution platform with third-party distributors. So we're planning to be hiring there, despite, obviously, the consolidation of these three platforms, but we believe the role of the independent distribution platform is going to grow and we need to be spending more time with those platforms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, terrific. Second question I have is just coming back to the cash management business for a moment. It seems like this is an industry &#x2013; part of the industry that's poised for significant consolidation &#x2013; there was some recent press out there suggesting that, I think, a study by the G-30, that the cash management business should have some kind of capital allocation against it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I was wondering what your view is on that, and how that might influence your participating in that part of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are a loud and large believer that capital should be &#x2013; capital charges, or the ability to reserve &#x2013; is a very important component. So, we are probably louder than most of the players in this business on that. I don't believe the ICI has that position. I believe they're against that position. We are very much in favor of that position. We have been asking our auditors, can we reserve one or two basis points on our money management liquidity business for years, and we were not allowed to, because, obviously, auditors don't allow you to do any reserving. But we believe by having some type of government oversight, with the idea that we are having capital reserves, is a very, very important component for the future of money market funds. I believe, as your investors know that there's capital behind those funds, it gives more stability to the business.</p>
          <p>I believe the challenges in '08 were, why should I have money with money market funds when I could go to a bank and the bank is FDIC guaranteed? To me, that's a bigger challenge for the long-term survival of money market business. And so, we believe the money market business, which is essentially a shadow banking business, should be treated like a banking business with capital charges associated with it, or reserves associated with it. We believe it's going to force, Bill, even a greater consolidation in the money market business, and obviously, for the small firms that do not have the scale, the added capital charges or the reserving for capital, is they're going to force down profitability even more, and is going to make it a more of a scale business than ever before. So we're in favor of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just two other final questions. I wonder if you could quantify the savings from the head count reduction, and where those reductions came from. And then, Ann Marie, if you could just flesh out the FX impact on both revenues and expenses this quarter one more level, if you don't mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On head count, I think you can estimate it fairly easily by just taking 500 people times a fully comped personnel &#x2013; person that would be at an average rate for a full-sized firm. So, that I think, you can get at very easily.</p>
          <p>As far as the FX, I would just differentiate between two things: one, the FX that I mentioned with respect to G&amp;A is the balance sheet-related FX. I think what you're asking about is FX related to revenues and related to expenses, where we do have some balance, in that we do have euro and sterling revenues, but we also have very significant sterling-based costs. So we do have a positive margin business, but on the other hand, we do have costs, very material costs, in the same places where we have very material revenues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I had a question on the Advisory base fees, so that they ticked down a fair amount sequentially, and it looks like equity imbalance was hit the hardest. Is that a function of mix? Is it less equities inside of equities imbalance &#x2013; or is there anything unusual there, or is that the run rate to think about going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roger, when you talk about Advisory, you're not talking about the BlackRock Solutions Advisory, I'm sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that was predominantly just driven by the fact that</p>
          <p>the market hit equity imbalance the most. So, really, what I said in my comments was, really, base fees represent the bulk of the equity decline, and within that, 80 to 90% of it &#x2013; in one case over 90%, depending on period you're comparing to &#x2013; is related to equities imbalance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I said, in the fourth quarter, we did see in the retail platforms outflows in equities, but the market was so dominant. And I would also say we did have positive alpha. So, it was just dominated by beta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I was asking in terms of the basis points, right?, the 33.4 basis points in aggregated from 3Q going to 28.7. I think you answered it. It does sound like it's mix: it's less equities in there, which means ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yeah. That's all it is, yes. You answered it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And then on comp and just to come back, I think you partially answered the question previously, but if we were to look at &#x2013; I'm assuming part of the downtick in the contra revenues was a reversal of prior accruals, maybe bonus accruals in there. How would you think about a fair comp-to-revenue ratio for the 4Q, adjusting from any reversals previously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I looked at the data and I think one thing you can do is look at the full-year comp-to-revenue ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that was actually good, I mean actually down sequentially, which is surprising given the ...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 5%, about flat to a year ago. And rather than look just at the fourth quarter, I'd look at the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But see, as a guidepost, there's no question the first half, Roger, we had some large performance fees that were <mark type="inaudible" />. So it's being skewed a lot, in terms of the destruction of assets, especially in some of the areas where there's some large performance fees in the first half that were totally wiped out in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you adjusted your human resource base in 4Q, markets are down another 10% here. Going into the year, you said you're going to proactively continue to cut costs. Are you staffed appropriately for where we're at right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are going to be &#x2013; we analyze that all the time, and there is, at the moment, there are no plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I don't want to mislead anybody to say that this is not a dynamic situation that we all have to look at. And I will say we also have strategic opportunities from the BlackRock Solutions area, our retail distribution area, we're going to continue to grow. But I would not suggest that we would not do staff reduction if we needed to, if the market continues to erode. But I will say, loud and clear, we are not anticipating any at this moment. And there's no plans for it at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. And then on the Advisory inflows, at 100 billion or so in the fourth quarter, I know you've been hesitant to talk about fee structures tied to that, but now it's obviously getting to be more significant. And so if we think about the comments you've made, which is they're large assignments, they are fixed income in nature, they are complex. Does that mean that they're around, and when you bake that all in, around what a fixed income capture rate is, or a little bit higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, they're actually lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>They are lower. So lower than the 17, 18 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't go into that, because some of the assignments are official institutions, where we cannot discuss it, and yes, they are lower. But I will say they're profitable, and they're very important for this platform, and obviously by looking at the delta of growth of revenues, it's significant in the Solutions space. And so, it's a significant component of our growth, and it will be a significant component of our growth in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and last thing, Larry, just macro. Do you think &#x2013; I don't know if you've made public comments on this &#x2013; do you think cramdown legislation is an appropriate course of action? Will it be effective? Wilbur Ross actually is on the tape while we're on this call, saying that he thinks mortgages should just be reset at 100% of current home prices. Does that makes sense to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Here's the situation: there's a lot to be said about in the subprime space, that we need to keep people in their homes, and there needs to be a reappraisal of the valuations. In some of the mortgage space, you have assets trading at 0.20 and $0.30, and yet, the defaults at the moment are only running at 20%. And so, you have a huge difference. So, you have a lot of room to revalue the asset, and so maybe the mortgage is now worth $0.50. There's still a gain in the subprime space.</p>
          <p>So, there are many areas where resetting the principal amount of a mortgage is very doable, and there's not a real loser in the whole situation. The situation that we are saying loudly to our government, loudly to our new economic team, is that if we force cramdown with assets that are trading more closely to par and we harm the security holders, the foreigners who own tens of billions of dollars of our mortgages, who believe they can get par back, and the mortgages that are crammed down, we will disrupt capital demand for our mortgage business for a long time.</p>
          <p>And so what we are telling our government, do not, in the sake of helping homeowners, harm our investors. You're going to have to change security law in the grantor trust in many ways. And so, this has to be done cooperatively with the security industry, with government, with the mortgage industry. The cramdown, overall, if we're talking about cramming down everything, that would have some severe impact in our global capital markets, and I would hasten to say that we will have a hard time finding buyers of our mortgage credit in the future.</p>
          <p>So, this is a very delicate situation. It should be done cooperatively with the security industry, with the groups that are representing security holders, to do it properly. So, it is not a clear and cut answer, but overall, if we're talking cramdown in the entire mortgage industry, I would say that would be cause much greater long-term havoc and damage than what we are experiencing now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Just, first, one question on a follow-up on the fee rate. I understand the negative mix in assets pressuring the overall fee rate, but if I just look at the equity assets and the equity fees, the rate on the equity assets seemed to come down significantly in the quarter, sequentially. So, I was just wondering if there was some sort of shift in there in terms of more equity versus balance, retail versus institutional, or if there are any fee cuts in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no. (A), there was no fee cuts; there was the mix. We saw more outflows and more beta declines in some of our European equity products, especially our energy products, which were much higher fees. And that's just, as you know, what has happened to the energy sector, so that was probably some of the highest fee products, and that was where that we saw in the third and fourth quarter the greatest declines in NAVs. And so, it's really a mix within equities. There are no fee changes or fee waivers. It is just the mix going out of some of the more specialized equity products into the more core equity products, and that's all you're seeing. The dynamics are nothing but that.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then just on the non-operating income, in terms of the investment portfolio and losses, can you give any more color &#x2013; and I think this is more just looking forward to try to gauge that the portfolio and the losses, whether in the first quarter or throughout ''09 &#x2013; just in terms of the relative buckets of the assets, I know you guys give the breakdown in terms of the hits during the quarter. And then, just overall, if the portfolio is down about 25% &#x2013; and granted, depending on the market, markets could be down anywhere from 10 to all the way up to 50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just trying to get a sense of some of the relative levels of where these valuations are, whether it's in private equity, or real estate, or distressed. And then, the final one is when you do look at valuing these assets, for any of them that you're getting from, say, fund of funds, or third-party providers, is there any way to do a valuation check on what they're giving you, so within <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'll let Ann Marie answer the core question, but we have third-party providers go in in all our fund of funds advisory assignments. So we are not taking &#x2013; there's no question: we are not taking their manager valuations. We are going in and getting a third-party appraiser, and I think that's probably industry standard; that's not unusual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say on the first one, the first question was the distribution of the portfolio. The last time we talked about it, we said, we mentioned five asset classes being the more public market, distressed credit, hedge funds and fund of funds, and private equity, and real estate; and that each of those represented between 15 and 25% of the total portfolio. That distribution of our investments remains the same, even with the marks. So, the portfolio, in proportion, may have moved within those ranges, but still remains about there.</p>
          <p>As far as the marks go, we don't rely solely on broker quotes, or anything. We look through to the assets, we look through to the cash flows, and make sure we understand. We do have the duty to make sure we're looking at those, as appropriate hiring outside managers. And I'm sorry, what's the middle one?</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Roger Smith, with Fox-Pitt Kelton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How you doing? Thanks a lot and I just want to talk about more on the institutional side, and I know you talked about your clients looking for one provider. I just want to try and understand, when you're out there talking to them, what should we be thinking about in terms of their target allocations? I know you said they're rebalancing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, really, how does the role that you guys are going to play change with the consultants, and what would the consultants' role be on a go-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me go over allocations. It really depends; as I said, it really depends on the client's liabilities. If a client has assets that are substantially lower than their liabilities, they're probably going to be reallocating out of fixed income, more into equities. If clients are imbalanced because of liquidity issues, they're probably allocating out of alternatives, as best they can, into more liquid assets. If clients are just totally frightened, they are allocating out of all long-dated assets into cash. We are trying to recommend clients to shy away from cash as much as possible, to start reinvesting, and so.</p>
          <p>And really, we take an asset -and-liability approach to all our clients. There's not one formula; it really depends on the clients' needs, their cash flow needs, their timing needs, and so, but I think it's fair to say clients overall are looking for more stable returns. They're willing to accept much lower returns now for more stable return. So I think that's a generalized statement, and so there's not one formula.</p>
          <p>And in terms of our relationship with consultants &#x2013; and consultants are still a large driver of our business &#x2013; consultants are actually also getting into the asset management business, as they play a role as an asset allocator, and we are too. So in lot of ways, we're playing some role as a consultant with some clients, and some clients we are working alongside with consultants, in terms of working on asset allocations.</p>
          <p>There's not one right model, but service, the opportunities are being blurred between the BlackRock platform and some consultants, but we know consultants are a very large component of our client business. We work with them. We try to make their business better. We are not trying to take away business from consultants, but we're just trying to be a larger partner with our clients, our direct clients. And in those cases when they are looking for more of a fiduciary relationship, we are taking on those responsibilities.</p>
          <p>Fiduciary outsourcing is growing much larger in Europe, and this is where we want a large amount of fiduciary mandates, in Europe. And Europe, this is where the consultant community had less of a historical role. And then you'll have, I would say, the partnership type of relationships we have, such as the PBGC, which I mentioned; a consultant played a role in that. A consultant was very active working with the client, and we acted as a partner, working alongside with the consultant and the client. So, once again, there's not a real model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then, really, on the Advisory business, I know with these assets that you're getting in, I know you don't want to talk too much about the fee pressure, but what are the expectations of the client, in terms of the duration of some of these mandates? Is this something that a lot of them are thinking might be a 12 to 18-month deal, or is this something that we can end up seeing stay for five years, or 10 years or more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's probably more appropriate to think five to 10 years. I think if the assignment is done with some official institution, the main purpose is to stabilize the assets, work out the assets, but most importantly, not disrupt the marketplace. And so, if you told me in two years the market is going to be totally fine, and it's going to be able to handle more supply and more opportunities, then it's a shorter term assignment. I think our expectation's that it is much longer than two years or 18 months. I think our expectations is north of five years, but it really depends on the global economy and the global capital markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh no, that's good, and then just the last question's on Quellos, with the pressure in the fund of funds business. How is that really playing in this total product that you're offering, and do you see fee pressures, and even with you're seeing a lot of funds cutting their fees; is that pressuring the other managers, or do you not see as much of that happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Once again, I think, the Quellos product, which we don't call it Quellos anymore, the BAA product, was one of the products that was part of, like, the PBGC. So, there was a good example of cross-selling products. There was a real estate product and a fund of funds product. And so, it really depends on the product, but we are not seeing fee pressure. We are seeing people question the whole alternative space, as I suggested, and I think this is an industry problem. And yet, I do believe there is a greater role for high quality fund of funds platforms that do the due diligence, that have the systems of risk monitoring.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, there are many fund of funds platforms that were a big allocator of Madoff, and so it puts a black eye in the entire industry. Where were their risk management tools? Where were their alarms, when an institution played every role, from custodian and everything else in terms of assets? To me, there were just some big open questions that really throw the whole question of the virtue and value of fund of funds with some people. I believe, overall, it's going to play much less &#x2013; there is a active role for fund of funds. I believe a platform like BlackRock, with a risk technology, enter in having the BAA space a part of overall platform, will play well for those who are still believers of the fund of funds space.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question will come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's been a lot of discussion in this industry to how it's really going to evolve, and one demand we're seeing in your results is stronger demand for advisory business. But history would tell us that there should be some decent pent-up demand for some institutional equity products, too, and I'm just wondering, in your view, is it that advisory asset liability, other fixed income, cash management should continue to take share here, even in the case of rebounding markets, or is this really just a function of higher risk premiums? Is that really why we're still seeing large demand for fixed income products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a complete answer to that. I believe at this moment there's a view that I took: fixed income credit stabilizes and narrows; it's very difficult to think equity products can go that far. So I believe the first order of business, we need to see a big rally in a lot of the credit products. We need to see stability in a lot of the credit products, and then we'll see equity products rebound very strongly.</p>
          <p>It is our view that we are going to see, sometime in the future, that stability. But we do believe the equity markets will respond much quicker than people, than most people believe in, by just looking at how much money is in cash, and that money will rush into equities much faster than people think, once we see the stability in the credit markets. And so we are recommending to clients to add to their equity allocations, but pay attention to liquidity this time.</p>
          <p>I actually think, if you look at the mutual fund flows, we saw huge historical outflows in the large cap series of products industry-wide as people started to navigate into different specialized products, and navigate into alternative products. I actually believe we can see, for the first time in maybe a 10-year cycle, a large flow back into large cap series types of products, be it value, or growth, or core, as people are going to value liquidity a lot greater and value large cap products, which provide probably the most complete liquidity of all the alternative and equity products, so, and in products like global allocation. So, we believe you're going to see that.</p>
          <p>As I noted, we are starting to see more and more inquiry &#x2013; and we've had in our pipeline a couple of large wins in the last few days. So, we're starting to see client activities pick up. But on the other hand, I think clients are going through their whole asset and liability review now, over the next four to 10 weeks, and I think you're going to see some real large allocations, and we would recommend to clients to go heavily into credit and go into equities. We believe, unless you're frightened of the world, you should not be in Treasuries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. I think, what my question is really trying to get at is the potential persistency of your Advisory and your cash management business, should the markets rebound here, which would benefit the equity piece?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, cash management, I expect cash management to fall. If markets rebound dramatically, I believe the whole industry assets will fall. Hopefully, we will continue to pick up share, but we expect, yeah, we certainly expect that assets will fall in liquidity.</p>
          <p>On the Advisory business, actually, I believe '09, maybe 2010 there's going to be very large opportunities for us. I believe there are going to large-scale needs to stabilize financial institutions globally. I believe we will have some great opportunities to work with these institutions. I believe there's a global appreciation to risk management, and I believe our Aladdin platform will be a very large growth part of our future business. And as I said, I believe that the advice part of our Advisory business will grow dramatically, even if there is stability in assets, as you've suggested there may be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a quick one for Ann Marie: when you look at comp expense, there's, my view is two large unusuals in the quarter &#x2013; one from deferred comp, and one from the severance. If you take them out and think about how comp should trend in the next year, is that a core number, or is there additional expense reductions that we haven't seen really play out in the fourth quarter yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when you think about the fourth quarter, you are correctly adjusting for the comp, and we've given you that detail, the comp-related hedge stuff, so you take that out. I think that you think about the full-year comp-to-revenue ratio, which you need to factor in, and then really as far as the head count reductions, that really didn't come into play till probably the beginning of December. So, it's a partial quarter effect of that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. How you doing? Just really, two quick questions. The first relates to the MBS purchase program, understanding your reluctance to talk about the fee structure, but is it, assuming the program hits its targets of upwards of 500 billion of purchases in the first half of the year, should we expect that it's going to be about 100 billion, of thereabouts, of flows of that program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did not include that in our flows, that program, and I don't believe we will, because I don't believe it's proper for us to describe what's going on. We'll let the client announce that specific program, so we are trying to be as opaque on that as we feasibly can. I can't even talk about it; that's a program that I'll <mark type="inaudible" /> the client through their official releases discuss it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well maybe just from a geography on the financials perspective; is that going to show up in fixed income assets, or advisory assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we're not certain whether we're going to show those as assets. The revenues will show &#x2013; we'll show the revenues in Advisory, but I don't believe that specific program may &#x2013; we have not determined whether we will show that even in the assets.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a quick question on the balance sheet to Ann Marie, maybe just get a quick update on maybe a snapshot what it looks like now in terms of, I would put it, free cash? If there was any kind of debt reduction in the quarter? Just trying to get a sense for what the net cash position looks like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to be a positive cash flow business. We, of course, haven't published the balance sheet yet, but there were no, really, changes in our debt position. We neither took on more debt, nor did we prepay any debt. So you're going to see a pretty stable balance sheet. The one thing I would remind you of, which is an annual event, is that year-end cash does tend to be higher than the end of first quarter cash because of incentive comp and the timing of that payment.</p>
