        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks very much for coming today. Let's begin with the results of the 2007 fiscal year. We have a very tight agenda. So we're going to divide this presentation into three parts. First, we'll talk about the Group results and then Renovables, and then we'll have the Q&amp;A session. The mother company, Iberdrola -- and between the Iberdrola results and the Renovables, we'll take our coffee break.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. First of all, I would like to thank those that are listening through the webpage and those that are here in person for your interest in the company. Today, as always, we have Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, the Director of Finance; Luis San Pedro, Director of Operations; and Luis del Valle, as you know, is CEO of ScottishPower and other operations within the Group.</p>
          <p>The results -- Group results will be structured as follows. On the one hand, I'm going to take a look at the results of 2007. Then, Jos&#xE9; Luis del Valle is going to talk about the major aspects of the financial situation of ScottishPower. Then, Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada will do our financial results of the Group result. And then, I'll come back with some conclusions.</p>
          <p>Now, the net benefit of Iberdrola has a record, which is almost 42% increase over 2006. This growth is based on the operational results of 42.4% increase in EBITDA. Together, with the solid evolution of traditional business of Iberdrola in 2007, we have also carried out three operations, which have consolidated the company as one of the main energy companies in the world -- the integration of ScottishPower, the going public of Renovables, and Energy East in the United States.</p>
          <p>In terms of ScottishPower in the Group has -- this has concluded with success and in a record time. In just over eight months, this is both a financial success, 1.3 billion EBITDA, which is 25% of the Group results from the strategic point of view. In this sense, we should point out that in addition to the fundamental contribution of the other parts of its business, ScottishPower has contributed its renewable assets in the UK and the United States.</p>
          <p>Hence, this segregation and merger situation of this business in the Group, we have managed to put Renovables on the stock market. It's the number one wind energy company in the world. And it's number seven on the IBEX. Iberdrola has also been able to carry out these operations at record time and situating its leverage at 42.4% as -- and as a result, the rating agents have given the company an "A" rating.</p>
          <p>And finally, I wanted to point out that once with this capital -- after the capital increase, the profit per shares has increased by 14% in 2007, which is more than the average of the 2000/2006 period. Therefore, the operations carried out have had a positive impact in terms of profit per share from the very first year.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the major points in 2007, Iberdrola has diversified its business. Production has increased by 34%, up to more than 120,000 GWh, and with an increase of distributed energy by 25% to 160,000 GW. So these figures only account Energy East and PPM as of April, just eight months.</p>
          <p>Also, ScottishPower has diversified its mix -- production mix. And Iberdrola with the thermal and wind energy, has done this in the UK and the United States markets, which are now 19% of the total of our production.</p>
          <p>Now, Spain has reduced its relative weight from 80% in 2006 to 54% in 2007, which shows that the internationalization process has been very successful over this past year. Indeed, Iberdrola now is a more international group and a stronger group and, in 2007, has an EBITDA over &#x20AC;5.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Also, could I comment on the contributions in the UK and the US with just eight months, 26% of the total, and this complements a solid position of Iberdrola in Spain and in Latin America. In 2008, we expect the international business in EBITDA to pass 50% in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>In terms of operational expenses, the company continues to be efficient and making efficiency one of its major, major issues. In this expansion period, the increase in our gross margin is 1.25 times the operational expenses, showing that efficiency has increased by 6%.</p>
          <p>As I said before, eight months after having closed the operation with ScottishPower and just a little bit more than a year after announcing it, the situation of the company has been -- the merger has been a major success.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to talk about the contribution of the workers of this Scottish company, which have blended very well into the company, with results that are now 25% of the total results of the Group, and a unified management system for everyone, and the work on the acceleration and synergies and saving -- cost savings.</p>
          <p>So I'd also like to thank them and their Spanish colleagues, which have also made a considerate effort, and they've worked side by side to benefit on both sides. ScottishPower in terms of its assets in renewables in the US and the UK has been key in this second axis -- strategic axis.</p>
          <p>The going public of Renovables with more than 7,700 installed MW -- almost 8,000 now. This is the number one company in the world in this sector and has a fantastic prospectus for the future based, on the one hand, with a portfolio of more than 42,000 MW, and in terms of access to the best machinery guaranteeing through contracts with the major suppliers, and is the number one player in this business. So it has tremendous efficiency in that regard.</p>
          <p>On a record time, we've been able to reorder and split companies and integrate human teams and gone public in just six months. Just a few weeks ago, this company also formed part of the IBEX-35, where it is now the number seventh Spanish company for capitalization.</p>
          <p>In terms of the development of authorization for the takeover of Energy East, we are complying with the timetable that we announced at the beginning of the operation. We have all of the federal permits. And the only state permit that we need is from the State of New York, and that process is underway. So we hope to be able to complete this operation by the middle of 2008.</p>
          <p>Also, in 2007, we've invested more than &#x20AC;25 billion. And therefore, the balance sheet of the company has doubled to &#x20AC;68 billion, reinforcing our financial solidity. And finally, the increase of 42% in net profit and 47% in operational cash flow, reaching almost &#x20AC;4 billion, is 14% of the profit and 18% of the cash flow per average shares showing, therefore, the operations have had positive impact on the bottomline this year.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to give the floor to Jos&#xE9; Luis del Valle, who's going to talk about the results of ScottishPower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When we announced the Iberdrola ScottishPower, we talked about synergies and other operational cost reductions for &#x20AC;130 billion by the third year in addition to &#x20AC;45 million per year for four or five years in terms of savings and investments.</p>
          <p>These objectives have now been increased to 204 and &#x20AC;62 million, respectively, as a result of the efforts made by our teams in the UK and in Spain to transfer our best practices in both directions, as our chairman has just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Now, through each quarter in 2007, we have been observing this favorable development of the costs that we're able to control, both in terms of personnel and external services, which have fallen by 7.6% as a result of the efficiency measures taken -- both at the corporate headquarters where we've had a decrease of 30%, and in terms of commercial expenses which is where we're now having greater profitability, while at the same time optimizing the customer portfolio, which has been maintained above 5.2 million.</p>
          <p>Also being implemented, we have 61 projects of all types with a view to cut costs by &#x20AC;160 million by 2010. And we have already achieved, in 2007, reductions, which year-on-year, are more than &#x20AC;30 million. In terms of commercial expenses, we have reduced costs, while at the same time enhancing operational and financial variables.</p>
          <p>Operationally speaking, we've had less claims by Energywatch by 61%, and the customer satisfaction index has increased to 66% according to Uswitch. We have also been the number one company in the UK in complying with our obligations and commitments for energy efficiency. And financially, we've reduced by 13% the amount of time for doubtful payments.</p>
          <p>Now, we've also maintained a level of thermal production, despite the programmed outages at our plants to carry out environmental improvements, and especially, the installation of the desulphur plant at the Longannet coal power plant.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the grid, we've also improved costs. We're now in the first percentile -- 25% percentile in terms of efficiency, while at the same time, reducing the interruptions in the grid by 13% that is improving reliability of the grid.</p>
          <p>Now just briefly, I'm going to now talk about the timetable of operations for our Energy East project. As the Chairman has mentioned, we have achieved the four federal authorizations required and from the States of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine. We only need now the authorization from the State of New York, which we hope to achieve before the end of the first half of 2008, thus, complying with the timetable that we had announced.</p>
          <p>Now, our request is, now at arbitration stage before the Administrative Judge and the technical services of the Pubic Commission Service of New York have subjected our proposal &#x2013; their conditions proposal to approve the transaction. And we've also made our allegations.</p>
          <p>Now &#x2013; so these technical services have requested the Administrative Judge to stop the process until the situation has been clarified in terms of the rumors on the future of Iberdrola but the process continues forward. And on the 27th we will have the oral hearing with the Administrative Judge, but this will not prevent, either before or after that date, that we could retake the negotiations with the technical services with a view to reaching an agreement, which could speed up the timetable envisaged. And the objective is still June of 2008 to finalize that project. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Now, we'll have Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, who will give some details on the accounts.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good mornings. As always, I'm going to take a very quick look at the balance sheet. 2007 has been a year of consolidation. There's been quite a bit of change and, just if we look at the accounts of the different areas. And as clear as possible, I'm going to first going to explain what each area reflects. Once we've finished this session I think the investors &#x2013; we are at your disposal if you need any further specific clarifications.</p>
          <p>As you can see, by the different business lines we've had quite a bit of movement within the Iberdrola Group. So we've defined three major groups of consolidated accounts, each one with a different color.</p>
          <p>The first is Iberdrola before ScottishPower, excluding renewables. Here, the liberalized and regulated business in Latin America. Here, we have the same perimeter in 2007. The second group, which is Iberdrola Renovables, includes the whole year of Iberdrola Renovables and the last quarter of ScottishPower renewables. That's the UK part of the business and all of PPM.</p>
          <p>And the third group is ScottishPower, includes the business in the UK with except renewables from the 23 April to 31December, and the renewable business in the UK and PPM from 23 April to 30 September. So as you can see, it's a little bit complicated, but we'll try to explain this as clearly as possible.</p>
          <p>Before going on to the accounts, I'm going to talk about impact on our balance sheet of the emission rates in 2006 and 2007. Thanks to the conservative policy in our result of our balance sheet, the provisions that we made in 2006, 2007 compensate for the negative impact of the rate.</p>
          <p>And finally, the definitive price assigned to the bi-lateralized is &#x20AC;49.43. Since Iberdrola had already talked about &#x20AC;42.43 following the Royal Decree, this brings us to a situation where &#x20AC;149 million additional, which are in the distribution, account. Also the negative impact of the loss of rights means an increase in the provisions for 2006, even the loss of rights that we had originally provided for. And we also increased this by &#x20AC;115 million in terms &#x2013; this is in the area of generation.</p>
          <p>Therefore, as we can see in the gross margin of Distribution compensates for the additional provisions that we had to make. And finally, just a comment that Iberdrola has &#x20AC;361m in terms of the tariff gap compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to take a quick look at the major aspects of the balance sheet. Once again, this is the legal balance sheet, not the pro forma sheet and so there's different changes and complications in the integration of ScottishPower since 23 April of last year, together with the good behavior of the operations in Latin America. And nine Energy operations accounted for strong growth in all of the lines of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>A growth in EBITDA by 42.4% up to &#x20AC;5.5 billion and net profit by 41.8% to &#x20AC;2.2 billion, just to give an estimate figure of what could have been the pro forma of the Group, on EBITDA this would've grown by 15%, in net profit, by almost 21%.</p>
          <p>And now, looking at the different parts of the accounts, the income of the Group increased by 58% to over &#x20AC;17 billion. First of all, given the ScottishPower assets, which are 5.8 billion, second of all, Renovables increased by 37% to 9.5 billion, Latin America and Non-Energy, we have growth up 24 and 33% respectively. Only Energy in Spain fell by 1.1% to 6.2 billion affected by the lower production and lower wholesale electricity prices.</p>
          <p>In terms of the provision of the Group 83% -- it grew by 83% and also to the ScottishPower, which was 3.7 billion. In terms of the sales in Latin America Non-Energy sales grew by 27 and 51% compared to a fall of the Energy of 1.8%, given the lower production and the improvement of the mix and lower price of fossil fuels.</p>
          <p>Now, in the consolidated the gross margin rose by 48% reaching &#x20AC;8.2 billion. And ScottishPower together have 1.98 billion. And their gross margin of Energy in Spain grew by 3.6% to &#x20AC;3.6 billion, compared to a fall in the first nine months of the year by 2%, thanks to a growth of 17% in this business over the last quarter.</p>
          <p>The Latin American business and the non-energy maintained growth in 2007, and by 20.4 and 18.3% respectively. Renovables increased its gross margin by 18.3% to reaching &#x20AC;8.2 billion. Net operational costs grew by 35% reaching &#x20AC;2.4 billion. This, as the Chairman pointed out, is growth of almost eight points lower than the growth of gross margin. ScottishPower contributed &#x20AC;5.7 billion to these expenses. Renovables 2.4 billion, also point out that the Group that we've called Iberdrola, the costs fell by 3.4% to &#x20AC;1.68 billion, thanks for the fall in the personnel costs by 17%, given the positive impact of the pre-retirement plan that was implemented in 2006, and compensates for the increasing cost of extra outsourcing by 15.6%.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of attributes we have a strong growth for two reasons. First, and the most important, is because as the deduction for that &#x20AC;115 million for emissions was accounted as an added tax. And the second, in 2006, we had an environmental profit which we didn't have this year for &#x20AC;78 million. And so once we've deducted these impacts this would be -- things are growing as the rest of the company consolidated result is 41.2% to &#x20AC;5.3 billion. And the inclusion of ScottishPower provides &#x20AC;1.3 billion. And we should also point out that in terms of the growth of EBITDA in Spain in the last quarter, which had fallen by 7%, grew by 2% to &#x20AC;2.246 billion.</p>
          <p>In Latin America in Non-Energy business generated -- continued to grow in 2007, 25.3 and 14.5%, Renovables grew as well to &#x20AC;5.69 billion in Latin America. The EBIT grew by 39% to &#x20AC;3.6 billion, just under the growth of EBITDA. Given the increase of 49% of the amortizations and provisions, which is really broken down to the growth of amortization of 52.8% and provisions by 29.2%.</p>
          <p>The increase in amortizations of &#x20AC;55 billion is broken down into three parts. One, 148 million for the increase in assets and operations due to the investments of the Group. 441 million which are the result of the operation of ScottishPower of which 209 correspond to PPA. And three, the amortization of the Generation assets of both Groups, ScottishPower had a useful life for the combined cycle of 35 years, and Wind power for 25 years, while Iberdrola had 30 and 20 respectively. So we decided to maintain the ScottishPower criteria and cycles and the Iberdrola end part, so this means an improvement of 37 million in amortizations.</p>
          <p>The increase in provisions by &#x20AC;60 million corresponds to the 24 million in Iberdrola and &#x20AC;36 million more from the participation of ScottishPower to the consolidated Group. And provisions also includes provisions non-recurring, which can be quantified in more than 100 and some million euros of the total amount for provisions. The financial results were &#x20AC;901 million, 73.6% higher than the 2006 figure, given the increase in the average volume of the debt, around &#x20AC;20 billion, especially debt in pounds, which higher interest rates than the euro for the purchase of ScottishPower, which was almost doubling our debt, and an increase in the interest rates from 4.4 to 5.1%.</p>
          <p>Before tax profit grew by almost 30% to &#x20AC;3.98 billion. This growth is just a little lower than EBIT, given the increased financial cost that compensated by the non-recurring costs, which was 41% to &#x20AC;2.61 billion, basically, through the sale of 3% of the electricity grid, and for the sale of buildings. And in terms of the equivalency figures, we had the lower participation of participating companies in 2007 compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>The net profit, therefore, grew by 42% reaching &#x20AC;2.35 billion. This increase is greater than the profit before tax, given the lower tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006; the tax rate which we estimate will be maintained over the upcoming years. The reason is basically because the state rate went from 35 to 32.5% and next year it will go from 32.5 to 30%. Secondly, the regional regulatory does not reduce -- which is from 32 to 28%, and the tax rate of ScottishPower is around 30% and will fall to 28%.</p>
          <p>And finally, both in the regional legislation and in Latin America we've had deductions for investment. Also, in 2006, the rate was higher than normal because we had greater deductions in futures for that, 35% down to 30%. We should also point out, finally, the strong growth of 46% of the funds generated through operations which is close to &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>Well, looking at the results of our business, let's look at the Liberalized Business Spain. We include commercial Generation and the non-regulated Gas. First of all, there's a drop of 26.8% of the pool price. There's a change in the mix in the system, an increase of production of 3.3% and a 4% in Hydro electricity. And there's a reduction of the fuel costs and CO2 costs. The provisioning of fuel has gone down by 12% and we have improved the rest of the mix.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have improved the production and ordinary regime because there is a lower nuclear production due to the loads in Coventes and Banda Yosa and a better utilization of the mixed cycles. So we have reduced the margin. The gas business is improving and it compensates the lower wholesale prices.</p>
          <p>This has meant that there has been a gross margin fall of 23.6% to &#x20AC;1.995 billion, due to lower prices and production. This has been compensated by the commercial business and by the gas business, and a reduction of the storage cost. The EBITDA has gone down to &#x20AC;1.995 billion. This means that we have now an EBITDA of 1.250 billion. This has been influenced because there is a lower capacity payment of 95 million and a claw back of &#x20AC;149 million. And Iberdrola, contrary to other companies, looks at distribution and not only generation, so these two impacts mean &#x20AC;144 million.</p>
          <p>In Renovables, the Group installed capacity as a whole reaches 7.704 billion megawatts and the Group Production 13,309 gigawatts, which is 69% more. In Spain, we have 59% of our installed capacity. And concerning the production, 50% is produced in Spain and 31% in the United States. The gross margin has increased by 18.3% and our EBITDA has increased by 1.3%, achieving &#x20AC;563 million.</p>
          <p>The exchange of tariff meter means that it's difficult to compare the evolution. The expenses are determined by the international rate of growth and by the restructuring emerging cost that has an influence on -- in 2007, but they won't be recurrent in the years to come. During the presentation on Renovables, we'll talk about this again.</p>
          <p>The gross margin is up by 83.8% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion. This is due to increase of our gross margin by 83.8% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion. This is due to increase of our gross margin by 83.8% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion. As a consequence of these increases, we have increased our EBITDA. This is due to the change in Royal Decree 2006 and 2007. Furthermore, we must add 200 million of costs that we had when we started purchasing on the market a year ago. And then we -- instead of having &#x20AC;43, we have now 42.5.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we must stress the net operating cost that goes down by 10.5%, because we've improved our efficiency and we have organized our retirement fund.</p>
          <p>The contribution of ScottishPower to the Group, concerning the gross margin since the April 23, amounted to &#x20AC;1.7 billion; 86% coming from the United Kingdom and the rest of it from PPM. Concerning the EBITDA, we have &#x20AC;1.1 billion, 105 from the United Kingdom and 122 from the United States. We have used derivatives in our Gas business, and this means that we have a future price, which now we'll have to evaluate this on the market. &#x20AC;122 billion were indicated as a profit; 60% of them in the United Kingdom. ScottishPower contributes 24.4% of Group EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Our business in Latin America is growing. Our EBITDA grows by 25.3% to &#x20AC;889 million, in spite of the negative effect of the dollar devaluation vis-&#xE0;-vis 2006, excluding the impact of the rate of exchange, otherwise we would have increased by 25 -- 28%. The increase of our capacity and the increase of our production is -- and the cost and efficiency control have enabled us to obtain these excellent results. The gross margin grows by 16% more than the operating net growth, because the gross margin increases by 20% and the net operating expenses by 4% and our EBITDA represents 16% of the Group.</p>
          <p>In Brazil and Mexico we have a good rate of growth. Our EBITDA has increased; this is mainly due to the tariff increase as well as the increase of demand by 6%, and the reduction of our loss. This improvement of our gross margin and the reduction of margin has enabled us to achieve an EBITDA of &#x20AC;529 million.</p>
          <p>In Mexico and Guatemala there's more production; an increase of 46.7% since we have now Tamaz and there is a good availability of the plant and we have a good increase of our gross margin and of our operating results. We have achieved an EBITDA of &#x20AC;360 million, in spite of the 9.1% drop of the exchange rate.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA in Non-Energy plus Engineering has increased by 14.5% to &#x20AC;486 million. This is driven by our Engineering and Real Estate results, as I shall explain later on.</p>
          <p>The good development of these two businesses compensate the contribution of IBV. Our Real Estate business is doing well, in spite of the problems we have in the real estate sector at the moment. This doesn't affect so much our business because we've always been very cautious.</p>
          <p>Our business is very diversified because we manage soils and we sell properties, but this enables us to face this storm. Furthermore, we have managed to manage properly our costs; our EBITDA increases up to &#x20AC;190 million. Our gross margin achieves &#x20AC;213 million. We have achieved an NNAV of &#x20AC;1.4 million, which is an increase of 5.3% vis-&#xE0;-vis 2006.</p>
          <p>Concerning our Engineering and Construction business, we have achieved &#x20AC;860 million in 2007. We have works portfolio, which means that we'll have some guaranteed future. Our gross margin has increased by 93.5% and we've achieved &#x20AC;197 million and our EBITDA is over &#x20AC;62 million.</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about the leverage and financing. The financial debt represents &#x20AC;20 million, which is 55% more than last year, but our equity has increased by &#x20AC;10 billion and we've achieved &#x20AC;27 billion, which means an increase of 166%. Our leverage has improved tremendously from 54.3% to 41%, so we'll be able to make all these investments that were included in our strategy call plan.</p>
          <p>Concerning the financial ratios, the FFO over net debt has improved from 22.5 to 23.8% and we have improved our RCF over net debt from 16.4 to 17.3%. Concerning the liquidity, we have a liquidity of over 11.6 billion, which means that we shall be in a position to develop our strategic plan in 2008 and we'll have more liquidity at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll give the floor to our Chairman for the conclusions.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you very much, Pepe. As a conclusion, let me stress that in 2007 this has been the take-off year for Iberdrola. We had a rate of growth of 40% in the main businesses and Iberdrola is now another company; it's a different company.</p>
          <p>We have an EBITDA of over &#x20AC;5.5 million and a net profit over &#x20AC;2.350 billion. The results come from international investments, 50% of them. We've managed to develop our traditional business, but also new businesses. We have diversified our currency and business risks. In the years to come we'll create more value in a sustainable manner, thanks to our strategic plan for 2008 and 2010.</p>
          <p>In these circumstances, the year 2008 will mean a strong rate of growth in all our areas; in Spain, Latin America, ScottishPower and Iberdrola Renovables. We're going to increase our installed capacity and our production. In particular, Iberdrola Renovables is going to commission 2,000 megawatts more in 2008. 208 are already built and 1,245 are under construction at the moment.</p>
          <p>The energy prices will increase during the first months of year 2008 and will keep increasing during the rest of the year, taking into account the evolution of the prices of the major raw materials. We'll keep working, trying to improve our efficiency. Synergies will become important, thanks to the integration with ScottishPower, with our Scottish friends and the exchange of best practices in the Group.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, in 2008 we'll have a full year of work in ScottishPower and, according to our estimates, during the third term of the year we'll have with us Energy East. We'll be able this year to have a net profit in 2010 of &#x20AC;3.5 billion, thanks to our investments of more than &#x20AC;24 billion. We'll make it maintaining our financial strength.</p>
          <p>I'd like to stress the growth model that we have. In this growth model we take into account all the interest groups of the Company. In 2007, the shareholders have managed to have a total profitability of 28.8%, which means that the accumulated total return since the year 2000 achieves 250%. The employees now belong to a stronger and more international Group.</p>
          <p>As a result of it, the training hours have exceeded 800,000, with an investment of &#x20AC;54 million. We have increased our measures for the consolidation of our family and labor life in Spain. We've developed it thanks to a new framework of labor relations, which means that these measures could be implemented in a compatible manner with productivity increase as we did it in Spain. We have increased our commitment with our customers through network investments.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we have invested more than &#x20AC;1.3 billion and we have improved the quality in all the countries where we operate. In our societies we have -- all the societies have benefited from it. We have purchased more than &#x20AC;5.5 billion. This has meant more wealth to our providers in the different autonomous communities in Spain, in Scotland, in the United Kingdom, but also in the United States and in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Concerning research and development, we have invested more than &#x20AC;65 million. Last, but not least, we have dedicated &#x20AC;50 million to different social projects in the world.</p>
          <p>Our strategic plan is a project that aims at creating sustainable value for all. It is a win-win success model. During the last weeks we've -- there have been many support statements to our Iberdrola project, and I would like to thank the shareholders, the trade unions, the business associations, the different autonomous local, national and international institutions. All these statements are the results of the excellent relations that we have with all of them.</p>
          <p>I would like to stress that this Company will be able to keep growing and respond to this support with just one project, our strategic plans for the year 2008/2010. We have a strong balance sheet, so we'll be able to keep financing our investment and we have a highly capacitated human team. We've been working as a private Company for more than 100 years. So it can be said very clearly that Iberdrola has become a world giant. We are champion in Europe, in Spain, in America and in the rest of the world, both in terms of growth and in terms of profitability.</p>
          <p>Now, we'll have a coffee break and then we'll look at Renovables and the Q&amp;A. So, we'll have a 10-minute short break now.</p>

          <p>Good morning, and thanks for being with us for the presentation of these results for 2007. In -- the year 2007 has been a very special year for Iberdrola, because we have managed to integrate all the assets of our -- the thee legs of our company. In Renovables, we've integrated the teams that are part and parcel of these companies and we -- our company has been listed at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We have managed to achieve our targets in 2007. At the end of the year we had installed a capacity of 7,704MW, which is an increase of 19.5%. We have managed to maintain the number of installations and we have under construction 1,373 megawatts at the end of the year 2007, which will help us to achieve our target of 2,000 MW.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we have increased the number of the projects up to 42,000MW. We have increased our production in our vis-&#xE0;-vis 2006 by 14%, in spite of the fact that the last quarter was very bad because there was very little wind. And we have an EBITDA of &#x20AC;777 million, which means that the contribution of the Wind business in Spain amounts to 60%. And prices were not so good in 2007, but there is a changing trend in 2008. This is true for January and also for February.</p>
          <p>We've achieved 7,700MW, this is a landmark because we are -- we have now about 1,400 under construction. In Spain, we have installed more than 600,000 &#x2013; 600MW, which means an increase of 15.5% vis-&#xE0;-vis 2006. In the United States we have increased by 26.7% our Wind Farms from 2006. In the rest of the world we have an increase of 46.5% and we have installed 103 additional megawatts.</p>
          <p>Concerning production, the production has achieved 14,708GW. As I said, this means an increase of 14.3%, vis-&#xE0;-vis 2006. 48% of this production is in Spain, more than 7MWh, which is an increase vis-&#xE0;-vis 2006 of 6.7%. During the last quarter -- if the last quarter had been as good as the rest of the year, in terms of wind, our production would have meant 700 more gigawatts. In other words, our increase would have been 16 to 17%, which would have been very similar to the increase of our installed capacity in 2006.</p>
          <p>The United States represents 36% of our -- 26% of our production, which is an increase vis-&#xE0;-vis 2006. This is in line with our additional installed capacity. In the United Kingdom, the production has been more or less the same. This is due to a drop of production that represents 3%, because there was a security -- non-recurring security outage. In the rest of the world, there's been an increase of 43.3%, which is in line with our additional installed capacity.</p>
          <p>When we made the presentation of our bid, we said where our basic appeal is, we wanted to grow. And one of these bases is the value of the quality of our pipeline. During the last quarter, we have increased our pipeline by about 800 MW. This means an increase of more than 1,100 MW. Since, during this quarter, we have installed 300,000 MW more. This has been in Spain and in United States. This has happened in very relevant segments where we can be very successful in our pipeline, which is the highly confident sector where we have an increase of 500 MW. As you can see, there is a difference between 2,882, and we've reached 3,103. We also have an increase in the likely segment, which means that we are in a position to increase our rate of growth and achieve our commitment for the year 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2007, there's been a price drop. This has meant a reduction of about 10%. In Spain, this has been a drop of about 12%. On the contrary, in January -- if you look at the prices in January, we have an increase vis-&#xE0;-vis the average price of 2007 of 16% in all our installations and, in Spain, we're over 26%.</p>
          <p>I'll give the floor now to our Financial Director.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Xabier.</p>
          <p>In the legal result page, balance sheet includes only the results from the last quarter of the business from the United States and the UK from ScottishPower. And to facilitate understanding of this balance sheet, we have a pro forma balance sheet that includes the results for the entire year of all of the Renovables sections of Iberdrola. In other words, the annual results of the old Iberdrola Renovables, and those results from the US and UK renewable assets of ScottishPower and an analysis of this consolidated balance sheet is based on the pro forma from 2007 and 2006 to the bid. And the legal balance sheet is what you see here on this next slide, and reflects an increase of EBITDA by 1.3% to &#x20AC;5.6 billion and net results of &#x20AC;170 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of the pro forma balance sheet, that's on the next slide, and you see EBITDA of &#x20AC;777.3 million, and that's below the pro forma by 7.7%, affected by the lower prices in Spain, the lower production in the last quarter and the effect of the depreciation of the dollar and the pound, as I'll explain further later. And EBITDA would have risen by &#x20AC;900 million if it hadn't been for these factors and a 7% increase over the 2006 value.</p>
          <p>Now, analyzing the gross margin, they were at &#x20AC;1.13 billion, 1.5% above the gross margin pro forma. The greater production due to the greater installed average of &#x20AC;103 million. And despite the greater production in Spain and the UK, given the lower Wind Energy and the non-recurring stoppage as our CEO mentioned, and the lower prices in 2007 had a negative impact on the gross margin by &#x20AC;52 million. And the depreciation of the US dollar and the pound had a negative impact of &#x20AC;34 million. And the net operational costs increased by the internationalization process and there's &#x20AC;14 million of non-recurring costs from going public. And the exploitation and development costs rose by 23.6% in line with the increase in the average installed capacity, which is reflected in a slight improvement in the development and this -- in each one of the fiscal periods. And similar to 2006, and with normal Wind in the last quarter in Spain, EBITDA would have been closer to &#x20AC;900 million, if we had had that normal Wind in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, the EBIT is 486 -- &#x20AC;485 million, which was lower than the pro forma. Now, the provisions explain this difference that &#x20AC;39 million was related to the debt of the old owner of the combined cycle, Clima, and this was the period 30 September. Now the greater amortization of the new installations has been offset by greater amortization for the assets of ScottishPower in accordance with the definitive allocation of those assets and businesses. And the financial results increased as a result of the increase in the average costs of the debt, which goes from 3.86% to 4.82%, and the greater investment. We should point out here that the net debt at the close of the period was &#x20AC;803 million, as a result of the funds from the bid in December. Now, as a result of all of this the net profit in the pro forma for 2007 was &#x20AC;174 million versus &#x20AC;11.4 million. Before going on to the pro forma results by business, I'd like to describe the major magnitudes of the balance sheet in Brazil -- in Renovables. The net -- the equity increased to &#x20AC;10.91 million. This is basically due to the capital increase for the assets in the United States and the UK from ScottishPower for &#x20AC;5.4 billion. And the capital increase for the takeover bid of &#x20AC;4.4 billion. As a result of this, and investments close to &#x20AC;2 billion and net debt at the close was &#x20AC;803 million, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Now, we'll go on to analysis by business. We'll begin with the Wind business in Spain. The Wind businesses in Spain contributes about 50% of the gross margin of Renovables. And this is been effective by the lower prices in Spain, 11.7% lower and lower production in the last quarter as a result of less wind as has already been mentioned. And in this connection, we need to remember, what our CEO mentioned in terms of the variability of the wind and the average prices in January, that it increased by 26% compared to 2007 and 17% with respect to the average January prices of last year.</p>
          <p>Also the maintenance of the margin overbid of above 80% and especially the effort made in installed capacity, which increased by 15.5%. And we have another further 220MW in construction and an increase in the portfolio of projects, which with just three months increased by 10.4% with 772MW in the almost sure bid of pipeline projects.</p>
          <p>Wind energy in the US, EBITDA increased by 20.1% to &#x20AC;117 million by the increase in the production by 26.4%. The EBITDA margin is in the United States is 68.9% substituting the -- this substitution up to 77% and the results of the Unites States have been affected by the depreciation of the dollar against the euro and this had an EBITDA effect of &#x20AC;13 million. Amortization and provisions increased by 13% due to the amortization of the price over the allocation of different asset and EBIT was &#x20AC;39 million. Also we'd like to point out that the installed capacity increased by 26.7% to 2,145MW and a further 453MW being constructed at the end of 2007 and also the increase in the portfolio by 3.6% with -- and this increase is practically sure.</p>
          <p>Analyzing the results of the Wind business in the UK. The progress margin increased by 2.2% and an average price increase of 9.6%, similar to last year, as a result of non-recurring on security shut down. And EBITDA fell by 2.3%, as a result of the variation of the gross margin and the increase of the operational costs, as a result of the new operational power and greater development cost, reaching a gross margin of EBIDTA of 78.3%. The impact of the depreciation of the dollar compared to the euro was &#x20AC;5.2 million. EBIT was at 12.8 million with 66.8% less, basically due to the greater amortization of new prices of non-assets at &#x20AC;12.1 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of the results of the Wind business in the rest of the world, the installed capacity grew by 46% and we have a -- quite a bit in construction as well. Capacity was increased up 43.3%, and Wind production to 1,011MW per hour. Average prices increased by 6.6% in 2007 vis-&#xE0;-vis 2006 which, with increase in production, has increased our gross margin by 52% which was &#x20AC;81.3 million. EBITDA increased by 47%, despite the operational -- increased operational cost given the increase in installed capacity, maintaining our margin over EBITDA, of course, to 80%.</p>
          <p>The amortizations and provisions was 40.6% higher, given the new installed capacity during this period and EBIT was at &#x20AC;35 million. And just to finish up the results of the gas business in the US, provide 110 million EBITDA, 14% of consolidated EBITDA in Iberdrola of Renovables with a negative impact of the dollar of &#x20AC;12 million. In terms of the thermal generation is basically the difference of the different pool market prices.</p>
          <p>The decrease in the gas business by 90% is the seasonal differences in gas prices and the short-term margins and capacity for storage -- long term storage. These are the differences. EBIDTA increased by 53%, basically due to the 39 million reinvestment and in Clima (82.32) -- the owner of the Clima (82.33) power plant and this was the purchase of the Clima (82.38) and the cancellation of that. And finally amortization decreased by &#x20AC;12 billion as a result of the end of these assets, I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>I'll give the floor back to our CEO to talk about the new regulatory changes that are taking place in Renovables.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As we said, when we talked about the OPS, we said that the result of the energy environmental challenges and economic efficiency meant substitution and the support frameworks, which will continue and in terms of the development of renewables. And so in this connection, we have to underscore the approval by the commission of the directive -- in terms of the objectives of Renovables for 2020 in Europe, which are 20%.</p>
          <p>I think there are three important points here. One, that these are objectives which are binding four countries, which means that they also maintain the support schemes that have existed in each one of the countries, establishing the fact that they have -- renewable action plans need to be established, and they have the intermediate goals as well. And, therefore, this can be measured whether we're on the right path or not, whether countries are sticking to the goals.</p>
          <p>And also a complementary system of certificates for countries, as well as for companies, which could be a complementary system to counteract those different difficulties and to provide opportunities to companies that are more extensive, have more extensive wind fields, for example. So these values are reflected and very attractive values for the main countries like Spain.</p>
          <p>So this is based on the situation, current situation in each country and, until we reach that 20%, would be spread depending on the wealth of each country. We can see that the countries like Portugal would be above that 20%, with a significant growth increase would be close to that 20%. And Poland would also be around 15%. And Spain would be at 20%, because Spain is very representative of the European average, both in terms of consumption of renewables and production and earning per capita. And the UK where we're working, has attractive growth to reach that 14% level.</p>
          <p>We also have the incentive system of the PTCs in the US. Remember that in 2007 the US has installed one of every four megawatts of wind in the world. So this means that the United States is the second biggest producer in the world. Spain is now third. And there is a great now political and general consensus from all the different political parties, and the candidates in the United States for the Presidency of the United States to support renewable energies.</p>
          <p>Studies right now are showing the possibility of not extending this over the short term. This would have a negative effect for the economy of the United States and could affect more than 116,000 jobs and, over the short term, reduce investment by about 19 or &#x20AC;20 billion. Meaning that the process of extending of renewables is reinforced, it's going to happen. And the -- with you know some of that it is the law to implement this extension of the PTCs, so that the system will continue to grow over the next several years.</p>
          <p>And just in conclusion, I would like to highlight the ideas that I gave at the beginning. Iberdrola Renovables is committed to the strategic plan of installing 2,000 megawatts per year. And with the data we've given you of growth of the pipeline, installed capacity and the megawatts being constructed, what we've done is reinforced simply the solid basis that we said that we had to continue growing.</p>
          <p>In January, we've installed additionally 218 MW, so that the installed capacity is now close to 8,000; 7,922 to be exact. And you know that we will -- we'll have a talk someday more in detail. You cannot extrapolate the development in one month as an average for all months. There's seasonability of Wind Energy. But we do understand that with a -- looking between, we think that we'll be just above or just below that 228 MW. And this would meet our strategic plan, our goal, without any problem.</p>
          <p>We also are maintaining almost 1,300 MW in Construction. And these are MW which could be in operation in a short period of time, before the end of the year. And we're extending our agreements for turbines to cover this strategic plan to 2010. And in this connection, so we're working on the existing contracts with Gamesa and other suppliers, like Mitsubishi, so that we can confirm the expected growth for 2010.</p>
          <p>And we've also, we're exchanging best practices with the integration of all the different groups that Iberdrola is involved in. At the same time, during 2008 we're seeing that there's greater production; it's growing. Also the capacity that we talked about, the installed capacity and the prices, as I said, are significantly higher than the ones that we had last year.</p>
          <p>So we have solid basis for growth and that are being reinforced, plus the more favorable situation over the short term will certainly allow us to meet our project and shows this as a consolidated long-term project with a very bright future. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Alejandro from Citi. I have two questions. One is on 2008. Can you give us an indication? You said that there's going to be strong growth in 2008 in all the different business lines. So could you give us an indication, in Spain, with the claw back and the regulatory issue, and what impact could that have and how could we compensate in terms of prices or in terms of legal situation? And then in terms of ScottishPower in 2008, bearing in mind the higher cost of fuels, gas and coal, ScottishPower is a thermal company in generation. And the other question on Energy East, looking at the conditions in the State of New York, what is your vision on the conditions there? And is the operation still interesting for you in Energy East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that what we're doing at this time &#x2013; part of the year is re-affirm the objectives that we had. And looking at how the year is going. I think we could even increase those expectations because, indeed, the price situation, and even making high estimates in terms of the claw back, in terms of prices, we could even imagine that we would comply with that and even have even better results. The growth in demand is reasonable, the prices are high, the year it's dry, so this means higher prices. The prices of fuels worldwide are very high. So, therefore, we are optimistic about 2008 in terms of activity in Spain. There are some elements that Pepe talked about, just glossed over, which are non-recurring provisions that we've had this year and that we won't have next. So we'll also be benefited -- have benefits in that regard.</p>
          <p>In terms of ScottishPower, for 2008, we want to continue, clearly continue the trend to continue the improvement that we saw in 2007. We have numbers that show how, quarter-on-quarter, we have been decreasing cost in 2007. And this trend of expense control and efficiency will continue throughout 2008. In terms of the different businesses, we expect better results in the wholesale and commercial areas. Especially given the increases in prices that we are observing in the market by all our participants as a result of, as has been said, the greater cost of inputs, the higher cost of fuels and of emissions -- CO2 emissions rights. And all of this means, that we believe that the results for 2008 in their wholesale and commercial activity, clearly, will reflect these higher cost of the inputs and therefore will show an improvement in terms of the results -- over the results of 2007, higher prices, given the higher cost of inputs and higher control of expenses as has -- was exhibited in 2007. Just to be even more clear, in a general level EBITDA, in this year we're expecting a figure of around seven, just to be very, very clear on that issue. That means growth you can round your numbers around 55. That's just to give you an idea of what we're talking about in terms of growth. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Raimundo Fern&#xE1;ndez. I have two questions. The first is for the Chairman and the CEO. We've seen in the press over the last several months, once again, and I just want to reconfirm with all of this speculation, what are the company's plans in this strategic plan in terms of major acquisitions of other companies? We just had the acquisition of ScottishPower and Energy East is still pending. And we suppose that by the middle of this year that will be finalized. So has anything changed in this strategy, or should we expect that after these transactions that are now being consolidated, should we expect some other big issue? You said before that we were consolidated, but I wanted to just ask the question, just to make sure.</p>
          <p>Also I have questions on CO2. Going back to this important subject, I wanted to ask how are you going to account for CO2 this year, because there is resolution from the Minister for 2006, 2007 with a clear methodology. And now it seems that, although we don't have the methodology for the next period, but we do have that precedent, but maybe we could get an idea of how CO2 will be counted. So where are we in terms of counting CO2?</p>

          <p>First of all, you know our philosophy. We are a boring company. We have a plan every three or five years, a strategic plan, and we do everything to comply with that plan. Therefore, we've drawn up a plan for three years. Then, we were talking about &#x20AC;24 billion in investment, and now we're complying with that. And we're doing this for a simple reason. We're doing that because we knew that this model creates value compared with others that changed plans every time they present their results. We don't do that. We've been constant, we've been coherent, we've been boring and, sure, always talking about the same. So we're in the same line. We're being constant. We're reiterating. We're being boring, saying that our plan, up until 2010, is going to be an investment of &#x20AC;24 billion. And it's a plan that's going to create a lot of value, as the previous plan and among other things, because we don't see any other model better than ours. I think, and I am very proud to say that when I see that all those that criticized us and those that ignored us are systematically trying to imitate our model. Eight years behind us of course, of efficiency, of solidity, of the use of renewables et cetera. Therefore, I think that we have a magnificent model, it's proven to be efficient. We have our team which is trained, very well trained, I should say. And I think there is no reason to change what we've just approved. So we'll continue with our plan of 24 billion in investment in a very boring way to achieve those &#x20AC;3.5 billion in the period up to 2010.</p>

          <p>In accounting, we try to reflect the economic reality and our interpretation of the regulation, which is not always so easy to do. So in 2006, we interpreted the Royal Decree as to -- as value of those free rights that were I distributed to each company. So, in accordance with that interpretation, we accounted for as a variable cost of production, the internalization of the cost of the rights that we were using and we valued these at the cost, or at the average monthly price at each month.</p>
          <p>Now in 2007, we had the Royal Decree, 11, 2007 that changed the interpretation of the previous one, or at least our interpretation. Our interpretation is, of this Royal Decree has what's called a windfall profit which apply to the total production in the ordinary regime, with a price that is established by the regulator and its on the -- is based on the environmental cost. And in accordance with this, our interpretation is that this Royal Decree has nothing to do with the rights, and therefore with respect to attraction of rights we are applying the same criteria that we gave in 2005. In other words, we're internalizing as the variable cost of production, the value of the free rate valued at the 2, January 2007 at the same time up to the consumption of the total free rates. And from that point forward, we're internalizing the value of the market of this rights that we will continue to consume. The free right that we've received we feel that this -- we'd look at this as a subsidy that we amortize in a linear way, approximately linear during the 12 months of the year. And then the windfall profit, which is established in this Royal Decree, we've asked for the opinion of three different lawyers' offices in Spain, and all three agreed that this is para-fiscal and, therefore, this tax, this levy is being accounted -- is being -- for accounting purposes is being paid a as a tax. And the access of the detraction, which has taken place in 2007, applying it to 2006, we were treating this as -- also as tax; I think they were 100 and some million euros.</p>

          <p>Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. I have three questions. Would you please tell us what is the pro forma EBITDA for 2007? You mentioned an increase of 15%. Could we have the exact figure in millions of euros? Secondly, can you tell us if these &#x20AC;7 billion that you expect for 2008 take into account the implementation of this Royal Decree? And secondly, can you give us more information concerning the hedging strategy in coal of ScottishPower. And how many euros do you pay per megawatt at the moment? And can you talk about the gas cost in Spain in euros per megawatt? And the last question, it concerns the corporate rumors. Can you -- what would be the conditions, or the requirements that will lead you to merge with another national or foreign operator? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pro forma EBITDA was &#x20AC;5.751 billion in 2007. And this figure is in conformity with the Royal Decree, which means an important windfall profit. The pro forma data that we are managing includes this data from ScottishPower since 1st of April, if you want to compare it to the year 2006. So this figure that we mention includes an integrated ScottishPower since the 1st of April, which means an increase of 14.5% vis-&#xE0;-vis the previous year. Now, concerning the coal coverage in the United Kingdom, the perfect coverage in terms of supply and cost. But I'd like to ask John Campbell who is in charge of the wholesale energy market in the United Kingdom to give you more information.</p>

          <p>We have our coal -- we have coal coverage in place right out to 2010; that's 100% coverage out to 2010. That includes physical and financial coverage and it's from a variety of sources, including South African, Russian, indigenous U.K. coal. We also have all of our port and railway and shipping facilities contracted right out to that period as well at very good rates compared to our competitors. We haven't revealed our cost of coal, but what I would say is that the contracts that we have struck over the last -- two of these contracts that have been struck over the last two or three years, so that the price that we are paying is materially lower than the current market price.</p>

The figure that is on slide 40 is the average fuel price, which has gone down as you can see. Concerning the last question, I can't talk about rumors or corporate rumors. You well know what is in the mind of our team. We wanted to increase the values we've done it during the past years. We've multiplied by three or four the value of the company. We have a plan ahead and we are not going to change this plan. So now you understand what the situation is about. We have an excellent plan, we have an excellent model, we have an excellent human team with a good structure and we have very clear cut plans, and this company will keep increasing the values we did in the past.

          <p>It's Chris Moore from ABN. Excuse me, if I ask my questions in English. I have two questions, please. My first question is we've talked about increase in cost of gas -- increase in cost of coal, sorry, and gas, but I think the coal price is up 50% since the second half of last year. Could you give us an update on your guidance for load factors of gas versus coal in Spain this year, and whether your thinking has changed since your strategic plan came out last October? That's my first question. And my second question is about the Wind business. Can you give us some indication of the average age of the Wind Parks in Spain now, and can you give some idea as to what point in time you might consider re-powering some of those older turbines? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Paco will answer the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the load factor of coal and gas. We said, on many occasions, that gas is a product that means value, so we have to maximize this margin. What is important is not the -- if the load factor is higher or not, what we want to increase is the value. On many occasions, we have indicated that this is the sum of what we produce and sell to the wholesalers. We are maximizing this value at the moment, as we said before. And what is important is the whole of it. The load factor of gas at the moment is about 70%. This is more or less the one we had last year. Concerning the coal, the share of coal is increasing because there's an increase of the extraction and that corresponds to demand. We don't want to produce at any price, as the competition is doing. I don't think this is the reason why we're being paid. We want to increase the value of what we have at hand.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about the Wind Parks. Our Parks were installed in 1998. What is important is that we've had this -- some installed capacity in the last years. So, as an average, I should say three, three and a half years. And concerning the re-powering, as you know in the Royal Decree, you get an additional premium for the first megawatt that you produce at the given date, when they are substituted by others. At the moment there's an increase of our capacity in these Parks. Secondly, since the average of these Parks is about three and a half years, the amortization is normally 5 to 6 years. Taking into account the cost for the installation of the new capacity, it is not profitable at the moment to introduce these changes. This may happen in a few years' time, maybe in 4 or 5 years, but not before. If the market conditions change, the current problem is the access to turbines, so we'll have some re-powering when we shall have achieved a critical point and if we have enough locations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Javier Garrido, JPMorgan. I have two questions. My first question concerns the CO2 adjustment. I'd like to know how you book the CO2. Will you take -- will you regard the subsidy as an income, or will this be booked directly as a yearly subsidy? Second question, Pepe said that the tax rate will remain low because there is a drop of the margin but, in 2007, the rate was about 23%. What do you expect in 2008, do you expect something like 23%, or something more similar or closer to what there is in the countries where you operate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning the rights, we calculate the rights as a provisioning cost and we value them. We take into account the free rights, and we give them the value of the rights on the 2nd of January; the rest of it at the market price. As to the free rights, we regard them as a subsidy that we introduce as an operational income for an amortization in 12 months. Then, the money we pay, that is to say the settlement, is calculated as a levy, from a tax point of view. There has been no change in the tax rate in 2007 when there has been a drop of this tax rate, both in Spain and in the United Kingdom. In practical terms, the net tax rate would have been 31%, which would have been greater than 2006, in line with the increase of our profits. However, this year we had to reduce this tax rate because we have reduced from 35 to 32.5%. In the United Kingdom there was a deferred tax, which has meant a tax rebate of &#x20AC;33 million and we have also implemented a redemption of &#x20AC;124 million, which is 30 million more than last year. This has meant that we have a tax rate which is in line with last year. This is why there is a drop of this rate in 2007. This is not recurrent in 2008. We'll have an average tax rate of more or less what we had in 2006.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>JPMorgan. I have a few questions on Renovables. Apologies if these are details. Firstly, you mentioned the weak wind conditions in fourth quarter '07, and I heard the number mentioned 700GWh of lost output. Is that just Spain, or is that Spain and U.K. Secondly, can you just tell us what the contribution to the interest expense on the debt-like capital was, and how that might be treated going forward? Third, you released provisions of around &#x20AC;35 million; you just explained why. For the overheads, can you just show how that will develop in the future? The number, I think, was quite low compared to what we were expecting. In terms of mark-to-market, there was a profit mark-to-market for the first three quarters in PPM. Was there any benefit in the fourth quarter for Renovables? And finally, you reduced the UK pipeline by around &#x20AC;700 million. Can you just explain why that is? It's a little disappointing, perhaps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try to answer all these questions. First of all, the reduction referred to Spain only. In the United Kingdom, there was a security outage that meant 20 to 25. Concerning the &#x20AC;39 million, concerning the provision reduction, it means that due to the acquisition of Clima on the 30th of November, the corresponding guarantees to the debt that were paid by the society is reduced. Concerning the overheads, these are business overheads. They have been adjusted to the royalties that we get in PPM, so the net figure doesn't correspond to the total overheads of the Company. Now, concerning the mark-to-market, Rafa, correct me if I'm wrong, but it only affects &#x20AC;6 million in PPM. Now, concerning the last question -- what was it? The pipeline. In the UK pipeline, the explanation is very clear. In Wales there was a bid in 2006. We -- two; there was ScottishPower and Iberdrola that went to this bid. Since then this has been awarded, so we have reduced the part that was not given to the Group. That's why there is a reduction of 6,000MW in the United Kingdom. This is included in the package of potentials. Now concerning PTCs, I'd like to ask S&#xE1;inz to explain this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The specific criterion of PTC we indicated as a financial expenditure. There was an explicit cost of 5.8%. Here, we have the implementation of 5.8% on the liabilities, and this is regarded as an institutional investment. As you know, looking at all the other concepts, the PTCs are incorporated in the gross margin and the makers are not included in the P&amp;L results.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Iberdrola Renovables, it seems some of your competitor are mentioning that US gov might change the rule in terms of PTC, due to the fact that this fiscal mechanism is quite complicated. And it might change to, I would say, normal subsidies, given directly to the manager of Wind Parks. Have you have any comments on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>PTCs may change because the industry is all in favor of that change. This PTC is not the most adequate cost -- the most adequate scheme and it means an over-cost to us. Consequently, at the moment we don't have any details concerning this possible change. The industry doesn't have a clear cut position on this. We don't want to regard it as a subsidy, but this would help us to strengthen the standard pipeline or portfolio. Ian Clins is the Director of our Operations in the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>PTC has been the main subsidy, or the main government support mechanism for the last 15 years in the US. But what we're seeing today is the 26, now 28 states that have a portfolio standard that requires up to 20% of their supply be from renewable resources, and that's really driving demand in the US. The PTC is still supporting, and we expect to see another extension of the PTC over the coming year. I don't think it'll be a long-term extension and I think it'll give the Congress the space to consider alternatives. One alternative that's been debated quite a bit lately has been a national portfolio standard requiring 15% of the energy supply coming from renewables. We think that with that, that would strongly underpin the industry and cause more long-term investments in manufacturing in the US. And that's a key consideration for our government as well because, I think most of you know that the primary materials in a wind turbine are still coming from overseas and the US would like to promote more industry in the US to build more manufacturing there. So we think there're probably some changes down the road. I think certainly the State PTC -- excuse me, the State Renewable Portfolio standards are going to continue to underpin the demand and grow the demand as we've seen this last year. We've moved up to 5,000 megawatt installed in the US this past year which is, largely, these portfolio standards kicking in very strongly.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Alejandro Danai, BBVA. I have two questions for Xabier Viteri. During the presentation before the OPC, before the bid, you said that you had an installed capacity of 1,300 megawatts and you expected 1,600 or 1,700 megawatts at the end of the year. Any change has been introduced? Any doubts concerning the future? The second question. Could you give us more information concerning the coverage of turbine supply in the years to come, and what would be this coverage after your agreements with Gamesa and Mitsubishi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is some understanding. Last year we talked about 1,300 megawatts and that's exactly what happened. We --- at the moment, we have under construction 1,300. You know this is no change there. The plans -- we follow the plans as expected. Many of them are in an advanced state of construction and it's probably better than we expected. In other words, there is no problem concerning achieving our target. Our commitment, it was 2,000 for the year 2008 and this has been planned, and we can reassert this commitment today. Concerning the second aspect, in our strategic plans we mention an integration of 6,000 megawatts, and we said that we already had covered 4,300. At the moment, we have reconfirmed some agreements with Siemens for the United Kingdom. We have increased our negotiations with other companies, such as Gamesa and Mitsubishi. It can be said, at the moment, that Iberdrola follow the same practices then -- in signing agreements before we signed with ScottishPower. Very shortly, we'll have a coverage over 6,000 megawatts in 2010. Now we have questions from the network. We have one from Javier Su&#xE1;rez, and that concerns the impact of this new Royal Decree on the pool evolution and the P&amp;L results.</p>
