          <p>Thank you, operator, and hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. With me here today are Hans Vestberg, President and CEO of Ericsson; Jan Frykhammar, who is our Chief Financial Officer; and Johan Wibergh, Head of our Business Unit Networks.</p>
          <p>Before starting our presentation, I have to remind you all that during the call today we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual results may differ materially due to factors mentioned in today's press release and discussed in this conference call. We encourage you to read about these risks and uncertainties in our earnings report as well as in our Annual Report.</p>
          <p>With this said, I would like to hand over now to Hans Vestberg for comments about our performance and plans going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, &#xC5;se. So let me start by going over a little bit of the trends in the quarter. We saw pretty much the same pattern in the second quarter as we have seen now basically at the second part of 2009, meaning that we see strong mobile broadband, or good mobile broadband, development. We see all the North American and the Professional Services continue. But then on the other hand, we see that the markets that have an impact from the financial crisis, either from structural point of view or financial credit point of view, currency point of view, are still very slow in investment, and then of course you had cautiousness from those operators.</p>
          <p>So that is very much the same pattern as we have now in Q3, Q4, and Q1, and as we're actually started talking about that in Q4 call 2008. So the mixed operating investment activities is still prevailing and it is great variations. We see a continuation of a good demand for mobile broadband. We have seen even more Android phones coming out in the markets, smartphones, and connected devices, of course, bringing data growth there. And I think that is encouraging to see.</p>
          <p>We have also seen some initial changes to the pricing of data where some operators have started to retail pricing for data traffic, which we have outlined in our capital market base as an important trend to follow to see how that pans out, and we have now seen some operators.</p>
          <p>We see a continuing focus and on network quality and efficiency. As we said at the Capital Markets Day, there is quite a substantial portion of the radio base station out in the world that needs re-modernized; many of them actually in Europe because Europe was earlier out on GSM and 3G. And that will mean that we're going to see a modernization in Europe quite a lot when it comes to that. There are other regions as well, but I would say a big portion on that is happening in Europe.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the components, we talked about the component shortage in the first quarter where we saw the capacity of the supplier of components was not enough when different industries were coming up in volume and demand, and they reduced their capacity dramatically when the crisis started and the ramp-up has not really come up to the levels.</p>
          <p>That seen, we had some impact in the first quarter, and you remember we went through that. In the second quarter that impact has continued and what we can see is that we actually got the gradual improvement in the quarter and actually &#x2013; was not even in the quarter, it actually was in the last month that we had high volumes and at the end of the June month. And that of course impacted us in several areas. I will come back to that. Of course, the toughest for us is that we were not able to deliver to our customers that were expected to get deliveries for us in this quarter. And of course when you get the supply chain high volumes late in the quarter, then of course logistics and inflation has to happen as well, and that was hard to finish in the quarter.</p>
          <p>A couple of the recent events that we think going forward will happen in the quarter and after the quarter. We closed the LG Ericsson &#x2013; nowadays called LG-Ericsson, the previous LG-Nortel. We are happy to be a leading vendor in the Korean market. We closed that at 30th of June, meaning that we have an impact on the balance sheet for the acquisition. We have not paid all, but the main part is paid, but that had an impact on our balance sheet but we had no impact on the P&amp;L; that we will have in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>We highlight here one deal but of course, as we have outlined, we believe that telecommunication will be for many different industry and the segments going forward. We highlight one deal here; of course we are doing others. This one we have publicly announced, and that's with the energy company in Spain, Endesa, where we will do managed services for them, and I think that's how we see our offering going into other industries.</p>
          <p>Another highlight that came off for the quarter was our managed services deal with China Mobile in Hebei, which is very important for us. We have done of course services before in China but this is actually a launch and the first really big managed services deal, some 22,000 radio base stations that we're going to manage. And I think this of course with a good focus on quality and delivery on this opens up on other opportunities. And as we have said before, China has a lower level of share of services historically and lower than the average. This is of course an important inroad there.</p>
          <p>We also made another important deal which came off for the quarter, but, again, combining our strength in technology and services, where we will &#x2013; where Telef&#xF3;nica will outsource their prepaid and billing solution to Ericsson and an IT company called Indra, a Spanish company, where we will take care of their prepaid and billing for maintaining it and upgrading it over a long time period. This again shows the innovation that you need to have now in this industry, combining services and equipment.</p>
          <p>LTE, as we have said before, we are the leader in LTE with the largest market share so far. That's of course very important for us. More interesting is that we have more than 50 ongoing, to be started LTE trials confirming of course that LTE is the preferred solution for the next generation standard, which we think is very good.</p>
          <p>So we move on. If we're talking about our own performance, then net sales down 8% in the quarter. Same as we have seen before, down in the networks and multimedia. Global Services was flat, but if you take out the network rollout portion of it, it was actually up, the so-called Professional Services area, up 9%. And the service share in the quarter was an all time high of 42% of the total revenues.</p>
          <p>The component shortage that I talked about on previous slides, that impacted us in the quarter, and we started with a late &#x2013; came out late with deliveries in the quarter. We estimated impact for our customers on things that we were committed to deliver in the quarter but were not able due to this shortage on the supply chain to some 3 billion to SEK 4 billion that we were not able to deliver. That's of course unfortunate, especially for our customers that were expecting those deliveries.</p>
          <p>Margin-wise, we stayed fairly stable on operating margins, some 11% compared to last year 12. Actually the difference is only 0.6 if you compare them on the decimal. So we're almost in the same, and if you look from the first quarter it's an improvement. Of course, one important piece here is our gross margin; rose somewhat to 39%. Main attributes are of course business mix, which means that we have a little bit less of rollouts and more of expansion and upgrades, basically what we have explained before how our business model is working. You get the footprint first then you get expansion and then upgrades on that. And of course the most competitive area is the footprint when you build it.</p>
          <p>But also not to forget, also an important piece of the improvement of gross margin is coming from the efficiency gains that we now have carried out since the beginning of 2009 in the program that we closed this quarter. Basically, we have concluded all things that we outlined in the beginning of 2009 and a little bit more.</p>
          <p>Regional comments. If we take the regional distribution, just to highlight of course that North America is standing for a quite substantial piece of the quarter, 27%, was some 20 plus percent in the last quarter. Of course, that means that others have shrinked, but important to understand that that is an important region for us right now.</p>
          <p>So starting with North America, up 128% year-over-year. I would say even excluding our acquisition on TDM and GSM from Nortel and even excluding the Sprint-managed services, which was not in the base last year, it's still a good growth in North America for us on the base business on mobile broadband; that has to be clear.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing a continuing demand on data in this region, and it doesn't really matter if you're WCDMA or CDMA, both technologies are the same. And, of course, we are now also doing volume shipment on deliveries on LTE to this region.</p>
          <p>Mediterranean down 17%, sequentially up 11. Here we see little bit different pictures. We have of course some slowness in some of the economies in Europe which are impacting the operating spending, especially Spain and Greece. We're also see in this region a lot of modernization plans and also LTE trials.</p>
          <p>Latin America down 12% year-over-year, sequentially up 6. In this region we have talked about before the shift from 2G to 3G, and that's happening. The mobile broadband is the predominant investment right now but we also see LTE trials and also we have a couple of different countries that has quite a large operator consolidation happening.</p>
          <p>Western and Central Europe, here we see a decline on 90% and sequentially 16. Here we have a large variation between the different regions and countries. If I try to generalize such a big region, I would say that Eastern Europe is slow, some countries there actually are impacted from the financial crisis and have been very cautious on the investment.</p>
          <p>Western Europe, a little bit more the same as we've seen before: service is strong as well as the mobile broadband. Here in this region, as I mentioned before, we're going to see quite a lot of LTE and sort of network modernization happens because 2G and 3G was early out in this region and the modernization work will happen in this region the next 24 months, I guess, a little bit different from different operators. But it's an important piece here that going forward we're going to see modernization work coming up, and that's sort of it's a new footprint to be built in Europe right now. So it's going to be an important piece to report on.</p>
          <p>Northern Europe and Central Asia, two pieces here I would say. Mobile broadband and modernization on the fixed networks are happening in this region as well as with the 2G expansions in this region and then 3G expansions and rollouts in Eastern Europe, especially Russia.</p>
          <p>If we then take the other regions, Middle East down 20%. We see general cautious operators in this region. And the area of strength right now in growth is the service area, down 4% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Sub-Saharan Africa down 19% year-over-year and 22% sequentially up. Here we see that we're still impacted by the economic climate, and of course also as we mentioned several times before, the operator consolidation taking place in Africa as we speak, which has not spurred any investment so far.</p>
          <p>South East Asia and Oceania, this is the region where we have together with Africa and Middle East have had the largest impact on the cautiousness and the financial crisis; many countries with high volatility on currency and credit limits. Here we're down 36%; sequentially, we're growing. You can say here that definitely HSPA upgrades and mobile broadband in demand here and we see also LTE trials starting.</p>
          <p>India and China I will take specifically. If I start with India, we have one of the lowest quarter sales in India for many, many years. If we take the side that has not declined, it's the service business, that is remaining fairly intact, especially the recurrent business.</p>
          <p>If we look at the infrastructure, mobile infrastructure we have a clear shortfall. There are two reasons for it. One that we have talked before about &#x2013; we have talked about both, but the 3G auctions, which have very important spectrum coming out for a continuous deployment or equipment in India, that now is concluded but has not spurred any investment so far. It's still up to be grabbed, that market. And, of course, that market is a new footprint which will be very competitive because the mobile broadband and sort of the penetration still are going up in the country, which are, of course, giving good prospects for that.</p>
          <p>The other area is the security clearance process that all vendors in our industry and many even other industries have to go through. That has in the quarter impacted us significantly. We were cleared for one operator late in the quarter. So that's the only sales we have, is the one operator at the end of the quarter because we were not security-cleared. Now we are security-cleared and we have added some other operators after the quarter. So that is fine and then we can start delivering. However, just as a reminder, as we understand and we are discussing is that there are a new security clearance process that will come up. That is a long-term solution. This was a short-term solution. That we don't know how it is going to impact and what it means as we haven't seen that process defined yet. But at the moment we are cleared with the majority of our customers for deliveries. But, again, 61% (sic) [63%] down is quite significant.</p>
          <p>China and North East Asia, down 36% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. If we are nice to each other, which we sometimes can be, China, of course, has a very hard comparison in this region in the second quarter. The second quarter last year was an all-time high on 3G rollouts and I think that the future focus on 3G in China is still there and they are really focusing on success, so it's more of a timing issue when they are spending that money.</p>
          <p>LTE is on the agenda in all countries here, China, Japan et cetera are looking into LTE. We can also clearly see that Japan that jumped to the fourth place in our country ranking, has a very good growth when it comes to mobile broadband and a very healthy growth for us as a company. Finally, I've already mentioned it, but in this region we will from the next quarter have our acquisition from LG-Nortel that is now renamed to LG-Ericsson.</p>
          <p>Segments. Starting with networks, networks down 12% in the quarter. Fairly the same trend, mobile broadband and CDMA develop favorably in the quarter, partly offsetting the decline in 2G, or the voice-related sales. It's the whole chain on that, so it's much what we have discussed before. This is the segment that have had the main or the majority of the impact of the supply and all the shortage of components.</p>
          <p>However, on the positive side, we continue to creep up on EBITA. We had 70% EBITA in this quarter, and, of course, that's very much fueled by the business mix but also the efficiency gains that have been done in this segment.</p>
          <p>If we then take Global Services, I said flat, but the return in network rollout down 12%, very much correlating with the networks business. And if we then look only Professional Services, up 9%, and Managed Services grew 23% in the quarter. And you can see that the margin is fairly stable on the whole segment, 12% first both in year-over-year and sequentially. And you can also see that Professional Services held up well in the range where we usually have had Global Services profitability.</p>
          <p>Couple of highlights on Services. We have now 450 million subscribers in the networks where we have the end-to-end responsibility in Managed Services. So we are actually going quite rapidly here. If we define the Managed Services arena, including standalone field maintenance, which we have not historically done, then we would come up to 750 million subscribers. We are disclosing that number because some other companies are disclosing that number, so we will tell them both, but when we have full end-to-end responsibilities, 450 million subscribers. 2 billion subscribers in the 24/7 technical support and some 40-plus thousand service engineers. We are now &#x2013; we are actually having a very strong and powerful service organization; I said 42% of the turnover in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Multimedia. You can say with the &#x2013; I would say very, very similar patterns as in the first quarter, meaning that the stronghold for our building and revenue side is in Africa, Middle East and India and those three areas, as you have seen on the slides, are very much down, which has impacted our multimedia business. The multimedia business is down 27% in the quarter, very much as we saw in the first quarter. This leads to a negative EBITA of 5%, same as we had in the first quarter. We had some growth sequentially and that was more attributed to TV and multimedia brokering. So this is of course a challenging area, but on the other hand we believe that our revenue management and billing are essential pieces for the future growth for operator to see that they have a very good billing system that can actually both do voice and data and we believe we have the state-of-the-art technology here.</p>
          <p>Joint ventures, both has reported so we'll be brief. Sony Ericsson reported earlier this week, and had a sequential growth of 25% and of course a quite a dramatic improvement year-over-year on profitability coming of course from a very big loss in the second quarter 2009. What this encouraging here is of course to see the new successful range of products that has a good attraction in the market, which also led to a very good and healthy ASP in the quarter.</p>
          <p>ST-Ericsson reported yesterday night. They had a sequential decline on 10%, mainly because of the transition on the portfolio. That meant that we basically kept our loss at the same level, meaning that we see traction on our cost adjustments program. But if we compare year-over-year it is somewhat an improvement.</p>
          <p>By that I will leave it to Jan Frykhammar to go over a couple of the financial highlights. Jan, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans. Let me then just talk through some of the financial highlights for the second quarter. First of all, if we look at the gross margin, we are encouraged about the improved gross margin and this is, as Hans said, due to business mix, meaning really more expansions rather than turnkey projects as well as a good progress and results delivered on the efficiency gains. Note as well in this context, as Hans said, that there is 42% service share in the quarter. So we are really encouraged about the improvements here.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the operating margin, it declined mainly due to lower sales and it improved, as Hans said, slightly sequentially. It's also important to note the reduction in profitability in the Multimedia segment here. We had around SEK 300 million of profit last year, now it's a negative 300, so that's more than one percentage points.</p>
          <p>If we look at the operating expense, there are a couple of things that I would like to mention there. First of all, we now this quarter have the full impact of the acquired GSM business from Nortel; that the impacts the operating expense. There is also an impact on SG&amp;A due to high amount of LTE trials and I think we should expect that high activity to remain throughout the year. And then as well then if we look at more of an effort that is ongoing in North America and that is also the integration then of the CDMA-acquired asset. And that has been a lot of cost in the second quarter, predominantly related to integration work around the ISIT environment. Our ambition when it comes to selling and G&amp;A expenses is of course to reduce that percentage as a percentage of sales, but over a certain quarter it may vary.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the R&amp;D guidance, the R&amp;D guidance that we have in the report is staying at between SEK 28 billion to 30 billion for the full year. Here it's important to note then that since we will then start to get the LG-Ericsson impact in the P&amp;L from second half, I think we should expect that that will have an impact on the R&amp;D guidance, but we will come back to that in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the net income. It's improved year-over-year and sequentially, mainly due to the improved earnings in our joint ventures, great progress, but also then due to slightly lower restructuring charges if you compare with last year. Then those improvements were offset then with the same reason as for the operating margin, i.e. lower volumes.</p>
          <p>If we look at cash flow, this is minus 2.7 billion in the quarter. That's not a number that we're happy with. The explanations are clear; it has to do with the supply chain, the root cause is the component shortages, but also then some related bottlenecks since we started to get volumes up here late in the quarter and that has then impacted the working capital.</p>
          <p>If we then take some highlights on the balance sheet, here we can see then the impact on trade receivables, inventory and payable days by the supply chain. Also important to note here that the consolidation of LG-Ericsson then has impacted the receivables and the inventory with about SEK 1 billion each. That's also highlighted in the report. But then also look at our continued very strong equity ratio.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at the cash position. We had a change in gross and net cash in the quarter of some between then 12.7 billion in the net cash. There are three reasons for that, two of them were planned, meaning the pay out of dividend and the fact that we paid also $212 million out of the 242 million that we are going to pay for Nortel's share of what is today LG-Ericsson. The operating cash flow of minus 2.7 billion is the reasons that we discussed before here. I mean, I think it is so important here to say that you need to look at cash flow over a longer period than one single quarter. We continue to target a cash conversion of more than 70%, and that is what we target.</p>
          <p>If you then look at the debt maturity profile, it continues to look very strong. There is no changes here compared to the first quarter. We have a very strong payments readiness and in the quarter that was SEK 79.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Then if I end with some highlights on the cost reduction program. The program has now really delivered the savings that we expected. Most of the estimated savings are now impacting the P&amp;L in the second quarter, and it is both then cost of sales as well as operating expense. And I think we have as an organization worked very good proactively with this program. The total restructuring charges of the program since the start in beginning of 2009 will be then &#x2013; or is SEK 15.5 billion. I think it's important to say then that in this program then there will be cash outlays also going forward both in the second half of 2010 and perhaps some still in 2011. The total amount of those you see there on this slide, SEK 4.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Having said all of this, having said that we are extremely satisfied with the progress of this program, cost efficiency and capital efficiency remains top of our agenda. We are in a very competitive market environment. We are also in a business that requires that we all the time look at different synergies. Our Services share is 42% of the total company and so forth. But we will not run a new company-wide program. Cost efficiency, working is what may and so forth will continue to be on top of our agenda.</p>
          <p>So with that said, Hans, I turn back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jan. Just rounding up, the forward-focus Ericsson targets we have. Grow faster than the market. After the first six months of course it's a little bit too early to say how the market has been growing but we don't believe that the market has been growing and of course we had so far a decline when we compare to last year. So we will continue to strive for growth and then see that we can do that. Not saying anything about the future but that is on top on our agenda.</p>
          <p>Best-in-class margins. I think that the organization that I'm heading up has done a great job being proactive on the cost efficiency work, starting quite in advance proactively to see that we can now cater for the margins that we have despite the lower volumes. But that doesn't mean that we will continue to work with the margin but that's at least where we stand.</p>
          <p>The strong cash conversion. As you all know, applying our ambition and target is clear, that the main part of our profit should be cash flow, and we have a target of above 70%. So far this year, we have had a little bit more challenging, especially in the second quarter due to the working capital build up. That doesn't take away our ambition to generate more than 70% in cash of the profit.</p>
          <p>The JV earnings, of course coming from a low-level or a loss level last year has had a very good development. We are around zero right now for our two joint ventures. Both of them have their different challenges and their different strengths and we continue to support them and work with them to see that they continue to succeed. But definitely we have seen an improvement on JV earnings.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. That was the update.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans and Jan. And by this then we are ready to open up for the Q&amp;A session. And I just want to stress that here beside me I also have Johan Wibergh who is head of our business unit networks then who can also take questions then. So, operator, you can open the Q&amp;A session now.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Rod Hall from JP Morgan is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I've just got a couple. The first one I guess is on this 3 billion to 4 billion of lost sales related to the component shortage. I wonder if you could talk about whether you expect all of that to come back, and if you do, when you would expect it to be coming back so we can think about in our models how that revenue returns to the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is on the OpEx drivers. Jan, I just wanted to clarify something you said. You were talking about LTE trials, I think, when you said that those won't go away soon. Could comment on the other two OpEx drivers as well, the R&amp;D and the integration costs? I mean, do you expect that OpEx to be maintained at this higher level now for a few quarters or ongoing? Could you just talk to us about that a little bit? And those are my two main questions.</p>

          <p>Then I start with the 3 billion to SEK 4 billion, the impact. Of course it's sort of the ones that are being closest to us now to deliver, so of course this delay that we now have of course will be served now going forward. But I said we will have a gradual improvement in the supply chain in second half. But of course the 3 billion to 4 billion that we now have a delay on, and specifically those, they will of course be served the first right now when it comes from the customer point of view. But, again, we will have a gradual improvement in the quarter, but we will serve this 3 billion to SEK 4 billion in deliveries as we speak right now.</p>

On the ISIT integration-related costs, it's also real state, so completely transparent. Those costs I think we have seen the majority of the cost in the second quarter. There will still be some cost in the third quarter, but then over time that will &#x2013; within this year it will go away.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. Two questions if I may. The first is on the &#x2013; a follow-up on the component tightness. What technologies and geographies do you think that impacted the most? And then also, I guess you said a gradually recovery, so I'll just ask that.</p>
          <p>And then second, on the LTE roll-out, how should we think about that? Are we going to see a nice acceleration there? You're talking about competition. Would that be lower margin business at the beginning with the higher margins on the capacity upgrades to follow? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with the LTE and then you will answer about the components a little bit about which technology it's impacting. On the LTE roll-outs, I mean, it's not changing anything to our previous ideas on when LTE will be in sites. But what we talk about that with the industry-wide support for LTE as the next generation as so many are doing trials et cetera. So I think that's important. I guess any new footprint, as our normal business model, when it's a new footprint built, of course, that is a little bit more competitive environment than when you have the footprint. So there is no difference from that when we added 2G or new <mark type="inaudible" /> things in any country.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I would just like to understand, you said that you had increased activity in June and that you're fulfilling the 3 billion to 4 billion of backlog as we speak. So would that mean that we should have a bit of an acceleration in the current quarter and then that would die away, just to tell us then how this will play out over time?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the obsolete European networks that are going to go through upgrades, you mentioned this repeatedly. Do you expect this to play out already in H2, or is it more next 12 months' affair? And competitively, I understand it will be done through open tenders, so how would the competitive situation then play out and how that would impact your growth margins? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Here will start, yes, you are so right. We had higher volumes at the end of June which, of course, created bottlenecks in the logistics and the installation, but we had higher volumes. I understand your question. My answer was basically that those 3 billion to SEK 4 billions are not lost, it's only delayed, and as we have delays in the supply chain, we are now delivering that to our customers. As we've said, we will have a gradual improvement in the quarter; that means that we will not have total risk towards our lead times and deliveries to our customers. But it's too early for me to judge sort of how that will impact or not. But it would be strange or sort of unreasonable to believe that that will go away in Q3, and that's why I'm saying it's gradual improvement in the second half.</p>
          <p>On the European network modernization, as I said, that will probably pan out the 24 months, and what we're seeing right now is that some operators will decide of course in this half year of 2010, then we well see some sort of deals being done and start being delivered, but it's also coming in the 2011 I would say. So it's a little bit distributed and it's more about operators deciding for it and when they want to decide it. So that is remains to be seen, because we will communicate as soon as we know when a deals that are close and where we report on that. But so far, we haven't done that. But we will come back on that so you can see when it comes in time. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. From a regional point of view, will the countries which decline sequentially near-term, such as China, India and Western Europe, will they grow in the second half if you had to give us a sense. And separately, does the goal of improving operating margins get progressively more difficult now that the cost reduction programs are mostly over? And if anything, it seems like the moving parts with Nortel and LTE implies more OpEx for the second half. Can we sort of get back to like 15%, what would it be your ambition for operating margins? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the &#x2013; I think we had six regions having sequential growth in this quarter. And of course looking forward, we don't do any forward-looking statements and we just try to elaborate on each and every region. As I've said, India is an all time low for structural reason not because of demand reasons. China is low more from timing reasons than something else. So that we have said, but not saying if there's something happening on a specific region for the next quarter for that. So that I refrain from.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the cost efficiency and keeping up the margins, I mean, yes, it's a competitive environment. As Jan said, we will continue to look for efficiencies, and the work, that we have to do all the time. That is nothing, because we now are taking down the global program that had certain criterias and certain projects that we do; we should have done all of them. Now sort of we will continue. I mean, remember, we are in 175 countries. We have a quite broad portfolio, rationalization on the portfolio and improvements all the time, and business mix and business volume in different countries will impact our efficiency gain.</p>
          <p>When it comes to ambitions and goals for operating margin, that we have not said. What Jan and I have said that we strive for improvements but we also need to acknowledge the marketplace at the same time, but we are continuing to strive for improvements but not &#x2013; haven't decided for any specific number to the market. But we will continue to strive for that improvement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the sharp rise in inventory. I understand why it took place &#x2013; I think there was a billion from LG-Nortel coming in. But could you just clarify the impact that inventory build had on your gross margin in the quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, if you could just talk to the size, just very roughly kind of annualized sales and the operating profit from the LG-Ericsson activity, that would help us model it accurately. Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think first of all on the first question there, we did not have any impact on the gross margin because of the inventory buildup. Then when it comes to LG-Nortel and now LG-Ericsson, I think what we would like &#x2013; I mean, we are not guiding about the future revenues, so forth, of any of our regions nor the joint ventures. But what we can say is that the LG/Nortel joint venture had a peak revenue in year 2008 as Korea then finalized a big build-out of 3G, and that was about $1.3 billion. Last year in 2009 it was more in the area of between 600 million to $650 million. I also think it's important to mention when it comes to LG-Ericsson, then, that from 1st of July when we then consolidate the full P&amp;L, we will also see then an impact on the R&amp;D expense and that is something that we will then come back to in Q3 and revise our guidance if we feel that that is necessary.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I've got just a couple of clarifications. On the gross margin that you produced now in the first half, which is roughly between 30 and 39% and I think 200 basis points higher than last year, could you split out the impact of business mix versus your efficiency gains just in terms of which is the larger of the two? And when you look at your business mix, Hans, would you say it's disproportionably positive right now just given how big North America has become in your sales, or would you say that we're looking <mark type="inaudible" /> level going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to give you a perfect split on how much is efficiency and business mix but both are important and both are a significant contributor to that gross margin. If we have a perfect optimized business mix right now, they're all little bit give and take. I think that from the infrastructure point of view, yes, we have more upgrades than expansion. On the other hand, we need to remember, 42% of our gross margin is impacted by services; that by nature has a significantly lower gross margin. And then also adding to that, that's multimedia, which has a high proportional or software is down. So I think it's a balance of it. But for this first half-year that is the gross margin we get with the mix we have and the cost efficiency as we go forward. But of course, going forward, if we want to have more footprints and more sort of modernization work or new 3G networks or LTE network, that will, of course, be a different mix, but there are also the cost efficiency that will be sustainable here.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>And one follow-up. Just the 3 billion to SEK 4 billion of lost sales, given what Jan was saying in terms of CDMA business and HSDPA, et cetera, it sounds to me that should be relatively on balance higher gross margin lost sales. Is that a fair assumption?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking the question. I have a question more specifically on China. You've signed a firm agreement earlier this year with the main operator in the country, and if I remember correctly, the firm agreement was up 6% compared to last year and your revenues in the country are down 20% year-to-date. And I think the contract represents historically 60, 70% of your business in China. So my question is: when we look at the full year 2010, what's the best indication for your performance in the country? Is it up 6% of the firm agreement or the 20% year-to-date on your business in the first half? Thank you</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pierre. I think you have made your analysis yourself here. But, of course, the same agreement that was signed, they are always a little bit different form and shape, of course. And they are not, as you say, not covering everything we are doing in China. They are for certain pieces. And then how they pan out in time, that will be different for different quarters.</p>
          <p>As I said, the commitment for 3G success in India is very high among the operators; our market share remains. And of course last year they had a very strong first half year when it comes to 3G and they have a little bit slower right now. So we will see when we report the third quarter where we are with China.</p>

          <p>I think that in general as we have not concluded any 3G business yet in India, it's a little bit a theoretical question. So but normally if it's a straightforward sort of CapEx decision by our operators in India, it's, of course, going to show up as soon as we get the acceptance on it. But we have to come back to that and when we have the deals if there is something new or something different. But at this stage we don't have &#x2013; conclude in any 3G deal so it's a little bit premature to have any comments on it.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Two fairly straightforward questions. First for Hans. You mentioned at the Capital Markets Day that once this current 15 billion restructuring plan is done you wouldn't have any new large plans. Are you sticking to that and at what point might you switch to reporting EBIT margins which include restructuring charges since I guess what you've been saying is that they'll be much smaller going forward?</p>
          <p>And then for Jan, just can you help us understand the 138% year-on-year growth in the U.S.? How much of that was from Sprint and Nortel business that obviously wasn't there in second quarter last year? And would there have been a positive impact on gross margins from the Nortel CDMA business, which historically had very high gross margins? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we take the first one, yes, we have now concluded the global program as we outlined, and that's over. That doesn't mean that we will not continue to work with the restructuring or efficiency gains, because that we do all the time. But, of course, over time we will see lower levels of restructuring and &#x2013; but we will &#x2013; if they are significant, we always need to at least disclose them and give you the information. We have not decided exactly who we want to deal with, but if there are significant amounts or restructuring, we're going to tell you and so that you will know.</p>
          <p>But I think we're going to see a gradual downgrade on the restructuring charges not basically coming to zero straight away because there are other initiatives at the same time surrounding right now. But we will come back on that in the third quarter and see where we are in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Maybe I can just say something or maybe Jan. I can start with the North America. We don't disclose exactly how much it is those items. What I have said that even if we take away Sprint and we take away CDMA acquisition, we still have a good growth in North America on the operators there on the mobile broadband business and service business that we had before. So I think that's important.</p>
          <p>On the CDMA margins, we have said there's good profitability on it, but it's nothing unusual in this quarter. It was unusual in the last quarter of 2009 because we only had the last six weeks, which are usually weeks where we had a lot of shipments. But nothing unusual in this quarter from the CDMA camp.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. The first one, if it's possible, in terms of understanding the cash flow, you've mentioned that the inventories have been significantly impacted by the component shortage, but when you look back historically, on the Q2 you're turning around 80 to 82 days in average in inventory days and this is exactly where we are. So I'm trying to understand a bit what's the situation on this.</p>
          <p>And the second question is trying to &#x2013; if you could give us a bit an idea of what you think the Q-on-Q seasonality for the U.S. could look like in the rest of the year. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I think first of all, when it comes to inventory turnaround, as a company we are working hard on improving the processes and the systems in order to improve inventory days. And we've seen that we have been on the right track to improve the inventory days. Now we have a particular situation in this quarter, and that is related to the supply chain, because, of course, when you get a ramp-up of volume late in the quarter, it impacts the accounts receivables but it also impacts the project part of the inventory because we had a lot of project spend that was started but was not finalized in time for invoicing, right? So that is the main explanation. I think overall, long term our improvement activities on the inventory, which involves then processes, project management systems, is, of course, all aiming to improve this down to the levels that we communicated at the Capital Markets Day.</p>

However, of course, important to remember that the component shortage is an important parameter here, and if everything remains the same, as I've said before so many times now, we will see a gradual improvement, but that's about it.</p>

          <p>Hi there. Thank you very much. I've got a quick one. Trying to get a bit more explanation of what's happening to the end market. You and Nokia Siemens have reported down over 10% revenues in the first half, yet when we look at operator CapEx in mobile it looks to be around flattish for the year. So I'm trying to get a sense of where you think the discrepancy is coming from. Are operators simply underspending despite the strong data growth? Is it a timing issue that perhaps means second half improves? Or do you think you might be losing market share either directly within wireless infrastructure or perhaps because operators are focusing on transmissional areas where you're less strong?

          <p>Thank you for the question. First of all, we mentioned market share for the full year because that's when we had planned all of the facts. But we don't have any feeling that we're losing market share at the moment. When enhanced CapEx correlations are on sale there are so many different parameter. You mentioned some of them. There's the timing on when they do the investment. When we have the revenue, what is included in the CapEx and what we are selling might not be the same as well. So I guess it's hard to draw that correlation with the CapEx. And over time we can actually see that CapEx is going down, but actually our share of that CapEx is going up. And we can also see CapEx is going up and our share is going down. So it's little bit more to understand what's inside that CapEx for each and every operator and then, of course, seeing the totality. Then one should also remember that we are addressing a lot of OpEx with our service business, which is another area, and again, I stressed it before, but even though it was a high time, this time at 42% this is quite a substantial piece of our business as well right now when it comes to services.</p>

          <p>Yes. It's of course the questions are extremely good and of course highlighting a lot of areas that we have been discussed. I think that if I would summarize a couple of points from this quarter and a little bit in general. First of all, I would say that we believe that the telecom industry, mobility and broadband are an industry of a long-term growth. And they're definitely over time the last 10 years has been very important for the industry and the next 10 years probably are going to be even more important what we're going to do with technology and mobility and broadband. I think that's important. Then short term is another question, but long-term, this is an, we believe, very important industry for growth.</p>
          <p>We see large variations in this second quarter. We have seen that large variation between operator spending and between regions and products and we saw that yet another quarter we tried to give you a flavor for the differences. We have an improved cost base. We have worked with that very diligently during the last six quarter applying the program that we exceeded and I would like to thank the organization for doing that even though we had good times in the beginning of 2009.</p>
          <p>And finally, I think that we stand strong in this industry by being the leader in mobility and services, which are key areas for the telecom industry going forward. Thank you.</p>
