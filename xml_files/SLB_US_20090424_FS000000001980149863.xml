          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to your hosts, Chairman and CEO, Mr. Andrew Gould; Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Simon Ayat; and Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Mr. Theobald, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Greg (:34). Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2009 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, where the Schlumberger Limited Board Meeting took place yesterday.</p>
          <p>Before we begin with the prepared remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request.</p>
          <p>Joining me for today's call from Saudi Arabia are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the first quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements, we will welcome your questions.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter income from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $0.78 per share, down $0.25 sequentially and down $0.28 compared to the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to focus on managing our cost base. In this regard, we have largely completed the head count reduction as we announced last quarter. In order to better match our costs to the lower activity and pricing levels, we will likely have a further similar reduction over the coming months.</p>
          <p>Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services first quarter revenue fell by 13% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue dropped 8%. Oilfield Services generated $1.3 billion in pre-tax operating income, down $344 million sequentially, with margin declining by 240 basis points to 23.1%.</p>
          <p>By area, Oilfield Services sequential pre-tax operating margins highlights were as follows. North America declined by 858 basis points to 13.7%, primarily due to the impact of the rapid and deep reduction in U.S. land and U.S. Gulf of Mexico shelf activity coupled with heavy pricing pressure.</p>
          <p>Latin America improved 168 basis points to 19.7% due to project efficiency gains on IPM projects in Mexico/Central America and a favorable mix of higher margin exploration activity offshore in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by a reduced gain share from an IPM project in Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and the impact of reduced activity in Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</p>
          <p>Europe/CIS/Africa was essentially flat at 25.9%. Higher margin activity in the North Sea and in Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea largely offset the combined impact of lower activity in North Africa and less favorable revenue mix in West and South Africa and reduced sales at Framo. Finally, Middle East/Asia was also steady at 33.1% as a more favorable revenue mix in several GeoMarkets offset the impact of lower activity overall in the area.</p>
          <p>At WesternGeco, pre-tax income of $55 million reflected a decline in pre-tax margins of 483 basis points to 9.9%. This decrease was due to the sharp decline in Multiclient revenue primarily in North America as customers continued to reduce their discretionary spending.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate of 21.1% was in line with last quarter after adjusting for the Q4 charges. The ETR for all of 2009 is still expected to be in the low 20s. Net debt was $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter as compared to $1.1 billion at the end of Q4. This increase is largely seasonal as we typically experience stronger Q4 cash collections on our receivables and we pay profit sharing and other related benefits in Q1.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $2.1 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remained unused and were available at the end of March. This compares to short-term debt of only 1.6 billion, reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet and leaving us with more than enough liquidity to meet all corporate and operational requirements.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the quarter we established a &#x20AC;3 billion medium-term note program, which provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in euro or U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies. In March, we issued &#x20AC;1 billion of 4.5% notes due 2014 under this program. The issuance of these notes was extremely well received. The proceeds from these notes will be used to refinance existing debt obligations and for general corporate purposes and will even further increase Schlumberger's financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $273 million of pension funding and $748 million of CapEx. Given the current economic environment, we have temporarily suspended our stock buyback activity. Oilfield Services CapEx is expected to approach $2 billion in 2009 while WesternGeco is expected to reach $600 million, which include $270 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels.</p>
          <p>And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon, and good morning or good afternoon, everybody. Schlumberger first quarter revenue declined sequentially as activity continued to weaken around the globe in response to reduced customer spending as the global economic recession reduced demand for both oil and natural gas. The rate of decline in revenue at Oilfield Services accelerated considerably compared to the fourth quarter, largely due to the precipitous drop in North American natural gas rig count. Outside North America, lower activity in Russia and the fall of many local currencies against the U.S. dollar remain the principal causes of weakness.</p>
          <p>Looking at the areas in more detail, and starting with North America, the U.S. land GeoMarket recorded a significant decrease in sequential revenue as lower natural gas prices and a lack of available credit for some customers resulted in a rapid and deep reduction in activity that was coupled with heavy pricing pressure. Offshore, revenue in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket fell through weak shelf drilling activity and associated pricing erosion, although expected deepwater projects began operations much as expected. In Canada, revenue fell as winter drilling activity was unusually low and the spring breakup came unusually early. These decreases, however, were partially offset by high seasonal exploration related activity in Alaska.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, the Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago GeoMarket saw the sharpest sequential revenue decrease as a result of lower activity related demand for Drilling &amp; Measurements, Well Services, and Wireline technologies, coupled with reduced IPM activity. In Peru/Colombia/Ecuador, revenue fell following the year-end sales in the prior quarter of SIS software and Artificial Lift products, while the Argentina/Bolivia/Chile GeoMarket decreased on lower activity related demand for Wireline, Drilling &amp; Measurements, and Well Services. Area revenue was also reduced by 2% due to the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar. These decreases, however, were partially offset by increased revenue in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket due to efficiency gains on IPM projects, and in the Brazil GeoMarket as the result of a robust demand for high technology Drilling &amp; Measurements and Wireline services on offshore operations, where IOC activity grew as originally scheduled.</p>
          <p>Within Europe/Africa/CIS, the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Russia and the North Sea, reduced area revenue by 5%. In addition, Russia experienced a sharp drop in revenue as a result of seasonal weather-related slowdowns, further reductions in customer activity, and heavy pricing pressure. Revenue for the North Africa GeoMarket was down due to lower demand for Well Services technologies and software products while the Caspian GeoMarket experienced reduced demand for Well Services, Drilling &amp; Measurements, and Wireline as customer activity slowed. Weaker Framo revenue also contributed to the sequential decline in the area. These decreases were partially offset by improved activity in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea that resulted in increased demand for Wireline services.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in the Middle East and Asia area, sequential revenue fell, primarily due to reduced customer activity in the Arabian, Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, Thailand/Vietnam, and East Mediterranean GeoMarkets, in addition to seasonal weather-related slowdowns in the China/Japan/Korea GeoMarket. These declines in activity mainly affected demand for Well Testing, Wireline, and Drilling &amp; Measurements services.</p>
          <p>At WesternGeco, the rate of sequential revenue decline slowed to 8% as continued weakness in North American Multiclient revenue was partially offset by improved Marine with the start of several new proprietary contracts. Data Processing also recorded a sequential decrease across all areas except Latin America, while Land was down due to completion of projects in the Middle East. Overall, backlog decreased by $319 million to 1.5 billion, partly due to delayed contract awards pending the results of licensing rounds in several countries.</p>
          <p>Looking at Schlumberger as a whole, we have already taken action to right-size our operations without diminishing our capacity to react to market changes. Our operating cost basis declined sequentially by more than $450 million due to prompt action on all variable cost categories and to the effects of favorable exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>Recent economic forecasts have yet to show any positive trends in GDP stabilization or growth, with the major forecasting agencies lowering their demand expectations accordingly. Our visibility on 2009 has therefore not materially changed from the end of the fourth quarter. We do not see any significant recovery in North American gas drilling before 2010. Overseas, while activity declines will be limited, customers are actively seeking and are obtaining price relief to improve the economics of current projects. At the same time, exploration expenditures are being deferred in favor of projects that produce immediate cash flow. We are encouraged to see offshore deepwater activity resisting fairly well to the current budget cuts.</p>
          <p>As we indicated on our fourth quarter comments, longer term we remain convinced that any demand recovery for oil will need to be accompanied by increased investment to offset decline in the aging production base.</p>

          <p>[Operator Instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, or good evening, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning &#x2013; no, good evening, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess maybe I'll start with just a general commentary. Deepwater, as you said, is the one thing that still looks good. Do you see any green shoots anywhere other than deepwater? We're definitely decelerating, but any signs of growth anywhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about the oil and gas business, Michael, or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm just talking about your business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Saudi gas, there have been pockets of growth, Algeria. Can you talk about &#x2013; because your overall tone just seems to be that the market as a whole is decelerating still. This is a market that's contracting, and I'm just trying to see where the signs of recovery and life might be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are always pockets that are different. But if you ask for a global judgment, yes; it's still decelerating. As we all know, the overseas cycle takes 12 to 18 months to work itself out, which is why I commented that I don't have a great deal of clearer vision than I had at the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So yes, there are always pockets of resistance. There's gas in the Middle East. There's Brazil. There's Australia. There are little pockets of resistance all around the globe, but I think the pockets of resistance today are more linked to the commitment to long-term projects that customers have taken which is more expensive for them to stop or slow than to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are those packets of resistance feeling pressure from just the general slowdown in terms of pricing and competitiveness on those contracts et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that on large projects where not only the operator but also the service company has a considerable investment in conducting smooth operations, the tendency is for the operators want to want to renegotiate price rather than retender and disturb the whole operation. So yes, are all the majors and large independents and some of the NOCs aggressive on asking the service industry to reduce price? Absolutely, and as I said in my commentary, it is better for all parties to negotiate rather than to run to retender.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly on the deepwater side, I guess there was some uncertainty in past calls about what the gross versus net rig additions would be. Do you have any thoughts there in terms of capital allocation, pulling equipment from idle rigs and putting them on new rigs? Or I guess I'm generally referencing the CapEx down 10% in the company deepwater.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. There is a lot of CapEx associated with deepwater that you cannot pull from other rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For example, the cables, the capstans that are used in deepwater, they are unique to deepwater and some of the units are unique to deepwater. But to the extent that we can pull tools from other theatres where activity is declining and put them on deepwater rigs, absolutely we're doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is that part of the 10 &#x2013; that's part of the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the CapEx, I wouldn't say the whole amount but some of the CapEx savings will be due to rationalization across different parts of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Andrew.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you might be able to give us some range of magnitude of the pricing relief that your customers are asking for in the international markets.  And just in context, could you also give us some general sense on what product lines are most vulnerable and which may be least vulnerable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the best way I can say this because I don't want to give you a number is that it is much less than some of our dear customers are announcing. Some of the announcements they've made as objectives, they are not achieving in terms of price reduction from the service industry. I would say that anything to do with deepwater probably has the most capacity to resist.  Anything to do with bulk land markets has the least capacity to resist, and jack-ups would be somewhere in between.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean service lines related to working with jack-ups, is that what you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm saying all service lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to distinguish between one new service line or another because the pressure is fairly general. What I'm going to distinguish is type of activity. So I'm saying in deepwater, there is more capacity to resist. On land, big bulk land operations, lots of land rigs, lots of competition; there's much less capacity to resist.  And jack-ups and third-generation semis would come somewhere in between.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my follow-up would be that you had a phenomenal performance I would say in Europe, Russia, and Africa in the quarter. And I was curious as to how much of that was related to activity or business vis-&#xE0;-vis how much of that could be contributed to the cost cutting efforts that you already referenced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; inactivity, I think that the serious decline was obviously Russia. The rest held up probably slightly better than even we expected, particularly in the North Sea and West Africa. And the capacity to offset Russia obviously largely came through pretty prompt action in last quarter of last year on cost reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the mix of oil and gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, mix was good and cost; the cost cutting, cost reduction efforts took place early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to clarify one last thing, one of the first comments made on cost cutting. The cost reductions that we saw, 450 million in the quarter, did I hear you guys right in saying you expect to see a similar impact as we move into the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to let Simon answer that, Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Kurt, basically the 450 represent mostly variable costs. There is a lot of cost associated with a revenue drop that naturally disappears like cost of product. We had some favorable exchange gains, but this has not much impact on the bottom line because a similar amount also was dropped in the revenue. So what we're going to see going forward is the impact on the reduction in head count that, as I mentioned, is almost completed, the first wave that we announced. So you will see a cost reduction, although it will be from a different nature than the one that we have already seen in the first quarter. This is mostly variable element.  The fixed costs will take a little bit longer to adjust to.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>And your next question comes from the light of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Andrew, your last point in your opening statement, I wonder whether you could elaborate a little bit more on your views with respect to a global oil supply response to this very steep slowdown that we have seen in global activity.  It's something you talked about before and I think if anything, this slowdown seems to have been steeper than what anybody could have imagined, or maybe not.  But can you give us some clarification on what you see there and how you see it relative to what you thought half a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I'm still very much in the mood I was at Howard Weil earlier.  That is that we need to see a stabilization of demand before the supply decline is really going to bite.  And it's the timing of &#x2013; to me, it's more the timing of the stabilization of demand. And even if there is a slight increase in demand, that is going to tip the scales rather than a decline in supply. Now obviously, if the decline in supply goes on long enough beyond the end of this year and all the rest of it, that's going to start having a material impact.

          <p>In terms of technology, as I said before, we have divided our portfolio into three. There is first the technology to match competitive threat that we will introduce as and when it is ready. Secondly, there is technology to reduce customer cost, which we will introduce when it's ready. And thirdly, there is some technology that we consider this is not the right market to introduce it into because you would be introducing it at a lower level of pricing. And therefore, we will take the time to perfect that and bring it back to the market when we see activity starting to increase again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I've got a lot of questions here. I'll start with this one. Your margins were better than your peers. You attribute a lot of the margin preservation to mix. I was wondering how much has to do with established footprint and market share position. Essentially, are you the last to feel any pain in most of the markets other than maybe North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually given our size, I think we're the first to be attacked, so I don't think you can attribute it to that. It is true that our footprint helps in these circumstances. But I am afraid &#x2013; I have to compliment the management team. We made the decision that we're going to have to cut costs in October last year, and they have done an excellent job.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you still see this as a typical cycle, and do you think that the pace of margin compression with your backdrop that you laid out there is going to be smooth, or do you think it's going to be choppy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I don't have any reason today not to think that this is not like any other Eastern Hemisphere cycle. So let's leave aside North America. Eastern Hemisphere cycles typically take about 18 months to roll over. And if you consider that this cycle started in Q4 of last year, then if it follows the pattern of all the previous cycles, it will roll over in Q2 of next year.</p>
          <p>Now, there are always factors that can influence that one way or the other positively or negatively. Negatively would be that the recession deepens. Positively would be what Ole just mentioned that supply starts to roll over sooner than you think. I don't have &#x2013; we don't have; in fact, I was discussing this with Chakib just before we came on the call. I don't have &#x2013; we don't have any reason to believe this is not going to be a normal cycle.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. All right, my second, my follow-up &#x2013; I'm going to cheat here a little bit and make it unrelated.  But I'll ask this on the deepwater side. I follow up because of the impact of the Brazilian exploration seemed to have on your related mix and your results. With the general shift away from exploration that you've mentioned in the last few releases, can you comment on the decline in your revenue or profitability expectations versus what you may have been anticipating last fall? I guess really what I'm trying to get at here is what the incremental exploration means for Schlumberger in a normal market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a good question, Alan. I think that obviously, I don't have to describe the effect on seismic to you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's dramatic. And in terms of the other high end measurement services that we perform principally while on testing, obviously any reduction in exploration is unfavorable to that revenue mix, but it's not dramatic at the level of the company. It makes our margin performance more difficult and it's generally unfavorable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Andrew, as several people commented, margins in the Eastern Hemisphere held up extraordinarily well. But your outlook comment emphasized the degree to which customers are getting price relief. I'm just having a little difficulty reconciling the strength of the margins and this comment that customers are getting price relief. Is there something about the first quarter that held up margins better than you would expect to be sustained or is this just a timing issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that a timing issue is a good way to describe it, Geoff. We started cutting cost in Q4. The customers started negotiating with us in Q1, and therefore a lot of the price concessions that we have given will flow through in the subsequent quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And given that you had it sounds like a one quarter head start on the cost cutting side, how do you feel about your chances of being able to preserve these margins as the pricing rolls in, but then the cost benefits also are coming, are being realized?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last question, Andrew. Do you think that the world is moving increasingly on land toward an IPM model, and do you think having a fleet of land rigs is going to be essential toward being a leading participant in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think over time that packaged drilling is going to become far more common all around the world. And I'm deliberately saying packaged drilling and not IPM. And the issue with land rigs is they're very nice when the market is strong and they're awful when the market is weak. So I don't &#x2013; we still don't think that it is in all cases essential to own land rigs to participate in packaged drilling projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you do expect that packaged drilling projects will continue to grow as a percentage of all the land business outside North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over time, if you look at the well density per square kilometer or square mile or whatever you want in North America and you compare it to overseas and you say that the U.S. industry is 40 years ahead of the rest; over time if you want to recover oil, you have to drill. So there are going to be more holes drilled. And therefore, yes I do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I guess, Simon, could you talk a little bit about the working capital draw in the quarter, a pretty big number? Is that just the Q4 good collections just coming back in Q1, or is there something else going on there?  And what should we expect for the rest of the year on working capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So normally Q1, we do deteriorate in working capital as comparing to Q4. In the Q4, we have as we do every year good collections. There are certain customers that do pay their cash allocations. And if you look back at Q4, we performed extremely well on receivables, which reversed the situation in the Q1.</p>
          <p>The other item is the payment of the incentive, bonuses, and the profit sharing that takes place in Q1. So if you add these two, it's almost 70 to 80% of the deterioration in working capital. So we did expect it to be at this level, as a matter of fact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you. Then I guess, Andrew, as we look at Schlumberger in its entirety as you look through the rest of the year, international margins outperformed our estimate this quarter, North America in line. You've got all sorts of mix and pricing issues going on. How do you think about the magnitude of margin compression for Schlumberger as a whole as we move through 2009? I mean are we going to be able to hold margins steady?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think overseas we're going to be able. In North America, I just don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And overseas, I don't &#x2013; as I ex &#x2013; we had a timing where we cut costs before we renegotiated price. So I don't think we can hold Q1 margins through the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the decrementals that you've talked about generally in the international markets, you haven't really changed your expectation there.  It's just the timings is a little different.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last thing related to that I guess would simply be given what you said, it sounds to me like North America doesn't get better until 2010. International is mid-2010. Can Schlumberger make more money in 2010 than 2009?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, got it. Second question, we lost money in WesternGeco in 2003. Do you foresee being able to make money at WesternGeco through this adjustment period? And if you do envision making money during the entirety of this adjustment period, what adjustments are you making in order to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me deal with the last part first, okay, so we are cutting costs in WesternGeco, particularly variable costs around the vessels and the land crews, proactively. And we actually will actually lay up some vessels; not very many, but we will lay some up.</p>
          <p>So what are the differences between now and 2003? The first is 2003 was still quite shortly after we had merged Western Geophysical with Geco-Prakla. At the height of that, we had 28 boats and we gradually worked off those boats. So we were much more exposed then than we are now in the marine market.</p>
          <p>The second thing is, and this is going to be a question for the whole seismic industry, not just for WesternGeco, in 2000 and that period, everybody went out and shopped Multiclient or speculative seismic on the basis of being able to borrow from the banks. Now hopefully this time around, the banks will have the good sense not to lend everybody the money to go and choose a lot of speculative seismic, which will encourage a much faster reduction of the marine fleet than we had in that cycle, Bill.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing is we had inherited a huge combined library...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...from Western Geophysical and Geco-Prakla, and today our library is tiny. The balance sheet value is $285 million, whereas I think, Simon, it was well over a billion, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Close to a billion, yes.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Close to a billion last time around.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are very hopeful that we will be able to make money through the cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last one from me, given the strength of your balance sheet and given your past proclamations that were prices to contract by a sufficient magnitude that you would be more opportunistic from an M&amp;A standpoint, how savory is the environment now with regard to acquisitions? Are seller expectations reasonable, or is the environment pretty inflexible and you're not optimistic about doing something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In certain markets where we have made acquisitions in the past, for example Russia, the state of credit markets is making aspirations much more reasonable than they were even a couple of months ago. I think it will take time to work through the system, in other places, for example North America, I suspect that it's going to take another quarter or so before people really realize, feel a little choked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I would say expectations are adapting themselves. They're not all there yet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In Russia specifically, a market that has hurt you of late, there is some view that that market is at least bottoming out. One, would you agree with that; and two, if so, is it going to stay at low levels for some period of time or is there any hope of a recovery there in the relatively near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would agree that the Russian oil companies because of the devaluation of the ruble against the dollar have made huge ruble profits and will over the next few months. I also think that the decline in Russian production is now becoming a recognized fact. And without being in any way certain, because there are a lot of uncertainties still to be resolved, it is not impossible that towards the end of the year we see some mild recovery in Western Siberian activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That would be great, certainly relative to where the market has been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. There is a lot of &#x2013; even this year, there is a lot of seasonal related effect in the first quarter Russia revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely, and then more of a broad question, been &#x2013; have kind of been polling folks on this one, so interested in your view. Does the level of the oil price matter so much as the stability? So at $50 oil in 2008, costs maybe not, but with costs coming down the way they are, and if you have even stability at these levels, does that change the outlook of your customers just more from a confidence standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously yes, it does change the confidence of the customers. But I still think that given the nature of many of the projects that our customers want to undertake, even with the cost reductions, $50 oil is going to be tough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's all from me. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Andrew, just a follow-up question on the pricing concessions. Is this strictly something that you're only offering or giving up on the traditional delivery of your services, or are you seeing your clients wanting price relief on the existing IPM contracts you've signed even though those are turnkey in nature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we have seen any request for price relief on an IPM project, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so do you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My colleagues are confirming that to me. We have not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is no, is there an expectation for that here as we move through the year, or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that, however, the scope of &#x2013; the amount of IPM work that's going to be available could well be affected by budget cuts in some of the customers who use IPM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I guess just one follow-up as it relates to Latin America; I guess another quarter really no startup costs impacting margins. Just curious as we move through '09 and the incremental Chicontepec award gets started, do we expect to see some margin pressure as a result of startups or are we pretty much entrenched there and shouldn't expect anything detrimental to margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our footprint in Chicontepec now is sufficiently material that we can start the next ATG without any significant startup costs. There may be some usual mobilization of rigs and that sort of thing, but apart from that, no.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you help us with I guess a little bit more of the, some quarterly outlooks. So for example, first question; if there is typically some seasonal weakness in the second quarter as boats transit north, is that something that we can expect to see again this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think so, yes. I'm not quite sure it will have such a dramatic effect as it did last year, but we'll certainly see it again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes sense. But there's boats in transit for some summer work in the North Sea. And that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one of the things which I said before, I'll repeat it now because it's useful for everyone to know is during the time that the fleet was flat-out, we postponed dry-docking boats, which the classification societies will let you do for a certain period of time. However, now that we are in a different market, we are going to do the dry-docks that are required for the certification of the boats, so it is transit and dry-docking. Hello?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think that was total and if my notes were &#x2013; I was looking back and it was 1 billion that you thought would be worked off in '09, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>No, not really.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that's apart from the part that was eaten up in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. But there are no delays of projects per se.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't seen, we have some pressure, but we've not yet seen any radical cancellations or requests for major price relief. What we are seeing is our customers are pushing surveys out. In other words, the backlog may last longer than we originally thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So 2010, the remainder of that backlog might stretch out even longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It might stretch out a bit, yes.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just last one sticking within WesternGeco, you mentioned a commercial project for coil shooting, which sounds interesting, and we're aware of that technology a bit. I guess it's interesting you mentioned three technology categories and this one might have been considered in that third one where pricing would not have &#x2013; you might have waited for a different market just to take advantage of a tightness in boats because you're actually loosening up supply effectively, right? So it's an observation, but if there is any color you can give us in coil shooting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think the color I have to give you is that we had already performed extensive field tests with customers of coil shooting. It would have been perhaps very difficult for us to take it off the market now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes sense. That makes sense. Is it an unfortunate truism that it's -you do effectively add some capacity back into the market?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because we reduced the number of boats that are required to do wide azimuths or full azimuth and shooting, yes. But we are not giving away coil shooting.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Hello, Andrew.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we get back to Latin America if we could, a lot of moving parts on the margin issues. You mentioned mix and offshore activity Brazil, which should be a positive. Efficiency gains I guess from rolling off the startups on some of your IPM, but then we have additional IPM startups. And so just good performance in the quarter on margins, and I know that you've addressed this a little bit, but the additional IPM startups, will those be, will those tend to take margins down sequentially as you have more past-due in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me deal with the margin question on IPM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When projects are stable, margin improvement comes through performance. And in Mexico that means how many wells you deliver to PEMEX and PEMEX accept per month. It's a cycle, right. So we, Q1 we did a lot better than Q4 probably because we have been doing better in Burgos. I suspect that &#x2013; and in the south by the way. As I said before, I don't anticipate large startup costs in Chicontepec, and the only question in Chicontepec is going to be how quickly we can get to the same level of efficiency as we have in the current contract.</p>
          <p>And then in the rest of Latin America, we have lower activity in Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago, higher in Brazil, lower in Argentina. It's a complete mix. But the dominating factors upwards are Mexico and Brazil and the dominating factors down were Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so I think you answered the question, the mix in Brazil, the improvement in that mix should continue and there should be continued growth. I'm talking about even...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly as long as IOC exploration continues, the mix should continue to improve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My follow-up is unrelated, but relative to consolidation opportunities in North America and it seems like in this up cycle, you need it on margin expansion through competition, particularly in pressure pumping. What is your appetite, you mentioned a couple of quarters for some people to see a choke point. So what is your appetite for consolidation for the sake of consolidation versus technology gains North America specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've never been &#x2013; we've not been and I don't think we would be doing acquisitions purely to consolidate market share. There has to be something more to it. But we will as I said before be opportunistic.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Andrew, in the comments you made at a recent conference, one of the areas that you cited as not economic at current oil prices is ultra-deepwater. I wanted to ask you what specifically, where you make that cutoff in terms of deepwater and ultra-deepwater.  And what kind of oil price is required to make the ultra-deepwater play more economic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually I think that ultra-deepwater is probably north of 8,000 foot of water or something like that, deeper than 10,000. It's really big huge stuff, where the rigs are very expensive. Actually I think that the oil price we need is obviously to make the project economic, but it's also to de-risk the project. Because obviously, risk is much higher when you're doing that sort of work. So I think we're going to have to get back to $70 to see a big resurgence into things like ultra-deepwater or very remote Arctic for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you mentioned heavy oil, enhanced oil recovery, ultra-deepwater not profitable at current levels. How critical &#x2013; I mean in the overall sense, how critical are all of those areas to Schlumberger's ultimate rebound from...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think ultra-deepwater for us would be icing on the cake. I think enhanced oil recovery was a growth business and therefore it at the moment doesn't play a big part in what we do, but could play a big part in the future, so to the extent that it restarted, it will provide a growth opportunity.  And heavy oil depends. If it flows, we have a role to play. If it doesn't flow naturally, then our role is somewhat reduced. So heavy oil, not being I think needing prices way north of 70, particularly in Canada, it's likely to take quite some considerable time. But it does not have a huge effect on us.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Russia, is this another factor in the slow or recovery that you expect there, as it's mostly that kind of activity.  I'm talking about enhanced recovery, sorry.</p>

          <p>Okay, understood.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just the production enhancement type of activity in Russia we think will come back quite fast eventually.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Andrew, I'd like to just follow up really quickly on North America and with margins. I recognize there is a lot of uncertainty out there. But can you just add some comments on the expectations for further margin declines? And once the rig count and activities flatten out, would you expect margins to flatten out and potentially pick up as cost savings roll through? Or do you expect there to be a further decline at that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So firstly, I think that everyone is going to have a really rough time in the second quarter with North America margins just on the basis of very, very low activity. And actually, I think that cost reduction will allow us &#x2013; will allow the industry, will allow us to stabilize North America margins. But it's going to take either removal of capacity or a fairly substantial increase in the rig count to move pricing power back the other way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you would expect a bottoming of margins in 2Q or potentially 3Q and then they should be on the upward move in 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know what's going to happen in North America this year, and I will not know, and I don't think I'll have any idea until we see some improvement in industrial demand for gas.</p>
