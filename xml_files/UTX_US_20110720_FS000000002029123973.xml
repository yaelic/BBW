      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Dana, good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, we had another solid quarter with organic sales growth of 6% and that's after 9% organic growth in the first quarter. You'll recall that we actually saw the recovery in our sales growth start in the second quarter of last year where we saw 4% organic growth. So, with five consecutive quarters of organic growth under our belt we're confident now in the sustainability of the recovery in our end markets and we're confident in our full year forecast of organic sales growth of 5%.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share in the quarter, $1.45. That's up 21%. Continued focus on cost reduction and operating leverage from higher sales drove segment margin expansion even as we increased investments in engineering and development. And it's no surprise that most of that E&amp;D increase was at Pratt &amp; Whitney as we continued to invest in the development of multiple geared turbofan platforms.</p>
          <p>We're clearly operating in a better economic environment than a year ago, however, most measures still point to a slow and uneven recovery. High unemployment, a weak housing sector, and the deficit standoff in Washington all continued to dampen consumer sentiment here in the U.S. while European sovereign debt worries still plague financial markets and constrain government spending in the E.U. On the other hand, emerging markets continue on their growth trajectories even with the adoption of cooling measures by the various governments to hold down inflation. And importantly, airlines continued to fill seats in spite of higher air fares.</p>
          <p>So with this uneven economic backdrop we continue to see sales and order rates consistent with our full-year expectations for most of our businesses. Carrier's Transicold business remains exceptionally strong, more than offsetting a softer residential U.S. HVAC market. This improved Carrier outlook along with the translation-related benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar gives us confidence to raise the sales and earnings outlook for 2011 one more time. We now expect sales of around $58 billion, that's up from $57 billion we previously estimated and now up nearly 7% from 2010.</p>
          <p>We also expect 2011 EPS to be in a range of $5.35 to $5.45, that's up from our previous guidance of $5.25 to $5.40. That's a range of 13% to 15% up over 2010.</p>
          <p>The foreign exchange has clearly been a benefit so far this year. The euro has averaged $1.40 for the first half of the year, as compared to our original assumption of $1.35. So, we're now assuming that we're going to continue to see this euro average of $1.40 for the balance of year. This FX benefit, and the improved Carrier outlook will more than offset additional engineering and development investments at Pratt &amp; Whitney and a lower outlook at Fire &amp; Security in our increased guidance.</p>
          <p>Before I start with the second quarter discussion, just a reminder that we'll talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items just as we usually do.</p>
          <p>Okay, turning to slide two, second quarter results, you can see sales up 9% with 6 points of organic revenue growth. More importantly, this is the first time in three years that all of our businesses reported year-over-year organic sales growth reflecting a broad-based improvement in our end markets and we still have runway with most of our businesses well below peak levels with the exception of Carrier's Transicold business and Hamilton Sundstrand's industrial businesses, both of which are now likely to be at or near their 2008 peaks.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, Carrier again led the way with 11% organic growth while Otis' sales were up 3% organically. That's after nine quarters of year-over-year decline at Otis, so a real turning point there.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, earnings per share in the second quarter were up 21%. Restructuring expenses were offset by one-time gains in the quarter, compared to a net charge of $0.12 last year. Excluding restructuring and one-time items, second quarter EPS increased 10%. And foreign currency was of net benefit of $0.06 in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Total segment operating profit increased 10% even with $67 million of higher engineering and development investments. Segment operating margin was 15.9%, that expanded 20 basis points with five of our six businesses reporting higher margins.</p>
          <p>Carrier's segment margins were up 110 basis points to 13.9%. And with Carrier's operating margins now at 12.9% for the first half of the year it's highly likely they'll be close to their 12% margin target for the year and that's one full year ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>Okay, maybe the one soft spot in the quarter I think the one thing, of course, that my boss is not very happy about in the quarter, free cash flow was only 80% of net income, which is of course, below our normal benchmark of 100%. Working capital increased by more than $600 million in the quarter due to higher shipments across the businesses, and the timing of cash receipts. However, let me point out for the year we're very confident that free cash flow will still equal or exceed net income.</p>
          <p>Share repurchase was $750 million in the quarter and year-to-date we've invested $1.5 billion in share repurchase, a pace well ahead of our guidance of $2.5 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>Acquisition spend was light again. And year-to-date we spent $184 million, however, Bill Brown and his team continue to work on a robust pipeline and deals are hard to predict. As you've seen in the past with the GE Security acquisition, we have the appetite, and the capacity for large acquisitions and we know how to integrate them well. That said, given that it's already July, we will likely spend less than the $1.5 billion-plus placeholder on M&amp;A this year and will likely spend slightly more than the $2.5 billion placeholder on share buyback.</p>
          <p>Okay, on slide three orders. We continue to see strong order trends in the aerospace aftermarket with Pratt &amp; Whitney large commercial spares up 23% and Hamilton commercial spares orders up 25%. At constant currency, Otis new equipment orders grew 15%, and Carrier's global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 9%, that's a positive sign for commercial construction. Emerging markets continued to do well with particular strength in the BRIC countries where combined orders for the commercial business units were up 26%.</p>
          <p>So, solid quarter, strong organic sales growth, earnings growth and margin expansion all while continuing to make significant investments in these new technologies. I'll come back and talk a little bit more about the back half of 2011, but for now let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg. Turning to page four, Otis delivered a strong quarter with profits up 14% on sales growth of 12%. Operating margin expanded another 20 basis points to 23.4%. Foreign currency accounted for 10 points of profit growth and 8 points of sales growth.</p>
          <p>New equipment sales were up 8% in the quarter at constant currency led by strong growth in China and Russia. Service sales were also up in the quarter with continued growth in contractual maintenance and repair. New equipment orders increased 15% at constant currency led by China where orders were up close to 30%. Orders in North America were up mid-single-digit while orders in Europe were flattish.</p>
          <p>Pricing remained under pressure in most markets. After, including the translation benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar we now expect full year profit at Otis to grow around $225 million, as compared to the prior guidance of approximately $150 million. Sales are now expected to grow high single-digit based on FX.</p>
          <p>On slide five, Carrier posted another very strong quarter with profits up $78 million, or 20% on 10% higher sales. As Greg said, operating margin for the quarter was 13.9%, up 110 basis points from prior year. Organic sales growth was 11% led by continued rebound of the transport refrigeration market.</p>
          <p>Transicold showed strength across all products and geographies, with sales up organically more than 40% led by the refrigerated container business. On the other hand, North America residential shipments moderated this quarter after a strong start to the year. While split system unit shipments were up mid-teens, this was offset by a double-digit decline in gas furnaces. Earnings growth was driven by volume, strong conversion from continued productivity and cost reduction, and about $15 million earnings improvement in our Japan joint venture from business transformation actions.</p>
          <p>The first half growth in Carrier's Transicold business was truly exceptional. We expect more normal growth rates in the balance of the year for Carrier. After a first half organic growth of 14% we expect Carrier's organic sales to be up about 10% for the year. Given the strong first half performance we are increasing Carrier's profit growth guidance for the year to about $325 million from $250 million-plus previously.</p>
          <p>UTC Fire &amp; Security delivered profit growth of 15% in the quarter on 8% higher sales. Organically, sales were up 4% with mid-single-digit growth in the products' businesses. Among the service and install businesses, we saw high single-digit growth in Asia and Australia and high single-digit contraction in the U.K &#x2013; Second quarter orders grew organically 5%, backlog continues to expand and is up approximately 15% organically year-over-year and from the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the quarter grew 8% at constant currency. Favorable litigation resolution contributed around $25 million of profit growth. Benefit from higher overall volumes was more than offset by substantial profit decline in the U.K. from lower sales and productivity. For the full year, we now expect F&amp;S operating profit to be up approximately $150 million, instead of the prior guidance of $175 million, as benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar and favorable one-time gains are likely to be more than offset by lower-than-expected organic growth for F&amp;S as a whole and lower margins in the U.K. We continue to expect F&amp;S sales to be up high single-digit.</p>
          <p>Turning to aerospace on slide seven, at Pratt &amp; Whitney, sales were up 5%, driven primarily by higher overall aftermarket sales. Large commercial engine spare sales were in line with expectations, and up more than 20% over the second quarter of 2010. Operating profit was down 7% in the quarter. The benefits from net higher sales and restructuring savings were more than offset by a nearly $70 million increase in E&amp;D, unfavorable engine mix in both the large commercial and military businesses, and higher pension costs.</p>
          <p>Operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, down 190 basis points year-over-year due to the impact of higher E&amp;D, and the unfavorable engine mix. As a result of higher E&amp;D investments primarily from timing of programs, Pratt's operating profit is now likely to be down around $100 million for the year, as compared with prior guidance of down $50 million. We also expect Pratt &amp; Whitney sales to be up slightly for the year.</p>
          <p>Hamilton Sundstrand delivered a solid quarter, with 13% profit growth on 11% higher sales. Organic growth was eight points, while foreign currency translation contributed three points. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by continuing strength in the industrial and aerospace aftermarket businesses. Commercial spares were up around 35%, while aero OEM sales were flattish, as commercial aero growth was offset by declines in space and defense.</p>
          <p>Profit growth in the quarter reflects the benefit of net higher sales, and slightly lower E&amp;D, partially offset by higher program costs. Operating margin was up 40 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%. Commercial spares orders increased 25% versus last year, with book-to-bill slightly below 1. Industrial orders were up about 20% and remained particularly strong at Sullair. This quarter we also saw an improvement in the longer-cycle Sundyne business. For the full year, Hamilton Sundstrand remains on track to increase operating profit by about $100 million with mid-single-digit sales growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to Sikorsky on slide nine, operating profit increased 17%, on 6% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 70 large aircraft, two more than the second quarter of 2010. 57 aircraft were based on military platforms, and 13 commercial, including only one Canadian Maritime helicopter. Higher sales in the quarter were driven by increased aftermarket volumes, and higher commercial aircraft deliveries, partially offset by lower international military aircraft deliveries.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded 110 basis points in the quarter to 11.5%, primarily reflecting the benefits of higher aftermarket volumes, low-cost sourcing, and slightly lower E&amp;D. For the full year at Sikorsky, we continue to expect profit growth of approximately $100 million on sales growth of mid to high single-digit.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Akhil. We're on slide 10 now for those of you following along. A solid quarter, continued momentum in organic sales growth puts us on track to deliver on improved sales and earnings outlook for the full year; I think that's the really good news here.</p>
          <p>It was also great to see Otis report organic growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008. And, of course, it's heartening to see Carrier continuing to deliver on its operational and portfolio transformation agenda with a very strong quarter.</p>
          <p>Also in the quarter, some big accomplishments. Otis won a contract to modernize and maintain the Empire State building elevators as their biggest modernization contract in history. On the aero side, we achieved a major milestone on Pratt &amp; Whitney's geared turbofan. Pratt's first GTF engine for the CSeries aircraft successfully completed its first flight on June 20, and it validated the performance metrics that make it an industry leader on fuel burn, noise, and emissions. Hamilton Sundstrand is firmly on track to support the 787 entry into service, which we now expect to be in September. And Sikorsky's BLACK HAWK platform continues to drive international growth. We had significant wins this quarter in both Australia and Turkey.</p>
          <p>So, with solid results year-to-date, and the healthy order trends, we're confident in achieving the increased outlook of $5.35 to $5.45 for EPS on sales of around $58 billion. That's earnings growth as I said before, of 13% to 15% on sales up nearly 7%.</p>
          <p>Now this conversation wouldn't be complete if we didn't talk a little bit about some of the concerns, but let me tell you first of all, that we're confident in our cost reduction efforts and our initiatives to drive growth. There are concerns out there. We all know what they are, there's a sluggish recovery in the U.S., a weak consumer sentiment, there's continuing uncertainty in Europe and we hear a lot about commodity inflation driven by emerging market demands, as well as high oil prices, which are putting a damper on airline profits. We know about these things, but we're focused on doing things &#x2013; focused on what we can control and that's cost and that's delivering value to customers.</p>
          <p>We also talked about pressure on E&amp;D as we continued to invest in these innovative new technologies, particularly as we ramp up the multiple next-generation product platforms at Pratt &amp; Whitney. For the full year we now expect engineering and development to increase by at least $275 million. We also expect restructuring expenses of around $200 million for the year. And for the full year, consistent with our prior expectations, we see one-time gains will offset restructuring expense for the year.</p>
          <p>Other couple of changes, effective tax rate will be a little bit higher, we think about 31% now for the year, that's up from the 30.5% we previously looked to &#x2013; or previously estimated and we'll use that additional tax or the higher tax rate to repatriate some additional foreign cash later this year.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned before, free cash flow slightly below 100% of net income in the first half, we're still confident free cash flow will equal or exceed net income for the full year. We continue to expect solid conversion from organic sales growth for the balance of the year based on our relentless focus on costs and continuing to take advantage of operating leverage across our businesses.</p>
          <p>So, overall, very confident in our improved 2011 outlook. We've got a great seasoned management team that's focused on positioning the business for long-term growth with innovative products, a global market presence and flawless execution. Now, let me stop there. Let's open up the call for some questions. Dana?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll take our first question from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Greg, real strong performance out of Otis and Carrier in the quarter relative to our expectations, and I'm wondering on Otis if you can just talk about the step-up in profit forecast there given the pricing pressure comments that you made. It doesn't look like maybe the mix is as much of a headwind as you thought before. What other dynamics at Otis are going on? And then maybe you can address some of the press reports on the China issue there if there's anything to talk about there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all, I think at Otis, they had a very good quarter, continued to grow earnings, continued to deliver on conversion, too. Operating profit or segment OP margin I think was up 20 basis points for them. Obviously, they do benefit from the mix shift. Right now about 60% of their business is service, about 40% new equipment. And we're going to see some pressure going forward, I would tell you on that margin as new equipment starts to pick up.</p>
          <p>We had a good quarter. I think 15% on a constant-currency basis increase in orders. Very, very strong in China, up almost 30% in orders. So, again, good growth there, good growth around the world, we saw good growth in Russia, in India, in Brazil. The U.S., Europe kind of a different story, kind of flattish. The U.S. is a tougher compare because of the big order we had last year with the LAX airport, but I think good momentum across the new equipment business at Otis and as always, a strong focus on cost control, which is why you're seeing these very, very strong margins.</p>
          <p>Second part of your question, I think everybody has heard there was an incident in the Beijing Metro a week or so ago, a tragic accident where we had one of our escalators fail. We're obviously working with the people in Beijing. We've identified the problem. It's a pretty small problem, as you think about escalator sales in Otis it's really less than 10% of their total China revenue. This particular model there's less than 200 of them in service. So, we're out there obviously actively working to correct the problem. We've identified root cause and we got to make sure it doesn't happen again. But no big financial impact we think to Otis. Obviously, just a terrible accident.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Greg, just on Carrier's second half implied guidance, I mean, you're up almost $300 million profit in the first half year-over-year. I think you had mentioned 6% organic assumption for the second half. Can you take us through the pieces within Carrier around that 6%, and then it does look like the flow-through on the second half year-over-year revenue increase is kind of light and is that caution, is that copper prices moving up or what's driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start and I'm going to have Akhil fill you in with the details. First half on an adjusted basis we're up about $245 million. It was about another $80 million of back half earnings growth that we see. Again, we saw very strong organic growth in the first half of the year driven by Transicold. That's going to slow down in the back half of the year. So, again that's a high-margin business. We see good sales conversion on that. So, you're going to see a little bit lower conversion in the back half of the year. But having said that I think all of the businesses are hitting on all cylinders there. Slowest in the residential side, but still I think good earnings momentum there and it's going to be a good year. You just have to remember the compares get tougher in the back half of the year, not just for Carrier, but on the commercial aero side as well. And that's why I think, again, very strong first half and we'll have a good back half, but probably not the same big headlines that we saw here in the front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of data points to add to what Greg said. I mean, first half organic growth for Carrier, nearly 50% of that came from Transicold, which as you know, is the high-margin business. In the back half, that slows down a little bit because of tougher compares, Transicold started recovering last year as you will recall and certainly, in fourth quarter, so you'll see probably 10% of Carrier's organic growth in the second half will be from Transicold, and what picks up is international residential, particularly Latin America, which is one of the lower margin businesses. So, I think there's a little bit impact from that, Terry. And in reality 23% conversion in the back half is not really something to feel bad about, I think it's a pretty good conversion still given that mix issue.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Hey, Joe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just sticking with Carrier for the first question. Could you guys comment on whether Transicold was up or down sequentially from Q1, and then just a little bit of commentary maybe on the gas furnaces, which is something we pay a little bit less attention to maybe than the splits. What are the different demand dynamics there, and why was that down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Transicold was slightly &#x2013; was flattish, although container, which is a big part of that business, was down in the second quarter, compared to the first. Not surprising, Joe, because I think as we talked about, first quarter container was very, very strong and if that run rate had continued, the implied market for the year would be 60% above their prior peak, which was not going to hold. So, I think that's the &#x2013; so we see the trends, which are not surprising at all, the truck trailer business picked up a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, too on gas furnaces, obviously we've seen the impact in the quarter of the elimination of the stimulus during the year. Gas furnace was down, I think cooling was up in the quarter, so the net residential HVAC was about flat. I think the good news is Carrier's got a great new product they're introducing in the back half of the year, the new Aurora, it's a very high efficiency furnace, we hope to actually use that to leverage sales growth into both the fourth quarter and into next year but, again, I think it goes back to it's a slow economy out there on the consumer side, housing is still relatively anemic but, again, positioning ourselves, making investments today to grow on the long-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second question, just turning over to Pratt, you bumped up your E&amp;D expectations. Is there &#x2013; I mean, I know you have a lot going on there and we understand why of course, E&amp;D is going up, but in terms of the incremental change in the quarter are there areas you're struggling on with the GTF that you had to put more resources into? I didn't really see acceleration of any schedules out there in terms of your platforms during the quarter, so just wondering what that is due to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we saw in the quarter is the run rate on E&amp;D picked up a little bit from the first quarter. And it's that run rate that we saw in the second quarter we just recognized it's going to continue on through the year. So, I think in total E&amp;D at Pratt will be approaching $1 billion dollars for the year. The key here is to get ahead of the curve here and continue to make these investments to make sure that we're ahead of the schedule.</p>
          <p>Airbus obviously is anxious to get the engine out there, we've pulled that schedule up, we said before about six months from our original expectation. But the key here is just making sure we get everything done ahead of schedule because if you get behind schedule these programs get very expensive and Pratt, as we said before, they have to execute flawlessly on these programs and to the credit of the folks over at Pratt &amp; Whitney I think they're spending the resources, they're spending the money today, and they're getting the results, right. We validated the CSeries on the first flight, we met the fuel burn, we met noise, we met emissions. So, everything's going along. But there's a lot on their plate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment, Greg, more quantitatively in any way you see possible, help us understand exactly how you're tracking relative to plan not from a dollar standpoint, but how many boxes are you checking on the program relative to where you should be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We just had our operating review with Pratt &amp; Whitney last week and it's a great question, Joe, because, again, as you're spending all this money the question is are you spending it as efficiently and as effectively as possible? So we have something called an earned value management system, which tracks the progress that you're making on a day-to-day basis with each dollar that you spend and I think what was heartening with us is that Bob Saia, who heads up the program said they are right on track from an earned value standpoint from the cost, the dollars that we're spending so far have been as efficient as we had expected them to be. So, that's not to say there's not going to be problems later on, but I'd say so far I think we're doing a great job.</p>

          <p>Hey, on Sikorsky we were expecting three of the Maritime deliveries. Does that change the outlook for deliveries for the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Absolutely. I think for the full year we're still at six, so year-to-date we've only gotten two out so you'll see again, some of &#x2013; I think, probably three push into Q3, and then most likely one into Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, over at Fire &amp; Security the softer operating profit outlook, you tied it to both I think it was lower demand, also lower margins in the U.K., I was hoping you could expand on both of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, Deane, as you know, the U.K. issue first, the government austerity there is hitting the F&amp;S business significantly because, as you know, U.K.'s a pretty big portion of total F&amp;S and government jobs were higher margin and with them going away there's been some kind of a negative pressure on the margins. They also had challenges with some of their portfolio attrition rate, which has been decent, but the margins they are losing on some of those contracts is being replaced with lower margin contracts and that's hurting a little bit.</p>
          <p>And finally, I think, which Scott has focused very much so, is that costs were added a little ahead of the sales. There were a significant number of sales force additions in that country. And we haven't seen the sales to support that. So, costs are a little ahead of schedule there and with all that comes some pressure on margin. But Scott and team are on it, and it will be addressed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So no change to the Fire &amp; Security target margin for 2012, plus 15%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think what you're going to see, Deane, is the margins will be north of 13% this year; we'll get good margin expansion. Obviously, we're disappointed in the first half, but these are things we can fix. Scott, Louis' focused on this with the team, we're going to get these things behind us and I think that 15% target is still out there, it's still something we're going to focus on achieving next year. I think it's &#x2013; we've got a road map to get there.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick question for you on the interest expense, you're running a little bit light in the first half relative to I think you're looking for flat year-on-year, is that still the expectation or are you going to run at this run rate for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Miles, I think the rate goes up a little bit in the back half because we are still planning to issue some debt in the third quarter. So, I think what we see is probably $50 million reduction in interest expense for the year. As compared with I think what we originally were thinking would be flattish. So, some good news there, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the F-22 sounds like it's being halted in terms of deliveries at the OEM level from the oxygen distribution system, is that affecting the military engine shipments as well or are you continuing to ship those at pace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, for the F-22 we're in the process of shipping spare engines right now. In fact, the production engines, those are all gone. This is just we're finishing up this year and into next, I think by next April or May we're done with the spares, and then that will be it for Pratt in terms of F-22, SD 30:35 F119 engine.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what's that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thinking about the GTF on the NEOs, it didn't go that way. I mean, were you surprised by that, I mean, how much of a campaign was it for you guys, how should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's be clear, there's been no engine selection on the A320neo. I think the only news in terms of engine selections is the fact that Boeing has decided on an interim basis to re-engine the 737 with the LEAP-X. But I think the engine competition is still out in front of us. In fact, I think it's &#x2013; this decision by American to go with Airbus to break up the Boeing monopoly that they've had on the fleet is really a testament to the success we've had on the GTF, and what we've been able to do in terms of performance. I fully expect &#x2013; the A320 family of aircraft with the GTF power is going to outperform the 737 in the current configuration. The NEO is still the best value out there. And we've got a real engine, we've met the performance criteria already, and we're going to get there sooner than GE and CFMI. So, again, I think it's actually good news for us in the fact that we've opened up the possibility of Airbus aircraft at AMR and we think we've got a very good shot at putting our engine on those aircraft.</p>

        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, can you talk a little about, I guess, the balance sheet and just the cash, which is &#x2013; one is why were receivables up, I guess $540 million, or so in the quarter, anything in particular, driving that? And then secondly, to get the $4 billion, or so that you've said between buyback and acquisition this year means you've got about $2.5 billion left to spend, if I look at where you are at the end this quarter you've still got $5.4 billion, or so in cash, certainly more than enough and you're going to continue to generate cash. So, what is the right cash balance you should be targeting as we go through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your point on the balance sheet, first of all, back to cash flow, obviously, the growth in receivables, it's mostly at Carrier. Obviously, that's again, part of the selling season. I think we missed a little bit of a few cash receipts that we had been expecting; there was some timing on a couple of issues, but nothing really that gives us concern here, this is really just I think, a week-to-week, month-to-month timing issue so for the full year feel very confident about hitting the free cash flow to net income target.</p>
          <p>As far as the balance sheet goes, there's lots of firepower sitting there. We've got $5.4 billion of cash at the end of the quarter. Debt-to-cap just a little north of 32%. Right now we're going to buy back stock because we don't see the right M&amp;A target out there, but I would tell you that Louis, that Bill, and the team are focused on doing some transactions and eventually, we're going to get there. In the interim, though, we're going to use the cash, use the capital that we have to deploy it effectively and that's right now share buyback, which &#x2013; look at the quarter, we picked up a couple of points of earnings in EPS because of share buyback, we've taken 100 million shares out of the count in the last six years by share buyback, and it's still a very good accretive investment, but we want to do deals, and it's all about timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you've said being north of $2.5 billion in buyback this year, I don't know if we should be using this Q2 run rate, but I guess what I'm trying to ask is, you ended last year at over $4 billion in cash, I mean, it still seems like you're running with an awful lot of cash and really what should that balance be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, we are running with a lot of cash but, again, we use that cash every day in our operations. And again, a big piece of that cash, probably north of $5 billion is sitting overseas, and we use that to fund our overseas operations. So, if you think about it, you probably don't have access to every single dollar out there, but we do put most of it to use every day through our intercompany lending program, and look, it's higher than we want it to be in terms of the cash balance because the M&amp;A spend has been light. I think, again, you'll see us take up share buyback probably at least in the third quarter probably to the same pace that we saw in the first half of the year. Again, we just don't see a big call from M&amp;A right now, but these things, they can change quickly. I'm reminded two years ago in June of 2008, GE Security wasn't on the horizon and by the end of the year, we had inked a deal for $1.8 billion with GE, so these things can happen quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true. And then one last question. Just in terms of your thoughts with regards to what was going on in Europe with Otis, in particular, a fine. I know I don't know exactly when it gets resolved, but how do you factor that and that likelihood into your outlook, especially in 2011 for Otis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact, we just heard back from the first appellate court that we took the case to and, in fact, we did not get any relief from the fine that we originally paid, I guess, four years ago now of about &#x20AC;300 million. So, we hadn't been counting that &#x2013; any money back. I think we still believe we have some opportunity there, we're probably going to appeal this latest ruling, I think, to the European Court of Justice, but I'm not going to bake any of that in. I think those are things that if they happen they're very nice and we'll use that kind of a one-time gain to invest someplace else in the business. So, didn't count on it, and we're not going to count on getting anything back.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just another question on the whole AMR situation, did you guys have &#x2013; were you in any way in discussions, or have an opportunity to talk about GTF on the 37 re-engine, or did that happen kind of totally outside your sphere of communication?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, it's a small industry, obviously we've been working with Boeing, we've talked about this publicly in the past about the opportunity to re-engine the existing 737. And I think, again, the problem we have with re-engining, we've made it pretty clear, is they have an exclusive agreement with CFM. And until we have a new aircraft with the Boeing Company for the 737, we're probably not going to have an opportunity. At the same time, I think the A320's a great aircraft, and it's going to compete very effectively against the 737. This re-engined 737.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a sense, Greg, on what we should expect for E&amp;D trajectory into '12 and '13, kind of at what point does the line start to bend at Pratt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My crystal ball is a little cloudy, and I think we've said before E&amp;D will probably peak at Pratt next year. I'm loathe to give any type of guidance on 2012. I mean, there's a lot of things that will happen between now and December, when Louis stands up to give guidance, but I think again, the thought here is E&amp;D will peak next year, probably start to go down '13, '14.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I was also just wondering on Carrier, a couple prior questions, and Akhil hit it in the open, but can you just be a little bit more specific, Akhil, on &#x2013; you gave us Transicold very specifically, but how commercial equipment performed in the quarter, not the orders, but the actual revenue performance, and the U.S. resi business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Globally, Jeff, commercial HVAC equipment was up high single-digit and U.S. residential was slightly up, just kind of very low single-digit type of level. I think geographically, U.S., Europe &#x2013; Asia was stronger than others &#x2013; but the U.S. and Europe also grew for commercial HVAC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you give us some color on price realization and HVAC in particular, in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure I think as you know, Carrier announced a price in February, that has been doing pretty well. I think we also just recently last week announced a second price increase up to 6% on both residential and commercial products. That should go into effect over the next 75 days or so. So, overall, still the net number for the year that we are expecting is still about $100 million negative for Carrier as the gross commodity costs are probably negative $200 million, offset by about $100 million of price realization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just finally, same thing on Otis, you mentioned price was still tough on new equipment. Any change, though, in kind of the level of pricing? Is it the same, is it worse, is it moderating? Are there any geographic differences that stand out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, the market, especially in the U.S. and Europe remains tough. Obviously, with the dearth of new commercial construction in both the U.S. and Europe, there's not that much new work going on, so the bidding is tough. At the same time, we've recently raised prices in China on new equipment to compensate for the higher commodity cost, especially on some of these rare earth metals that we've seen. So, that happened, I think, July 1 we've raised prices. So, again, Carrier's got this $100 million dollar kind of net commodity. I think Otis will probably have $60 million or so of net commodity headwind for the year, assuming we get good price realization in the back half of the year.</p>

I was wondering if you could give us some sort of clarity on what you think some of the underlying trends might be there, and whether they are sustainable, even though you're coming up against tougher comps in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Rob, we had a very good first half. I would say it's a little bit ahead of our expectation. We talked at Hamilton for the full year of kind of 10% to 12% of growth in spares for the year. Obviously, a good start to the year, but to your point, compares get very difficult in the back half of the year, not just at Hamilton, but in Pratt as well.</p>
          <p>But I think the good news is that, even with these high oil prices, airlines are still making money globally, and they're still spending money on maintenance, and they're still filling up seats. So, I think &#x2013; could aftermarket be a little bit better than what we expected? I think so. Again, inventory we know is low out there both in the engine shops and in the other repair shops. So, I think there's still some opportunity for a little bit better aftermarket both at Pratt and at Hamilton than what we had originally expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're not expecting any sort of underlying trends to deteriorate in the second half; it's just a mathematical calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's just simply math. You think about spares at Pratt in the back half of the year were up 30%. They've been up in the first half north of 30% now. So, it's kind of tough to grow another 30% off of the 30% from last year. And again, oil is always out there as a concern to hold down or to dampen demand in the back half and not that we're predicting a big slowdown, I think we're going to see a continuation of the run rates that we've seen in the first half in the back half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then secondly, at Pratt, I was wondering if you could comment on how say business jet aftermarket spares have gone in the quarter and your thinking in the future here and certainly, on the aftermarket, have you seen some of these heavier maintenance checks coming through on the engine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, to both. I think on the Pratt Canada side, the business jet spares overall were up sort of mid-teens, excluding FX, and it's consistent with what you're seeing on the takeoffs and the regionals, particularly, have also been doing very well. So, I think based on that the Pratt spares, Canada spares were also in line with expectations, and to your second point, I think that's &#x2013; the answer is yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to M&amp;A, you've taken &#x2013; you've put Bill Brown in charge of the group, it seems like you're putting a lot of energy into that area, yet we've had a placeholder that is small, compared to history. And could you talk about what you're trying to do there? Should we expect the numbers for M&amp;A or your placeholder for M&amp;A to go up substantially in the future given an increased emphasis on the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, Doug, you make a very valid point. The fact is the $1.5 billion placeholder we put in place this year was before Louis put Bill in charge of the group. We're going to stay disciplined in the M&amp;A side, but I think we have an appetite to do more. And while it's easy to buy back shares, and not as easy to buy companies, we think we can create value out there with the M&amp;A agenda. We've got six great global franchises, we've got opportunities around the world to do things. And just stay tuned. I think again, more to come, and probably a stepped-up rate of M&amp;A spend, too, during the next of couple years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so making this into a higher profile unit, which it seems like you've definitely done here, that is consistent with a much stronger focus going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think &#x2013; and you're going to see us put our balance sheet to work, you're going to see us put more cash to work on the M&amp;A side. And that's where I think a big piece of growth is going to come from over the next few years is going to come from the M&amp;A. Again, commercial construction is going to be slow, residential slow in the U.S., but we've got a lot of cash and a lot of capabilities on the M&amp;A side, and I think that's what Louis saw in putting Bill in that role, is that we needed a bigger focus and a better focus, and I think Bill is doing exactly that, it just takes time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on Fire &amp; Security, the top line growth you've had seems to be a little bit less than you've expected. When you look forward and you're talking about this picking up in the back half of the year, but what should we expect longer term? Should we expect growth rates to move up more toward high single-digits? And if so, what's going to drive that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, obviously, first half organic sales growth and even full year, we've taken the target down from 6% to about 4%. So, a little disappointed in the rate of growth. There's been a couple of issues geographically, Akhil talked about the U.K. I think what's important is we look the backlog is up about 15% year-over-year, so this back half sales growth looks to be in backlog and I think, again, we're getting momentum out there, but you've got to remember, a big piece of what Fire &amp; Security does in the service and install business is directly related to commercial construction activity, right? And so to the extent that there's a dearth of commercial construction activity, you're also going to see kind of slow-ish growth here.</p>
          <p>So, it will come back, I think commercial construction will come back, we started to see signs of that at Otis, but it may take a little longer than what we had thought. But at least for the back half of the year, confident in the sales forecast based on the backlogs that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're seeing the growth at Otis and you're not yet seeing it here. Is that related to geography or longer lead times at Otis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's really geography. If you think where F&amp;S is particularly strong, it's the U.K. and it's Continental Europe and North American commercial construction; those are the same places where Otis is not seeing big new equipment growth. In the quarter Otis grew new equipment orders I think 15%, but Europe, and the U.S. were not stellar in that regard, if you back out Russia.</p>
          <p>So, it's really the geography that F&amp;S suffers from today. Australia's doing very well. Again, I think the economy down there is doing well, commercial construction is picking up, and F&amp;S is doing well in that geography, they're doing well in Asia, but unfortunately, the majority of their business is in Europe and North America, and those are the markets that continue to suffer.</p>

          <p>I don't know what happened with the phone. Let me try one other thing, Greg, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Much better, much better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. Just a follow-up on a couple things. One is you're usually very conservative in thinking about your financial planning, so this change in R&amp;D at Pratt, does this mean that there's been additional opportunities, or are there some other challenges that you've come across in the process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's other challenges. I mean, the real issue when we started out the year, the timing on the NEO still looked to be entry into service probably 2016. Obviously, there is pressure from Airbus to move it up, as we talked about maybe late 2015 now. And it's just the recognition that we have to get these programs underway. We're at peak spend right now on CSeries. And it's just, again, a lot of resources. And I think the Pratt guys are doing the right thing. They're spending more money sooner to try and make sure that we reduce the risks as we go forward, in the development programs, and that's why I think you're seeing this greater spend now. It would all give us a benefit, albeit maybe not next year, but it will assume to the year after.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I get it. In other words, really the way to think about it is you're not finding &#x2013; you're pushing the envelope on risk now, and you're not finding anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's about risk mitigation today. And I think again, with all the bench testing, and the rig testing that they've done, we call it TRL, technology readiness level, six. We're there on all of our technologies. Spending on that is not cheap, but it's a lot cheaper than spending when you're developing the engine and find a failure on a development test bed. So, I think they're doing the right thing, they're spending the money and quite frankly, we can afford it in the guidance here. So, while we're taking it up a little bit, we're doing the right thing long-term for the business by investing here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the second thing, again, I'd say F&amp;S probably has been of all the businesses the most challenging or the one that's not quite met your expectations. Is there a need to do some further reshaping of the way the business is focused to improve where you'd like to take it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; I tell you, we've done 61 deals over the last seven years to pull together the Fire &amp; Security business and we think we've got a very solid core of business both on the fire products, electronic security products, and the service and install business. There's always opportunity I think to take a look at the portfolio that you've assembled. Just like we've done at Carrier and call out those that don't make a lot of sense, that don't have the same growth attributes that the rest of the business does. So, Scott and team are focused on that, they're even working with Bill I think on that agenda so there's opportunities both in M&amp;A and I would tell you in disposition and I think you'll hear a lot more about that as we go throughout the year and especially in December when Louis gets up and talks about next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Howard, maybe it's a little bit of pride of authorship here for me, but I mean, we've taken 4% ROS businesses and moved them to north of 12%, so that's not something to feel too badly about I think right? And there is opportunity to do more, but certainly 15% next year would be a great target and once we get there, there is room to do more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know we've had this discussion a bunch, I appreciate that, Akhil. And just the last thing is the restructuring frankly, is very modest relative to the size of the company, and the various business units. What &#x2013; when you sort of look at what you're doing now today, Greg, in terms of the targets for improving performance, what are the sort of actions you're finding are most effective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, as we take out and consolidate back-office functions those things have the highest payback. And you talk about modest restructuring, I think we've done about $1.7 billion of restructuring here the last couple years and, although we're only doing $200 million this year I would tell you that the businesses have identified well more than $200 million of potential things to do. So, there's always an appetite to do more restructuring, to take out structural costs and to get more efficient. And the $200 million placeholder is that and I think if gains come in higher than $200 million you might see us take that up. I think the key is gains will equal restructuring for the year. We've tried to maintain that discipline, to go back to it. For the last couple years we spent in excess. But we've done enough, there's always more to do, but we always have our eye on what's going to make sense from a productivity standpoint in the long-term.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First a tactical question. Given that we've slipped some of these Canadian helicopters into the third quarter; maybe give us a little help on the pattern we should look for in Q3 and Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Greg said, I think we are looking at somewhere two to three Canadian Maritimes for the third quarter, and then the remaining in the fourth. We're still looking at about six for the year. Does that help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess so. I mean, just in terms of the earnings, should we therefore, look for flattish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are &#x2013; as you know, Cai, we're not going to give quarterly guidance for Sikorsky, but I think overall we still feel good about that $100 million, second quarter was a good $30 million increase year-over-year in earnings. And as we look ahead, aftermarket is going to grow even at a faster rate and I think we get some additional benefits on the military side from cost reductions. So, I think those two components will help offset incremental loss from the Canadian Maritime and we still feel very good about being able to get the $100 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Cai, I'd also add we've talked a lot about the Canadian Maritime, and the financial impact of the losses associated with the deliveries. I think that's all well-known. I think the key here is we're developing the world's most capable maritime helicopter. We had great reception over at the Paris Air Show from everybody from the foreign governments that were looking at this thing and like any development program there is going to be fits and starts and trouble delivering a couple of these early this year, again, I think that will all be behind us soon. We've recognized in the forecast the fact that Sikorsky's got to deliver six of these this year, it's going to cost them $70 million, $75 million in earnings, and the base business at Sikorsky is doing phenomenally well. I think you back out these develop helicopters and you see a business that's probably going to do 14%. But the fact of the matter is we've got to deliver these helicopters, they're going to cost a lot, but we're going to have a great, great aircraft when this is all done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. And then, I guess, the bigger question obviously, I guess, in one respect good news that American is looking at the NEO and I guess you're in the hunt. Bad news given that Boeing is deciding to re-engine the 737. And therefore, pushing out the new single aisle, which would have been the big opportunity for you. While it's not your call, you obviously must be talking closely to Boeing. Do you have any sense as to when the new single aisle might happen given this turn of events?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think obviously, to your point, we've been working closely with Boeing on the opportunity to re-engine. I think, again, it's &#x2013; the better outcome we have always said for Boeing is a new airplane with a GTF engine on it, we just don't have the opportunity, as you know, contractually with Boeing to offer a re-engine on this &#x2013; on the current 737. When Boeing is going to launch a new aircraft, I think time will tell. I think to the extent that the A320 outperforms the 737 with our GTF engine that just puts more and more pressure &#x2013; and again, the GTF is out there today, we're flying that thing, we've got hours on it, we know it works, we're going to have a very, very competitive aircraft in the A320neo with this engine on it and if anything, hopefully Boeing will move up its decision to build a new aircraft. But that's really a question for Mr. McNerney and for Mr. Albaugh.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last one, your military engine deliveries 44 up from 30 in the first quarter. Where did the big uptick come? And I've been looking for that to be off 15% to 20%, is that still the right range for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Cai, repeat that again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The military engine deliveries were 44 in the quarter, up from 30 in the first quarter. Where did the uptick come from and is that in line with looking for those deliveries to be off 15% to 20% this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. I think the delivery increases came from all categories. I think the F119s were a little up, F117s were a little up and also, were F100s. So, I think it's all in line. First quarter was a little light, but full year is still in line with what we said earlier.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. My first question, I guess, was on what you're seeing &#x2013; or what your expectations are for your construction-related businesses in China because I guess you've got very good order growth in Q2. Obviously, if we look at things like construction machinery orders and shipments in China those have been down double-digit year-on-year the last two or three months, so potentially some &#x2013; that's a lead in some respects for some of your equipment going into buildings. So, can you sort of clarify how you see that market over the next sort of six to 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Julian, I think again, you've got to look at the various segments in which we participate in China. It's really on the building side as opposed to on the machinery and equipment side. And the biggest single driver for growth in China is going to be social housing. I think, year-to-date they started about 5 million new social housing units. They expect to build about 10 million for the year and do that for the next five years. And I think that's driving growth. You also see at the provincial level still big investments in commercial real estate development, maybe slow on the East, but in the West it's not that way. So, people need a place to live. We continue to see this big trend in urbanization; we continue to see that as the driving macro force in China that's going to benefit our businesses. A little different than the machinery and equipment segment because these people need a place to live.</p>
          <p>Obviously it's going to slow down. I think China, the growth rate that we saw this quarter with 30%, or nearly 30% at Otis and over 20% overall for our businesses is not sustainable, but I still think, this is a country that's going to grow at least high single-digits over the next few years and we're going to get more than our fair share there.</p>

          <p>Dana, let's take our last question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll go to Joseph Campbell with Barclays Capital.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to go back to the Beijing escalator accident. There's &#x2013; the story continues to sort of stay in the Beijing newspapers. And I wondered if you could just talk a bit more about the extent to which this is the investigation, and the sort of pause of using Otis restricted just to Beijing and just to escalators or is it country-wide, Otis-wide? Yesterday or the day before there was some comments about perhaps doing the same thing in Shanghai. And how you see this progressing to sort of restore to normal good relations that Otis has China-wide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There, again, it was a tragic accident, Joe. We're obviously working closely with the authorities in Beijing. So far, the suspension of Otis has been related to escalators and it's been really related to the Beijing area. We haven't seen this spread country-wide. As I said, I think we ship about 6,800 escalators in China annually. Not a huge, huge market for us. And, again, as we get to root cause working with the folks in Beijing, I think, we'll quickly get to the point where people are comfortable that this was not a basic quality concern from an Otis standpoint. We think it's probably a sub tier supplier that supplied some substandard parts, we're working through that, we'll figure it out.</p>
          <p>I think right now there's, again, less than 200 of these escalator models out there. We've inspected I think more than 20% as of yesterday. We'll get through those in the next couple of weeks. We'll get all these back in great working order and we'll recover the lost business. But clearly it's an unfortunate incident. These things happen. But the key is how we recover, and how we respond to this. And I think the Otis folks in China are doing a great job. You never like to hear about these things though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I think that's just what people wanted to hear and I think the way that Otis responds will probably be indicative of the way in which you recover from this. And it seems, although the tabloids are all over this, and it just doesn't seem to want to go away, as long as this is working sort of hand-in-hand with the authorities, it should over time, go away, I would guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, I think the key is to work with the customers and to make sure this never happens again, and to make sure that our systems are in place from a supplier quality standpoint that this kind of escape can never happen, but again, I think Otis is on top of this, and they're doing all the right things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just back to the AMR thing again, so the &#x2013; are the regular A320s do you think an opportunity for IAE or are we talking about when you say there's still a competition you're talking about those 130 NEOs and 300 and some odd options for NEOs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, I think those are all up for grabs. The A320 families are the first time they'll be in the American fleet and I think IAE will have a good shot at that with the V2500; we're going to pursue that aggressively with our partners, as well as the opportunity for the NEO. Again, there's no fleet commonality here issue that we have to worry about so I think so we've got a good shot with American. We'll put forth our best foot and I think we've got a great engine and we'll hopefully have a good opportunity here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do we have a sense of when this will happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will be sooner rather than later. I asked Louis that question this morning. I think he mentioned before the end of the summer we would expect to have some type of decision on the engine selection.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not tomorrow yeah, but I would &#x2013; again, what are we sitting mid-July? Again, probably before the first of September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Terrific, thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me just close out. Again, solid results in the quarter, continued momentum in order trends, all good news. We're confident in our improved outlook and in our ability to outperform peers. So, I want to thank everybody for listening to the earnings call this morning. Akhil and team will be available for you throughout the remainder of the day. So, thank you, again and have a wonderful day.</p>
