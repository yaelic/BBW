          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase's third quarter 2010 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We are now going live to the presentation. Please stand by.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator. It's Doug Braunstein. I'm going to be taking you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. We'll take questions after walking through the presentation. One final note, there's a slide in the back of the presentation regarding forward-looking statements. Please read it.</p>
          <p>With that, let me move to page one. We generated $4.4 billion in net income, $1.01 per share on revenues of $24.3 billion. We're highlighting three items here that relate to significant changes in our reserve positions in the quarter. First, as you know, we released reserves in the Card Services representing $0.22 a share of an increase to earnings. In the Corporate sector, we increased our litigation expense through increasing our reserve, and that reduced earnings by $0.18. And in RFS, we booked an increase in our mortgage repurchase reserves. That reduced earnings about $0.15, and that obviously runs through as a contra-revenue item.</p>
          <p>Broadly as you look down, we had solid results in our businesses but I'm going to cover those specifically when we talk about the specific businesses on the following pages. One final note on page one, Tier 1 common at the bottom of the page, about &#x2013; a little under $111 billion in the quarter, that's up $3 billion quarter on quarter.</p>
          <p>I've covered much of the important information on page two, so let's move to page three, the Investment Bank; circled net income of 1.3 billion on revenues of 5.4 billion, IB fees in the quarter 1.5 billion. We continue to be ranked number one in fees, but markets there remain highly competitive. The results demonstrate some particular strength in our Debt Capital Markets businesses as well as our Asian Investment Banking businesses. And you'll see in the back on page 19 very strong league table results.</p>
          <p>Fixed income revenue was 3.1 billion for the quarter. That's down year on year on lower volumes and tighter spreads. However, if you look quarter to quarter and you exclude the negative impact of DVA, which was 150 million in this quarter, and that DVA reflects the credit spread tightening on our structured notes versus a benefit of 400 million in second quarter, revenues are actually up modestly quarter on quarter, largely consistent volumes and spreads from our client businesses.</p>
          <p>In Equity Markets, revenues were 1.1 billion, up year on year and quarter on quarter; very solid client revenues in our Global Equities business that was offset by declines in Prime Services as lower spreads continued to offset actually higher balances we had in the quarter. The quarter results for equities includes DVA impact of a negative $100 million this quarter versus a $200 million benefit we highlighted in 2Q.</p>
          <p>A word on credit, you'll see credit costs were favorable, 142 million benefit, as we released reserves in the quarter. Net charge-offs, however, are at 25 basis points, and that continues to reflect what we've talked about, which is strengthening of corporate balance sheets across our client base.</p>
          <p>Expenses in the quarter of 3.7 billion, that's down both quarter on quarter and year over year. That's largely a function of lower base performance-based comp as well as the impact of the UK bonus tax charges we took in the second quarter. And comp to revenue was 38% in the quarter for the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>On page four, let's spend a moment on RFS. At the top of the page, you'll see circled net income of 900 million. That's on $7.6 billion worth of revenue. I want to focus in on the three component businesses. Retail Banking, which you know is our branch and deposit taking businesses, had 848 million of net income in the quarter. $4.4 billion worth of revenue; revenues are down year over year. That's principally driven by the NSF/OD fee changes in 2010. They're fully reflected in this quarter versus a 50% impact in second quarter.</p>
          <p>That reduction was offset by a number of positives in the quarter, including an improved deposit margin, as well as we continue to increase our branch footprint, ATM footprint, an increase in the number of checking accounts in the quarter, and a number of other positive production metrics you can see on the next page.</p>
          <p>Expenses are up in the quarter slightly. That's largely a function of our continuing investment in our sales force and our distribution business as we continue to add bankers and specialists in the branches.</p>
          <p>Mortgage Banking and other consumer lending, which is in the middle of the page, which reports our mortgage loan origination, our servicing activity, auto, and our other consumer lending businesses, earned $200 million in net income for the quarter, 1.9 billion of total revenues. And that really included very strong Mortgage Banking revenue of 2.5 billion in the quarter. That's before considering repurchase reserves, which I'll talk about in a moment. That was largely driven by higher mortgage origination, $41 billion in the quarter, up 27% quarter over quarter.</p>
          <p>Loan repurchase expense was 1.5 billion in the quarter, and that negatively impacts the revenue line as a contra-revenue item, as you recall. We increased reserves in the quarter $1 billion, and that's largely based on the continuation of a high level of requests for loan files from the GSEs [Government Sponsored Entities] as well as repurchase demands. As a result of that increase, total reserves are now at $3 billion for this category.</p>
          <p>In addition, our realized losses for settled claims rose in the quarter as well, and that's largely because we're working on working down our aged claim inventory. Going forward, we think our realized repurchase losses, what would be the functional equivalent of charge-offs, are going to remain high in 2011, and we've guided you to $1 billion plus or minus. But eventually as we work through bad vintages, we would expect those actual costs to come down.</p>
          <p>Other expenses in this category are up 21% year over year, and that largely reflect higher default related costs. And one other note here, our auto business had very strong earnings, credit improvement, lower delinquencies, and a continued strength in our used car values all contributed to that.</p>
          <p>Finally at the bottom of the page, real estate portfolios experienced a loss of 148 million in the quarter. Revenues, which are principally NII, are down 18%, and that's largely consistent with the runoff in our balances quarter on quarter and year over year. And credit costs, which I'll spend time on page six, really a function of net charge-offs this quarter, declined to $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>So what I'd like to do is skip page five. I've covered much of that information. I'll talk a little bit about Home Lending on page six, and let's focus first on the circled numbers. Reduction in our total home lending net charge-offs in the quarter; we went to 1.2 billion from 1.34 billion in 2Q. And if you look at appendix slide 17, which is our normal chart showing our delinquency trends, you'll see that the curve has essentially remained flat across the categories through the third quarter, and that's the same trend we talked about in May and June of 2Q. In addition to that, HPI home prices remain stable. And as a result, loss severities remained stable in the quarter as well.</p>
          <p>So if you look at these numbers, and you remember that losses lag new delinquencies by approximately five months, what you see reflected in this quarter really is the benefit of the delinquency reductions that we saw in the first four months of 2010. And if delinquencies remain flattish, which they have for the past five months, you'd expect to see our losses going forward flatten out as well.</p>
          <p>Bearing that in mind, if you look at the right side of the page, right, you'll see that our loss guidance for the quarter remains unchanged at 1.8 billion. Now if you take our run rate over the last two quarters and you were to annualize that, we'd have a run rate of about $5 billion to $5.2 billion. We have reserves, as you know, in this category of 11.3 billion. Those remained unchanged during the quarter. And the reason we're keeping both our reserves and our guidance where they are is that there is continuing economic and housing market uncertainty, and we want to reflect that in those two numbers.</p>
          <p>Finally, the WaMu PCI position, which is at the bottom right of the page, you'll notice we haven't changed our allowances or our existing marks. Remember, these are lifetime estimates, and so they include some assumptions about the future improvements in both our trends for delinquencies and severities. And we do note at the bottom here that if delinquencies and severities remain flat for a two-year period that we would have to add incrementally 3 billion plus or minus to our reserves.</p>
          <p>Page seven, Credit Card business, at the top of the page, net income of 735 million on revenues of 4.3 billion; credit cost is a big story for the business this quarter, total costs of 1.6 billion in 3Q. We had a $1.5 billion pre-tax reduction in our loan loss reserves. That largely reflects a lower estimate of future losses, and it's really based on the two numbers circled at the bottom of the page. Our charge-off rate went to 8.06 for the Chase portfolios excluding WaMu. That's down almost 100 basis points quarter over quarter. Thirty-plus day delinquencies declined 35 bps to 4.13. One final note, our absolute dollar of charge-offs continue to remain very high, $3.1 billion in the quarter versus 3.7 in 2Q.</p>
          <p>I want to spend a moment here on outlook for where we are on net charge-off rates. We gave you prior guidance this past month that we believe net charge-off rates will decline in 4Q another 50 basis points to 7.5% plus or minus, and we're maintaining that guidance.</p>
          <p>The revenue line, just spend one more moment there. 4.3 billion in revenues is down quarter on quarter and year on year. That's largely a function of lower outstandings. That includes our WaMu portfolio runoff as well as lower balance transfers, which we talked about last month. EOP balances for the quarter are down 7 billion and almost 29 billion year over year. Revenues are also down because of the impact of the CARD Act. The run rate this quarter is about 65% of the total guidance we gave you of $750 million in net income. That's up from a 25% run rate in 2Q.</p>
          <p>Now on the positive side, I would note that sales volume for our Chase portfolio is up almost 8% year over year, 2% quarter on quarter. It means people are taking their Chase cards out of their wallet and using them.</p>
          <p>Net interest margin at the bottom of the page, up 50 basis points quarter on quarter; that largely reflects a lower level of fee reversals as our credit trends continue to improve, some runoff of some introductory balances, and then a favorable mix in our loan balances.</p>
          <p>One other word here on balances and outlook, we're guiding towards year-end balances of $123 billion for the Chase portfolio. That's down 15% year over year, and that's a function of both charge-offs as well as our pullback in our balance transfer business. Receivables in this category we'd expect to bottom out in Q3 2011 and end the year in 2011 plus or minus 120 billion. The WaMu portfolio we'd expect to decline at the end of 2011 to 10 billion. It began 2010 at 20. We're down to 14.5 billion as of Q3.</p>
          <p>Page eight, the Commercial Bank, overall a strong result for the Commercial Bank, net income of 470 million, up a little under 40% year over year; revenues of 1.5 billion is a record for the Commercial Bank this quarter, and it reflects a number of very positive outcomes. Gross investment banking fees in the quarter were a record revenue. We acquired a $3.5 billion CTL, Commercial Term Lending portfolio in the quarter. We continue to build out our footprint of bankers in the WaMu states, and that has developed into attractive business with new customers. And our liability balances ended the quarter at $138 billion.</p>
          <p>The other circled numbers here on the page are loan balances of $98.1 billion. If you exclude the acquisition impact, they're essentially flat, but we do see some signs of activity. We've had an increase actually in our loan balances in the middle market, up $900 million quarter on quarter. And that's the first time in many quarters we have seen growth there. Some of that is our existing customers; much is new customers. We added almost 500 customers in the quarter in the middle market. Our utilization rates, however, still remain in the low 30s.</p>
          <p>Credit costs of 166 million in the quarter largely reflect an increase in charge-offs in our commercial real estate segment. You'll see net charge-off rate here of a little under 90 basis points, 89 basis points. Commercial real estate represents about 80% of the net charge-off rate. That's versus 62% in 2Q. And we would expect to see continued pressure going forward from commercial real estate. But remember, our commercial real estate balances are not a significant component of the total portfolio.</p>
          <p>Page nine, Treasury &amp; Securities Services, circled net income here of 250 million in the quarter; that's down slightly from last year and last quarter. I would say that the story for TSS remains essentially the same for the second quarter. We have the slow rate environment. It continues to pressure our revenues across both WSS [Worldwide Securities Services] and TS. And that's coupled with some incremental investments we've been taking, and that's reducing our margin over the near term.</p>
          <p>Revenues of 1.8 billion were up modestly year over year, down modestly quarter on quarter.</p>
          <p>And expenses you'll note are up $130 million year over year. And so just a moment to remind everyone, we continue to make investments in this platform in our Global Corporate Bank, our international branch network, our international product capabilities, incremental product expansions, and other platform spending. One other final note, TSS here had a $1 trillion increase in assets under custody quarter over quarter.</p>
          <p>Asset Management on page 10, circled net income of $420 million, revenues in the quarter 2.2 billion, up both year over year and quarter on quarter, and that's based on a number of factors. We had a continuing increase in fund flows in the quarter, almost $38 billion. That included $27 billion into liquidity products, which is our first positive quarter in a year. We had 11 billion of flows into long-term products, which are higher margin. And that's the sixth consecutive quarter of positive inflows there, and largely all of that is based on continued strong investment performance. We also had revenues up on higher market levels. And we also in the quarter saw significant increase in our mortgage production in Asset Management.</p>
          <p>Expense growth here, if you look year over year, was up $137 million, again a story of continued investment for long-term growth. We're hiring front office folks, so our Private Banking advisors were up 17% year over year, and a larger percentage of that internationally. We continue to invest in technology here, particularly in the Private Bank, to improve both the speed and the efficiency of those platforms.</p>
          <p>Page 11 is Corporate and Private Equity. You'll note here we had very strong Private Equity this quarter, $344 million of net income impact after all the expenses. And just a word of caution, Private Equity, the results here can be volatile quarter on quarter. They vary both based on timing of realizations, the market values of our public positions, and so that number will move quarter on quarter.</p>
          <p>Corporate net income, $4 million, is down significantly quarter over quarter, down significantly year over year, and that really reflects three things: one, reduced net income, net interest income in the quarter; second, lower security gains in the quarter; and then third, we increased our expenses in the quarter. And that includes 1.3 billion pre-tax increase in our litigation reserve and that litigation reserve includes items related to mortgages. We aren't going to spend a lot more time discussing that particular topic on the call.</p>
          <p>And the final note of guidance here is that there will be periodic items that affect the Corporate line. We still believe the net income number should be trending over time plus or minus $300 million when you exclude Private Equity.</p>
          <p>Page 12, focus on the balance sheet for a moment, strong results here. Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 common both grew, 139 billion and 111 billion respectively. RWA total assets were actually up modestly in the quarter. And our Tier 1 ratios continued to remain very strong. The absolute levels are higher in both Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common, but there was a modest decline in the ratio this quarter, and that largely reflects the increased level of repurchase activity. We bought back approximately 2.2 billion shares in the &#x2013; $2.2 billion, thank you, Jamie. And we continue to buy back shares to offset our equity issuance to employees.</p>
          <p>Credit reserves remain very strong at 35 billion, and there are details in the back on that.</p>
          <p>And then just one comment, we've added a new disclosure item here, the global liquidity reserve, which is 272 billion. The details of that are in a footnote, but I would just note that outside of the details in the footnote, the firm has a number of other significant highly marketable liquidity positions in marketable securities, corporates, equities, that aren't included in that number. And all in all, we continue to think we have very strong balance position.</p>
          <p>Page 13, outlook, I think I covered all of that.</p>
          <p>So what I'd like to do finally is spend a moment and comment on the mortgage affidavit issue. We're not going to say too much about this today other than the comments that we're giving you here because we're really at the beginning of this process, but I can share some information with you, so let's turn to page 14.</p>
          <p>We've identified issues relating to the mortgage foreclosure affidavits, and those include signers not having personally reviewed the underlying loan files, but instead having relied upon the work of others. Those others, Chase employees, did conduct reviews of the underlying loan files. And there are circumstances where affidavits have not been properly notarized.</p>
          <p>So I want to just step back and have you understand what the nature of some of the information in this affidavit relates to. They obviously differ by jurisdiction. But in general, the type of content that we're attesting to includes: the name of the borrower, property address, the date, whether or not the borrower has actually defaulted and if they have cured the default, and the total amount of indebtedness.</p>
          <p>As a result of these actions, we're reviewing 115,000 plus or minus loan files that are currently in the foreclosure process. And we'll do the following based on that review, either refile the affidavits where appropriate. As you know, we've delayed our foreclosure sales. And so to the extent we can, we'll reinitiate those when appropriate. And we're also in the process of putting additional processes in place to make sure on a go-forward basis, we fulfill all the procedural requirements. Obviously, the company takes these matters very seriously, and we're devoting substantial resources to the issue.</p>
          <p>On page 15, what you'll see at the top headline is really all of these processes are really designed to avoid foreclosure if possible. And what we would say today is say based on the processes, which I'll describe in a moment, and the reviews we've done to date that we believe the underlying foreclosure decisions were justified by the facts and circumstances.</p>
          <p>But let me give you a little more color on the actual processes we employed and why we're comfortable. If you see the first sub-bullet point, 15 days after delinquency is when we first reach out to a customer. Following that, we will send numerous letters. We'll make numerous phone calls. In fact, the frequency of those contacts are likely to increase as we head towards the possibility of taking foreclosure action.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we added in 2009 a separate group outside of our processes to review these loans before we take specific foreclosure actions. So that group, and you'll see an appendix slide on this, goes through a series of questions including: have we made contact, have we pursued mitigation strategies if appropriate. And you'll see those questions listed on page 20 of the appendix.</p>
          <p>As a result of all those actions, since January 2009, we've prevented 429,000 foreclosures through either modifications, short sales, or other loss mitigation actions.</p>
          <p>And just to remind everyone, this is a very lengthy process. And so from the initial default to the actual foreclosure sale for our serviced mortgages, that's on average 14 months in the process or 448 days. Mortgages in the state of Florida for us, that process is 678 days. In New York, it is 792 days, more than two years. And in most if not all instances over that period of time, no principal or interest payments have been made on the mortgage.</p>
          <p>So I think we'd like to conclude by saying is that we really believe the proper approach and response here is to go loan by loan, file by file, customer by customer. And if mistakes have been made, then we need to address them individually, which we will absolutely do.</p>
          <p>And just stepping back, obviously the housing market in the position that it's in, we'd hope that we'd be in a position to move briskly here to avoid further damage and further pressure on the housing market, and ultimately further pressure on the economy.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to at this point open it up for questions for Jamie and I. Operator, would you please open the line?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much, first an easy one. The balance sheet went up 6% sequentially, all on the securities side, not a big deal. Your leverage numbers are not high. I'm just curious if you have &#x2013; how much wiggle room or how much appetite do you have to continue that trend on the modest uptick in leverage there, or are you just growing that as equity builds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That decision is made all the time. It changes all the time. It's just trade exposures and what securities you like and the timing of sales and stuff like that, so that is going to bounce around. It's not a deliberate growth strategy in securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next one is a little different. You talked a little bit about the conference the other day, Jamie. Mitigation techniques, in other words we know the negative side of the impact on returns and risk-weighted assets. But on the mitigation side, you talked a little bit about repricing, but I wanted to ask you what impact can &#x2013; what I'll just sum up under Reg. R opportunities are there, meaning there are asset managers, mutual hedge funds, private equity funds that don't have the same increase in those requirements, so are they more natural owners of some of the assets?</p>
          <p>And then part B of the question is what about the long-dated trades and contracts that you might have on with the rest of the Street where both sides have the willingness to maybe tear up contracts and net things out? How much of an impact can that have on the mitigation front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're asking a long question there. I think on the risk-weighted asset side, we talk about natural mitigants. Things are just going to run off over time. They're actually not really actions we're taking but just securitizations or retail loans that run off over time. Remember, we're economic animals. We're not going to sell something that we think is a good asset with a good return because the RWA is too high relative to capital. So no one can look at us and say we're going to have to sell something cheap to somebody else because we can't hold it. We have plenty of capital. We can hold whatever we want. And we're going to make economic decisions, not Basel III related decisions.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I do think that you're going to find people, some other natural owners of certain assets that don't have the same kind of regulatory or capital stuff. I don't think that's going to be an unbelievably material thing for us. I think if you were in a different kind of business, it might be more material. I do agree with you. There are going to be a lot of ways that when people really go through this, they're going to go man, a CVA/DVA contract, clearing houses, which will diminish the RWA effect pretty dramatically over time. People will really learn how to manage it better, and we haven't tried to do all that, and we're not worried about it because we don't really need the capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So between those comments, that confidence, and the confidence on the ability to reprice, an obvious statement, but you seem reasonably confident that you're able to earn pretty good returns in the new world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're pretty confident in the new world we'll earn good returns for shareholders. And some will be &#x2013; when you talk about reprice if you're referring to retail, it's going to take a while to design the exact products, the exact fees, exactly when to do it. So there may be a little timing difference, which costs us more money as we design those products and roll them out, but eventually we'll have to reprice it, yes.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Doug, I was wondering if you could clarify the outlook on rep and warranty that you gave on the losses for 2010 and '11. And then in terms of the income statement impact, just wondering since this is a lifetime reserve methodology, when would you expect to start consuming some of the reserves that you've built for the rep and warranty or at least matching instead of building reserves here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on outlook, what we said is for 2010, I think our outlook was plus or minus 1.2 billion of expense, right? Obviously, you'll take a look at our third quarter numbers are a little higher, and so we're likely to come in at the high end of that range.</p>
          <p>For 2011, what we've said is $1 billion of realized repurchase losses. And what we've done is we've taken &#x2013; based on what we know, we've gone back and increased our reserves by $1 billion based on the higher file requests as well as higher settlement demands. And where we are today, we believe we're adequately reserved based on what we know, and we'll go back periodically and review that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the idea is you're probably not going to start consuming reserves. It is analogous to the way you do credit reserves? Don't you have visibility that this is ending and you have a better line of sight to the end? Is that the idea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, it's not lifetime losses exactly. It's more known and estimable, which extends beyond a year in this particular case. Think of it as repurchased losses will be at 1 billion. That may go on more than a year. At one point, you won't need the reserves and you'll start to hit the 1 billion to get to reserves. We just don't know if that's going to be near the end of 2011 or 2012, but it will be sometime in that period. If you just look at vintages and aging and stuff like that, eventually you won't need to reserve and the expense will go against the reserve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Jamie, on Basel, do you have any sense of timing of when the U.S. regulators will be deciding on the additional buffer to be required of systemically important institutions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not specifically, they're waiting for this thing in Korea on November 20th. And then at one point, we hope to get some guidance. In any event, we think we're in very good shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have a sense that &#x2013; do you have a regulatory green light for capital management? Do you think that banks might be given that before Basel is implemented, or is there a risk that capital return gets delayed while they debate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that everybody is waiting for final Basel III guidance. Remember, the regulators are putting us through additional stress tests, and I think everyone is waiting to get that done. I'll make the same statement I made before. I think it's reasonably hopeful that sometime in the first quarter, we can reinstall a dividend or something like that. I think it makes sense to do. I think some banks will start retaining far too much excess capital at one point next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the regulators are open to those discussions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they are, but they are going through their own calculations, and they obviously want to look at the global issues I think before they make any final determinations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last thing here. The net interest margin was down five basis points, a lot less of a decline than last quarter. Do you think you've maybe seen the worst of your NIM pressure? And what are going to be the key drivers for the top of the house NII going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we're &#x2013; it was down five basis points. There are a number of factors that impact that. We're going to continue to see some pressure in Corporate for NIM. And it's hard to predict at this point where rates are going to be and what the impact is going to be and where loan demand is going to be on the other side of the equation. But it will be down a little bit.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is with regard to the net interest margin in the Corporate sector where you added about $30 billion in securities. Based on the comments you've made, should we assume that that is extremely liquid stuff with very low net interest margins, very low margin, low duration stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would assume mostly very liquid. I wouldn't assume it's all very low margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And duration is probably pretty short, or not so much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say fairly short, but that moves around a lot. It may not be the same thing the next time we talk to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add. Remember that as we reposition the portfolio, we're doing that through a quarter, so second quarter sales we had had full NIM impact in the third quarter, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then just following up on the Basel III discussion, you had spoken recently at length about your capital position with that approaching. But since then, we certainly have heard quite a bit from the Swiss on this Swiss Finish issue. Scan Target is out raising capital yesterday. I'm just wondering even though you did obviously buy back a couple billion dollars worth of stock, whether you are quite as optimistic about the potential for capital relief going forward in light of all of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say the same thing. We're already very close to the 7% Basel III requirement, which includes that buffer. I know that the Swiss Finish came in at 10, which I think is too high. Remember, if you go back &#x2013; remember, this should be consistent with stress tests. When the American government did the stress test at 4% Basel I, it made the adjustments to cap RWA, 7% is closer to 12% Basel I. It's almost a triple of what the banks were able to survive under, under the worst recession of all time under the stress test. So we think the seven is a very strong number, and I personally don't think it's going to be a market. Then the Swiss Finish had another 9% for Cocos. I think that that's extremely optimistic and almost impossible to occur. I think you've got different issues. The size of their banks versus the size of their country, so they've got to do what they think is right for them. I would put those numbers in the extreme category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are fair points, thanks. The final one I want to ask, and I know that you don't feel like you can say much more...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I'm in a strange conference room with a weird setup, so I apologize. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more of the foreclosure issues. I know you can't talk too much more about it than what you've said, but I was wondering if you could give us any sense for timing of resolution in terms of reopening these 115,000 cases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to take several weeks to go through the files and make sure &#x2013; and correct any errors that are in there. Remember, we believe the underlying stuff is all accurate, okay? That's the key substance. Obviously, we know there are a lot of state AGs. We've had conversations with them. We're hoping that the normal process &#x2013; to us the sooner the better for everybody involved. We don't think there are any cases where people have been evicted out of homes where they shouldn't have been. These foreclosures go through multiple processes. And so we're hoping it will be sooner rather than later, but those conversations are starting to take place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it fair to assume that at least a fair portion of that litigation reserve that you added to is specifically for this topic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's nothing in it for this topic. I think the way you should look at this topic is that we're bearing today $7 billion of charge-offs, foreclosure, repurchase costs. That's ex-reserves. That 7 billion will go up or down based upon the economy and stuff like this. I'm not sure stuff like this is going to dramatically change that number. It may extend it a little bit longer and stuff like that. And remember we have in total between repurchase reserves and the $11 billion &#x2013; we have 14 billion of reserves for repurchases or loan losses.</p>
          <p>And look, the mortgage thing, we're halfway through all this. We think we should continue and get done and make sure we do the right things for the consumers, the investors, and the country. And so it obviously will increase our costs a little bit, and maybe we'll have to pay penalties eventually to some of the AGs. But we really think we should just continue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I realize you guys don't want to talk in too much detail on the litigation reserve. But just conceptually, you've taken a little bit greater than 4 billion of reserves for litigation so far this year. And I guess a lot of us are just having a hard time understanding what it might be for. And are you getting ahead of it or still trying to catch up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know our society, right? You know how many lawsuits go on and class action suits and stock drop suits and barrister suits and WaMu suits and mortgage suits, and it ain't going away. It's becoming a cost of doing business. Yes, we always try to get ahead of it. We're not going to give you specific detail. When we're wrong, we're going to settle. When we're right, we're going to fight. Not all those reserves are mortgage related. They were related to other items we have to deal with as a company, and we do try to be ahead of it. We try to be very ahead of it because we think it's the right thing to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just separately, sorry to be a little nitpicky on this question, but if we look at some of the drivers of your net interest margin, there are some of these dollar financing rolls basically causing a negative funding cost for about 280 billion of liabilities...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, for some of the liabilities, but go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just overall it's minus 28 bps for like 280 billion and just trying to understand what that is and what the risks are associated with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's one of the reasons we tell you it's going to come down next quarter because we don't necessarily expect all those favorable rolls to continue the way they've continued. But remember, we're pretty creative in finding ways to do NII, so there are other things to buy and other things to do. We've positioned the company more and more for raising rates, less rates. Those portfolios may come down. The benefits of rolls may go away. We don't have to buy low duration mortgage assets. We could buy other things too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And obviously there's not going to be the type of extension risk on this funding side that you would have on the asset side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will just go away one day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just separately a bigger picture question. The credit card losses for you guys and I think for the industry overall continue to march down at a very nice pace despite very high unemployment. Once we get to that 7.5% in the fourth quarter, do losses just flatten out at some point unless unemployment gets better, or do you still get a continued trend down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the likely outcome is for continued trend down. And remember in the credit card business, those losses tend to relate more to new unemployment claims and new unemployment, not just the absolute level, if you look through history. And also after 2.5 years, you charged off 20%, so you really have worked through a lot of the bad accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add that the accounts we're obviously taking on because we continue to grow the business have different characteristics than the accounts that we're rolling off. So the net of the entire portfolio is a better quality portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it seems like you'll probably have some more reserve relief at some point. It seems like you're still...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at some point, this is very important. We don't release reserves because we want earnings targets or something like that. We release them because we have to. We're conservative. We fight the other way. Keep them up, not take them down. As charge-offs come down, if they come down in credit cards, we will have to release those reserves. I think it's a really silly pro-cyclical thing we all go do, put them them all up and take them all down, and you all have to guess what the earnings are going to be and is it real earnings or not earnings or normalized earnings, but they are going to have to come down.</p>
          <p>So you can think of that right now losses normalize eventually, call it 4.5% in credit card, we will have to take down another 4 or 5 or $6 billion of reserves. That isn't a choice. That is an absolute accounting rule. There are underlying assumptions that go into it. It's your judgment call, and my guess is that will be happening slowly over the next six quarters. And you'll see more rapid change if and when the economy starts to improve. The same will relate also to mortgage losses by the way, and all other losses for that matter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the $35 billion of reserves, you go through your own numbers, but that's going to normalize a lot lower than 35.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, it continues to be &#x2013; I'd say the big trend is you've had a lot of companies extend maturities, reduce their cost of borrowing by going into the public markets. And so that has been a very positive thing. And balance sheets continue to be very, very healthy. You're starting to see a pickup in the appetite for M&amp;A, and I think part of that is a function of people getting their balance sheets prepared and ready to go and looking for growth. There continues to be a little more uncertainty out there about both the economy and what the political landscape entails. And so we haven't seen a rush towards activity, but you would expect as you get clarity there to get some real momentum behind it.</p>

          <p>Jamie, I just wanted to follow-up on the Basel III comment you made earlier. And I know you kept your common Tier 1 pretty much flat in the quarter, and you indicated that you're not going to be making Basel III related decisions. I guess I'm just wondering. Are you managing capital? You're comfortable obviously with where it is today. Is that what we should be expecting going forward? And when Basel III starts to kick in, you start to...</p>

          <p>We're completely covered with capital. I think we showed you a number that in 2013 when Basel III starts to roll in, we will have under even adverse circumstances like 11 or 12 &#x2013; it's a huge number. I've got the...</p>

          <p>It rolls it over five years or something like that. So we have lots of capital, and so we're really not managing capital or RWA as much as we're just trying to build the business: clients, branches, brokers, traders, salesmen, and we have plenty of capital to grow the business in an intelligent way. A lot of those numbers we showed at the Barclays presentation, they were not heroic. They were just runoff with basic stuff we know about. I do think people do a much tighter job imagining those things if and when it becomes important.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Most of my questions have been answered, but just two more quick ones. Jamie or Doug, do you want to provide any color on the pace of the buyback over the next couple of quarters? Should we expect around 2 billion in near-term quarters to be a consistent trend? I guess that's question number one and then I'll ask the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to give you an answer about next quarter. But I think at one point going forward when everything clarifies around Basel, we could be an aggressive buyer of our own stock if we think the price is cheap. We're not going to do it at any price. We're not like everybody else. At a low price we'd do it. At high prices we don't. And as you know, we have plenty of capital generation. So if that's what makes the most sense for shareholders, you can assume that's what we're going to do. At a minimum as a discipline, we like to buy back what we issue. That does not mean every week we buy back what we issued that week. It means that generally in the course of a year, we like to do that at a minimum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That number is plus or minus around 3 billion for 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with your stock in the low 40s, should we think about fully diluted shares outstanding shrinking by some amount in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're just not going to tell you what we're going to do with our stock. I mean, we're just not. We look out looking a couple years how much capital, what the options are, what makes the most sense for shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in prior conferences and presentations, you've talked a lot about different pieces of the loan portfolio that will shrink, and we don't need to go through all that again. But I guess could you give some kind of an outlook three quarters out, four quarters out? When do you think we'll get to that crossover point where the loan portfolio or loans outstanding stabilizes and then maybe starts to grow a little bit? When do you hit that inflection point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it bounces all over the place. Commercial Bank, we're starting to see signs of life, and maybe we'll start to see growth in the next three to six months. Credit Card, it will bottom out we think in the third quarter of next year. That includes the runoff and all the other stuff. Treasury, Asset Management, we've actually had loan growth. Treasury is trade finance. We expect maybe to see both. And in consumer, auto generally you would expect to see growth, and the big one is the 200 billion runoff of stuff, a lot of which was acquired from WaMu. That will be running off for years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So it seems like that runoff of that big piece for years could have a pretty significant impact on where the loan portfolio goes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got to remember. This is an important thing. When it runs off, first of all someone is losing money. When it runs off, it frees up capital, so we're not losing potential earnings because we can go do something else with it. It's not like some other types of businesses. So you're right at least with negative revenues, but it does not necessarily lead to negative profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again just to reiterate what's happening in our credit card portfolio, we're shifting the balance and the mix of customers and the nature of that business, so it's a much more attractive business. We added $41 billion in mortgage origination activity in the quarter, and that was very attractive business for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that went to &#x2013; most of it goes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But we can change that too and retain more if we thought that made more sense for our shareholders.</p>

Mortgage Banking, we've been hearing a lot of anecdotal stuff that the Mortgage Banking business is really, really strong, with spreads being almost four points on given cash and servicing relief.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Markets set rates, okay? There are a lot of people who compile mortgages around the world, and that's usually what determines rates. Sometimes it's how much the system can handle.

        <plist>
          <p>Doug and Jamie, could you maybe talk about a little bit whether you think the model going forward on the mortgage side changes as a result of this, whether it's expectations of servicing costs, how the MSR is valued? Is there something structural that's going to change as you go through these processes and everybody else is doing the same thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Look, the spreads will go up and down. The MSR go up and down. It's still such a critical product for the American consumer. We don't know how the GSE is going to be redone or the mortgage markets and we do think a lot of work needs to be done on both. But at the end of the day, servicing mortgages and originating mortgages for clients will still be a good business with we think a good return.</p>
          <p>And the MSR, I think the only material change in the MSR is when we all decide the rates are low and low forever and never gets any lower, and mortgage rates are low and low forever. MSR is one big IO [Interest Only], and how we handle that MSR might be a little bit different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on that loan growth question, it just would seem that at some point, you would start to get a higher retention of mortgages at least adjustables and maybe even some of the shorter dated fixed. Do you see that as something that could happen during 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Remember, every portfolio decision is almost a discrete decision. So whether we retain a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac whole loan, which is conforming, we're buying an adjustable rate security in the securities portfolio. Those are almost the same kind of decision. So you have seen some of that taking place, but it's in the securities portfolio, not in the balance sheet or retail.</p>

          <p>Right. And then just in terms of the process with respect to Basel, you talked a little bit about it. Are you going to be reporting your Basel II to the public? And what are we going to see from a regulatory standpoint during the next couple of quarters?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we just told you all the Basel numbers. And <mark type="inaudible" />, I think we'll probably be updating you all on what we think Basel &#x2013; we're going to pass &#x2013; remember, Basel II was ten years in the making and was never done. When we get the final &#x2013; when we think we might be close to the final rules by the end of November, we'll probably start telling you roughly, not specifically, what the Basel III numbers would be or when we'll be there and stuff like that, just so you're aware.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But again I would go back to the comment that Jamie made before. We can adjust our balance sheet, but it is not our intent to do things that don't make sense as an economic matter to improve over the short term what our Basel III numbers might look like because we do have until 2013 for the initial implementation of Basel III.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually I think the way to look at it is that the utilization &#x2013; it's just that the middle market is probably more representative than mid-corporate because they can go to the marketplace too. But middle market usually uses revolvers to grow and extend. Utilization is about the same, but actual loan demand, including unused, is actually up a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Some of it is customer growth, Mike, but we're starting to see some positive signals out there. And I would add just in that middle market, we're also seeing &#x2013; we've got a healthy pipeline of things that we're looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hear generally some of the same stuff anecdotally from other banks too.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So these are early indicators of accelerating loan growth? It's just that we've heard this for the past year. Is this the real deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say instead of it going down, it may actually be going up a little bit, but I wouldn't call it accelerating yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as far as Asia, the Investment Banking business in Asia is growing nice double digits. And Europe is flat, the U.S. is down. What is going on in Asia Investment Banking? And more generally, how do you think about the build or buy decision when it comes to Asia consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the Investment Banking business is doing really well in Asia, and remember Asia is doing well, so we grow with the markets and the economy. And we've added bankers and clients, so we're obviously building up there.</p>
          <p>And I think on the consumer side, there will be no build, okay? There will be no build on the consumer side in Asia. It's too hard to do. We're not going to try. Sometime in the future, and that could be two years, one year, or 20, a buy is I'd put it as a pretty high likelihood.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as what sort of prices you think you can afford with the cost of capital being lower, with the current interest rate environment, has it gone up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but that's what I'm saying. I wouldn't pick the timetable here. If it doesn't make sense for shareholders, we're not going to do it. I think we create the most opportunity for JPMorgan really buying &#x2013; remember, you don't buy a weak consumer. You basically buy a bank, and it comes with all the attendant businesses with it. I think the time will be when JPMorgan is doing well, the dollar is doing well, financing costs are low, and maybe Asia is not doing quite as well. I would say now is not the time.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's going to take weeks to clean up the files, but we actually have to have real in-depth conversations with regulators and AGs and stuff like that, so I don't know exactly when. I'm hopeful that it all starts to move at one point. I don't know if it's going to be three weeks or five, but I think it will be a real shame if we don't get this resolved and moving again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So 250 million a quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's 250 million of expense. It's not clear we're going to need any additional reserve. If we do, we'll add some. We'll move pretty quickly. But at one point, the 3 billion will be excess, so there's a good chance it will be $1 billion expense for four quarters to six quarters, and then that expense will be going against the reserve which we'll no longer need.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>On page 17 of the handout, it looks like there's a discrepancy between the upper and the lower parts of the table, with credit card and subprime early delinquencies continuing to trend down substantially. And that's what I would expect given the month-to-month numbers that you can get out of Fannie or Freddie or LPS [Lender Processing Services]. They all show the delinquencies trending down. But we don't see that in the upper part of the graph, the home equity or the prime mortgage. And I wondered what accounts for that discrepancy and how long do you think those two patterns diverge.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>We don't know any better than you do, with one comment. Home equity will lag because home equity, by its nature, we find lags the underlying prime and the underlying real estate and lags more than most other things.

          <p>Hi, good morning; maybe just a quick follow-up on Basel and more the impact from a competitive standpoint. You alluded to this at the conference, Jamie, but we've done some work, and dug into it. It really seems to be a big difference between on the market risk calculation between the European banks and the U.S. banks, and you can see that in the leverage difference. If the incremental returns of the foreign banks, if that persists, and the incremental returns of the foreign banks on say fixed income trading is much higher, can they undercut you? Is there a competitive issue here? Or how do you think about the risk weighting calculations and normalized...</p>

          <p>Let me make a couple points. First of all, it has been this way for a long time and it didn't undercut us.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Number two, the regulators have said that they're going to try to make sure that they understand that these things may not have been equally applied in jurisdictions around the world. And it is incumbent of them to make sure there is a level playing field because you've noted the same thing that we've all noted. So I'm not going to worry about it particularly much right now.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe just one question on the repurchase stuff. It has all been lumped in, but can you give any color on the non-agency stuff? I think that's a big question out there. I think some people have gotten &#x2013; we've all gotten I think a little bit more comfortable around the agency side, but the non-agency side is a little tougher to get our hands around.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In repurchase reserves and litigation, okay, it's unclear exactly how or where it's going to show up, but we do think there will be some of that. And when we make the statement that some of these costs may go on for a while, it relates also to that. While we're burning through the vintages and GSEs, there are other vintages that may have more of a time lag than that.</p>
          <p>And I think it's also important to note that they're fundamentally different because a lot of the private label stuff didn't have the same rules, requirements, disclosures, stuff like that. They're all different.</p>

We don't expect it to be a blowup number. We expect it will be &#x2013; we'll just drag out these losses as these things play themselves out.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess one specific question and one general question. In terms of the commercial lending, and you've noted there is some life in that portfolio in the first time in a couple of years. You also mentioned there has been some improvement in your sales capacity on the commercial side and the WaMu franchise. I'm just wondering if those two trends are simultaneous, if you're seeing more demand or more growth out of the former Washington Mutual business opportunities, or are you still just harvesting what you had in the Chase business?</p>

          <p>I think it's a little bit of both but more the latter, which is I think we've been putting bankers on the ground and building customer relationships in those states where WaMu did business. We're using the branch networks there obviously very effectively. And the result of that is, as I said, we added 500 new customers in the quarter in our middle market business and that's a very positive trend. We expect that to continue.</p>

          <p>I think you might see that, because they may use deposits before they take down loans. I'm just saying we think they're good. Like corporate America is in good financial shape, we think that middle market commercial banking America is in good shape too, and they're just waiting for more orders.</p>

          <p>Okay, and Jamie, just a big picture question. I just wondered if you have any thoughts or color on the recent FDIC rule-making paper, talking about potentially providing preferential treatment for short-dated obligations relative to long-dated obligations in a wind down and how that might affect your fixed income business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's going to affect our fixed income business at all. I think that all this resolution activity is important that it be done right, and I think you see a lot of to and fro-ing as people figure out what the right part is. It's going to be some fashion of coordination. It really does need to be done right. The devil is in detail, but it's not &#x2013; as of yet I don't see it changing our fixed income business at all.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First related to the foreclosure issues and whether there are going to be any extraordinary expenses associated with that, and is the level of expense and that whole activity now going to be higher going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nancy, I think I already mentioned that the way I look at it, we're bearing $5 billion of charge-offs a year, $1 billion of repurchase reserves a year, a lot of real foreclosures. I don't remember offhand, but big numbers. Those numbers may bounce up and down and probably will go up a little bit because of this, but I'm not sure they're going to materially change because of this.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, Jamie, this is more a question for you. The head of Boston Fed, Eric Rosengren, made some comments a couple of days ago about the need for banks to proactively cut their dividends in times of stress, and that the banking industry had not moved swiftly enough to cut dividends, et cetera, et cetera. It seemed to indicate an extraordinary amount of hostility towards banks paying dividends. Can you just give us your commentary on that? You seem to be the only person in the industry who is still confident that you will be able to raise your dividend in the first quarter of 2011. Could you just give us your thinking on the Fed's attitude right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't say confident. I said hopeful. The people make a good point, okay. The banks going into this crisis &#x2013; not all of them, I don't want to paint them all in with the same brush. Some of them kept their dividends really, really high for a real long period of time when they should have been retaining capital, and with real low capital ratios. So I think some of those complaints were legitimate, but they're not legitimate for everyone in involved.</p>
          <p>The new systemic &#x2013; the new 7% Basel III incorporates that as you go below the buffer, the first 2.5%, that there will be restrictions on dividends and comp, and personally I think that's perfectly reasonable. That's where they set the limits and how they set it. But to me, that's fine. If you go to &#x2013; the lower your number gets, the less you can raise dividends, the more you have to cut dividends, the more you have to cut comp, and that's not unreasonable. That's the way a company should be run. So I think that's probably what he's referring to, but it's built into the regulatory regime as opposed to not.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing about dividends, it's really just there's so much uncertainty. It's clarifying now around Basel III, capital requirements, systemically important firm requirements, resolution. People are being a little hesitant on capital. They do want to have more clarity around it. I think why we have more confidence is because we have so much damn capital.</p>

          <p>I was just curious, Jamie. What do you think it's going to take to get the industry out of the doghouse and no longer a member of the evil empire of this administration? And secondarily, is it possible that you're actually benefiting from the fact that the industry is under so much pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're benefiting from the fact that the industry is under pressure. I think you're not going to see a big turnaround in sentiment until I think we have a healthy and growing economy. And I also think you're going to see a lot of rules and regulations that could take a year or more to go through, and that's just our lot in life. We've just got to deal with it.</p>
