          <p>Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the ANZ 2011 Full Year Results Presentation. Thanks for all of the people here joining us in Melbourne. We have people in Martin placed in Sydney and, of course, on the phone and watching over the web.</p>
          <p>Presenting to you this morning are our CEO, Mike Smith and CFO, Peter Marriott. They'll speak for about 35 minutes and then I'll come back and take you through the housekeeping for question and answers. Thanks, Mike.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks, Jill, and good morning, everyone. Jill actually introduced me earlier to the staff as the CFO, so she obviously knows something I don't. I know that most of you have seen the detail of the earnings announcement, and, in summary, the result is absolutely in line with the key terms and trends that we outlined in the August trading update.</p>
          <p>Our key customer franchises in Australia, New Zealand and Asia-Pacific have produced very solid performances and that's been supported by an improved credit environment. Offsetting this, the global environment became must tougher in the second half and like most banks, the macro conditions for our Markets trading business deteriorated which, of course, impacted earnings.</p>
          <p>The way I look at this is that although l would have liked a stronger performance in the last few months of the year, we didn't see the environment as one where it was prudent to expose ANZ to excessive risk and our strategy was very much a risk-off one. As I said at the trading update, I would say that actually conditions have now eased somewhat, they're a bit more predictable and certainly, the first month's performance has been very strong.</p>
          <p>As I said at the trading update, we have been working hard to increase the proportion of Global Markets' earnings from non-trading sources and we're seeing good progress with customer sales, which were actually at record levels this year. Overall, the environment has become more difficult. Funding costs have risen again. Consumers and businesses have become more cautious and new regulation for banks globally means that we have the prospect of higher capital cost.</p>
          <p>While there are many opportunities for us in this environment, we also need to manage our business tightly in these conditions and I think you'll see evidence of that in the second half and that will continue. We've further strengthened our financial and capital position and diversified our funding base, and this continues to be a source of real difference for ANZ.</p>
          <p>What's significant though is that we have also got to the point where we've made a step change with our Super Regional strategy. We've continued on our growth path in Asia and have really begun to embed the strategy into our whole business, with greater levels of connectivity between Asia and our key domestic franchises here in Australia, in New Zealand and in the Pacific.</p>
          <p>So we are positioned quite uniquely, with much greater diversification in our portfolio, both by geography, by product and by capability. For example, APEA now represents 26% of our Institutional revenues, which is up from 20% in 2010, and it represents 4% of Group revenues is actually now sourced from APEA. That gives our businesses far more choices and more opportunities, opportunities which are frankly open to very few banks in the world right now. And I'll talk a little bit more about this later.</p>
          <p>But first, let me you a brief overview of the results. Underlying profit after tax was up 12% on last year, while statutory profit was up 19%. The increase came from a 7% increase in income, which we achieved despite a 31% decline in Global Markets income, which happened in the second half. And of course, there was also improved provisions.</p>
          <p>Group margins, excluding Global Markets, were up 7 basis points, which reflected re-pricing and mix changes, and I think we will now be in a period where this will stabilize. We continue to invest in the business, but we are also managing costs more dynamically, and we significantly reduced the run rate in the second half, with costs up a modest 2% on the half, and we expect this trend to continue.</p>
          <p>Importantly for shareholders, the proposed final dividend of $0.76 per share fully franked brings the total dividend for the year to $1.40 per share, which is up 11%.</p>
          <p>So, if I now turn to the regions. In Australia, Phil and his team increased profit 4% based on a good cost management and solid results in Retail, which were up 6%, and Commercial, which were up 5%. This was offset by Wealth, which was down 16%, reflecting market conditions and the increased insurance costs which followed the extreme weather events earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>In a subdued but highly competitive market, we put in a pretty solid performance across the board with lending up 6%, mortgages growing 1.2 times system and customer deposits up 12% or 1.5 times system. Pleasingly, we've continued to increase customer satisfaction in all segments, and we've maintained our number one ranking for customer satisfaction in retail.</p>
          <p>In Asia-Pacific, Alex and his team have maintained the strong underlying momentum, with U.S. dollar profits up 22%, despite the impact of trading conditions for Global Markets.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to invest in Asia to build scale and to build capability. Expenses grew 26%, although they were only up 9% in the second half, reflecting that we're still managing the expense growth more tightly while still investing for growth, now that we've finished the RBS integration.</p>
          <p>You can see the benefit of the investment is showing in the franchise that we're building. Lending was up 44%, and customer deposits were up 40%. But if you look more closely, you can see that we are delivering this based on a much deeper franchise than we had previously. For example, the number of active customers in the Institutional and Commercial business rose 25%. And in some of our key markets, revenue growth is very significant. For example, India is up 115%, China 82%, Indonesia 43%.</p>
          <p>And we've continued to develop on the milestones in our regional expansion plan. I think most notably with the establishment or the reestablishment of our presence or our branch in India. We've also made real progress in delivering regional IT platforms, such as the transactive cash management platform, the Finacle core banking system and the Global Markets sale distribution platform.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, David and his team increased New Zealand dollar profits by 55%. While this is obviously a substantial increase, the fall in provisions and strong cost control were the key drivers. New Zealand is slowly recovering, although lending actually fell 2%, which reflects customer deleveraging, particularly in the rural sector. Deposits grew 4%.</p>
          <p>Our simplification program in New Zealand is on track. We are moving to a single core system, simplifying the product portfolio, reengineering the operational processes, and we're implementing an integrated management structure. Our aim is to deliver the lowest cost to income ratio in the market.</p>
          <p>I'm actually optimistic about our New Zealand business, although I have to say that the whole of New Zealand's future looked a little uncertain towards the end of the game at the end of last week, but I'm very pleased to see the best team won. I got real support here, didn't I? There's no French people in the audience, is there, no?</p>
          <p>Turning to Institutional, Shayne and his team lifted profit 7%, and the long-term trend of this business is very positive. There's no question that Institutional is now delivering more diversified earnings by product, by customer and by geography. Our client base has grown, with 1,300 new client relationships in 2011, and we've seen trade finance revenues up 29%, foreign exchange revenues up 22% and cash management revenues up 13%. Customer deposits grew 20%, with lending up 16%. The APEA lending grew strongly and now represents over a third of the loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>The key issue in Institutional's performance, which also impacted the Group result, was a 28% fall in Global Markets' profit. This was driven by a large reduction in trading and the balance sheet income, and it was primarily a second half story, and it was partially offset by a 13% growth in customer sales revenues for the year.</p>
          <p>The trends in our trading book have been consistent with what you've seen at other banks as a result of an extremely volatile market conditions in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, it was also impacted by the prudent decisions we took during the worst of the volatility to move to a risk-off strategic.</p>
          <p>We haven't gone overboard in the decisions we have taken because, clearly, the market will normalize at some point and already has, and as I said, the first month of the year, we've had a strong result.</p>
          <p>Cost growth in Institutional, particularly in the first half, reflected the investments made in 2010, both in people and in systems. In the second half, though, the business took action to reflect the changed revenue environment by putting in place a targeted productivity program that provided a lower cost run rate going into the new financial year.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are continuing to strengthen our positions through our focus on balance sheet. Tier 1 capital is now 10.9%, which equates to about 9.5% on a Basel III fully harmonized basis, placing us among the most strongly capitalized banks in the world.</p>
          <p>Our loan to deposit ratio has declined from around 170% in 2007 to almost 130% today, with customer deposits growth having exceeded loan growth by almost $50 billion over that period. This has significantly reduced our reliance on wholesale debt. Term debt issuance for 2011, including pre-funding, was about $18 billion, in addition to which ANZ raised $1.34 billion in hybrid capital.</p>
          <p>We have similar targets for funding for 2012. However, I know that the key issue for investors is not so much the past, but what we're going to do to perform in the future and our Super Regional strategy is clear, it's consistent and it's aligned to the economic opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region. What will determine our future is how we successfully execute against that strategy in all of our key markets.</p>
          <p>Now, some say that management is by its nature optimistic, although those of you who know Peter know that's not true, but I genuinely believe that the global economic difficulties, the structural shift that is taking place in the world and the subdued domestic environment plays absolutely perfectly to ANZ's strengths. We have a portfolio which is diversified by geography, by business and by industry focus, which is increasingly connected, so the sum is greater than the parts.</p>
          <p>Our diversified portfolio gives us options and choices to deliver differentiated revenue growth and shareholder value by building our customer franchises in Australia and Asia, while maintaining our strong position in New Zealand and the Pacific. These growth options are simply not available with a domestic-only strategy.</p>
          <p>Our financial strength will provide us with opportunities for careful strategic growth as capital constrained international banks retreat from our region. Our investment in our operation hubs continues to support our productivity agenda, and we're also placing a stronger emphasis on generating ongoing efficiencies given the more constrained conditions. As I said before, this isn't a matter of reacting to events, but of dynamically managing our cost to reflect our business strategy and the market conditions. This is already underway and as you've seen the trends in our cost performance in the second half.</p>
          <p>So, I'm optimistic about our future, not because it's in my nature, after all, I'm a traditional banker, but because these choices and these opportunities are open to very few banks in the world right now, but they are open to ANZ. So the bottom line is that we see 2012 as a year of opportunity and I'm confident that we continue to deliver on our promises to shareholders, to our customers and to the community in which we serve.</p>
          <p>Now, let me ask Peter to talk to the result and then we'll open up for questions. Many thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, Mike, and welcome to everyone and good morning. Mike's already introduced the result in terms of a 12% growth in our underlying profit for the year and the 19% growth in the statutory profit. And when you look at that 12%, you can see that the profit before provisions growth was relatively modest at about 3% and we'll explore in some detail why that was case, and then the bulk of the growth has come from that 33% reduction in provisions where, for the year, we've had a much better credit quality outcome. That reduction is entirely from individual provisions. There's no net CP release across the year and so it reflects an improvement in the credit portfolios.</p>
          <p>For the half, of course, the result was more modest and we'll drill into that with a bit more detail as to what drove that, and the other observation to make on this slide, of course, is to just quickly focus on those non-core items and to stress that there's nothing unusual there, the standard items that we have within that category and in particular because the Australian dollar was so weak as at 30 September, there's an adverse mark-to-market gain on our hedges, but of course, the Australian dollar has subsequently bounced back.</p>
          <p>So let's look at that second half performance and it's now become a common theme of the season that trading activities around the world for banks have been tough during that, particularly what was quarter four for us, and you can see the impact. Stripping out the impact of that, the rest of the business had 3% income growth and then that 2% cost growth. So the rest of the business had a much stronger performance and continued with reasonable momentum across the half.</p>
          <p>So how does that final result for quarter four compare with perhaps what you were expecting? And the composition is perhaps a little different. The net outcome was about the same but the composition's a little different and you can see that, in particular, that in Q4, there was essentially zero trading income; I think it was about $7 million. Sales income held up. It's down just ever so slightly, but mainly because of lower capital markets activity, which you'd expect in that environment, fewer bond raisings, but the underlying sales momentum was still strong. But well, well down on that trading income for quarter four. Particularly coming out of Australia, the performance offshore was also down, but the real reduction was within the Australian business in rates.</p>
          <p>The provision charge was well down in Q4. I think we flagged at the trading update that we were looking at the overlay provision in relation to the floods. We've had very little on the way of individual provisions from floods. In fact, the same in $16 million come through, so we need to reassess the collective provision for that and we did so. But you'll see at the same time in that half, we used some of that money to establish a CP for the current global uncertainty; we'll just touch on that a little bit more in a moment.</p>
          <p>Then we had much higher level of recoveries coming from the Institutional portfolio. In general, the credit quality of that Institutional portfolio is being significantly improving, very few in the way of new impaired assets coming through and some favorable outcomes on some of the existing ones.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results on a pro forma basis, so we adjust for the acquisitions and exchange rate effects, and here as well, we've overlaid the trading income, to look at the business excluding the trading income. And you see on that basis for the year, the jaws are just slightly negative, 7.6% versus 8.2% and the PbP is 7% growth for the year for the businesses adjusting for trading. And a much better result in the second half. We can see that trading adjusted revenue growth was close on 3% and then cost growth just a bit over 2%.</p>
          <p>A little bit more detail around the divisions, all the divisions had PaT growth for the year, and when we look at the Australia division, it was a quite respectable PvP growth of 5%. Their provisions were up about 19% in large part because of write backs of collective provision last year that weren't repeated this year, but obviously, the floods and some stress in rural part of the business with the strong Australian dollar and difficulties in beef all led a slightly higher level of provisioning.</p>
          <p>When you look at the APEA and Institutional results there half-on-half, they are positive again if you adjust the trading. It just reflects the flow through of that weaker trading income performance.</p>
          <p>Then the New Zealand business, PvP growth in the second half, provisions slightly higher because again, they had some collective provision releases in the first half that weren't repeated in the second.</p>
          <p>Driving down now looking at the interest margin. The interest margin for the half was down about 0.6 of a basis point, so basically flat for the half, but very similar trends to what we've been seeing in the other halves, an improvement in the margin because of a reducing reliance upon wholesale debt. The main thing that drives that funding and asset mix component, but nonetheless, funding costs are going up, nonetheless the rates we have to pay on deposits and the margins we have on deposits are working against us. But then a continuing improvement in asset re-pricing, particularly coming out of New Zealand and, of course, the full year effect of the mortgage rate changes in the first half.</p>
          <p>That story, though, of course, is very different business-by-business and you really have to look at it business-by-business. In particular, I think we called out at the time of this, the first half result to expect the Institutional and APEA business to have higher volume growth, but contraction in margin and that's exactly what we've seen: still net interest income growth, but different mix with margins down and volume higher.</p>
          <p>Within Australia, it's been modest growth in volume and a slight reduction in margin, and in New Zealand, as Mike was saying, deleveraging has led to a reduction in the volumes, but margins actually improved. So different dynamics drive an interest income in each of those businesses, but the net effect overall being just that slight slowdown in the margin half-on-half.</p>
          <p>On the expense front, I think the chart on the left-hand side points to the change in the momentum here, that clearly, we came into this current year, absorbing the full impact of that very significant jump in costs in the second half '10 and we've been lowering that rate growth in costs across the year, so that in the second half, it was only 2.4%.</p>
          <p>And you can see that from a cost point of view, our cost growth is being skewed towards the businesses we see as having the highest growth potential, being the Institutional and Asian businesses. But nonetheless, particularly Institutional, you can see that slowdown in its cost growth, this was a much greater focus on productivity in that business and I'll make some more observations about that when we look at the outlook for the year.</p>
          <p>A bit of a decomposition of our growth across the year of 8%, and you can see there's been significant components of that which are focusing on growth, building the infrastructure and the platform for the businesses in Asia and within Institutional, making sure the right risk management systems are in place to support that growth as well. And really, when you look at the run the business cost and the realized productivity benefits, you should look at them together because that's the way you run the business, of course, as you have business as usual growth, but then you're constantly trying to absorb that, which leads to a net about 2% being growth in the running of the business.</p>
          <p>Wrapping up on some comments around the credit quality. Clear downward trends in those new impaired assets, I think is the pleasing observation here. And you can see that from early on in this part of the cycle, where Institutional was dominating our new impaired assets, it's now by far the smaller component and that's been a continuing downward trend there.</p>
          <p>A little bit of reduction in the level of new impaired assets coming out of New Zealand, a slight increase there in Australia, a bit in mortgages as they've tightened up on some of the collection practices there. And as I mentioned before, some stress in the rural side, just there a slightly higher level of new impaired assets and those same sorts of factors flowed across into the individual provisions. Once again, you'll notice here from a collective provision point of view there's essentially a net nil charge. There was a charge in the first half and some released in the second.</p>
          <p>And that's a good lead then into the chart on the collective provision itself. Bottom line, our net level of management overlays is essentially unchanged from the beginning of the financial year. From a P&amp;L point of view, there was only a $12 million release net-net across all the various components of that over the year. A significant wind back in the natural disasters component half-on-half, reflecting both recognition of actual IPs that came through in Christchurch and in the floods, and releasing equivalent amount of CP for that, and also reappraising the level of overlay required for the floods here in Australia, recognizing the very low level of actual IPs coming through.</p>
          <p>Then we used some of that release to recognize that the uncertainties in the world, the European crisis, which is being worked through, well, inevitably by the effect that it's having on the international capital markets and equity markets, will have some, albeit modest, flow-through effect. And so there's a $40 million has been set aside for that volatility, funded in part out of the movement on the flood provisions.</p>
          <p>Then turning to the outlook. Clearly, the biggest uncertainty, or at least, perhaps I should say the biggest difficulty to predict I guess, is the outcome on trading and as we can see, there was significant fall away in Q4. As Mike mentioned, the month of October was very good, their revenue for the month overall, both trading and sales is looking like it's going to be over $160 million, so from a trading point of view, that's a level which is back equivalent to first half of 2011 and continuing growth in sales. Now it's obviously only one month, but as Mike was saying, it's pleasing to see some new momentum in that. And only a relatively modest amount of that was bounced back of positions that existed as at 30 September. So it reflects a good underlying momentum.</p>
          <p>From a margin point of view, you look at those drivers, the position in Australia is a little more uncertain recognizing the higher funding costs and the impact of the competition within that market. So there's some sort of uncertainty there, margins are likely to come under slight pressure. Within New Zealand, we still see margins being stable maybe slightly up. In the APEA and Institutional businesses though, there's some signs of the flow-through effect of the widening in credit spreads globally as a result of the &#x2013; I guess, largely the European situation, but we see opportunities that actually the margins have stabilized somewhat and maybe even increased. So perhaps a more stable outlook for margins within the Institutional and APEA businesses. So overall, meaning that margins were probably just stable, maybe slightly off.</p>
          <p>Volume, I think you know the story around there. Clearly, I think our economist outlook for mortgage growth in Australia is about 4%. You factor on top of that some higher than system growth. New Zealand modest growth in the balance sheet there, but we still expect the Institutional and APEA businesses to have strong growth, both because even here within Australia, there's the opportunity to capitalize on the fact that a lot of the foreign banks are pulling back on their involvement and that gives greater opportunities.</p>
          <p>From a provisioning point of view, we would see the outlook into 2012 as being similar to our 2011 levels, maybe slightly up, certainly not calling a reduction and so thinking stable to maybe slightly up.</p>
          <p>FX, if you take the current spot exchange rate and our current level of hedging that's set out that within the document, if that was to remain, there's only about a 0.3% drag on earnings per share going into 2012, so very small. If the Australian dollar was to strengthen by another 5%, that's only about a little bit less than 1% impact on earnings per share. So the impacts there are quite modest.</p>
          <p>From an expense growth point of view, as Mike was saying, as I said earlier on, there is a heightened focus upon productivity. You can see the cost growth going down. We would expect cost growth in 2012 to be lower than what it was in 2011. Both the Australian and New Zealand businesses have maintained good disciplines in their costs across the last few years and you'd expect that to continue. So a slowing of revenue would require a slowing in cost growth.</p>
          <p>Within the Institutional business, particularly in Australia, there's a much-heightened focus on productivity, and a focus on maintaining jaws, and indeed, that continues to be the discipline across the whole Group of trying to manage the jaws. And when we talk about that, we're not assuming some miraculous rebound in trading income. So, thinking about this in more normalized terms, rather than just simply saying we're going to spend an abnormal level of growth in trading income. So, I think, you'll see that there will be a much greater focus and the benefits of that flowing through in the expense growth. But we will continue to invest in those areas, which are our growth priorities.</p>
          <p>So, with those comments on the outlook, Jill, I'll hand back, so we can open up for questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Peter. You'd all be very familiar with the procedure for this. We'll start with questions in Melbourne. If you could wait until a microphone comes to you, because there are people listening on the phone and via the web. With that, we'll start with Craig please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Craig Williams from Citi. Look, I recognize that your result was solid and you're well positioned for growth in the medium term. If I look back at third quarter '10, in your trading update, you called out a need to focus more on productivity. Today, your result, you've called out a stronger emphasis on generating ongoing efficiencies, given the more constrained domestic conditions and we've heard in Peter's summary, a focus on productivity. Reality is, this year, as you look at it, 5% pro forma revenue growth, 8% pro forma expense growth and a strategy, which does require investment. So what have you done specifically to stem the leakage on cost growth in the business? Can you put some more meat on the bones so to speak around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean there's been a huge emphasis on this. I mean if you were to put a normalized trading income back into that and the jaws would obviously have been positive, we've always managed this in terms of adjusting expense growth to what we can afford and the problem was this year and in that second half was that that trading income was a much more significant reduction than we would have expected. So I see it more as an income problem rather than a cost problem.</p>
          <p>The fact that we were able to pull back costs very substantially, particularly in Institutional, I think is important. But we did have quite a high cost growth in Institutional as a result of that big increase at the end of 2010 where we put very significant investment into the markets there, in terms of systems and people. And, of course, that will benefit us going forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of the other businesses, APEA again has reduced its cost growth considerably in the second half from the first half. It's almost half of what it was in the first half, but again, we're continuing to put as much investment as we can afford into APEA and we'll continue to do that. In terms of Australia, Australia's actually &#x2013; its cost income ratio is the lowest of its peers in its Australia-only business. Can it do better? Yes, it can. And I think that the recent changes we've made around the management structure for actually changing the operating model within Australia is going to be quite important, because I think we perhaps had a situation where we've had too much cost in the business and too much cost in our hubs, and we really have got to now work through that much more effectively. And Alistair Currie's been given a very clear mandate on fixing that. I look at him.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that in New Zealand, we have actually had a reduction in cost. So it's a tale of many parts, but, as I say, I think we've got in place now a very clear policy of how to move this one forward. And as I say, we will always manage our cost on what that we can afford.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, just to amplify on that as well. If you look our cost growth this year, 26% of it was actually in the Markets business, and there was an expectation at the beginning of the year that a much higher rate of revenue growth and particularly, the rebound in revenue growth into the second half, which obviously didn't eventuate. So, in the end, they ended up close to 30% short of their original revenue growth targets and then you can't quickly turn your costs off when that revenue falls so substantially short, but the business has been responding to that and you'll see the momentum of that and perhaps flowing through into 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Do you need more margin for error? You've set markets as a part of your growth strategy, and therefore, that sort of comes with volatility at times. Do you need more margin for error in terms of the way you set the cost in, recognizing the fact that your strategy actually takes on a more volatile income strain through the markets growth you're driving?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we would &#x2013; you would say, if looking at the results, we have that margin for error. I mean, the fact that we've actually had a close to 30% reduction in income in the second half, and have yet met consensus, I think is a pretty good result. I think that's quite a big margin and I hope that won't happen next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Matt Davison, Merrill Lynch. Mike, back in '08/'09, you had some success in Asia winning deposits during the crisis then. I'm just interested with the European situation, if you could expand a bit more on exactly how that's helping you win customers in Asia in the current climate. And when you look at, I guess, the opportunities coming forward, do you view that more as the opportunity to win customers from European banks, or to look at whole businesses that might spill out of the crisis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's both. I think it's both. I think it's a double opportunity here. Quite clearly, if you look at a number of the European banks and actually some of the U.S. banks, when you're trading at 0.3 times or 0.4 times book, it is extremely difficult to raise capital in that environment and, of course, the easiest way to do it is either reducing your balance sheet or selling assets. And we're already seeing opportunities where portfolios are being offered for sale. So, that's one possibility.</p>
          <p>The second though is that same point around the constraint of the balance sheet. The players will leave the field. They're just not &#x2013; they're not playing exactly as what happened in 2008. So this is a huge opportunity.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that we still have a AA rating and I hope S&amp;P continue to keep it that way. But a number of counterparties who've &#x2013; corporate counterparties are obviously looking to put money with us in terms of deposits in a way that was not there six months ago because obviously of that concern with the safety issue. The problem has been that in this market, we have had a huge inflow of short-term funds; 48 hours is the new 20 years. So it's been extremely difficult for us. In fact, we've had a huge amount of liquidity coming through. It's what to do with it. I think we've got about $14 billion with the Fed at the moment, which is not earning us a lot. But what we've been trying to do is tender that out a bit and use it for funding trade finance and the guys in Asia have done a great job of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Jon Mott from UBS. Just a quick question if I could, following on from the Global Markets comments. I did see that on Page 64 that the Global Markets' revenue was down 31% but costs were still up 6% in the second half. So it did have a lot of negative jaws coming through there. So you did elaborate saying that you can't turn costs off quickly. Do you need to be more flexible in that area, so that the people in these trading areas have much more flexibility in the expenses and it doesn't just flow through to shareholders?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the capital generation in the period, I've noticed that there was no capital generated in that fourth quarter, and that credit risk-weighted assets were up pretty sharply, especially in the corporate division or corporate area, which was up about 9%. It just seems strange to see such a large increase in credit risk-weighted assets there, given what you're talking about the improvement in the Institutional book and why we're not seeing an improvement there in credit risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>An improvement, I didn't understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, how about if you pick up &#x2013; do you want to pick up the question on the cost and I'll pick <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:39:59)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. On the costs, I think that the ability to turn on and off costs is always an issue in terms of times when you have a substantial reduction in income. As I say, I think it's more an income story than a cost story. I think overall, the dependence we've had on trading income, as you know, has always been quite high and we have been moving to change that dependence to a customer sales focused or more customer sales focused in terms of the revenue generation. And we've actually seen a 16% increase in sales volumes this year, which I think is in an extremely good result and that will continue. That will continue to move forward. So it's not that trading will not be important, it means that it will not be as important in terms of the overall mix of business. And that's the way we're going to move out of that dependence, Jonathan.</p>
          <p>In terms of the capital, I didn't understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well Jonathan's spot on in his question, and there were a few things that happened in terms of Q4. One, if you think about the way this works, Q3 had the accrual of the DRP. We accrue the DRP at 30% and then as you actually have the DRP take place, you recognize the difference between the accrual and the actual. So it had the benefit of the 10% coming into Q3. Q4 didn't have that. Q4 had very strong risk-weighted asset growth. Now, that's a good news story and a bad news story. Good news story in the sense that it implies there's new volumes in there for earnings, but it did chew into capital. So for the year, risk-weighted assets were contributing 43 basis points, but the annualized rate in Q4 was 93 basis points, so double the growth.</p>
          <p>Now, Jonathan, you said that it was in corporate, but, of course, that's corporate AIRB, which means it's institutional lending, it was fundamentally institutional lending, undrawn lines in Australia and Asia reflecting the growth in that part of the business and us picking up more market share in those areas. So the good news story, there was actually good risk-weighted asset growth in Q4 that did, though, of course, mean that the capital ratio didn't improve in Q4 because it had to absorb that effect.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. A question on drivers of margin change over the last 12 months. In particular, it looks as if like APEA's had close to 50 basis points of margin decline over the 12-month period and 30 to 40 basis points in the second half. What were the drivers of that change?</p>
          <p>And then in light of your comments, Peter, that you think margins will be stable at a Group level. And maybe then just throwing into the mix that if there is a potential S&amp;P downgrade coming, what that does to ANZ's attractiveness in Asia in terms of getting deposits and then defending margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we may get Alex to make some comments in there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But specifically in terms of your question around the APEA margin, a large component of that reduction in the margin is mix because the growth was in the Institutional business or the lower margin parts of the APEA business ex-Institutional, so very big mix component, a very large component just coming through from the competition for deposits and asset prices, but those trends, and that's why it'd be useful to get Alex to make some comment, we're seeing actually start to improve post the European situation. So perhaps, Mike, if we get Alex to make a comment on those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, but before doing that, what you have to remember what has happened in Asia is that margins actually went up quite significantly during the global financial crisis. They have gradually been reducing basically as a result of competition and what we're now going to see is as competition leaves the market, we're going to start to see an improvement in margin again. Now, the numbers that which &#x2013; sorry, I mean, you were talking about the overall net interest income as well was it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and clearly in 2000 &#x2013; particularly in the second half of 2011, the APEA margin was a major contributor to the overall margin reduction for the half. My comments on the margin outlook were to say that that is likely to be less of a factor and may even be positive, depending on what the ultimate direction is for the margins in that part of the business, will be sensitive to mix. If the Institutional business grows faster than the Retail business, then that'll be different to if the Retail grows faster than the Institutional, because they have two different margin dynamics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's likely that the Institutional will build up, but as I say, I mean, Alex, would you like to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:45:25)?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look not much to add to that, Mike. I think you &#x2013; we're starting to see margins on the asset side now flicking up. I think the quarterly results from Standard Chartered and from DB, certainly from Standard Chartered should &#x2013; signaling the same thing that we're signaling. We're seeing margins in the trade book starting to motor up in a way. So I would expect margins to improve over the next three to six months in a gradual basis month-by-month, as it comes through your book.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. Just want to actually follow up on the trading income side. You've mentioned quite a big bounce back in the October month. Just wanted to get a feel as to how the risk capital's changed in that business. Have you got more risk on or less risk on than you did? Because I understand that the third quarter you'd indicated you'd reduced the amount of risk being placed into the market and we can obviously see that in Q4.</p>
          <p>And just also, you've spoken a fair bit about the Institutional cost or the direction of costs or trajectory in costs coming down towards the end of the year. Could we get some quantity around that? So what have they actually done in the fourth quarter to reduce the <mark type="ph" /> Institutional (0:47:12) costs and where the run rate on the cost growth for Institutional is moving into the 2012 year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll ask Shayne to comment on the cost initiatives because there's a quite a lot actually going on. In terms of the trading book, yeah, you're right. We had a strategy which was basically risk-off and you can see basically that was, I think, as a result of the market dynamics beings so difficult to read, so difficult to predict. It was extremely difficult to see where the value of taking a risk on at that time would have been. I mean I think it was just too &#x2013; it would have just opened us up to potential loss.</p>
          <p>So we were quite conservative. And I think it was the right thing to do. We've moved to a strategy which is now more varied. I think that they can pick &#x2013; they can <mark type="ph" /> plot (0:48:19) the movement a little better now. It's a bit more predictable. And so we're moving to &#x2013; we have slightly increased our risk appetite, but our VAR is actually still incredibly low. And for the size of business that we have, our overall VAR is still extremely low.</p>
          <p>So as Peter mentioned, the result of the last month was not really much of a bounce back. It was just improved positioning. I think the guys are getting used to this new world and are reading the signs that much better. So I think it was an overall improvement in the trading area, and of course, in customer flow.</p>
          <p>Shayne?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So I'll comment on the costs. So I think there's a chart in the handout on Page 78 that kind of shows that on a quarter-on-quarter basis actually we've kept our cost growth very close to zero on a run-rate basis.</p>
          <p>We've actually done quite a bit at the front-end in terms of our costs. So we've been focused on removing overlaps that we felt we had between the APEA organization and Institutional, so that's made us more streamlined, taking out cost at that level.</p>
          <p>We have done a lot of work around &#x2013; as Mike mentioned &#x2013; about spending what we can afford. We've done a lot of re-prioritization work around our investment slate, in terms of technology in particular. So that is just being more selective about timing of those, deferring things, being more specific about exactly where we want to invest.</p>
          <p>We have been very aggressive &#x2013; Institutional's always been very aggressive on the offshoring program, in terms of our operations and in terms of back office. We're going to lift that to a new level, which we're going through at the moment.</p>
          <p>Obviously, some of these things incur cost. So some of the cost of that restructuring, whether it's redundancy cost, whether it's offshoring cost, et cetera, are already in our run rate. And so we're seeing that. And at the moment, we're also undertaking a review, and we've already seen changes in terms of what we'd loosely call kind of our coverage model. So looking at the number of relationship managers we have covering accounts, looking at the sales support they have, whether it's from market, from trade, from transaction banking in general, et cetera, and streamlining those things as best we can.</p>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; I'm actually very confident about our cost growth. I mean what's not really seen in these numbers is that we have an increasing cost line in things like amortization because we haven't vested in the past in things like our transactive platform, which are critically important, strategically very valuable, which are helping us acquire customers today &#x2013; there's no doubt about that &#x2013; and will set us up extremely well for the future. Those things cost money.</p>
          <p>And we do have an increasing amortization charge. We've effectively absorbed that within this month-on-month costs by making offsetting saves elsewhere, and we expect that to be the case going forward.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. I want to go &#x2013; if I may, could I go back to Slide 19? If we have a look at the APEA, the collapse in the margin, we know that this business is primarily deposit-funded. But we also know that the risk profile generally of SMEs, corporates, businesses in Asia, according to the ratings agencies, is substantially higher than the Australian one.</p>
          <p>Could you just run through, is there the potential that we're actually seeing a discount margin applied in APEA to gain business, and that the margin outcome doesn't look quite right when you compare it to, theoretically, the lower risk business in Australia? And also, could we get a feel of how much of the excess deposits in that business have been streamed back to Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the rating differential is probably on average a BBB in Aus versus a BBB-minus in Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the last question first, and we can go onto the &#x2013; on the other questions. In terms of amounts streamed back into Australia, it's $13 billion as at 30 September, so it's essentially unchanged year-on-year. But the deposit growth has been put into liquid assets. So there's substantial built up in liquid assets.</p>
          <p>But perhaps Alex can pick up on the questions around asset quality and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. And let me just say something, Brian, that this growth is actually very high-quality corporate growth. Institutional growth. Most of this growth is &#x2013; well, most of the credit rating around this business is actually higher than the book in Australia. So, I don't really understand the issue. But Alex?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, Mike, I've got &#x2013; our credit grading is actually improving by half a point on our internal grades in the last 12 months. Our Institutional business is very focused at the top end of the market and will continue to be so.</p>
          <p>On the Retail side, we're actually, Brian, exiting the non-affluent and emerging affluent businesses on the asset side. That's required exiting of that portfolio. And we've been building actually on the higher-quality affluent and emerging affluent. So as you know, we're extraordinarily well positioned and focused on the higher end of the markets in both our Retail, Commercial and Institutional businesses.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a question on the fee income, which is about half of your income. And when we're looking at the second half run rate in your fee income growth, it looks like that that was running at about 10% annualized, if you go into Page 18 of the pack. I'm just keen to get a sense of what's &#x2013; in terms of the sustainability of that growth rate, and whether the investment made in like the transactional banking platforms and the other things like that, whether that run rate is sustainable or even likely to pick up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a number of drivers behind that, obviously. But the fee income, as you can see in the commentaries there, was particularly helped in the second half by the benefits coming through on transaction banking. Some of the cost that we've been seeing coming through in the Institutional business, some of the capitalized software that you see coming through, which relates to the same business, has been putting in the transactive platform for Institutional, and that's starting to flow through into revenue.</p>
          <p>Now whether you can just simply extrapolate out &#x2013; I'd caution against extrapolating out any one half, because obviously, a couple of larger deals can impact the numbers. But you would expect to see the transaction banking business be an area of above average growth for us.</p>

          <p>So just talking about cash management, in particular in the transactive platform, we would expect the benefits to gather momentum. I mean we have a very strongly growing business there, and you've seen that in the numbers here.</p>
          <p>And what's interesting, the real growth, the story behind that is a customer acquisition story. It is a transaction volumes story. And that is coming because we had greater capability. Our capability in the Australian and New Zealand markets today is superior to our competitors.</p>
          <p>And we are the only Australian bank with a trans-Tasman capability, and that puts us in a league of only three banks in that market, the others being Citi and HSBC. That hugely differentiates us, and that's the first leg of building out the regional cash capability.</p>
          <p>We go live with a few countries in Asia in the coming months, and then we progressively roll out around a dozen markets over the next 12 to 18 months. There will be resulting growth from that, and you will see cash management increase as a percentage of our business, which has always been part of our strategy.</p>
          <p>We love that business. We love it from a customer point of view in terms of the stickiness of the relationship. We love it because it's important in terms of determining lead bank relationship, and it's the core for ongoing cross-sell. And we like the annuity style. It's not totally annuity, but we like the dependency annuity style, revenue streams that it generates.</p>
          <p>So it's always been our strategy to have that as the fastest growing part of Institutional, and we expect to see the benefits continue at an increased rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Scott Manning from Scott Levine from JPMorgan. I've got a three-part question loosely based on capital. Firstly, just the need for the DRP discount to a correct capital given that the payout ratio is already substantially below peers?</p>
          <p>Secondly, the Basel 2.5 impacts, I couldn't see them in the little waterfall chart of the Basel III impacts. So if you've got any numbers there on that?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, if that share count is building, does that mean that any potential future earnings growth will get offset by that share count, so the ROE kind of stalls around current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, picking up all the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, can I take the first one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean the DRP discount is something that we have done consistently for the last few years. And I think it's now being accepted by the market as a relatively good way to raise capital. Other banks that have done it without the discount have had a much lower take-up. It's almost half the take-up that you would get with a discount. So we do believe that it's a good way to do it. And indeed, that discount is quite minimal.</p>
          <p>In terms of Basel III, we have provided some numbers in terms of the fully harmonized &#x2013; you can't really say those two words together &#x2013; Basel III and harmonized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> It's not the norm. (59:00)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But we have provided those numbers in there. What we haven't talked about is the discussion paper that APRA have produced, because that still contains a number of things which are outside of Basel III and still need discussing. After all, that's what a discussion paper should be about, I guess.</p>
          <p>So I don't know if Peter wants to just talk about the harmonized stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's a few aspects in Scott's question.</p>
          <p>But specifically addressing your 2.5, we think that 2.5 will add about $6.5 billion to the risk-weighted assets, which is about 20 basis points. However, we're expecting that will be offset by some of the benefits coming through from a new risk management system that Chris Page has implemented that was giving us greater granularity around our risk-weighted asset measurement and will allow us to reduce our risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>And the benefit of that should neutralize. That's why we haven't specifically called it out because we don't think it's going to net-net, be a major driver in the capital ratios. But you're right that we didn't specifically signal that out.</p>
          <p>In terms of the DRP discount and also building on what Mike was saying, fits in with the fact that our risk-weighted asset growth is higher than our peers. And the discount allows us to get the natural profit retention at the levels &#x2013; to be able to continue to pay out the fully franked dividend to get the franking credits out, but still absorb enough from the earnings of the business to fund that risk-weighted growth, particularly in Asia, and the growth in the partnerships within Asia.</p>
          <p>And obviously, there is an implication on the share count, because you're issuing shares. And the focus has to be on making sure we're getting a high enough ROE on that additional capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the ROE is increasing, so.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Victor German from Nomura. Just if I could &#x2013; and I think Shayne already touched on that issue around capitalized balances. And what does it mean from amortization, high amortization expense.</p>
          <p>If we look at your capitalized balances, they continue to increase. Your software balances are something like $1.5 billion now. Westpac suggested that for them it creates about a 2-percentage point headwind next year. Could you give us an idea what sort of headwind that creates for you guys? And where does it leave you in terms of costs growth for next year? Are you going to be able to do sort of similar 2% cost growth per half as you have achieved in the last half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned before, the capitalized software growth is in those areas where we've got the business volume growth as well as particularly being driven by &#x2013; the major components in the current 12 months have been driven by the ACE project for APEA, which is the common platform for that business, driven by the likes of transactive.</p>
          <p>So there is a continuing buildup in amortization charges into 2012, but that's just part of the costs we've got to absorb and manage. And to the extent it's focusing on areas like ACE and transactive, there's an expectation of higher revenue, as well, as we make use of those platforms. So it's just part of the broader picture we've just got to manage in our costs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew Lyons from RBS. Just a question on your domestic margin. Your commentary suggests that deposit competition was a drag on your domestic performance in the second half. However, recent term deposit pricing does suggest that some of the heat has come out of that market. Can you just perhaps discuss what sort of a drag you expect this to have, particularly in light of what's happening in wholesale funding markets?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:19) deposit pricing <mark type="ph" /> recently (1:03:21) is true, but you've got to look at the offset to that is that the higher wholesale funding credit spreads, obviously, are going to impact us going into next year.</p>
          <p>So I don't think that the deposit side of the business will be a material negative drag in 2012, but we are under quite a lot of pressure in terms of the variable rate funding pool from those term credit spreads. And also, some <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:44) things that have happened in the hedge markets, particularly in the overnight index swap. So, there are going to be some margin headwinds for the domestic business next year, but they're less likely to be this time around from the deposit book, because of the point you have already highlighted.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mike Wiblin from Macquarie. Just a question around New Zealand. Looks like the outcome there has been a little bit more subdued compared to competitors. Maybe just a view on outlook for provisions there going forward? Also, the margin and also, any plans on the sort of footprint rationalization and further cost out benefits there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think we're actually &#x2013; I mean the big problem with New Zealand was just the lack of growth in term of the volumes. Now, we hope that that will pick up as the economy gradually looks a little bit more positive. In terms of the provisioning, I suspect that that will have flattened out a little bit now. We do expect or we have not seen as significant a problem as we originally expected from the Canterbury earthquake or earthquakes. That has not been quite as pronounced as perhaps we'd first thought. But we are beginning to see an improvement in terms of the housing market, and in terms of credit cards; that's slightly improved. So that's all positive.</p>
          <p>In terms of the rationalization, further cost rationalization, yes, I think there's still significant work to be undergone there. The simplification to one system is going to be very, very important. That's going to save us a lot of money in the medium term. The product rationalization that we're doing will also save significant amount of money. And we're working through now channel rationalization and I suspect that there's a fair amount of benefit in that too. There was another point there, what was the other?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh yeah, margin. Yeah, we have seen an increase in margin in New Zealand. I think they'll probably continue to have a little bit more benefit as we reprice, particularly in the commercial area. But, I guess, around the half, we will probably see that plateau, but I think a little bit more improvement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Brett Le Mesurier from BBY. A couple of questions. On the excess deposits that you've got in Asia, am I right in thinking that the ROE on the associated liquids is around about 5%? And secondly, the ROE on the Asian business is about less than half of that on the Australian business. So I would be right in thinking that the faster you grow the Asian or the APEA business, the faster your ROE will decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you understand that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Alex may want to make some comment about the ROE because he's <mark type="ph" /> KRA (1:07:57), but in terms of the liquids, yeah, there is a large block of liquids which we are making a spread on and we're making a positive spread on the liquids with people have come to us because of our rating and we've, in turn, classically put them with the likes of the Bank of Japan, with the Fed, et cetera. So they are very highly rated counterparties, obviously. The capital required for those is trivial and we're making a positive spread and that's allowed us to build up the liquid assets to give us some more flexibility around that funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where's the 5% ROE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know where the 5% ROE would come from because the ROE on that would be very high because the capital's so low. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But then going onto your question about ROE, clearly growing a business initially puts some pressure on ROE and then we look to improve the returns over time. So, Alex, do you want to make some comments on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, just to add to that, Peter, your high level is absolutely right. We'll continue to invest in the business. That will obviously delay ROEs, but we're beginning to get into a positive circle on the cost income ratio now, so that will help. And we're beginning to continue to generate more non-interest revenue at a pretty explosive pace and that will continue to improve the ROEs. The ROE differential from two years to this year is we have had big asset growth. That has been deliberate and we would expect ROEs also to move as margins move with the market conditions.</p>
