      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that EMC starts off the year with solid results. We achieved record Q1 revenues of $4.6 billion, up 18% from last year's first quarter, a non-GAAP EPS of $0.31, up 19% over Q1 of last year. We improved both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin considerably for the first quarter of last year, and we achieved free cash flow of almost $860 million, well in excess of record Q1 non-GAAP net income of $700 million.</p>
          <p>We successfully executed on our financial Triple Play once again, gaining market share, investing in the future, and improving profitability. We fully expect to continue realizing this Triple Play over the long term for two reasons. One, we are in the early stages of the largest IT transformation in history, which is creating enormous opportunities in cloud computing and big data. And two, we positioned ourselves to take full advantage of this opportunity by focusing on the transformation of IT infrastructure and applications.</p>
          <p>Customers recognize that their ability to compete is increasingly tied to the efficiency and agility of their IT operations and their transition into cloud architectures to make their businesses more efficient, more flexible and more agile. To get there, they are seeking partners who can meet their requirements from start to finish. From their first phase one server virtualization deployments through the phase two large scale ramping up of virtualization to include mission critical applications through phase three implementations where IT is automated and offered as a service and well into the future.</p>
          <p>Successfully navigating these phases can be challenging and doing so in the face of additional challenge created by the rise of big data makes it even more so. In addition to scalable yet manageable storage for petabytes of data, customers need analytics that grow beyond pros and cons. They need to analyze and leverage the massive amounts of data generated from various sources such as always-on networks, the web, consumers, surveillance systems and sensors. We are squarely focused on helping our customers take advantage of the rapidly emerging opportunities offered by both cloud and big data. It is this focus that drives us to continually identify and execute on opportunities that increase our value proposition to customers in this new world.</p>
          <p>As their IT needs grow larger and more complex, and as more and more of a company's success is linked to IT, we have innovated and invested to come out in front of these needs. There is no other company in IT with the combination of market leading virtualization and infrastructure assets that EMC has today for getting to cloud and for unlocking the value contained within the big data that surrounds us.</p>
          <p>Our virtualization and infrastructure assets are critically important for getting customers where they want to be. This is why EMC is a vendor of choice for organizations of just about every size and every vertical and is a key reason why our opportunity is so vast. Not only do we have an excellent base of technology assets, but we are expanding our reach by getting to market in many different ways. We are working directly with our customers to move them to cloud infrastructures and address their big data needs on their terms and time lines. We are investing in and expanding our channel to equip them to become more invaluable partners to their customers who are looking to gain greater efficiencies from IT.</p>
          <p>We're working with dozens of service providers who want to deliver the efficiencies of IT at scale to their customers and use best-of-breed technology to do so. And we are meeting the rapidly expanding demand for converged IT infrastructures through our VCE joint venture. In short, we are developing solutions and expanding our go to market in ways that make it easier for customers to take part in cloud computing and unlock the value of big data. There is vast growth potential in the areas where we compete and we are aggressively pursuing these opportunities at multiple levels.</p>
          <p>Given the strong growth we saw in the first quarter, and the opportunity we see for the rest of the year, we are now more confident that we can meet and potentially exceed our 2011 goals of $19.6 billion of revenue, $1.46 non-GAAP EPS, and $4 billion of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a closer look at how these opportunities are driving the financial results across our various lines of business, starting with information storage. Q1 information storage revenues were $3.4 billion, up 18%. For years, storage has been a top priority as information growth continues unabated. This phenomenon is fueling our growth at a fundamental level and is not likely to change anytime soon. But perhaps more important is the fact that this unbridled information growth has forced customers to seek more efficient and intelligent ways to handle these massive volumes of data. The best solution for one customer may not be the best for another, which is why we continually strive to offer the very best in-class technology tailored for various business requirements.</p>
          <p>High end storage product revenues were up a robust 25% year on year, driven primarily by pent up demand for the much anticipated FAST VP tiering software we announced in January. This in turn drove new VMAX system sales and upgrades. VMAX continues to be the smartest, most scalable and most efficient high end storage system available in the market and the ongoing introduction of unique capabilities such as Flash, FAST and VPLEX has led to tremendous growth since the introduction of VMAX in April of 2009. The success and growth of this business has been great, and given our share in the high end, it has resulted in higher than expected growth in the market as well.</p>
          <p>While it's realistic to expect growth to moderate in this relatively mature market, we do expect to continue to grow faster than the market and gain share. Our main reason we expect to continue to gain share is the ongoing introduction of unique and value added capabilities such as FAST VP that I mentioned earlier. In Q1, we saw a steep increase in the sale of FAST licenses from Q4 and three-quarters of the systems we shipped with FAST in Q1 used both Flash and SATA. Clearly customers are taking advantage of the value proposition offered by automated storage tiering and for good reason, as they are able to achieve up to 40% more application performance while significantly reducing the number of disks and power needed to compare with single tier systems. This type of differentiation of value are what will lead to our continued success in this market.</p>
          <p>An excellent example in the quarter of how this differentiation is winning occurred with a rapidly growing IT service provider in Brazil. This company needs an infrastructure to support the VMware virtualized operating environments that host their customers' platforms. A mission critical implementation, their solution has to be proven, smart and ultra efficient, as well as perfectly suited for virtualized environments. With the ability to meet each of these requirements, VMAX was head and shoulders above the competition in this deal.</p>
          <p>Our mid-tier storage revenue grew 20% in Q1, as our market leading portfolio of solutions offered important competitive distinctions in each of the areas it addresses. Looking across our broad set of capabilities in the mid-tier, it is clear that our ability to meet the wide variety of mid-tier use cases is unique. We firmly believe that this strategic approach will continue to drive our success here. By keeping the value proposition of each offering very distinct, channel partners benefit from selling the entire portfolio. This is an important point and one in which we are very focused.</p>
          <p>In our traditional mid-tier storage space, our newly launched VNX family is being very well received by the market. Our unified VNX product, which is also part of our January announcement, started shipping the last week in February, and was off to a strong start in March. VNX represented over 50% of the traditional mid-tier orders we booked in the last two weeks of the quarter and we expect VNX revenue to continue to ramp over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>It has a long list of advantages against competitors, advantages that customers in this space really respond to. First, it is simple. The market leading capabilities of our file and block solutions are now combined into a single unified platform that has managed to centralize an simple Unisphere interface. Also, it is efficient. It is the only storage system that automates both file and block <mark type="ph" /> sub one (10:44) tiering with FAST VP. The combination of this, the compression and file de-duplication enables customers to significantly improve capacity efficiency. It was great to see that almost 50% of VNX systems went out with Flash capability, which indicates customers are taking advantage of tiering. And finally, it is powerful. By leveraging x86 based multicore processor technology to maximize solution, proofer and bandwidth, the VNX set a world record performance benchmark for network file performance and overall response times. VNX is three times faster than our previous generation systems.</p>
          <p>With the launch of VNX, we drastically simplified our storage software offerings by streamlining over 25 different software products into 5 suites. This bundling has been extremely popular with our customers as well as with channel partners as they are now much simpler to buy. The result was a dramatic increase in software penetration with VNX and a deeper value proposition for our customers. In short, the VNX feature sets resonates with customers and was instrumental in winning several competitive deals in the quarter across a variety of verticals, including a telecom service provider building out infrastructure as a service for its client base; a bank eager to take advantage of thin provisioning, FAST, and FAST Cache on VNX to increase usable capacity and improve performance at lowest cost; a restaurant chain looking for a roadmap to private cloud; and a national police force where we were already a trusted provider and with VNX, were able to displace the incumbent vendor of distributed file storage.</p>
          <p>We entered the SMB market in Q1 with the launch of VNXe which started shipping the second week of March. The VNXe provides proven EMC quality into an affordable unified storage system. We designed the VNXe to be easy to manage, easy to sell and easy to support with the features and functions you would expect from an EMC product at a price you may not. The VNXe offers capabilities like advanced data reduction technology, automated technical support and efficient provisioning for mailboxes or VMware data stores at an entry price that firmly establishes it as the best value in the market.</p>
          <p>Remember, that this is a new product in a new space being sold to new customers through new channel partners. So it's going to take some time before we see a material benefit to our growth. However, we are pleased to report the VNXe is off to a strong start.</p>
          <p>We are rapidly on-boarding hundreds of new partners to sell the VNXe and have created fresh momentum with existing channels. In fact, with VNXe launch events in dozens of cities across the globe, we've signed on more new partners in the first quarter this year than we signed on over the course of all of last year and the progress continues.</p>
          <p>The significant majority of our mid-tier portfolio is sold via our channel partners and we are proud of the progress we are making here, particularly as our CLARiiON OEM agreement with Dell declined less than $40 million of revenue in Q1. In response to feedback we solicited from our growing partner community, just last week we announced several enhancements to our channel partner program to accelerate partner profitability. We'll continue these relationships in ways that are mutually beneficial to both EMC and to our channel partners.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our backup recovery systems division, which spans a variety of customer sizes, verticals and environments. BRS's ability to add value to just about any backup environment helps explain this division's consistently strong performance with our data domain products leading this growth. We expect this growth to continue, especially given the ongoing enhancements we are making to our market leading product lineup. On Monday, we announced the expansion of Avamar for use in much larger production environments by integrating it with data domain technology. We also announced state-of-the-art VMware backup enhancements with VMware APIs for data protection and tight integration with vCenter, Avamar can now provide up to 3X the backup speed of its nearest competitor. This is an excellent illustration of the EMC effect at its fullest, capturing the wealth of opportunities available with EMC's existing accounts while leveraging the deep resources of EMC not only to connect with new customers, but also to drive valuable innovation as well.</p>
          <p>We intend to use the power of the EMC effect to capture the opportunity presented by big data with scale en mass and data analytics as well. In the Scale-out NAS space, our Isilon storage division exceeded expectations in its first quarter within EMC. This is due to the merits of its highly differentiated technology with the global name space and multi petabyte scalability, Isilon systems are designed to handle massive numbers of large files, in other words, big data. We continue differentiate the Isilon technology. Last week, we launched out next generation hardware and software. The new systems incorporate greater tiering flexibility, across FSC and SAS or SATA drives and combined the tiered back end with a large globally coherent cache and next generation quad processors. These technology improvements are leveraged by innovations on the software side, with significant enhancements to improve performance of mission critical data center operations and with new recovery point objectives. The net effect is accelerated performance, proof of replication, underscoring Isilon's market leading position in scale en mass.</p>
          <p>Our technology advantage here is winning us new customers and getting us into environments where we are able to swap out competitive products that cannot meet customer scalability requirements. Isilon is also seeing early examples of the EMC effect and benefiting from the strength of EMC's brand and global reach.</p>
          <p>A couple of large wins in China in Q1 illustrate why Isilon is a storage infrastructure of choice for so many big data applications. In these cases, genomics. These customers need to make petabyte scale datasets simultaneously available to numerous instruments, users and data servers. With Isilon, these customers are able to achieve unprecedented levels of both concurrent and sequential IO performance while saving significant time and capital costs.</p>
          <p>Our data computing division continues to thrive in the big data analytics space, both Forrester and Gartner recently recognized the architecture leadership in this space as our continued innovation, solid execution and strong cloud focus form the basis of our competitive advantage. With twice the data loading speed of its nearest competitor and the industry's best performance, the EMC data computing appliance permits more data to be analyzed faster and at lower costs. Because of these advantages, SAS, the leader in business analytics software, recently announced the expansion of its high performance computing offerings on our data computing appliance. The combination of SAS's unique analytic capabilities with Greenplum's massively powered architecture in a complete purpose-built appliance delivers a compelling value proposition to customers.</p>
          <p>To sum up, our storage business has never been better positioned. Looking forward, we expect to see a bounce back of growth in the mid-tier driven by full quarter contributions from the new VNX family and our continued leadership in the high end. Again, our strength in storage comes from our ability to provide leading edge technology to a broad range of customers and use cases. Add to this our depth of experience and our proven track record and EMC emerges as the storage vendor of choice as customers transition to the cloud and navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by big data.</p>
          <p>Our RSA security revenues in Q1 were $174 million, up 8% year on year. We saw strong growth from our GRC data loss prevention and IPV solutions. This was somewhat offset by a pause in shipments, as we reviewed and hardened our systems in response to the sophisticated cyber attack targeting RSA that occurred in the quarter. Customers are our first priority, and RSA's management and sales force are actively engaging with customers and partners to address their questions and ensure they have the tools and support necessary to reinforce the security of their RSA secure ID environments.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to the rest of the year, it is likely that we will give up some revenue growth within the RSA business in the short term as we continue to work with customers and strengthen these relationships for the long term.</p>
          <p>This year's record attendance at the RSA Conference, which is the marquee security conference, underscores the fact that the security challenges faced by IT organizations around the world are not going away. As attacks grow more sophisticated, frequent, and targeted, customers need defense mechanisms at multiple levels to defend against them. We deepened RSA's analytic and visualization offerings earlier this month with the acquisition of NetWitness. This acquisition as network analysis and insight to better inform security management. This is a highly complementary addition to our arsenal of GRC, data loss prevention and security information and event management offerings as customers seek multilayer security offerings as threats become increasingly persistent and complex.</p>
          <p>Revenues from our information intelligence group in Q1 were $160 million, down 10% from Q1 of last year when we saw a larger number of big orders including one particularly large financial services transaction. Whilst growth here has been disappointing, the technology is good. We are making some key changes to help this business perform to its potential.</p>
          <p>Our new xCP offering is earning accolades. It was awarded a leading position by both Forrester and Gartner in their most recent assessments of the space, because it can be used to build intelligent case-based apps faster at a much lower cost and with fewer resources. We are building light weight applications on top of xCP using modern virtualized frameworks. These are geared for specific industries which will in turn allow for much faster solution deployments. And we've reorganized the IIG sales force into a more vertically aligned structure with fewer accounts per rep, enabling our sales team to identify and execute on opportunities more rapidly. This is an initiative we expect to start bearing fruit in the second half of the year. Because of these efforts, we expect this year to be one of modest growth and significant transition for IIG, with results being a business that's much better positioned for success.</p>
          <p>VMware revenue grew 33% in the quarter to a record $843 million. VMware saw strength across all geographies and benefited from high close rates on large enterprise license agreements in the quarter. This impressive growth of VMware stems from a few simple facts. Virtualization is now mainstream, with the majority of new applications being deployed in virtual environments, it is a standard feature in modern data centers.</p>
          <p>Virtualization is a fundamental first step for cloud computing. Without it, customers are limited by the inefficiencies of physical infrastructures. And virtualization is being led by VMware, which is head and shoulders above others in the space, particularly for full data center deployments. In Q1, there continued to be countless examples of the affinity between VMware's robust virtualization platform and EMC's proven information infrastructure. As more customers are entering phase two of their journey to the cloud, we are seeing more mission critical applications being virtualized and deployed on high end infrastructure, Also differently, systems that can live up to the more demanding SLAs these workloads require. There were many such examples of these implements in Q1 in retail, telecom, Internet, construction and insurance to name but a few.</p>
          <p>Let me take a moment here for a couple of housekeeping items on how you should model VMware's results within EMC. First, we have broken out for you the expected full year minority interest of approximately $175 million. We have also provided you with an estimate of the additional dilution of $50 million for the non-GAAP EPS calculation. These items are being implied within our consolidated expectations, but we noticed not everyone has modeled them correctly. These amounts have been relatively small historically, but as VMware's success continues, it is increasingly important in how non-GAAP EPS is calculated. The takeaway here is that you should include both of these when modeling consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the full year.</p>
          <p>Across our business, we have a number of additional initiatives to facilitate customers' transition to cloud. Our consulting division continues to see good demand for systems building out cloud architectures. But getting to hybrid cloud also means utilizing enterprise cloud services offered by external providers and we are directing a lot of energy to make sure service providers have the technology and expertise necessary to enable these offerings. We've made lots of progress on this front and you can expect additional announcements from us next week.</p>
          <p>Through our joint venture with Cisco and VMware, VCE, we are helping customers get to IT-as-a-Service much more quickly with Vblock converged infrastructure products. The value proposition here is incredibly powerful as our Vblock enables the deployment of best-of-breed IT infrastructure in a matter of hours rather than days and even months. With an expanding pipeline, and a workforce approaching 1,000, VCE opened its headquarters in Dallas last month and will soon open offices in San Jose, Raleigh Durham, and London. Given the market momentum, we are accelerating our investment in VCE, as it's important route to market will serve us well in the race to create both private and public cloud infrastructures.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our projection for other expense in 2011 by approximately $70 million. The acceleration of the VCE investment is reflected here as are changes in the operating effects associated with VCE. However, we expect improvements to our operating margin from Vblock related sales to effectively offset most of this increase in other expense during 2011. We are focused on developing the broader IT ecosystems to support hybrid cloud implementations.</p>
          <p>The alternative to our broad-based strategy is a single vendor approach wherein customers are dependent upon one company for applications, infrastructure and services. Our open approach offers choice as it engages an array of partners, allowing customers to take advantage of developments and innovations springing up across the broader ecosystem. While this strategy requires coordination of efforts across several players, we are committed as we firmly believe it offers the best long-term value proposition to our customers.</p>
          <p>Looking more closely at our financials, it is evident that the strategic combination of our technology assets which we have been building over the last several years has resulted in clear value for our customers and for our shareholders as well. Total revenue grew 18% to $4.6 billion in Q1. Revenue from the US was up double digits while our strategy to invest in geographies outside the US is paying off, as the rapid growth of these markets help drive our overall results. Our BRIC plus 13 markets grew over 40% and EMEA and APJ were up 21% and 43% respectively. This helped drive the our non-US mix to a record 49% of revenue.</p>
          <p>We improved non-GAAP gross margin by 160 basis points over last year's first quarter. This improvement was driven in part by our ability to offer differentiated features that enable customers to maximize the value of their information infrastructures. We continued to show leverage and our non-GAAP operating margin grew 220 basis points during the year to 21.7%. The result of these improvements was non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31, up 19% from $0.26 a year ago.</p>
          <p>We recognize there's a lot of interest in Japan, and how it might impact our supply chain. While the longer term impacts of these tragic events are still unknown, we have very solid relationships with our suppliers and believe we have been able to develop a clearer picture of our near term risks. After carefully assessing hundreds of our suppliers and their suppliers as they have been impacted, we've determined that only a handful currently have some supply risk exposure. We have taken risk mitigation steps and continue to monitor the situation. At this time, we do not see any meaningful impact in Q2, and continue to work with our suppliers to secure the components we need for the second half.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. We returned nearly $900 million in cash to shareholders in Q1 with the repurchase of more than 33 million EMC shares. Augmenting VMware's $148 million share repurchase in Q1, we also invested $38 million purchasing VMware shares in the quarter to keep our stake at around 80%. To reiterate the rationale of these purchases, we strongly believe in VMware's potential, given its strategic position as the cloud data center operating system of the future. As a result, we believe our relatively small purchase to maintain our ownership level an excellent long-term investment.</p>
          <p>In closing, we're encouraged by our strong Q1 results and the opportunities as we look ahead for the rest of the year. Given the trends of the market, our strategic position and our focused execution, we now have greater confidence in our ability to meet and potential to exceed our 2011 goals of $19.6 billion in revenue, non-GAAP EPS of $1.46, and free cash flow of $4 billion.</p>
          <p>Note that the non-GAAP EPS goal we gave you in January contemplated a share count of 2.23 billion. We have since increased our projected share count to 2.26 billion shares, which impacts our full year non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02. This is a direct result of the increase in our share price in Q1 driving a higher average share price assumption for the full year. Offsetting this we now expect our operating margin for the full year to be between 23% and 24%, due to better operating margins in our storage business and improved margins from VMware.</p>
          <p>In summary, we executed well against our strategy in Q1 and we believe the outlook for the rest of 2011 and beyond is bright. The major trends in cloud and big data are large and growing. Our strategy is in place and we will continue to execute very well. With that, I will turn it over to Joe who will give you more color on the outlook, the quarter and the vast opportunities that lie ahead. Joe?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's Q1 earnings call. Thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I am pleased with our Q1 results and I'm even more pleased with the way our strategy and products are resonating with our customers.</p>
          <p>Clearly customers are extremely interested in the massive benefits which private and public cloud computing can bring. And they see how our products, services and solutions can help them accelerate their journey to the cloud while helping them meet the vast demands their business is placing on IT today.</p>
          <p>Also, it is extremely clear that good financial results and winning strategies, products and services do not happen in any company or organization without talented, hard working, dedicated people and EMC and VMware are truly blessed with more than 50,000 people who exhibit these winning traits as they focus day in and day out on the success of their customers. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their first-class execution.</p>
          <p>Let me now comment on IT spending and our expectations for the remainder of 2011. On balance, we still expect to see IT spending up this year in the 5% to 7% range, most probably in the higher end of that range. And we still firmly believe that the core areas where EMC and VMware have leading technology, namely in virtualization, a cloud OS, and information storage, information protection, information security, and then information management intelligence, are technology areas which will grow substantially faster than the 5% to 7% IT average.</p>
          <p>However, while we are pretty confident that IT spending will be solid, I would like to note that there are some potential event risks such as the impacts of the disasters in Japan, global public sector deficits and rising commodity prices, especially oil, that can cause a sense of uncertainty. We will continue to monitor these three sources of potential risks and to be clear, we are still confident that we can meet and potentially beat our 2011 plan of $19.6 billion in revenue, and $1.46 of non-GAAP EPS. The source of this confidence is based on our strong belief that our cloud computing and big data strategies are well placed and are underpinned with winning products and fully committed and funded product roadmaps.</p>
          <p>On the VMware side, vSphere, vShield, vCloud director, vCenter, vFabric, Cloud Foundry, and vClient are critical market leading core elements for private, public and hybrid cloud computing. And cloud computing engenders information on a massive scale. We call this phenomena big data. Our VMAX, Isilon, and Atmos product families, along with our virtual storage offering VPLEX, address this big data storage opportunity head on. These products continue to be extremely well received by our customers on both the private and public side and our Greenplum and IIG suite of products help customers get real value from their big data assets.</p>
          <p>Next, this massive scale of information needs to be protected. In other words, information needs to be highly available and eventually archived at reasonable cost points in concert with business process objectives. Here our data domain, Avamar and network technologies featuring industry leading performance, data compression and data de-duplication hit the mark head on.</p>
          <p>Additionally, strong, effective and pervasive information security is quick becoming a top board mandate for all IT data center environments, especially for cloud computing environments. Here's where RSA family of products for identity protection and verification, for data loss prevention, for security and event management, for governance risk and compliance, and now with our acquisition of NetWitness for network forensic play a critical role. In short, we have the most complete suite of security technology products that meet the vigorous demands of massive scale clouds.</p>
          <p>And finally for demanding mid-tier environments and SMB implements, our VNX and VNXe storage lines are generating a very strong reception from our customers. All in all, we have an extremely well-placed and focused technology lineup, backed by our world class services organization and our service provider partners to help accelerate our customers' journey to the hybrid cloud.</p>
          <p>And the best news of all, we have more innovation coming. Stay tuned to EMC World, which starts on May 9th when we will launch many more exciting new products that will help extend our leading cloud technology stack.</p>
          <p>Thank you for joining us today and I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&amp;A portion of today's call.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, had a couple of questions. David, first with regards to your comments on the mid-tier, good results there, but could you give us a little bit more color on CLARiiON and Celerra? Do you expect those products just given the order momentum that you are seeing at VNX to have a significant sequential declines over the next couple of quarters and so how do we think about that transition moving forward? And also with regards to your annual guide commentary, you mentioned that you feel much more comfortable in your ability to achieve it, then why isn't that feeling good enough to actually raise the number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start and I'm sure Joe will have comments as well. So relative to VNX, we are very excited about the way that is progressing. As I mentioned, we didn't start shipping the product until the last week in February. So we really had a very short selling quarter for VNX. We announced it, of course, in the middle part of January. So we knew we created a little bit of a pause in the market until it became available and that's what happened.</p>
          <p>Essentially the VNX replaces both CLARiiON and Celerra. And as I mentioned, in the last two weeks of the quarter, we saw more than 50% of the orders from those three products moving towards VNX. So we do expect the growth of VNX to accelerate. We expect it to quite quickly, certainly in the second quarter, it will be well over 50% of what we call our traditional mid-tier. But we expect the combination of those three products to grow quite nicely. And as I said, we expect a bounce back in total growth in the mid-tier in the second quarter because we'll have a full quarter where we will be shipping and selling VNX. So that's the flavor on the mid-tier.</p>
          <p>Relative to the year, obviously, we were off to a great start. The numbers, I think, speak for themselves. We did 18% revenue growth. We did 19% non-GAAP EPS growth, and of course that combines with our annual guidance of 15% and 16% respectively. So we obviously started off out of the gates ahead of the pace and that's why I said we are more confident now. We can meet and of course, potentially beat our guidance and we just want to see a little bit more of the year develop before we change our numbers explicitly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning guys. I just have a question on the big data market, given Isilon performed better than you expected. Just remind us, do you still expect Atmos <mark type="ph" /> and Isilon (38:07) to get to $1 billion plus run rate in the back half of the year? And secondly I think there was some news about Apple ordering 12 petabytes of Isilon storage intra quarter. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:14) can you just talk about what's the feedback been from the enterprise side where you've introduced Isilon products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We absolutely expect that Isilon will be at a $1 billion run rate in the second half of next year, not this year. So obviously a lot of success. I don't want to comment on any specific wins without any customer agreements. So I'm not going to make any comment on any specific wins other than what we already made with Isilon. But just that it's being well received. Our pipeline is strong and I am more confident than I was when we bought it that we will hit that $1 billion run rate either in Q3 or Q4 of next year, probably in Q3.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, guys and congratulations on the quarter. Question on VMAX, obviously quite strong. I think you referenced the new FAST technology. Can you talk about your adoption rate of SSDs, what kind of contributions SSDs represent as a percentage of capacity or drives shipped in the typical Symmetrix platform? And just a point of clarification, when you say SSDs, you know, is that just Fibre Channel interface SSDs or is the VMAX supporting SATA interface SSDs? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will support both, right now it's just Fibre Channel for Q1, okay. About 50% of the systems went out with Flash technology. So we are very pleased with the progression and that's going to grow over time. I foresee the day when virtually every single system that we ship from the bigger end VNXs to the bigger &#x2013; and to all the VMAXs will have Flash technology in them.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, good morning guys. Joe or David, on the mid-range, is there a concern that the ramp of VNX could actually reduce the growth rate for VMAX, given that VMAX has moved down slightly down market? Also could you talk a little bit about how we should think about the pricing disparity between VNX and the older mid-range products? And lastly as we exit the year, what portion of the mid-range do you think will be VNX? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've really &#x2013; as David said, one of the real successes that we had in the quarter was the adoption of FAST VP which is on both systems. And of course, when you start tiering like that, you remove the need for a customer to buy separate in a way, high end, mid-tier and low end systems because you can get all of those benefits in one architecture. And of course, if you have a say, a Symmetrix big farm of Symmetrix or VMAXs, probably the least expensive alternative for you is to put, because they've got a lot of horsepower in them, is to put more drives with better big SATA drives and use the FAST technology to move data very quickly, very efficiently to that lower tier.</p>
          <p>So in a way that's helping blur the line. So for sure VMAX is now taking some loads that were in formerly mid-tier. As far as the VNX line is concerned, you know, as the performance and capabilities of that system &#x2013; I mean, it is &#x2013; we are seeing in real customer instances three times the performance as that technology gets more and more used and FAST VP works there, we expect that. So basically do lines overlap a bit? Yes, they do, and that's intentional because when you leave gaps that's where competitors drive. So we believe we're going to see a significant acceleration of VNX sales and VNXe sales obviously and we're very pleased with our position on both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Deepak, just to clarify on the mix question. Again, as we look at VNX and CLARiiON and Celerra combined, as I mentioned in the second quarter we expect VNX to be over 50% of that mix, and a growing percentage thereafter. So, obviously the significant majority and by the time we get to the year-end. And from a price/performance point of view, as Joe mentioned, we've positioned the VNX to be much more competitive from a price/performance perspective. And also, as I've mentioned, we've made it easier for customers to buy the value-added software and some of the value-added components. So whilst we're even more competitive on the baseline in pricing, we have many more sell-up opportunities with VNX than we did with the prior generation products.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks a lot. Could you comment on VCE, how things are going, and how things are recognized in terms of revenue throughout the P&amp;L? I'm a little confused with the, it sounds like there's an extra $75 million in costs below the line that you weren't forecasting, about a $0.03 hit. But it sounds like you'll make it up through the revenue and profits you get through the P&amp;L. So first, just talk about that dynamic, and then also talk about just how it's going in general. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take it in your order. Why don't I let David start and I'll talk about more how it's going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Ben, so let me talk about P&amp;L mechanics and dynamics. So first of all, and Joe will give a bit more color on how it's going. We are accelerating investment because the market opportunity is great. As I mentioned, we're up to close to 1,000 people, which is certainly ahead of our plan at this point in time by a few hundred.</p>
          <p>So there's two things that are impacting that $70 million increase in guidance we gave you in the other expense line. The first is the fact that we are accelerating our expenses a little bit more than we accelerated, sorry, than we expected. And the second piece is that because of how we are selling Vblocks and where we are selling Vblocks, more of the Vblock sales are being recorded directly on the parent P&amp;L. So differently, not as much of the revenue is flowing through VCE as we expected. So what's happening is that the margin that would have been captured by VCE is now being captured directly by us in our operating margin. Over time we do expect that to kind of balance out a little bit. But for this year, we expect that to be the case.</p>
          <p>So what's happening is you've got a little bit of accelerated investment, and you've also got margins that would have been flowing through VCE and now flowing up through the parent. And that's why I said we expect to cover both of those through the operating results of Vblocks as they flow through the parent over the course of the year. Obviously there will be a slight timing issue. We're going to be accelerating our investments too and we'll be picking up all the revenue on the other side. That's why we say net-net, it will be pretty neutral when you look at the full year guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously, we wouldn't have increased the investment and we are investing a little bit ahead as David said. So you saw some of that drag if you will to EPS in Q1 and you will see it as we progress through the year. But obviously as revenues continue to ramp, we think we wouldn't have done it if we didn't think it was a great invest. And we wouldn't invest there if we didn't think the market wasn't hot. So as far as how do we see the future of VCE, we see it very bright.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Kaushik Roy of Wedbush. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So you're going everything right, growing nicely. Your gross margin, operating margins are expanding. But it seems like the headwind is the share count. So the question is, can you accelerate the buyback? And then the other question I would say is, any thoughts on dividends? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me talk about share count and how we are going on with buy back. So you are right, since we started off the year, our guidance on share count has gone from 2.23 billion to 2.26 billion and that's directly a function of share price. If you remember from what we talked about last time, the increase in share price basically drives three things that account for the extra 30 million shares in our forecast.</p>
          <p>The first is it impacts the dilution from the convertible. Remember, roughly half of that is kind of what we call accounting dilution. It goes away when the convertible matures. About half of that is economic dilution, it's real. We have to pay those shares out. The second and smallest of the three is with a higher share price, we expect some increase in acceleration of option timing. Last but not least, the high share price impacts the number of shares we can buy with the buyback we have for the year.</p>
          <p>Now, as you know, we are committed to spending $1.5 billion in buying back EMC shares this year. We spent a little less than $900 million in the first quarter. So we actually did move pretty quickly getting out of the blocks after the earnings call to start buying back and we'll look at the timing and the opportunity but we are still on track to do the $1.5 billion. But bear in mind, again on the share count, a big piece of the impact goes away. And if you kind of look at our Q on average, we have about 80 million shares in our share count which are from the accounting impact of the convertible, that when that convertible matures, disappear completely. So you've got a little bit of artificial inflation in the share count, as well as some real inflation. Joe, on dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our board continues to look and examine all uses of cash to generate shareholder value and we'll continue to look at dividends. Right now we think we are in a really sweet spot and have terrific ability to execute on our cloud strategy and big data strategy and invest in the future. So primarily, the two courses we're following now is buybacks and smart acquisitions. And we see a lot of opportunity on that smart acquisition side that are going to, I think, pay off really big for us in the future. So that's probably our bias right now but there's nothing in our DNA against a dividend at all and at some point in time, I'm sure that will happen. But right now, I gave you our primary focus.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. With respect to the advent of cloud computing and incremental services being offered almost on a daily basis and as that business continues to grow in the future, do you anticipate any changes in sort of buying power of the end customer? I.e., who is consuming the mainly enterprise storage and if so, how will that impact the financial model over time from a pricing pressure perspective, et cetera? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we think the answer to that is going to be what we are doing with FAST and to kind of blur those lines of &#x2013; in a way of what's enterprise storage, what's tier two storage, which as these systems work better together and get more homogenized, more networked, we think we have a really good future. And it's not a one size fits all. We have the, our big data assets, we have assets aimed more at the mid-tier and assets aimed more at SMB. Over time, we think the big data side is going to be where a tremendous amount of the cloud action goes. But there's opportunities throughout the whole storage line which is why we have such a broad line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, bear in mind that whilst we talk about cloud computing as broad and very important term, it applies just as much to our traditional enterprise customers as it does to service providers. So our primary focus is helping our enterprise move to their private clouds, which is basically turning their traditional data centers into more cloud-like environments, working with service providers so they can stand up enterprise compatible clouds and then the end goal here is what we call the hybrid cloud where those two environments are working seamlessly together and enterprises can use service providers for key applications, flex demand, capacity, archiving, et cetera, in a much more flexibility environment. So enterprises in this model continues to consume a lot of computing in the same way as we do today, just with a different technology objective.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe you could give us some color on spending in the public sector and if you could break that out maybe by federal, state and local, education and then maybe throw also in their sales in Japan. I know you mentioned Japan, but just didn't know what kind of demand dynamics you're seeing out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me do it this way, because I'm not going to break down public sector totally. But if you looked at our, at kind of average, you'd have markets like retail, from a verticals perspective, retail manufacturing, others. If you looked at what was better than average, I would point to telco, financial services, services companies. If you looked at what was lower than average, I would point from our Q1, I would point to public sector. And I already talked about one of the headwinds that I think everyone will face is most governments certainly in the US, certainly in most parts of Europe are faced with deficits or other issues. And I do think they are going to be very &#x2013; while IT is the real seed of productivity for sure, I still think IT will not be immune from public sector as they really sharpen their pencil and try to cut back a bit. So and again, healthcare may be a little bit aside. I think education and healthcare, unfortunately will probably get &#x2013; will probably also fall victim to the very, very, very pointed pencil. Healthcare might get a bit more investment, but that's kind of the way I see it.</p>

          <p>Oh, Japan. Actually in Q1, our sales into Japan were okay and on plan. So you just worry about the future. It's not &#x2013; we haven't been given any bad forecasts or anything yet, but you just can't help but have a worry bubble. It's just a little bit of an unknown. Our supply chain people have really done a heck of a job looking at the first, second and third order effects and we think in the main we'll be okay and almost everything we do virtually is multisourced. So we feel okay, but you still have some angst. It's a big supplier to the IT community. So you still have some angst, is there anything we missed, is there a fourth or fifth order effect that could come down the line and bite you a little bit? We don't think so. But it just causes a little bit of uncertainty and a little bit more focus and that's what I was pointing to.</p>

          <p>Yes thank you. David, I had a question on operating margins. You commented on the very strong year-over-year margin improvement in the first quarter as 220 basis points on an operating margin basis. If we look at your full year guidance, it kind of implies year over year operating margin improvement for the remaining three quarters. That's about half that level, the midpoint in your guidance. I'm wondering if you could comment whether that's just kind of prudent conservatism given some of the caveats you and Joe have mentioned, or whether there's some mix dynamics particularly with the new product offerings and VMAX that we need to be aware of as we model through remainder of the year.</p>

          <p>Okay, Toni there aren't any adverse headwinds from mix or margin point of view, and if anything as I mentioned with VNX replacing CLARiiON and Celerra, we are actually a bit more positive about margin potential in the mid-range. So we feel good about the mix. Obviously what we have done is that we've basically given you a set of numbers that gets you back to our same guidance, you know, mid-point as last time. So the $19.6 billion and $1.46 and obviously we have implied in that, that there is going to be some improvement in operating margin for the full year. And as I said, you know, we are incrementally more confident that we are able to beat than we were before and there are multiple aspects of how we could potentially beat that number and volume is clearly one and additional profitability in the model is clearly second.</p>

          <p>Yes, we are focusing Toni on what we think are prudent investments which are going to help us over midterm and long term growth faster. We are making a major investment with our programs for our channels. We're broadening out our channels significantly and we're really pleased with our momentum in channels and we had a record number of, as we pointed out, a record number of channel partners signed up. And they are very excited about some of our new offerings, our new programs. We're investing in VCE and we're going to continue to acquire smartly and follow our string of pearls approach.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our last question comes from Daniel Ives of FBR. Your line is open.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a last question in terms of deal sizes. Was there any sort of change for the March quarter in terms of deals getting bigger, anything that you're seeing in either in the channel or the on sales front that maybe surprised you on deal sizes?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, I think that it's difficult to generalize across a business with so many different aspects to it. Obviously on the VMware side as we mentioned, or they mentioned on their call last night, we saw some good sized deals on the VMware side. You know, by definition, because the Symmetrix were so strong this quarter on the back of FAST VP, we saw some larger deals there. Nothing particularly unusual for a Q1. Good news is that out of the gate, some of the VNX sales are making a little larger than the prior generation systems but nothing in particular in terms of overall deal sizes. I think obviously with such a strong quarter, we did see a number of large deals in the quarter which is good, after clearly what was a good Q4. So that's nice to see the level of spending continue. But nothing particularly remarkable in terms of overall transaction size.</p>
