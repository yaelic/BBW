          <p>Good morning. My name is Ashley and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter and year-to-date results and September sales release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ashley.</p>
          <p>Good morning to everyone. This morning we reported our 16-week fourth quarter and our 52-week fiscal year 2010 operating results, both ended August 29th. As well, we're reporting our five-week September sales results for the five weeks ended this past Sunday, October 3rd.</p>
          <p>As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that the discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and our performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, our 16-week fourth quarter. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.97 a share, up 14% from last year's fourth quarter earnings of $0.85. The $0.97 figure for this year's fourth quarter compares to the current First Call estimate of $0.95.</p>
          <p>Both fourth quarters included certain items that impacted the quarter-over-quarter comparison. As outlined in last year's year-end earnings release, last year's 2009 fourth quarter included a $16.6 million pre-tax charge or $0.02 a share LIFO benefit with no corresponding LIFO charge or credit this year in Q4. There were a few items in this year's fourth quarter that in the aggregate benefited our 2010 fourth quarter by about $0.02 a share as well, so kind of a wash in the year-over-year comparison in the fiscal fourth quarters.</p>
          <p>In addition, a couple of other items that impacted the comparison of this year's fourth quarter versus last year &#x2013; as I've discussed in I think all the quarters this fiscal year, unlike '09 where we had FX headwinds, this year we benefited. We had FX tailwinds, if you will.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our foreign currency earnings results, when converted and reported in U.S. dollars, benefited us this year as the dollar relatively weakened to many of the foreign currencies in countries where we operate. In the fourth quarter we were helped by a little over 16 million pre-tax or $0.02 a share after tax. That is, assuming FX exchange rates were flat year over year, our foreign country operating results in Q4 when reported in U.S. dollars would have been a little bit lower by that amount.</p>
          <p>For the entire year, the impact of FX assuming FX rates had remained constant year over year was to increase our total company reported sales by $1.6 billion, or about 1.4% of our total sales, and increased pre-tax earnings by 70 million pre-tax or about $0.10 a share. Again this calculation simply takes the currency exchange rates for the prior fiscal year and assumed they had remained at those levels throughout this most recent fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Second, and again as I have discussed previously, the last several quarters, we have experienced higher employee benefits costs, mainly consisting of higher U.S. healthcare costs. Total benefits costs were up about 14% and higher year over year. Health within that U.S. healthcare cost, which is the biggest item, was up 11%.</p>
          <p>As I'll discuss later in this call, our overall SG&amp;A percentage was still better or lower year over year in the quarter by I believe 12 basis points. In fact, payroll dollars showing good improvement. While U.S. total sales in the fiscal quarter were up 8%, our payroll dollars total company were up 5%. Correspondingly in the U.S., our payroll dollars were up 3.2% whereas total U.S. sales were up a little over 5%.</p>
          <p>For the 2010 fiscal year, our net income came in at $1.3 billion or $2.92 a share compared to 1.1 billion or 2.47 a share last year in fiscal '09, up 20% in dollars and 18% on an earnings per share basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, as we reported on September 2nd, our 16-week reported comparable sales figures showed a 6% increase, plus 4% in the U.S., plus 14% internationally. As we always do, we take out gas inflation and the impact of FX. That would make the 4% reported U.S. number in the quarter plus 3%, and the plus 14% international number plus 8% in local currency, and thereby bringing the reported 6% comp number for the quarter down to a plus 4%.</p>
          <p>We also reported this morning our September sales results for the five weeks of September ending this past Sunday. These were the U.S. coming in at a solid two; international, 14; and total company up a little over five but rounding to five.</p>
          <p>For the five-week September period, the 2% reported comp would remain at 2% even without the about 0.5% positive impact from gasoline inflation, again because it started off as a relatively strong 2. And given that the U.S. dollar's relative weakness vis-&#xE0;-vis other currencies in the last month, our reported 14% international comp would have been 10% if expressed in local currency. And again, if you exclude both gas inflation, the impacts of both gas inflation and FX, our September comp sales number would be on a normalized apples-to-apples basis of plus 4%.</p>
          <p>A couple of final comments on September. The reported 5% number included a continued strong frequency or traffic increase, coming in at 4.3% up in September. And the other piece of that product to get to the 5, a 1.1% in increase in average ticket. Of course, the plus 1.1% average ticket increase would be about flat excluding the combined positive impacts of gas and FX during the month of September. So essentially a flat ticket, which I believe is actually up a little bit and an improving trend over the last few months.</p>
          <p>Geographically, in September &#x2013; actually both in September and for the quarter, the regions of relative strength were the Northwest, L.A., Midwest, and Southeast, as well as Texas. Internationally, all countries enjoyed good comp performance with the exception of the UK, which is still probably the toughest economic environment we're operating in.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories, September comp sales, all four core merchandise categories &#x2013; food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods &#x2013; as you know, those represent a little over 80% of our total company sales, showed positive comps in September. In fact, softlines positive September comps were in the low double-digit range, while food and sundries, fresh, and ancillary were in the mid-single-digit range.</p>
          <p>With respect to September sales, weather wreaked a little havoc, but I won't lay a lot of blame on that. There was a little bit of a Multi-Vendor Mailer shift in the last week of September, which we think pushed a little of the fifth week of September's sales into the first week of October, which we're currently in.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest that I will review this morning. Our opening activities and plans. We opened a total of 13 net new locations during fiscal year 2010, which ended this past August 29. Among those 13, it represented 10 new in the U.S., two new in Canada, and one new in the UK. As well, we relocated one unit in fiscal 2010 in Warrenton, Oregon.</p>
          <p>For fiscal '11, we've greatly increased our expansion plans, with a current plan of 29 net new locations, 16 in the U.S. and 13 outside of the U.S., as well as a couple of relocations currently planned.</p>
          <p>Since fiscal year end on August 29th, we've opened one new location. It actually is our eighth Business Center in San Diego, California, with seven additional openings planned before our November 21st first quarter end. Those seven include one in Alberta, Canada; one in Landover, Maryland; two new locations in Georgia, one in Atlanta and one in North Georgia; and three openings in the Chicago market, bringing our presence in the Chicago market to 17 total locations.</p>
          <p>We now operate 573 locations around the world, and that includes the 32 in Mexico. I'll talk about the consolidating of our Mexico operations a little later in this call as we begin fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>I'll also review with you our ancillary business results, our online activities, membership trends, a little bit more discussion about Q4 operating results, our stock repurchase buyback activities during the quarter, and a couple of other housekeeping items.</p>
          <p>So on to the discussion of our quarterly results; very briefly, again total sales were up 7.8% to $23.6 billion. And again on a reported comp basis, Q4 comps were a six, normalized to four if you take out gas and FX. For the quarter, the six represented an average ticket of plus 2% and an average frequency of just under plus 4%, continuing robust year-over-year frequency increases. Included in the average ticket of 1.9 or 2%, strong FX; about half of it was FX, and about half of it was gasoline inflation.</p>
          <p>In terms of cannibalization, pretty minuscule right now, 30 basis points in the fiscal quarter, not that different, a little lower than past recent months and quarters.</p>
          <p>For fiscal '10 overall, our average warehouse did $139 million, up from 131 million a year ago or a 7% increase. Again, that has the benefit of FX and gas inflation. Just our U.S. warehouses went from 133, up $4 million to 137.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned in terms of sales comparisons by geographic regions, again FX helped in all four fiscal quarters of 2010. There was actually gas deflation in Q1 of '10 and gas inflation in Qs two, three, and four. And like September geographic results, the strongest regions with respect to sales in Q4 and September were the Northwest, L.A., Southeast, and Midwest. And again, international in local currencies are doing quite well with the exception of the UK, which is about flat.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories, within food and sundries comp for this &#x2013; I'm talking about fourth quarter here. Within food and sundries, comps were positive mid-single digits. No real standouts, all sub-departments were positive. Our hardline sales showed positive comps in the low single digits for the quarter. The strongest subcategories were in the 10% to 20% range. They included sporting goods, hardware, lawn and garden. All tend to be what I'll call mid-priced discretionary items for the home. This was offset by minus mid-single digit in majors. That's about a third of our hardline sales. And of course, a big chunk of that is what's going on, on televisions.</p>
          <p>Within the very positive low to mid-teen softline comps, great numbers in housewares, small electrics, domestics, home furnishings. And even jewelry was fairly strong, coming off certainly weakness last year.</p>
          <p>Fresh foods up a little over 5%, in the six point range, and all fresh foods sub-departments were pretty good. For the month of September, our food and sundries comps were positive mid-single digits, with deli and cooler in the low double-digit range. All departments were positive, sub-departments were positive in food and sundries, overall slightly inflationary for the month. And I'll talk a little bit about what's going on with some commodities inflation in a moment.</p>
          <p>Hardlines were slightly positive, with office, sporting goods, and lawn and garden showing the strongest results in September. Again, majors was negative in the high single-digit range, with TV comp sales down in the low double-digit range, and units also down a corresponding amount.</p>
          <p>Softline have continued to comp in the double-digit range, with many department comps in the teens or higher.</p>
          <p>Fresh foods, meat, and produce finished high single digits for the month, and meats continued to be slightly inflationary. And even the produce was high single digits. Produce was slightly deflationary in terms of pricing in the month.</p>
          <p>Regarding inflation, while up to July and August, most commodities were not very inflationary year over year, a little bit in June and July, compared to a year ago. But in the past two months, we've seen some big increases on various items. Corn and wheat are up 43% and 37% respectively year over year. That, of course, down the food chain will affect your protein share, your beef, your pork, and your poultry. Hogs are up 69%, cattle up 16% so far. Sugar is up 52%, butter up 35%. The only main commodity that showed some negative deflation was cocoa, down about 9%.</p>
          <p>In talking to our buyers, their feeling is, is while these high levels of inflation should subside a bit, they're still expecting some inflationary pressures depending on the food items over the next several months, in part because of what I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>We've been asked often over the last few months how we as a company are approaching the holiday season merchandise-wise. The answer has been consistent, relatively positive and aggressive.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the line items on the income statement, I'll start with membership fees. Membership fees were up 9% or two basis points, up to 533 million or 2.26% of sales in the fourth quarter. That was a $42 million increase year over year. Again, a little of that increase in dollars was FX. It doesn't change the percentages because the percentages would impact &#x2013; the dollars would be impacted on all items including the denominator of sales. But on like FX, dollars in membership were up 7% or about $36 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong renewal rates, actually ticked up a little bit in the recent quarter, continued increased penetration in the $100 a year Executive Membership.</p>
          <p>Our new membership signups in Q4 were down 4% year over year in the quarter. That's after being up 2% in Q3 year over year. It's really not an issue given if you recall that we only opened two new units in the prior two fiscal quarters of 2010, so in Q2 and Q3. And more importantly, in Q4 last year we had huge membership signups at our four international Costco openings, three in July of last year in Asia and, one in each of Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, and our first Australia opening last August in Melbourne. If you take those four out of the equation completely, the fourth quarter new member signups instead of being new reported down 4% were actually up 8%.</p>
          <p>Overall fewer openings in fiscal 2010 impacted new signups year over year. But with an estimated 29 new locations planned for '11, a more than doubling of last year's expansion figure, we should see increased signups as we go through this year.</p>
          <p>Now as you know, we always start off with a budget that includes everything that we have planned for the year. Inevitably, there are several in the last one or two months of the fiscal year as we try to push as much as we can and get them over as quickly as we can. My guess is &#x2013; what gives me comfort is the 29 will probably be more comfortably in the mid-20s, but that's still quite a big difference from the 13 a year ago.</p>
          <p>In terms of members, number of members at Q4 end: Gold Star, 22.5 million, up from 22.2 at the end of the third quarter and up from 21.4 million at the end of last fiscal year. Primary Business, 5.8; it was also 5.8 at Q3, but rounded. It was right at 5.75 and up from 5.7 a year ago. Add-on, 3.3, consistent with Q3 end and actually down 100 from the 3.4 million at last fiscal year end. A lot of that has to do with many add-ons as they've opted to become Executive Members, basically get out from under the primary business cardholder and become their own independent member, which is a Gold Star member.</p>
          <p>All told, 31.6 million members &#x2013; member households at Q4 end compared to 31.3 million at Q3 end and 30.6 a year ago. Including spouse cards, 58 million at year end compared to 57.4 at Q3 end and 56 a year ago.</p>
          <p>At August 29, our fourth quarter and year end, paid Executive Memberships totaled 10.336 million in the quarter, a 16-week quarter increase of 427,000 or a 4% increase during the fourth quarter. That's about 27,000 a week increase. Executive Members represent a little over a third of our membership base and a little over two-thirds of our sales.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership renewal rates, they continued strong, up one to two-tenths of a percent in the past few months. If you look at our U.S. and Canada, because some of these other countries are so new, you always start with lower rates. Again, the number was up 0.2% to 87.7 in the fourth quarter from 87.5 in Q3.</p>
          <p>Going down the gross margin line, our gross margin for the fourth quarter was higher year over year by four basis points, 10.89 versus a 10.85. As I always ask you to do, to jot down some numbers, we'll do all four quarters of the fiscal year. So going across Q1, two, three, and four, those will be the four columns. The line items would be core merchandising. The second line item would be ancillary businesses. Third line item would be the 2% Reward, which as we increase penetration, that has a hit to margin. LIFO would be the fourth line item, and then total.</p>
          <p>Again going across, merchandising core in both Q1 and Q2 on a year-over-year basis, it represented plus 15 basis points, in Q3 down 10, and in Q4 up five; ancillary, minus 20 in Q1, plus 16 in Q2. A lot of that has to do with gasoline deflation turning to inflation in Q1 and Q2 on a year-over-year basis; in Q3, plus six basis points, and in Q4 plus eight. 2% Reward, minus three, minus one, minus three, and minus one; LIFO, minus one, minus four, minus four, and minus eight; and again, that has to do with no LIFO credits or charges this fiscal year compared to LIFO credits last year. And if you add them all up, in Q1 of fiscal 2010 on a year-over-year basis, our reported margin was down nine basis points; in Q2, up 26; in Q3, down 11; and in Q4, up four.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you a little color now that you have that chart in front of you. As was the case in the last fiscal quarter, and again this requires a little explanation. In the fourth quarter, our core merchandising gross margin shows here up five basis points year over year. And ancillary business gross margin, again gasoline being the biggest impact in this number, contributed plus eight basis points.</p>
          <p>First, I'll add that on a standalone basis, our gasoline gross margin in Q4 was up 25 basis points. But keep in mind it's still a very low margin business compared to the rest of the company and well in excess of 800 or 900 basis points in any quarter. Our gasoline business and its inflationary price trends during the fourth quarter this year impacted our total gross margin comparison. So again, that's why it was plus on that line, but it actually has a negative impact to the Q4 line &#x2013; or to the core. And I'll show you how that works.</p>
          <p>Sales penetration of our higher margin core business was down a little more than one percentage point in Q4 year over year. So whereas sales penetration of our ancillary business &#x2013; or gasoline sales were much lower margin business, was up about 1%. So while gross margins in every category of our core merchandise and food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods were each higher year over year in Q4 by an average in fact of 20 basis points, its aggregate lower sales penetration year over year caused it to have a slight positive impact; that's the five basis point you see in that column on our matrix.</p>
          <p>I might add in Q3, and I mention here that the core, standalone core merchandise gross margin was up 20 basis points year over year in the fourth quarter. In Q3 the core gross margin increased year over year by an average of 14 basis points, so a good trend so far in the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>The impact of growing of our Executive Member business, again the results of higher 2% Reward, which impacted the sales line, moved Q4 down by one basis point.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross margin outlook going forward, no major issues; margins are fine, and we'll see what goes on with LIFO credits and benefits. At this juncture, through the first month we're ever so slightly deflationary. But as a company, but as I mentioned, we're experiencing some inflation right now in some of these key commodity categories.</p>
          <p>Moving on to SG&amp;A, our SG&amp;A percentages Q4 over Q4 were lower or better by 12 basis points, coming in at a 10.17 compared to a 10.29 last year. Again, we'll ask you to jot down a few numbers, and why don't we do the same four quarters. Core operations would be the first line; Central, second line; stock compensation or equity compensation, the third line; quarterly adjustments, the fourth line; and then a total.</p>
          <p>Going across, core operations on a year-over-year basis in Q1 were higher or worse by 16, so I put a minus in front of that because it's worse; Q2, flat year over year; Q3, better or lower by 14 basis points; and then Q4 better or lower by nine basis points. Central, a minus three in Q1 or higher; a plus two in Q2; a plus four in Q3; and a minus one in Q4. Stock compensation minus three, plus one, plus five, and zero. And quarterly adjustments, plus 18, minus 12, plus 17, and plus four. All told, in Q1 SG&amp;A was higher year over year by four, so a minus four; in Q2, a minus nine; significantly better by 40 in Q3 again. A chunk of that is the adjustment column, the quarterly adjustment column; and plus 12 or better by 12 basis points in Q4.</p>
          <p>Now let's start with Q4 here. Operations were lower or better by plus nine year over year. A big component of this is due again to the gas price inflation, which again while it has &#x2013; gas has a much lower gross margin, it has a very low, close to 1% I think, SG&amp;A. So just like with gross margin percentage where it hurt, it correspondingly helped our SG&amp;A by seven basis points in Q4. So within that, plus 14, seven of that has to do with that.</p>
          <p>Our Central expense was higher year over year by one basis point. It's not a big issue. I think depreciation was a little higher year over year, but there were lots of little things that went plus and minus. Our stock compensation expense was up slightly in dollars year over year, but flat as a percent of sales given that Q4 sales were a little better.</p>
          <p>Q4 year-over-year percent in terms of U.S. healthcare costs were higher by 11 basis points. That's of course within the core. U.S. healthcare costs were up 11% in the quarter and 17% in the year. If you recall, in the first half of fiscal year 2010 and in fact in the second half of fiscal '09, we had not only healthcare inflation, which we've always experienced, but also the double whammy of lower units and less employee turnover, so less freebies. As we ramp up expansion over the next year, we should see some of that come back, not all of it but a little of it.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned earlier, our payroll percentage has improved nicely for us. Part of that is the attention we, like many companies out there, have spent during the last couple of years with a bad economy. I think we're all getting a little better; overall, pretty good SG&amp;A performance given current sales levels and increased benefits costs.</p>
          <p>In terms of factors that will impact our SG&amp;A experience in '11, again the main items of course are sales trends, healthcare costs, gasoline inflation and deflation, and of course, some one-off expense initiatives. There are lots of little things, but it seems to be working, and that's a good trend at least in the last few months.</p>
          <p>Next on the income statement, pre-opening expense, 12 million last year in the quarter, or five basis points, down &#x2013; improvement or lower by 3 million to 9 million in this year's fourth quarter, so a basis point better. We had roughly the same number of openings, six last year and one less this year, five. The bigger issue is that last year, as I mentioned, we had four international. Those units over there have significantly more pre-opening expense per location, so no real surprises here.</p>
          <p>Asset impairment, closing costs, last year we had a charge of 2.7, this year a charge of 3.3 million.</p>
          <p>All told, operating income in the fourth quarter was up 15% year over year, from 598 million last year to 689 million this year or a $91.4 million increase.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher year over year by $1.5 million, with Q4 coming in at 34.7 million of interest expense versus 33.3 a year ago. Nearly all of that reflects the interest expense on our $2 billion debt offering that we did in February of '07. Recall that 900 million of that is five-year paper which will be repaid in March of 2012. That will be nice given that the interest rate is north of 5%, which was the interest income rate at the time, but not anymore. And the remaining 1.1 million (sic) [billion] will have another five years, so it won't be until 2008 (sic) [2017].</p>
          <p>Interest income and other was quite a bit higher year over year by 10.3 million in the quarter, coming in at 29.6 million in the fourth quarter. Interest income was actually lower by $2 million. Again, we all know what has happened with interest rates and short-term interest rates; the bigger chunk of the delta, $10 million plus, a combination of higher earnings in Mexico and some FX gains. These FX gains relate to where our foreign countries are buying where they have in their respective country, foreign denominated equity payables based on open purchase orders for merchandise. I'll use Canada as an example where they're buying goods from UK or U.S. and require that. That goes plus and minus. It happened to be a decent plus this quarter.</p>
          <p>On to our tax rate, our company's reported tax rate this quarter came in at 36.1, a bit higher than last year's Q4 rate of 35.2. There are always some discrete items that go both ways, and that change of a few discrete items was the culprit here. Actually given increased foreign earnings, our increased, relative increase in foreign earnings relative to total earnings in some of these countries on average where corporate tax rates are a little lower than the U.S. rates. The underlying rate is actually a little lower. But there are always going to be some discrete items as well.</p>
          <p>Now for a quick rundown of other usual topics, I won't spend any time on the balance sheet since that was in the press release. But I will give you &#x2013; you're always calling to ask depreciation and amortization in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization was 246 million, and for the year 794 million.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet, which again was in the press release, strong debt-to-cap ratios, we have plenty of financial strength. Lots of cash, we're trying to spend some cash both on increased stock repurchases and ramp up and expansion over the next year. I'll talk about that in a minute.</p>
          <p>Our average inventory per warehouse was up 184,000 per warehouse to 10.4 million or about a 2% increase. So that helps our turnover given that sales increases were higher than that, and also helps our AP funding. Even though we take all terms and discounts and pay as early as possible based on those incentives, our reported AP ratio, accounts payable as a percent of inventories a year ago at the fourth quarter end was 101%. This year it was 105%.</p>
          <p>Now that in fairness includes non-merchandise payables like construction payables. But if you take that out, and do it, take accounts payable, merchandise accounts payable to merchandise, actual merchandise, the 84% at year end, a year ago at year end, up to 89%. So it's the same trend, up five percentage points, a nice showing there.</p>
          <p>Within the $184,000 increase, about a quarter of it, a little over a quarter of it was FX. Of the remaining part, food and sundries was up about 175,000. Hardlines was actually down about 115,000. And again, FX was the rest of it, good inventory showing. Our inventories came in clean at year end, and we feel good about going into the holiday season as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, we spent 411 million in the fourth quarter, and for the year, 1.055 billion. Our current estimate for '11, again given the dramatic increase in the level of new expansion, will be in the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range.</p>
          <p>Also, I want to mention our dividend. Earlier in May, we increased, as we have done in each of the last six years, each of the last six Mays, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.18 a share a year earlier to this past May $0.205 a share on a quarterly basis, so $0.82 on an annualized basis. That represents total cost to the company of about $360 million.</p>
          <p>Costco Online, as you know, in '09 compared to '08 it was down I think 5% or 6% in sales, still quite profitable. As you know, the cornerstone of our dot-com is limited items but big ticket items. Certainly big ticket discretionary items weren't helped in '09 opposed to late '08. And the sales in '10 versus '09 were back up to a little bit above the high water mark from the previous year. These were again were impacted in the past year given our big ticket discretionary items and the economy, but seem to be back on track with a plus sign in front of it.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion, in '09 as you recall we opened 16 net new units, including one in Mexico; in '10, 13 net new units. And in fiscal '11, again our current plan is 31 total new units, including two re-los, so 29 net. Those 29 include eight in Q1 and two in Q2 before calendar year end, and the rest in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Within the 29, there are 16 in the U.S. and 13 outside of the U.S., three in Canada, and then ten other international, so picking up our international plans. Again, if I was a betting person, as history has shown, the 29 probably is a solid mid-20s number, still a lot better than the 13 and 16 in the prior two years.</p>
          <p>In terms of common stock buybacks, since the beginning of our buybacks back in June of '05, through fiscal year end we have repurchased a total of 98.7 million shares at an average price of 54.39 a share or just under $5.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Total authorization, aggregate authorizations from our Board from that time until now was 6.8 billion. So we currently have a little more than &#x2013; right around 1.4 billion authorized. Now of that amount, 400 expires in mid-November of this year with the remaining 1 billion expiring in November late next year. My guess is, is that we will leave a little on the table from that remaining 400 million. It really doesn't matter. I think, as I've shared with many of you over the past &#x2013; on an ongoing basis, our Board has looked to have us, and with management here, to buy back on a generally regular basis with the exception of that year during the downturn in the economy and the concerns about liquidity of cash. We had plenty of cash but there was a concern about the liquidity of it. But I would assume that if and when we do repurchase and need more authorization, that will be easily forthcoming.</p>
          <p>As you know, in the third quarter was a ramp up to almost 2 billion shares or about $115 million. In the 16-week fourth quarter, we bought 7.8 million shares for 439 million. Again, long term we're most likely buyers and we'll continue to watch the market. I will say right now, we bought less in the last few weeks per share because what we have to do is a 10b-5 filing to be able to buy during blackout periods. Of course, this is our largest blackout period over the last several weeks, six or seven or so weeks, because of year-end earnings and sales releases. We have to put in place, if you will, a buying matrix prior to that. At the time we put that in place, the stock, I think, was in the mid-50s. And who would have thought it would get this high so quickly. And that has been a good thing and we'll readjust that going forward.</p>
          <p>Our supplemental information packet, has that gone out, Dave? That's also going out; so you see that on our website. It will go up by noon and will be posted on the Costco Investor Relations site later this morning.</p>
          <p>One last housekeeping note effective start of '11, fiscal '11, so August 30, we began consolidating results of operations of our Mexico joint venture. Historically, these operations were treated as an equity method investment. Thus we only reported our 50% share of the joint venture's net income within our non-operating other income line on our income statements.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of '11, we were required to adopt a new accounting standard, which makes it appropriate to fully consolidate Costco Mexico joint venture into our statements. In effect, it adds approximately 2% to 3% to top line sales, assets, and liabilities. 100% of the venture's financial statements are now included. It will now going forward be included in our P&amp;L and balance sheet. And then the 50% portion held by our joint venture partner and the earnings of that will be backed out at the bottom of our income statement to offset the fact that we only own 50% of it, such that there's no net effect to Costco's bottom line but just another little thing to confuse you over the next four fiscal quarters.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll open it for questions and answers, and I'll turn it over back to Ashley.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Just, Richard, it looks like you said, I just want to make sure I heard you right, that the core within the core was up 20. So that's relative to the plus 14...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...in the third quarter. Is that correct? Okay. Can you just walk through? You said that all four of the categories I think were up 20. Can you walk through each of them and give us a little bit of color, if possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were all, I think the lowest of them was a high single digit and the highest was high 20s, I believe. I don't have it right in front of me. But they were all pretty good &#x2013; or low 30s. They were all pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the SG&amp;A growth in the quarter, it was up in terms of dollars 6.5%, which was the lowest of the year. Do you think that's a pretty good proxy for us as we look forward over the next four quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, with the caveat that we don't provide guidance, so far so good, at least trend-wise. Certainly, there's a lot of focus on expenses around here, recognizing we don't do the simple things like just change benefits to the employees. And as you know, in March we looked at our top-of-scale increases for the upcoming three years. And even in the midst of a terrible economic downturn, we gave pretty good numbers out to our 90% of employees that are hourly in our company. So notwithstanding that, I think it has gotten a little better out there, and I think some of those things will continue. We also like a little sales increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then I think if I heard you correctly, you said that the average store in the U.S. does $137 million. I was wondering if you could go into the state of California, and particularly L.A. and San Diego, and give us a little bit of color on how productive those stores are. I know they're more productive. But I guess one, how much more productive are they, and then also how more profitable are they, and if you've got any sense for how much that hurt your earnings over the past few years given the softness in that state?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, what we call and we operate in our San Diego region includes San Diego, some cities east of that like El Centro and San Bernardino as well as Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. Now of course, Phoenix hasn't been so swell either. And the Southern California market, if the average is 137, my guess is, is we're in the mid 150s, maybe the high 150s. Bob and Jeff are sitting here saying the low 160s and recognizing we've got some 250s down there too.</p>
          <p>But certainly, as comps, even when we were &#x2013; two years ago when comps were healthy for the company, relatively speaking, those regions were always a little lower because they're more mature and we've done more cannibalizing. And so while they've shown &#x2013; particularly L.A. has shown some relative strength in the last couple months and quarters &#x2013; its relative strength. It went from low to slightly negative comps at its trough in the last year and a half to a very slightly positive. And clearly, zero to ones, zero to twos, even though it has a plus sign in front of it, it's tough to leverage those expenses. So again, it's improving but it has certainly been our toughest region from an operating leverage standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my last question is regards to the trend. It sounded as if the last week of September was a little bit softer. Was that true in California? And I guess can you explain away what happened in the MVM? It looks like the number of days were pretty consistent year over year and the timing was consistent, so if you could just explain that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The single biggest thing is while they were both MVMs, I believe it had more to do with the tail end of a year ago it was &#x2013; no, last year it was that week. Week five was the first week of a new MVM. This year in that corresponding week, it was the last week of an old MVM. Clearly, you get a lot more bang for your buck in the first week than your last week.</p>
          <p>And again, as we've said over the last several years, these things have become more important and good. And certainly, with the frequency increase and the fact that many of the items are what I'll call things for the house, both food and sundries and mid-priced non-foods items, et cetera, some of the big ticket discretionary items, they're important to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks so much. Richard, it has been quite some time since you've raised your membership fee. Outside of the economy at this point in the game, is there anything else that's holding you back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. But again, when asked the question, I remember posing it to Jim probably in mid-'09 for the first time, well before we would even consider something. But I said all things being equal, I think the factors that don't give us any concern about increasing it is our renewal rate strength and our member loyalty strength. And certainly, Executive Member helps that as well that loyalty.</p>
          <p>That being said, I think that all things being equal, we would wait a while, given the economy. Now, wait a while doesn't mean forever, but it also doesn't mean we have to do it the first day of whenever X is.</p>
          <p>And at this juncture, we don't feel any pressure to increase it. I think a few weeks ago, when one of you guys that's probably on the phone was talking to me on the phone and asked the question, I said if you're a betting person, at some point in the next couple or so years, yes. I don't know if it's nine months from now or seven months from now or 18 months from now. But if you looked over the course of the next few years, my guess is there's an increase.</p>
          <p>But right now, if the decision was today, we wouldn't do it today just because let's not do it in the face of the bad economy. But we certainly feel comfortable from a competitive standpoint and from a loyalty standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then turning our focus to real estate, will more of your new stores be outside of the U.S. going forward, or is there something unique about 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe this &#x2013; it's a big jump for us in one year. I don't think it keeps jumping, but it will keep going up, yes, overall.</p>
          <p>All you have to do is look at our segment analysis and we've had some good results, and recognizing these haven't happened over time. As I think Jim has said a couple times to some of you, every new country starts with a trail of tears. It takes five-plus years to get to a bottom line profitability in many of the countries. But then you go another five years out and some of these countries are doing very well.</p>
          <p>And we've certainly upped our commitment. If you go back a few years ago, I think using simple examples like Korea and Taiwan, at the time we had maybe four or five units in each. And today we have six and seven units respectively in those countries, in Taiwan and Korea.</p>
          <p>I think if you would go back to some of those charts, we said how many will we have 10 years hence? If you go back three or four years ago, that 10 years hence number was 15 for each country. I think our feeling now is 25-plus. Who knows where the actual number will be, but certainly we feel more confident.</p>
          <p>In Australia, the percentage increase will be huge because we have one unit. And our competitors, the two biggest retailers down there, we feel are fighting us at every juncture to slow down the process. But we'll get our second unit open &#x2013; first in Sydney, in the Sydney area &#x2013; this coming calendar year. And certainly we'll open more there.</p>
          <p>And as you know, Mike Sinegal, who opened and ran Japan, which is very successful and growing nicely, moved to Europe in the past year. My guess is we'll announce something over the next year. But again, it will take a few years to get something that's meaningful to our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that 10 years hence number in the U.S. kind of a 600 number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think right now we're at 425-ish in the U.S. in terms of number of warehouses, or a little higher. 437?</p>
          <p>I think over 10 years, that would be &#x2013; that's 17 a year. To get to 600, that would be like 16 or 17 a year in the next 10 years. That's not out of question. Again, in a year where we opened six or seven, it seems not plausible. But again, it will be a light number this year.</p>
          <p>My guess is, if I had to give an honest guess of what 10 years hence is, it's probably at least 550 and probably not more than 625.</p>
          <p>We just opened our eighth Business Center. We'll see how that continues to go. That can add a few extra a year. Not this year. Maybe one.</p>
          <p>So we'll see. But we feel that there are still plenty of opportunities. Keep in mind, as I mentioned in the release, it was 10 or so years ago we opened our first Chicago unit, although there are not a lot of barren Chicagos for us in the United States. But we just &#x2013; next month, we're opening &#x2013; or two months from now, we're opening our 15th, 16th, and 17th units in four successive days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then last topic. I think last year your e-commerce business was 1.6 billion. How should we think about that in terms of your focus and your investment, and where do you think that can go in terms of &#x2013; as a percentage of sales? Or just as a key focus in terms of future growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you and others on the phone, many of you have known us for a long time. Jim has stated often that he thinks, even when we were at 1 billion and arguably growing at 30% or 40% a year a few years ago, that this should be a $5 billion business down the road. Now I don't know if down the road is five years or 10 years, but it's going to keep growing.</p>
          <p>As you know, it's all about focus on merchandising. We're not going to tweet and we're not going to gift wrap, and there are some things we're not going to do.</p>
          <p>Certainly the last year and a half has been tempered with big ticket discretionary items. We're encouraged in what we've seen again in the last few months on some things.</p>
          <p>We're not going to go crazy on it. It's a nice, profitable business. It has some benefits to our warehouses well sometimes when some vendors will sell us there first, and then ultimately hopefully we can talk them into the rest of the company.</p>
          <p>So again, our initiatives will be I think methodical and continue to grow. But again, it's a nice chunk of business. But if I just put blinders on and looked at just bottom line excitement, I think the foreign expansion over the next few years, given its profitability, is probably more important in the next few years. Who knows where it goes from there?</p>
          <p>Certainly many of you &#x2013; and probably you're correct &#x2013; we've got a wealth of information and great opportunity to push e-commerce in the future, and we'll do it in a methodical way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thanks. Hey, Richard, two quick questions. Just one a follow-up on inflation versus deflation.</p>
          <p>I think you said produce was deflationary. Can you talk about why that was deflationary maybe a little bit more? And also what else is maybe deflationary? And maybe work into that how you're feeling about TVs and the outlook for the TV business for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just on the competitive environment, what you feel like you're seeing out there from Walmart. And also, I don't know if you guys have looked at or thought about what Target is launching with their REDcard I think in a week or two here with the 5% off for all the customers with REDcard, and what you think about that program competitively. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, when I talked to Jeff Lyons, who heads up all fresh foods &#x2013; and it's always entertaining to hear what's going on out there &#x2013; with produce, it's as much &#x2013; and produce and even some poultry and fish &#x2013; it's as much what's going on with hurricanes and tornadoes and heat and cold, and Russia deciding not to export wheat, and the impact that wheat skyrocketed. And the view is it skyrockets a lot more than it should have just based on that comment by Russia. What China does with consumption of nuts, where some nut prices have doubled and tripled in the last six to nine months.</p>
          <p>So there are a lot of things going on out there.</p>
          <p>Produce specifically, if you ask Jeff Lyons, it's more crop production and weather and rain and pestilence-driven than anything else. And not the economy. The economy might be a little like &#x2013; and again, if you look at nuts, I hear the biggest reason I hear from our buyers has to do with the ever-increasing rising middle class for limited resources, higher-end commodities like pistachios and pine nuts and things, which have skyrocketed. But again, those are small dollar amounts to the total company.</p>
          <p>In terms of TVs, for a number of months, starting probably in early to mid-calendar '09, again this had more &#x2013; I'm sorry, early calendar '10 &#x2013; it had more to do again with rising demand in countries like China. I think it was January or February was the first month ever that the Chinese consumer bought more TVs than the American consumer.</p>
          <p>That tended towards some modest inflation in a category that has always been deflationary, and extreme deflationary when the stuff hit the fan in late '08 in the economy. That has subsided and turned around. I think last month we actually had slight deflation for the first time in several months in the TVs. And pretty consistent with what our buyers have told us and what I had shared with many of you, as you've asked over the last many months.</p>
          <p>By the way, that lack of deflation and modest inflation, again partly because there was demand elsewhere in the world, that impacted us, as you know, in a bigger way because of the MVMs. We drive a lot of business. A year ago, on one SKU of a $1,000 SKU of a TV, over three weeks, we might sell $20 million to $30 million of that one item. There were not a lot of promotional $100, $200, $300 off on flat screens over the last several months. That's starting to turn more in November and December, not to where it was, but a lot better than it has been the last several months.</p>
          <p>As relates to the Target 5% card, we understand how affinity works. Certainly our Executive Member success. As I understand it, the 5% off is not only on the REDcard or the Target credit card but also on the debit card. I understand the credit a little better from the standpoint that there's income associated with APRs and late fees and carried balances and what have you. On the debit, that becomes a more expensive proposition. It must be working for them, because they're rolling it out.</p>
          <p>I think &#x2013; ultimately I can't answer it. They have to. How long will they do it? I assume they'll do it as long as it drives business in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Who does it impact most? It impacts their direct competitors, in my sense, first. Certainly other traditional discounters like Walmart and Kmart and the like. And perhaps some of the apparel discounters. It's not a positive. Everybody that incrementally goes in there one more time and buys anything, and also is a Costco member, may not buy something at Costco.</p>
          <p>We don't think it's a big impact to us, but it certainly doesn't have a plus sign in front of it. And we're watching it.</p>
          <p>I don't think you need to worry about us doing a 5% card. We've done quite well with our Executive Membership, and I think it will be interesting seeing what their direct competitors do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Richard, a couple questions. First, just trying to understand the impact of consolidating Mexico. You mentioned the 2% to 3% lift to sales in 2011. Should we think about membership fee income growth lifting at a similar rate, maybe 2% to 3% incrementally?</p>
          <p>And then how does Mexico compare to the rest of the business in terms of gross margin profile and operating margin profile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all, again, the bottom line doesn't change because instead of just adding half of Mexico's earnings to our interest income and other line, as we've done historically, we now put in the whole income statement and subtract half of their earnings on a new line down below. I forget what it is called &#x2013; non-controlling interest line, which is below pre-tax. It's pre-tax before that, and then that and then pre-tax. And &#x2013; it's after tax, I'm sorry. But again, it doesn't change our bottom line net income.</p>
          <p>When we get to the first quarter, I'm sure I'll add another line item to my matrix because it will &#x2013; what it will end up doing is you're adding 2% to 3% to the denominator. It's about a $2 billion business, expressed in dollars. It will wreak a few basis points of havoc with margin and SG&amp;A, but not much, because it's not that different than our current company.</p>
          <p>Overall it's more productive, but overall it's also a lot less volume per warehouse. The volume per warehouse is in the 60-plus range, not 130-plus range. But even at those volumes, given we have great wages relative to competitive down there, but a lower percent of sales than up here.</p>
          <p>Margins are comparable? Margins are comparable, SG&amp;A is a lot better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. I look forward to the new line items on the next call. When we think about the U.S. healthcare costs, I think you said that it was up 17% in 2010, with it being up about 11% in the fourth quarter. Any initial thoughts on where that's going be in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know completely. There are a few small initiatives that we can do.</p>
          <p>Some initiatives that we want to do, we can't do right now because of the new federal legislation that when you start making some changes, certain things that are going to impact healthcare for all companies in the U.S. over the next five or six years under the new federal healthcare, you'll lose the ability to bring those in over the next five years. And I think that was a way to guarantee that companies don't change things, recognizing ours are very generous to start with. So I think less impactful than to other companies over the five years.</p>
          <p>I think the biggest thing that will help us a little, or mitigate it, that hurt us over the fourth quarter starting in Q3 '09 through Q2 of '10, was the fact that, if you go back to '08 or the beginning of '09, about 82% of our U.S. employees were covered with healthcare. They were eligible and covered. And the only reason the other 18 or so percent weren't is because they were new employees, anywhere from zero to six months. And if you're a part time, part time hourly, it takes six months to become eligible; full time hourly, three months.</p>
          <p>The fact that we went from 25 or 26 units a year down to 16 in '09 and 13 in '10, and the fact that in a bad economy, even existing employees are reducing their relative turnover, because nobody's leaving a job, meant that a higher percentage are eligible. In one year, we went from 82% to 91% or 92% participating in our eligibility plans.</p>
          <p>So on top of what I'll call 10%-ish inflation, you add another 10-ish percentage of employees in the healthcare plan. That is not going to go back to 82 in a year, but it should be a mitigating force to whatever normal inflation is.</p>
          <p>And so if I had to guess, it's high single digit, maybe a little higher. We'll have to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, you had a nice core gross margin increase in the fourth quarter. You talked about the heightened level of inflation that's starting to come through the business in the next few months. How should we think about the inflation impacting the outlook for core gross margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it has a big impact. We've always said that when prices are increasing, we want to be the last to raise it. But we're also not &#x2013; we're not going to get hurt by it except for that one time in late '08.</p>
          <p>But a little inflation I think will be helpful. And again, those numbers that I gave out on those slides, the commodities are huge. They'll be coming back &#x2013; the feeling is they'll come back down a little bit, but it will still be pretty big. But those impact many items, but not every item.</p>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; and of course private label has a deflationary net impact. And one of the reasons that private label is improving not only here but at other food retailers is because people are looking to save some money.</p>
          <p>So I think overall, as I've said many times, a little inflation net will be okay. I don't think we get hurt a little bit by holding on to lower prices longer than we have excess inventory in those categories we buy in.</p>
          <p>Usually when there's a price increase announcement on a consumer brand, the manufacturer will let us and other big retailers or other retailers buy one, two, six weeks at the prior price. And so we'll hold our price as long as we can.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is actually Joe Parkhill in for Mark. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your September U.S. comp versus August. I know you mentioned there's a difference in timing in the MVM. Is there anything else that changed between the two months as far as categories go or perhaps regional perspective in the deceleration of the comp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a lot. And I'm not trying to imply that the five &#x2013; it's broad based. My guess is that the five was certainly stronger than the twos and threes we enjoyed in the few months prior to that.</p>
          <p>Was the five a slightly less strong five or rounded down to four? I don't know right in front of me. But arguably, going from a five to a two, that's three percentage points. Maybe there's a percentage point or so of delta in those that &#x2013; maybe half of it's &#x2013; a little piece of it's rounding and half of it's real, and the other piece is not.</p>
          <p>It's not dramatic. I'm certainly not trying to imply that it was all timing and 115 degrees in L.A. It's not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the problem is, again, we're not &#x2013; we of course don't sit around and try to be economists and say it was because of labor statistics or housing starts. Generally, we feel good based on how last week was, or feel bad based on how last week was.</p>
          <p>But we know that week to week, it's more volatile than it used to be. I don't think we've changed &#x2013; I know we haven't changed our view about how we feel about &#x2013; in terms of seasonal stuff going into Christmas, whether it's original trim-a-tree and wrapping paper and some toys, those have generally been pretty good.</p>
          <p>And as you may know that during &#x2013; earlier in the year, with things like patio furniture in January through April, we were scrounging for stuff a little earlier. Now some of that arguably is pent-up demand. But at least for the seasonal stuff, we feel pretty good about it so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the international comp, the comp seems to accelerate between August and September. Is the inclusion of Mexico accretive to the total comp, or is there any other change in the comp trends across different countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Mexico &#x2013; first of all, for September, no, Mexico was really a non-issue. It's about the same.</p>
          <p>Asia is very strong. The UK is a little weak. And Canada actually has been &#x2013; Canada is a 70-plus unit, $12 billion division &#x2013; country that is as old and predictable as the U.S. The economy up there has been very robust the last two years. They didn't have the banking and the financial markets issues that the U.S. had, other than some carryover from the U.S., but nothing like the U.S. And natural resource benefited.</p>
          <p>And so we have underlying comps in Canada over the last two years, probably averaging above five. I mean six or seven. So it has been really fun up there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I also have a question on international. And I know we'll get the details with the 10-K, but I was hoping you could provide perspective on the year-to-year margin improvement in fiscal '10 for the U.S. and the non-U.S. businesses. And then since you're getting very good margins outside the U.S. now, I was wondering if you think there will be a long-term margin lift at Costco as international grows faster than the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then looking at the international business, do you think we're at a mature level on profitability? Or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was that? I'm sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are we at a mature level on margins? Can that go higher or as you add more units, does that cause that to be flatter from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I think internationally, our margins are quite strong. If anything, you don't want them to get a lot stronger because Jim will say they're too strong.</p>
          <p>I think we feel very good about where we are internationally and in Canada, frankly.</p>
          <p>Really, if you look at it, the U.S. has been the greatest challenge over the last couple years, in part because that's where some cannibalization occurred, in part because of places like Phoenix. These higher sales volume places like Phoenix, L.A., San Diego that have had the weakest relative comps and so the toughest expense with equal higher healthcare costs. And so that has been probably more of a challenge in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Again, I am cautiously optimistic that the focus &#x2013; we said it for 26 years. We're doing more about it in the last 18 months, as all companies are. The focus is on expenses. And we're not going to take the easy way out and just not give a big, a smaller &#x2013; we're not going to give a lesser increase to the top of the scale hourly. We're very proud of the fact that we did that. We're not going to take a piece of the healthcare benefit down to try to mitigate costs. We are doing a few things to manage that a little better. But what it comes down to is what things &#x2013; and again, 90% of everything or 90 or more percent of everything is in the warehouse. What can we stop doing that we were doing well but we shouldn't be doing?</p>
          <p>And I think that the ongoing commitment and reality of sustainability helps. As I've said before, sustainability rhymes with profitability. It's not just helping margins a little bit, but when you've got &#x2013; when you're moving tens of thousands of pallets on a given item in some cases, fewer pallets through the warehouse, it's labor in the warehouse.</p>
          <p>So we're focusing on &#x2013; and I'm not trying to be coy, but there are a lot of little things that are helping us right now, and I think that will continue. And boy, would it be nice to have a little more sales to go with it because that would really improve it. I think we've done pretty well. And one of the reasons in the call I talked about payroll dollar increases being less than sales dollar increases, that's a relative improvement for us over the last since comps have fallen a year and a half ago.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just, Richard, following up on your last point recognizing, as you said, there are a lot of SG&amp;A warehouse expense initiatives that have been working as of late, if you could give us a little bit more examples? Or perhaps if you were to harness all these little things in aggregate, what sort of opportunity that could present when you've summed them up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to do that because it's a slippery slope. And again, I'm not trying to be coy. We're starting to see some of the benefits of some of that stuff. Again, we can do a couple of the easy things that would equal it this quickly. Actually, some of the things that we're doing are working and will continue to work. And I hope that each of the next couple of quarters will show that progress, but I can't really give you a number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as long as it exists. On the holiday, when you described holiday, you used the words positive and aggressive, and I was just wondering. Maybe you could explain what you meant by that. Is that inventory? Is that pricing? What does that mean heading into the holiday, positive and aggressive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I meant it in one way, inventory. We feel good about the stuff we're getting in the door. And we feel good about selling through without risk of big markdowns. We've had good sell-through on some seasonal stuff. Even &#x2013; again, I know everybody wanted to see a little higher number on comps in September. The reality is, is that a little of it is MVM timing related. A little bit is other excuses. At the end of the day, it was a little worse than &#x2013; it wasn't as good as August, but it really hasn't changed our view. And frankly, it hasn't changed our success with some of the seasonal items. That actually has been pretty good. So I think we feel &#x2013; and the customer is coming in.</p>
          <p>So it doesn't help when televisions, which are major, what I call or we call majors, televisions being by far the largest component of majors, which is 6% of our company sales, is down 10% instead of being up 4% or 5%. So all these things &#x2013; that impacts you a little bit. But we feel very good about apparel. We feel good. Jewelry has been a surprise, recognizing it was down a year ago but has been a pleasant surprise in just the last couple of months; small category, but nonetheless. There haven't been any great exciting things in electronic games in the last year or two in terms of new consoles, so that tempers it a little bit. I'm just shooting from the hip here with things. The core stuff is doing great; fresh foods, small and medium priced non-food items.</p>
          <p>We were with a group a week or so ago talking with Dennis Knapp, our head of non-foods. In the last couple of months we're seeing 10% and 20% comps, which even on a combining these comps with the year-ago comps over a two-year period, we're above the high water mark nicely in some of these categories. So it's not all bad out there. Hopefully we'll see that one single number improve a little next month. But we'll have to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just following up as far as being a little bit more aggressive on the inventory front, any specific categories that there are some investments being made? And how we should think about as discretionary seems to be having some signs of life, perhaps positive mix shift as related to margins heading into the holiday season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm less thoughtful or concerned about margins. It's really across the board. Majors, domestics, apparel, we've got some great things in apparel, whether it's outerwear or &#x2013; which arguably outerwear was weak in Los Angeles when it was 112, but actually it wasn't. I stand corrected. Dennis last week told us that was one surprising with the heat down there. Partly it's availability of some products.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just lastly, recognizing it has been a tough backdrop, and I know you don't provide guidance, but when we think about heading into 2011 and you think about the tailwinds, headwinds that you've seen until now and what you're seeing ahead of you as it relates to sales, expense opportunity, maybe shed light in terms of how you think about where we are in terms of more tailwinds and headwinds into 2011 and where you think the sources of opportunities are on the line items as we think about next year. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think overall we feel pretty good, not knowing what happens tomorrow. I mean it's &#x2013; again I know you're trying to get more out of me here. But I think a comment at this time...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...about aggressive going merchandise-wise into the holiday season makes me feel good. I'm still not thrilled about healthcare expenses pending legislative changes that will impact everybody in the next few years. But the double whammy of reduced openings and more people in the plan percentage-wise, that will subside, mitigate that a little. Expansion I think is a positive, particularly international expansion.</p>
          <p>And as sure as Jim was sitting here talking to you guys and you ask about margins, he says guys, we're not going to go crazy, but margins are fine. And I think that's a good way to look at it. Despite everything that everybody is doing out there, our view is we're still the toughest and we've got room there. And we've been smart about how we can improve margins without doing the wrong things.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that over the last eight, nine years since the introduction of the Executive Member, we've hit the reported margin line by about 105 or so basis points. And margins are okay; so that was offset with something, notwithstanding the fact we're constantly being the most competitive out there in our view. So we feel pretty positive. But I don't know; there are different levels of viewpoint out there. But over here, I think we feel pretty good going into '11. Again, I can't quantify it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. It's Dan Binder; just wanted to touch on the consumer electronics business a little bit more. I know you've said TVs continue to be soft in September, but you also mentioned that you thought the &#x2013; it sounded like the vendor sponsorship might get better in November and December. I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on what you're expecting in terms of some of the increase in promoted items in the mailers versus what we've seen in recent months. And then also I was wondering if you could comment on your computer business in September also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if we look forward, and I'm sorry, the first part of that question? Somebody was telling me something here, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was just trying to understand, when you talked, you mentioned that TVs are still soft in September, but you thought it could change in November and December, it sounded like it was tied to vendor sponsorship. And I was just curious what kind of improvement we were going to see in items promoted in the mailers. Is that going to be a meaningful increase over what we've seen recently, and if you can quantify it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our TVs, our units in September were down in the low double digits, and dollars were down in the low double digits. In talking to buyers, the expectations for November and December are they will be up in the low single digits, just i.e., better, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
          <p>In terms of computers, dollars were down a like amount, low double digits. And I think there was &#x2013; I'm not sure. In my notes here I don't have anything about inflation or deflationary. We tend to have &#x2013; as prices in computers keep going down, we tend to add more things to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Some are arguing that the iPad is cannibalizing computer sales to some extent. I just meant it's cannibalizing discretionary dollars that the consumer has to spend. Do you anticipate getting an iPad at some point soon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't anticipate getting it between now and Christmas. Who knows what the future holds? At this point, we don't have it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly in terms of the &#x2013; I don't know if this falls within guidance or not. But from the standpoint that you have some understanding of what your expenses look like on healthcare, what are you thinking the leverage point is on comps as we head into the new year? Is it still 4% or 5% or closer to three, or any color you can give us on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We know as a starting point Q4 had leverage, positive leverage. I think we're only one month into &#x2013; one four-week period in terms of our own P&amp;L into this fiscal year. We still showed a little bit of leverage with a little lower comp, so that's encouraging. But I can't quantify it exactly. It's harder than it ever was. I think whatever those leverage points were two years ago, they're lower today because we've gotten a little better, but probably not as low as others out there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. I think if you look at the core, core merchandise margins up 20; that's the best performance in a while. Can you give us any more insights? It sounded like it was across the board, but what drove that? And I know you've added or are adding a pretty good little bit of private label this year in terms of the number of SKUs. How much of an impact was that, and what are you seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a little bit of the impact. I think it's all of the above. It's that.  We've talked over the last few years about margin initiatives on some items flowing through, some items flowing through the depots. It really is all of the above, the strength of fresh foods, which is on average a higher margin &#x2013; at the higher end of our range of margin acceptability. And so again, I think all those things have helped us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard, just a quick one. On the inventory buys into holiday, I think you've already mentioned that your expectations for TVs are looking up. But otherwise, are there any changes in the way you're allocating those dollars? If you could just speak generally across categories, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think relatively speaking, some of those mid-priced, non-foods categories, we have gotten more aggressive because our numbers in the last several months have continued to go up. I think it was even, if we go back six months ago, I don't have the numbers in front of me. But if I go back six months ago, some of those same categories were showing 10s and 15s in comps. And more lately, they're showing 10s to 25s. And so we probably got a little more aggressive on that. Domestics, apparel, jewelry, again the last couple months have been a little better; so we've turned that corner, I think. And clearly seasonal, we've ramped up from a year ago, trim-a-home, trees, gift items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you've got the flexibility that you can step up just on trends you're seeing in the most recent months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My guess is we have more flexibility than others based on limited SKUs. Again, structurally, and I've always said this. Even in things that are truly seasonal and truly fashionable like apparel, we're into fashion basics. And so for us, fancy means a different design of a crewneck sweater or a different color of &#x2013; a slightly different normal color of a dress shirt, nothing too fancy. The same thing goes with housewares and things. And our view also is, is our true seasonal stuff we're in new season early and out early so we always have a little bit of ability to be more aggressive structurally because we don't have the risk of giant markdowns in our view relative to others, other traditional retailers in those categories.</p>
          <p>Again, I think all those things help us, and certainly the confidence of the fact that customers are coming in more frequently and continue to do so and continue to renew more loyally, more regularly, all those things give us confidence too. It's not fair sometimes where we have less risky items, even in risky categories, relative to traditional retailers. And if we make a mistake, it's usually not giant markdowns. One time we got hammered a little bit with extra markdowns was in late '08 where &#x2013; in June &#x2013; July of '08 we're committing to patio furniture coming in, in January through March of '09. Certainly then something bad happened in October &#x2013; November of '08; so for us even then it wasn't giant. It was a small category with big markdowns. So maybe it was &#x2013; I don't have the number in front of me, it was an extra 10 or 15 million in markdowns, a couple cents, yes, but not the end of the world. So I think those things give us the ability to be more aggressive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, guys, really two questions. It sounds like the payroll growth, just 3% in the U.S., it's an impressive number. I'm just curious. Do we expect that to just accelerate a bit as the store growth accelerates, or can you actually keep it at that level? And then I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It certainly will grow as we grow the locations, and certainly not every location starts off at the average. But first of all, a lot of that growth, let's say take growth in Asia, or the payroll percentages are a little lower there than here, so that mitigates it a little bit. Clearly if you add people &#x2013; if you add new locations in new markets where you're hiring new employees, they're all starting &#x2013; generally the vast majority of them are starting at the bottom of the scale. And it takes four or four and a half years to get to the top of scale for full-timers and six to seven years for part-timers. And of course then you have turnover on top of that that helps you in terms of just average payroll dollars. So I think at the end of the day, yes, you don't keep it at that low percentage, but it doesn't grow faster. There's nothing about opening a bunch of new units that causes it to go up higher, at a higher rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then second is you led off I think the call by mentioning that benefits were up 14% and healthcare was up 11. Is the healthcare in the benefits number or is that a separate number and just explains that workers comp and what's actually in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Healthcare is the biggest chunk. I believe a piece of it was also with benefits &#x2013; as you're saying this, I'm not knowing why. I should have mentioned it back then too. It was this past year that we had a change in floaters I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, Dan. Dan is somebody here in my office. One of the reasons that total benefits costs increased 14% and healthcare costs within that, which is the biggest component increased 11. There was the floater and holiday change that added to benefits, which is really not &#x2013; I should have taken that out. So my guess is the 14 and the 11 is not as different as it appears. I'll bet you that's the biggest chunk of that delta.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And now you run it back going forward, great. Now my last question was on the buyback, and clearly you've ramped that up. But at the same time, the share count is steady, and I know you've got your convertible and options, et cetera. Could you help us out in terms of what sort of buyback you think we need to commit from a capital standpoint to maintain the share count and really how much the shares can fall if we keep buying back at 1 billion plus a year rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you just took $1 billion, as an example, times 63 &#x2013; 69, which is on my screen right now, that's 15.5 million shares. You'll reduce share count. Keep in mind, Q4 was a big relative annualized ramp-up compared to Q3. And of course compared to Q2, we only had one week of purchases at the very end of Q2, so a dramatic increase. But on average if it's a 16-week quarter, if you bought back every week you only had half of that impact in the quarter and an eighth of that impact to the whole year.</p>
          <p>So on an annualized basis for the year, you had very little net increase relative to the aggregate number of shares because so much of it was &#x2013; well, almost all of it was skewed in the second half of the year, and probably 70% of it was skewed into the fourth quarter of the year. And so I think on a more regular basis using your $1 billion number as probably a decent guesstimate, whether it's lower or higher in '11, we'll see. But using that number, right now, on an annual basis, what are we adding, Bob, to our share count, maybe four, a little under 4 million. And as the stock goes up there's a little dilution in what is a continually declining number of remaining in-the-money stock options that is a little additive as the stock went up.</p>
          <p>My guess is, is that something close to that 4 million a year is the net increase from equity compensation. And you're probably talking using the $1 billion example in today's stock price, you're talking a $10 million plus reduction in average shares. Once you get through a cycle of a year of buying, because during the year &#x2013; it's like if you bought $1 billion on average equally during the course of the year, it only leaves $0.5 billion of reduction in the number of shares.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Richard, back to the holidays and talking about being more aggressive on inventories, how about pricing? How are you guys looking at a particular category or item? If you could sell something for at a great value at $100 or $110 with an extra feature, I'm just making this example up. Are you leaning towards the higher or the lower price point in that mid-value discretionary range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm always looking from the higher; the more features and more value. Once you then have the item, you try to figure out &#x2013; I think what will impact margins more is going be once we have the item, which is the most we think we can put into an item in terms of quality and gadgetry and quantity and everything else and quality, we then get to a price point. Now what will happen inevitably there will be something in your example even that let's say the full price point is 105. We're not going to do 104.99; we're going to do 99.99. That tends generally tends to hurt you a little bit. But overall we're trading the customer up, not down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's &#x2013; so the economy notwithstanding, it's Costco's merchandising as usual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Even at the trough of the economy a year ago when big ticket discretionary items were weakest, we really didn't shy away. Let's take something in the summer of '09, furniture: chest of drawers, bedroom sets, dining room tables. We actually &#x2013; and again, if you heard Dennis Knapp in non-foods, and Craig, who was head of merchandising at the time and now President, and Jim, they were talking more about guys, it's the items you have. Get the right items. And we actually did, even at the trough of the economy on furniture, we were a little conservative but we did pretty well. And of course the same thing with patio furniture this fall; we did a little better than we expected. So I think we're not shying away from a lot of big ticket items.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we understand that $30 to $70 items for the home, whether it's domestics, housewares, small electrics, are in. And whether it's a doormat or new dinnerware, those things are doing pretty well for us.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Turning to gasoline, Richard, what were gasoline sales last year? And how are you feeling about the profitability of that category into fiscal '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chuck, I don't have the exact number, roughly about $6 billion. Gas, if I had to say anything about the gas business, it has been ever increasing profitable in terms of dollars. And even from the beginning of time while there have been quarters where we make money and quarters when we lose money on a full P&amp;L basis, the total on any rolling 12-month period since the gasoline inception were profitable. And fiscal '10 was our most profitable year, and fiscal '09 was the most profitable the year before that. It causes heartburn occasionally.</p>
          <p>The other thing I'll say about the gas business is that relatively speaking, the level of a good month &#x2013; a good week and a bad week in terms of P&amp;L is not as extreme. A bad week a couple years ago used to mean 3 million of loss; a good week, five or six. A bad week today is less than 3 million and a good week is 10. There aren't many of those, by the way. So it's a little less volatile and a little more positive. But nonetheless, it requires a thick stomach lining. But again, beyond that, so: A), it's a pretty good business for us. B), it drives your percentages a little wacko. But B), it drives people into the parking lots. And we've seen that time and again, particularly when gas spikes and local news stations talk about it, we get lots of free press.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales, by the way, sales for '10 were 6.2 billion compared to sales of just under 5 billion the year before; and in '08, 6.8 billion but that's all pricing. Pricing skyrocketed in '08, fell some in '09, came up a little in '10.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question was on traffic. It has been consistently very strong. Is it possible to segment out how much of the increase is reflective of taking share from club competitors or groceries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quantitatively, no. My guess is more of it comes from non-warehouse clubs other than when we go into a market that was entered earlier by a competitor warehouse club like the Midwest. Certainly I think as we entered markets where somebody else had a stronger presence than we have currently going in, that helps us a little bit or vice-versa.</p>
          <p>I think probably the biggest thing that has helped us in the last two years is when the economy really hit the fan and people were not eating out as much. I'm not just talking about the fancy business steak houses, I'm talking about the reasonably priced &#x2013; the family of four or five that was going out four nights a week to eat dinner for $80 or $90. As that got hurt, who got helped? The supermarkets and Costco.</p>
          <p>And again, I've said before, as the economy was heading south very fast in late '08 and early '09, we really didn't know. Was this going to be a help or hurt to us from the standpoint of frequency because are people less likely to schlep an extra five miles? Are they less likely to go to a place where they love but they know they're going to spend more than they want to? We found out the answer and thankfully it was yes, they are going to go there. And yes they will temper their purchases of big ticket items for a while. But at the same token, they are coming in. They are buying more food. And as long as they're coming in, they're buying something incrementally. And maybe it's something that's $30 and $40, not $500, but they're doing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then could you also elaborate a little bit more on what you're doing specifically in the merchandise categories within softlines to continue to drive such strong comps? You mentioned also increasing inventory buys in apparel for holidays. Is that increasing private label? Are you looking at increasing more branded fashion basics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really an item business. Within apparel, it's certainly &#x2013; we had a big increase last year because as late '08 hit, there were lots of high end brands. For the most part, we maintained good relationships with those new vendors that had sold us directly for the first time. But incrementally there's not a lot of new. But we are also more aggressive on what we buy.</p>
          <p>This is a small number to our company, but there's an item for kids. And it's an item that &#x2013; I'm not trying to be cute, but I haven't got permission to tell the specifics of it. But if you think about &#x2013; this goes back a couple months ago as we were looking at the seasonal apparel items or not even seasonal but just kids clothes for back-to-school. And there were items that retail for $20 to $35 in traditional retail stores, branded well known items, that we're making commitments on single items of six and seven &#x2013; or 400,000 to 600,000 units of an item where we're going be instead of 29.99 or 34.99, we're going to be at 14.99 and make a full margin. So it's not just the availability of a new branded golf shirt. It's a lot of the branded basics that people are coming in more frequently and they're buying that stuff.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks, guys. I guess I'm the lucky one, so a quick question on ticket. It seems like the trend has been a bit stronger. And I guess we're just wondering if there's anything in particular that's giving you confidence that it will continue to remain strong. It seems like pricing is still a challenge and you don't want to pass on too much, so anything there that you can talk about, Richard?</p>

          <p>It's a confidence level. It has to do, again, starting with structural things like in our business, we can afford to go more aggressive than our traditional retail counterparts on many of the discretionary items. The fact that when something is weak out there, we can buy a lot of it, and those manufacturers take notice of us.</p>
          <p>I think on the fresh foods side, it has been clearly an ongoing, continuing strength of ours. Both of our direct competitors, Sam's and BJ's, I believe, have reduced their commitment to certain bigger ticket, non-food categories, as they've stated, in the last year. That helps a little, not a lot. But all of the above gets back to &#x2013; I don't think there's any specific area. The good news about us is that our $76 billion or whatever is 30 or 35 different sub-categories, from mayonnaise to tires to clothing. Even when something is bad, we're not getting hurt too bad as a company. And when something's good it's helping us, but not like the whole business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and then just one quick follow-up on the stores. Any change in the type of stores you're opening? I know in the past, you talked about trying some mall-based stores. Should we see more of those this year? Should we see more urban stores? Any change in size, just especially given that you're going to open 29 this year?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Urban is probably not the best word to use. In terms of mall stores, I think we're up to like 10 or 12 of them. I know there's probably five or six that have been announced over the next 12 to 18 months. That has more to do, when the economy got hammered, and if you think about a traditional mall which had four anchors, two department stores and in many cases now are owned by the same parent, and a Sears and JCPenney. And in some cases one of those two have finished their lease and closed. Not a lot of that, but there has been a little of that too. And needless to say, malls have struggled. And so we tend to be the one new thing that we can bring to that parking lot that are high-end destination shoppers. And so again, it's not earth changing in terms of the numbers, as a percentage of our total units, but it's a positive.</p>
          <p>In terms of footprint, because certainly what we do in places like Korea and Taiwan and Japan are a lot different than what we do in the U.S. Several of those units are $50 million-plus capital requirements rather than 30-plus. And it has to do more with the fact that it's a much smaller footprint. And at 140,000 to 150,000 feet of retail might be spread 70,000 on each of two floors with three or floors of parking above and below it. But that being said, Jim and Jeff Brotman, and Jeff of course runs real estate here, our co-founder and Chairman. But Jim and Jeff are constantly telling our real estate people, don't bring me a double-decker parking lot in Atlanta or whatever because it is more expensive and it's more operating expensive, and let's be disciplined about it.</p>
          <p>So I think it's less about &#x2013; in terms of size of units in general, I think our prototype still is in that 140 acre range. We've done a few 160s. And we're also, Jim is making them look. Jim and Craig are making everybody look at, in some markets, 140s. We don't have to go crazy sometimes. So there's no big pendulum shift, though, here.</p>

          <p>Thank you, everyone. We're in budget meetings most of the day, which just coincides with every four weeks we have a two-day budget meeting, so Jeff and I and Bob will be in that. We'll take a break every hour, hour and a half to hear a few calls, but today it will be a lot more returning calls tomorrow. Thank you very much.</p>
