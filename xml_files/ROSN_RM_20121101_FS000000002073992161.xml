          <p>Good day and welcome to the Rosneft Third Quarter 2012 IFRS Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dmitry Avdeev, Vice President for Finance and Economics. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the call. I'm very glad to be here with you today to discuss Rosneft's results and what we believe has been a good third quarter.</p>
          <p>First of all, I'd like to draw your attention to the positive oil and gas production trends which have increased for the quarter in line with the interim guidance. Crude oil production volumes for the first nine months of the year have increased by 2.1% year-on-year, owing to production growth at Vankor and Verkhnechonskneftegaz fields and steady volumes in Western Siberia.</p>
          <p>Production at Vankor has increased by 14%, reaching 352,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. Based on strong operational performance for the first nine months of year, we are maintaining our crude oil growth forecast for 2012 at 2% and forecast continued growth of 1% to 2% for 2013.</p>
          <p>Gas production is up sharply, 33% for the quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of ITERA as well as our increased output and utilization of associated gas. With regards to future gas <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:45) cubic meters by 2016 included ITERA's volumes.</p>
          <p>Combined hydrocarbons production is up 4.1% for the quarter and we are now forecasting combined hydrocarbons production growth of 6% to 8% for 2013.</p>
          <p>Good cost performance remained a positive factor for upstream in third quarter. Average leasing cost for the nine months are down in real terms and 2% down in nominal terms quarter-on-quarter despite high utility costs and higher transportation costs.  Upstream CapEx for the quarter has remained level.</p>
          <p>In the downstream, petroleum products output has increased 13% from 13.7 million tonnes in the second quarter to 15.4 million tonnes in the third quarter. This in part reflects the completion of scheduled maintenance works at several refineries in Russia and in Germany.</p>
          <p>Retail product sales have increased by 4.2% in the nine months year-on-year, reflecting both Rosneft's strong market position as well as Russia's market dynamics as a growth market for refined products.</p>
          <p>For the nine months period year-on-year, refining OpEx increased on a per barrel basis, reflecting the increased use of additives required to produce higher specification products. However, as we told you at the second quarter results call, refining OpEx was significantly lower due to completion of planned maintenance.</p>
          <p>Overall financial performance has been strong in the third quarter. In a macroeconomic environment of stable oil prices, our revenues in rubles is up nearly 12% quarter-on-quarter and 16% for the first nine months.</p>
          <p>Earnings in the third quarter benefited from a favorable tax timing effect associated with extra duties and mineral extraction tax. So earnings for the nine months year-on-year reflect the expiry of the energy exemption and extra duty reductions that led previously to very strong profitability at Vankor.</p>
          <p>Our strong underlying profitability combined with disciplined approach to working capital resulted in strong operating cash flow in the third quarter of RUB 160 billion. Rosneft generated free cash flow of RUB 53 billion in the same quarter.</p>
          <p>CapEx in the third quarter was lower quarter-on-quarter, which is due to completion of certain refinery construction works ahead of plan in the second quarter. And our 2013 CapEx will be broadly in line with this year in real terms. We expect our downstream CapEx to slightly increase as a proportion of total CapEx from roughly a third to approximately 35% to 37% of the total.</p>
          <p>Also of note for the third quarter was the board has approved an additional dividend of RUB 4.08 per share, bringing our total dividend payout to 25% of 2011 IFRS net profit.</p>
          <p>With allowance for dividend payments, the company reduced net debt from RUB 658 billion to RUB 625 billion during the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, and we're now ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will pause for just a moment to allow everyone to signal. We will now take our first question from Ron Smith of Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening. Thank you very much for the call. Nice set of results from the quarter. My question actually goes to your statements about the cost gains, how your lifting costs are actually down both in real and nominal terms on quarter-on-quarter basis. If you could give us a little bit of an idea where you're gaining the efficiencies and how sustainable cost gains, especially versus inflation that will be possible in the coming quarters, and in particular, do you see any chance of lowering that as part of the presumed merger with TNK-BP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the main reason for the reduction in operating expenses in the third quarter was the improved procurement, as well as the absolute growth in production volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] (07:27-07:29).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Could you repeat your second question, please, on TNK-BP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just curious if &#x2013; what the scope is in your plans for reducing especially lifting costs and other operating costs upon the merger with TNK-BP. Are there any particular examples you can give us on how operating costs could come down? I know you've spoken some about how transport cost could be optimized, but I'm kind of curious to at the wellhead and at the &#x2013; in the operating level in the refineries, if there's some scope for efficiencies to be gained there as well on this subject.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the main areas of focus for us were indeed capital expense savings from integrated development of &#x2013; from joint development of the large upstream projects, as well as the optimization of logistics and, of course, some potential savings in general and administrative expenses. We're at early stage of preparation for our integration implementation and, obviously, we will be able to give more details about future cost savings and more granularity to the market once this program is adopted and then, of course, starts to get implemented.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Alexander Korneev of Prosperity Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Could you please tell us what is the refining cost per barrel in Russia and in Germany in Rurh Oel? Because in MD&amp;A, it's not really clear how to break down this downstream cost? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexander, I will refer you to our &#x2013; page 23 of our MD&amp;A &#x2013; which shows that our average operating costs for the third quarter were RUB 675 for the total refineries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it comes down to what &#x2013; to about $3 per barrel, and in this production and operating expenses, which you provide on page 22, you showed a lightening of downstream OPEX, which is at RUB 26.5 billion, so which I understand there is a procurement but shipping out the procurement isn't just clean operating cost of refineries or there is something else in this number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, no, the numbers that are showing on before operating cost, they do not take into the account any of cost purchases of crude. However, they do take into account purchases of additives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Karen Kostanian of Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gentlemen, thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions, and I apologize if I missed any of the numbers so it might be just a clarification. Do you already have numbers for liquids growth for a combined entity, Rosneft, TNK-BP, for 2013? And if not, could you repeat your guidance for 2013 for Rosneft alone?</p>
          <p>And my second question is also, do you have a combined guidance for CapEx again for 2013 for both entities? And if not, for a standalone for Rosneft? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Karen, for your question. We, of course, cannot at this stage give a combined guidance. We're still in the process of completion of those two transactions, one with BP and the other one with AAR, and are bound by confidentiality with the seller so we can only speak for our own production guidance. And I'm happy to repeat it; so we are expecting the liquids growth &#x2013; mix of liquids production growth for 2015 of between 1% and 2%, and we're expecting the combined hydrocarbons production growth for next year of between 6% and 8%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the CapEx? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the CapEx is expected to stay flat in real terms so adjusted for inflation. So for this year, our CapEx guidance remains at RUB 480 billion. And so, next year, it will be roughly the same, adjusted for inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Zoltan Palfi of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a very good evening. This is Zoltan here from Credit Suisse. Two questions, please. Firstly, on your 2012 CapEx budget, it seems like that your annual CapEx is running considerably below the RUB 480 billion budget that you set out earlier in the year. Is it because you found some saving opportunities in the investments or is it because you are delaying a couple of projects into next year? That will be the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question would be a follow-up on the previous one. I think earlier, you looked just for Vankor alone to deliver 40 million barrels of production growth in 2013. If you take that number, then a 1% to 2% liquids production target on a consolidated level looks rather conservative. I was wondering whether you expect the decline rate to accelerate in any of your other assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, the question on CapEx. We maintain our CapEx guidance for 2012 at RUB 480 billion. So while the third quarter CapEx number was below the run rate for the year, we expect &#x2013; and it is typical for &#x2013; typical seasonality for our business that in the fourth quarter, there will be certain &#x2013; a pickup in completions, in commissioning of certain facilities, water refineries in fields. And as a result, there will be an increase in fourth quarter CapEx, which will make us &#x2013; which will bring us back to where we're guiding originally.</p>
          <p>We didn't, indeed, achieve certain savings in our 2012 capital expenditure from an individual extent to our cost line basis. However, at the same time, we accelerate certain projects. So the overall amount of money spent is going to be the same, although of course we won't be able to achieve more with the same amount.</p>
          <p>And in terms of next year's production guidance, we, of course, want to be conservative and we do not want to overpromise at this time. We will continue to update the market as we execute on our plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from <mark type="ph" /> Evgeny Gregory (16:51) of VTB Asset Management. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions, if I may. Could you please explain high prices that you will see relative to brands on international markets for petroleum products? And will this premium that exists in this year show permanent improvement or do you expect that this premium will diminish after that?</p>
          <p>And the second question is could you tell us the share of drilling CapEx this year is included in CapEx this year and which you expect the next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So again, starting with your first question, we indeed managed to significantly improve the efficiency &#x2013; the effectiveness of our export operations. And this is partially due to the fact that we are approaching much more rigorously the export standard procedures. And in fact, we've managed to achieve a premium to the traded benchmarks, which obviously is reflected in our results already.</p>
          <p>And with regards to the drilling CapEx, did you refer to drilling CapEx for the year or drilling CapEx for the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think for the both &#x2013; for the both, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So for 2012, our drilling CapEx is approximately RUB 80 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next year...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So excluding exploration &#x2013; exploration drilling, it will stay roughly at this level in real terms. So, adjusted for inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Max Moshkov of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, good evening. Just a few questions from me. Would you &#x2013; what is the current status on greenfield taxation reform and also greenfield which actually would probably impact the investment decision for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:05) projects?</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding the taxation breaks for the North Vankor field. What is the peak production for the North Vankor and when do you expect this to achieve?</p>
          <p>And last question continuing the following question is the product pricing, so you cut ground work from the gas &#x2013; or sorry, from oil sales. Would you expect this to additionally improve your profitability of your sales income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with your second question. We are &#x2013; I think you do not have absolutely accurate information. So we are not cutting any purchases of our products. We are working with more than 20 traders in every oil or refined product auction. And obviously, we more than welcome competitive bids from all reputable traders, including, of course, Gunvor. That was referring to is that, of course, by running rigorous, competitive sale process, we are indeed maximizing the pricing terms at each juncture. And that, of course, helps us with &#x2013; help us to improve profitability. Speaking of Gunvor, I think they've recently won the tender and sure it was because they were offering us indeed the best terms.</p>
          <p>Coming back to your question about taxation, we're making steady progress with tax reform on several fronts. So the tight oil taxation reform has been approved by both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy and is now going through the approvals at the government level. The draft law on the export duty tax rate is also in &#x2013; going through the approvals in the ministries. And that should give &#x2013; once approved, it should give a stable framework for development of new conventional oil fields. And the offshore tax reform is also largely &#x2013; I mean, the framework of this reform has largely been approved. And now, the draft legislation is being discussed in the ministries. So we expect, again, this steady progress to continue and result in fully actionable laws in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the North Vankor field, the mineral extraction tax breaks, I mean just to estimate what is the peak production do you expect and then the peak production from North Vankor will be shipped?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the North Vankor output will peak at between 3 million tonnes and 4 million tonnes, depending on the drilling program that will be adopted. Obviously, we are now considering various factors in terms of the ultimate development plan for one quarter taking into consideration the adjacent projects that drives the ultimate kind of production level from the field. And we expect this peak level to be achieved after 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Ildar Davletshin of Ren Cap. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions please, one on your gas strategy and in particular the contract that you signed today. Could you specify please the sources for that gas that you will be supplying to ITERA? And also, we know that the market is pretty competitive. What terms did you offer to make &#x2013; to win this contract? Did you &#x2013; whether there's a discount or was there any special other arrangement to win the contract?</p>
          <p>And the second question on your potential deal with BP, do you think there is a risk to the JVs that you signed with Exxon and Eni and Statoil, that now if you have an international partner at the shareholder level, there may be some conflicts of interests between different parties at different projects? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with our gas strategy, the contracted volumes that we have will be covered with our existing output, with the output from the fields that have yet to be developed. And as you know, we have a large field that has been now contributed to ITERA, the Kynsko-Chaselskoye field. We also have the Kharampur field, which we'll continue to own 100%. And of course, it will be supplied with the fields &#x2013; with the gas coming from our oil projects including Vankor, which will start selling gas next year, as well as will increase gas utilization in our Western Siberian fields to 95% in the next sort of 18 months. So, that's number one.</p>
          <p>Okay. On any potential frictions, as you said, between various partners, I think it is fair to say that we have been and will continue to work with multiple partners on various projects. We do not see any conflicts between those projects, and we do not see any conflicts arising from the fact that BP may take a minority &#x2013; large minority stake at the Rosneft level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good evening. I have a question regarding towards the integration process of TNK-BP into Rosneft from the point of view of TNK-BP holding minorities. My question is what are Rosneft's plans? Does the company plan to consider conversion of TNK-BP holding shares to Rosneft as in the frame of transaction with TNK-BP or at the later stage or consider to buy out the shares of TNK-BP holding minorities, maybe at a later stage, after the completion of TNK-BP acquisition?</p>
          <p>And another question is what would be your key principles in building relationship with this new group of shareholders which would enter Rosneft group after the completion of TNK-BP acquisition? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Okay, well, Ivan, at this stage, the management of Rosneft is focused to completing the acquisition of 100% in TNK-BP Limited in two separate transactions. This process is indeed taking most of our focus at the moment in terms of this particular acquisition. And of course, there are many issues that need to be considered, including the issue of minorities. However, we do not have any specific plans that we'll be prepared to communicate publicly at this stage. What we of course want to say that we will respect all legitimate rights of TNK-BP creditors and minority shareholders, and we will inform the market as soon as we are ready about any potential steps with this regard.</p>

          <p>Let me verify that the only reason why I'm asking this question is because there is currently a concern on the market and especially amongst this group of the shareholders after the &#x2013; and so, we would be &#x2013; it would be a good step to maybe provide some clarification and to maybe provide some assurances that they will be treated with all fair corporate principles, that we expect also to be the case. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Thanks a lot for the presentation, very good results. I have two questions and the first one on the gains from ITERA acquisition, maybe can you please provide some further details on how this number was received?</p>
          <p>And the second, as far as I understand, all the companies with government share of more than 50% have the right to develop offshore fields. And after Rosneft Gas will sell 5.56% to BP, as far as I understand, share of the government in JV of Rosneft with Eni and Statoil will be less than 50% and as a result those JV should lose the right to develop offshore fields in Arctic. So, what is your view on this and how this can be actually changed the momentum? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me explain the accounting treatment of the ITERA acquisition. So the ITERA acquisition consists of two parts. One was the contribution of 100% in Kynsko-Chaselskoye field to ITERA; and the other one was a cash payment of $170 million to ITERA shareholders. These two steps in combination gave us a 51% stake in the combined company. For the purpose of the acquisition, we considered the contribution of Kynsko-Chaselskoye field as a sale at the imputed valuation of the enlarged company. And then that revenue, that sale proceeds, was compared with the historical cost for this field which was, of course, low given that this wasn't in essence licensed with a number &#x2013; with certain infrastructure and wealth. So the net result net of taxes is what we recorded as a net gain in &#x2013; during this quarter. Okay?</p>
          <p>Now, on your second question, of course, we wouldn't have done any deal that would in any shape or form jeopardize our ability to continue to operate on the offshore and our existing and future obligations towards our strategic partners. The way that our agreements are structured with them allows us to continue to develop those joint ventures in &#x2013; with the ownership structure that will result from the deal with BP. And the outcome, of course, you should rest assure that is &#x2013; this position has been reviewed and confirmed by our legal advisers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, you don't expect any changes to the tax legislation &#x2013; to the current tax legislation in order for those JVs to receive the right to develop offshore fields even if they have less than 50% of government control?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you're confusing two factors. One is changes to the tax legislation, the other one is changes to subsoil legislation. We do not require or looking for any changes in the subsoil legislation. So, we believe that the current subsoil regime fairly accounts for the strategic needs of the Russian state and, of course, it is consistent with the agreements that have been signed with our partners. Well, of course, the tax legislation is a completely separate matter. The tax legislation that is being drafted is very strongly a resolution of the government number 443 that outlines the fiscal terms for the development in the Arctic and the Arctic shelf. And that process, as I mentioned earlier, is continuing and it's making steady progress.</p>

          <p>We will now take a follow-up question from Karen Kostanian of Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, gentlemen. I'm very sorry for an awful lot of question here. I just wanted an update. The news trickled down to the wires that there was a delay of transferring about 14 offshore licenses to you. Could you please update us where we stand in that process and how confident you are that you will receive those 14 licenses? And any updates on further negotiation with other foreign strategic partners aside from BP on JVs in offshore and tight oil? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have applied for &#x2013; we hold 29 offshore licenses today. We applied for 14 additional licenses. And of course, this is a process &#x2013; it's a bilateral process between Rosneft and then the Russian government, including various bodies of the Russian government, including the Russian Rosnedra, including the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Natural Resources. I wouldn't characterize that we've had any major delays and we are confident that we will receive all 14 licenses for those additional blocks.</p>
          <p>And coming back to your question about BP's involvement in offshore and tight oil, I think it is too early to say. We have not discussed or agreed to any additional projects with this company. So for now, we only focus on executing the transaction on TNK-BP, buying their interest in TNK-BP and of course, on transferring our treasury shares to them as part of the consideration.</p>
