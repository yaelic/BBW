          <p>Welcome to the SABMiller 2013 First Half Results Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to SABMiller. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to SABMiller's first half results presentation for our six months ended September 30, 2012. With me today is Jamie Wilson, our CFO, and Alan Clark, our Chief Operating Officer, who will also participate in the Q&amp;A later in the webcast.</p>
          <p>As usual, our presentation will contain forward-looking statements which reflect the current best judgment of management including risks and uncertainties. We disclaim any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines.</p>
          <p>So, let's get started. This half year, SABMiller's proven approach to delivering organic revenue and profit growth was, again, effective. Strengthened brand portfolios and our development of local beer markets on the ground drove broad-based revenue and profit growth.</p>
          <p>Underlying volumes, pricing and mix are all trending positively and contributing to margins offsetting global raw material cost increases and some local market and currency pressures. The breadth of our local portfolios, with pricing, package and style developed to suit each market, is allowing us to create volume growth in the premium, mainstream and more affordable segments and providing us with effective revenue management levers.</p>
          <p>Although there have been a slowing of growth in most emerging markets towards the end of the first half, notably in Latin America and China, we believe their economic fundamentals remain promising over the longer term. We're confident that those markets will continue to deliver a disproportionate share of global growth, even as they become still larger in scale. The IMF forecasts that these markets will overtake developed markets in size in 2013.</p>
          <p>In this context, our superior position in the emerging markets will continue to pay dividends. This position was created not merely from exposure but is rooted deeply in local marketplaces, up and down the value chain, from farmers through to the distribution, to retailers and consumers and, of course, through constant exposure and contact with local governments.</p>
          <p>We've continued to strengthen and update our local flagship brands in the core mainstream and local premium segments around the world. These leading brands retain extremely strong equity with consumers and continue to generate the bulk of our local profit growth. Brand franchises from Tyskie to Castle, from Aguila to Mosi to Snow continue to drive performance and are in strong health.</p>
          <p>Local premium and craft beers, as you're aware, are undergoing a renaissance in many markets, as consumers seek out beers whose premium credentials are based on local differentiation and authenticity. We've historically created and led in local premium in emerging markets, and we're now doing more to develop this across the world. And this is being complemented by product innovation across a wide range of styles and prices and countries. From craft and ciders in the U.S. and Europe to recipes with different flavors and raw material bases in Africa, we've accelerated innovation up and down the price data, and this will continue throwing consumers into the category on the basis of both appeal and, in some cases, greater affordability.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over now to Jamie for the financial review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day, everyone. We'll start by looking at our earnings per share performance. The Group has delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth in all of our major currencies. In the first six months, this represents a 14% growth in U.S. dollar terms. This reflects good organic EBITDA growth boosted by the acquisition of Foster's. Revenue and profit growth have been healthy with underlying volumes, pricing and mix all trending positively and contributing to margin development. The interim dividend is $0.24 per share, which represents an increase of 12% over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Despite the moderation in growth in some emerging markets in the latter months of the half, we grew volumes and revenues across most regions. Lager volumes increased 3.9% on an organic basis versus the prior year, led by strong growth in Africa by 6% and Europe up 9% against the weaker comparative and helped in Poland by the Euro 2012 Football Tournament. A 6.1% increase in organic soft drink volumes was driven by Africa and South Africa generating total volume growth of 4.4% on an organic basis.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency Group revenue grew by 7.6%, reflecting a combination of higher volumes, collective price increases and improved brand mix in most regions. Organic constant currency EBITDA grew by 9.4%, mainly due to revenue growth and an improvement in organic margins of 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>There's been a positive impact on operating metrics from the acquisition of Foster's, our alliance with Anadolu Efes, and the management combination of our Angolan and Nigerian businesses with Castel, all completed in the second half of last year. At the same time, most of our main operating currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, so the performance trends and reported on organic terms vary somewhat.</p>
          <p>This chart illustrates these differing trends. Reported growth is reduced by around 6% by currency translation, so we had the exchange &#x2013; so had the exchange rates remained at last year's level, we'll be reporting Group revenue up 18% and EBITDA up 24%. Taking out the net effect of the M&amp;A activity, most significantly the contribution from Foster's in the half year, we get back to our constant currency organic growth rates of 7.6% for Group revenue and 9.4% for EBITDA. In the second half, we will begin to cycle the inclusion of Foster's from the December 16.</p>
          <p>For the rest of my presentation, I'll focus on organic constant currency performance. Group revenue per hectoliter increased 3% on organic constant currency basis, and all regions other than Europe grew compared with the prior period. Latin America benefited from selective price increases and positive brand mix across the region driven by our premium brand growth.</p>
          <p>North America firm pricing and favorable brand mix resulted from the Tenth and Blake division growth, mainly driven by Leinenkugel's and Blue Moon as well as downweighting of our economy beer segment.</p>
          <p>In Africa, strong performance from our subsidiaries, assisted by price increases and mix benefits from the growth of both Castle Lite and local premium brands in a number of countries, drove the increase. Price and mix benefits in China and India drove the 6% increase in Group revenue per hectoliter in Asia Pacific. South Africa benefited from a moderate price increase taken in lager and below inflationary price increases in the soft drinks portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the decline in unit revenue of 2% was driven by the growth of our economy brands, particularly Ciucas in Romania, targeted price reductions in Poland and the continued consumer shift from the high value, on-premise to the off-premise channel in a number of markets and growth of discounters in that channel.</p>
          <p>Raw material input costs for the half-year were up by mid-single digits on a constant currency per hectoliter basis versus the prior year, which was in line with our previous guidance. We've seen higher brewing raw material costs, with both &#x2013; driven by higher barley prices and rising energy prices. And those energy costs have flown through into some packaging cost as well as distribution cost.</p>
          <p>These increases have been partially offset by savings achieved through our global procurement program. As always, cost pressure has varied between regions with the steepest rises in Europe, Africa and South Africa.</p>
          <p>Reported EBITA margin benefited from the acquisition of Foster's and was up 100 basis points to 18.2%. On an organic basis, we saw improvement in most regions, an overall increase of 30 basis points despite the rise in input cost.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency EBITA margin in Latin America grew strongly due to slight price increases, volume growth and combined with the variable reduction and other cost efficiencies. Performance in Castel boosted Africa's EBITA margin, with subsidiary margins under pressure from capacity expansion-related costs, input costs and investment in marketing.</p>
          <p>Asia's EBITA margins were level with the improved top line performance in China and India, offset by increased marketing and sales cost in China. South Africa beverages' EBITA margin benefited from price increases, operational efficiencies and fixed cost productivity, however, was impacted by the one-off excise charge in our associate, Distell.</p>
          <p>North America margin improved due to strong pricing and brand mix and the phasing of information system costs partly offset by higher marketing spend. Europe EBITA margin declined driven by the negative mix, selective price reductions and higher raw material costs, together with an increased level of marketing spend in advance of peak trading.</p>
          <p>Total exceptional charges of $127 million have been taken against the profit before tax in the first six months of the year. Our business capability program costs have reduced this year as expected. Program exceptional costs totaled $70 million in the first half of the year, mainly relating to the preparation for enhancements for the deployment of the global IS solution in Poland.</p>
          <p>$10 million of exceptional charges relate to non-cash IFRS 2 share-based payment charges relating to employee components of the black economic empowerment program in South Africa. And costs of $47 million were incurred in relation to Foster's integration and restructuring following the Foster's and Pacific Beverages acquisitions. These costs improved the closure of a brewery line at Abbotsford and soft drinks production at Cascade.</p>
          <p>Net operating benefits were expected to reach $250 million this year in line with previous guidance. Procurement continues to be the main contributor with an increasing flow of projects in non-production spend areas adding to that in the more established co-players of raw material and packaging. Manufacturing in some regions and sales and distribution benefits also continue.</p>
          <p>Our global ERP implementation progress continues. The design and build of the global template has been completed and this is in the process of being thoroughly tested in Poland. Work to transition from projects-led structure into business as usual operations in IS is in hand. We continue to progress with shared services. We have centralized our treasury operations for European countries and are implementing the same in Africa resulting in both financial and operational benefits.</p>
          <p>Despite the adverse foreign exchange translation, adjusted EBITDA comprising EBITDA before cash flows from exceptional items, together with dividend received from MillerCoors, increased to 12% on the prior year with underlying growth enhanced by the contribution from Foster's.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, the level of operational working capital was unchanged but there was an outflow in the period due to the timing of payments, including the settlement of some costs provided in Australia combined with higher receivables in Europe as the modern trade channel becomes more important.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure, including that on intangible assets for the first half of the year, was $105 million lower than the prior period. We continue to invest to address capacity constraints and to support growth particularly in Africa. The adjusted net finance cost increased by 70% to $391 million following the increase in volumes related to the Foster's transaction.</p>
          <p>The Group's effective tax rate of 27.5% was 100 basis points lower than the rate in the first half of last year, primarily as a result of geographic changes in profit mix together with the tax effects of debt taken on with the Foster's acquisition. Free cash flow increased by $205 million versus the prior period; however, the timing of cash flows generated in a one-off inflow in Australia from tax and with a specific timing factor and that will reverse in the next year.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position as of 30th of September has decreased over the last six months reflecting partial repayment of the Foster's acquisition facility, and the repayment at maturity of bonds in Colombia and South Africa. As a result, gearing has decreased to 65% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 2.6x. Our access to liquidity remains strong with committed headroom available to comply with all covenants on existing borrowings and to fund ongoing capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>We remain on track to return to net debt to adjusted EBITDA to its target range of between 2x and 2.5x within the next 18 months in line with our stated financial policy. Our weighted average interest rate on gross debt as at 30th September has decreased to 4.4%, down from 4.9% at the end of March. This is primarily due to the repayment of higher interest rate debt combined with lower floating interest rate, most notably in euros and Australian dollars. The majority of our debt continues to be held in floating rates.</p>
          <p>And now the outlook, although we have seen moderation of economic growth in some countries in recent months, the fundamental potential of emerging markets in which we operate remains strong. In that context, we expect our brand, channel, and capacity development initiatives to continue to drive top line growth.</p>
          <p>We expect input cost pressures to continue at a similar level to the first half of the year, up mid-single digits on a per hectoliter basis, and we will selectively raise prices where market conditions permit. A positive impact from acquisitions and business combinations seen in the first half of the year will reduce as we cycle the completion dates in the second half, although synergy generation will continue.</p>
          <p>As previously advised, capital expenditure for the full year is anticipated to amount to approximately $1.6 billion, with new brewing capacity in South Sudan and Nigeria already coming on stream and elsewhere under construction in Ghana, Tanzania, Peru, Uganda, and Zambia. Finally, our effective tax rate for the half year was set at our current expectations the full year at 27.5% towards the lower end of our advised range of 27% to 29%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jamie. And now, turning to our commercial review. Just in Latin America, we've intensified our execution in trade in the past year. This and our broader brand and package portfolios have driven further gains in our share of alcohol, which we regard as a key metric in that region. Capturing share of alcohol with initiatives of spanning all price segments. This includes some progress in persuading consumers of informal alcohol to switch to our products in markets such as Colombia and Peru.</p>
          <p>Spain and Colombia, earlier this year, we began rolling out key brand presentations of larger 750-ml jumbo bottles designed to create a sharing culture and to improve affordability in the on-premise, while also supporting consumption in the home.</p>
          <p>Our profit and margin growth in Latin America remained strong. Lager volume growth of 4% in the half year was complemented by price increases over the last 12 months, and positive brand mix. Revenue per hectoliter grew by 4% on a constant currency basis and helped to drive robust EBITA growth of 14% on the same basis.</p>
          <p>Recently, the economic backdrop has become less favorable though with headwinds in some markets, resulting in lower, slower growth. Colombia, in particular, which had demonstrated good GDP growth and low inflation, has cooled somewhat. Strong currency and weak export markets have dampened manufacturing activity and in turn employment and consumption growth.</p>
          <p>Despite this, the medium-term outlook for Colombia remains strong. It's forecast by the EIU to remain one of the region's most attractive investment locations over the next five years. The forecast GDP growth of above the rest of Latin America. And our outlook for our other Latin American markets is simply positive.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the timing of an economic recovery remains uncertain. The effect of the crisis on beer markets has varied widely within the region. Most Western European markets are declining with growth evident further east. The capital consumption is reaching or even surpassing previous highs. Our own organic volume growth was 9% in the period, with share gains across nearly all of our markets. We've increased support behind our core flagship brands which maintained leading market share positions.</p>
          <p>As an example, the picture on this slide includes images which were part of our very successful Tyskie 5th stadium marketing campaign. Tyskie and our overall business in Poland grew market share significantly during the period. But much higher input costs, increased marketing, some selective price reductions and negative mix drove Europe EBITA down 5%, margins falling 200 basis points on an organic constant currency basis. The negative mix results from established structural trends in the region in favor of non-returnable packaging and modern chain and discount channels. Both of these changes are dilutive in the industry margins.</p>
          <p>In this environment, our re-based businesses are capitalizing on their brand equities and building new commercial capabilities suited at the time. Our focus is on regaining profit growth, increasingly sophisticated revenue and category management, tools and processes.</p>
          <p>We've launched numerous premium price innovations across our markets using consumer insight into demand trends particularly among younger adults. Many of these involved intrinsic  differentiation completing suite of testing products such as new flavors of Redd's in Poland and Frisco in Czech Republic and low alcohol Radlers to be launched in Poland and Czech as shown in the picture here, Hungary and Slovakia.</p>
          <p>We've also launched specialty premium beers in a number of our markets such as Ksi&#x105;&#x17C;&#x119;ce in Poland, which is shown in the picture. That's available in wheat, dark and red variants and then F&#xE9;nix [Phoenix] wheat beer in Czech.</p>
          <p>The alliance with Efes contributed positively to our EBITA growth, but competitive dynamics in Turkey and the integration in Russia had an adverse effect on their lager volumes which were down 5% for the half year on a pro forma basis. Efes soft drink operations through CCI had a strong half. Volumes up 9% on a pro forma basis and margins also rising.</p>
          <p>In North America, MillerCoors' sales to retailers were down 2% on a fairly daily adjusted basis offset by revenue per hectoliter growth of 4% due to firm pricing and strongly positive brand mix. These, combined with continuing cost savings, drove EBITA up 6% in the period. North America EBITA margins up 50 basis points. Advertising and trade activation of MillerCoors Premium Light portfolio is intensifying and will continue to do so for the balance of the year. Coors Light is on its way to eight years of consecutive growth, higher volume and segment share. The brand positioning of the Rocky Mountain cold refreshment continues to resonate well to consumers.</p>
          <p>Focus on Miller Lite continues. MillerCoors is increasing support behind It's Miller Time with strong investment in sports and entertainment partnerships, especially &#x2013; special football packaging, NASCAR activation and new programs for Thanksgiving growing up to today's holiday. Packaging upgrades including the punch-top can and new tap handles are having a positive effect. And the repositioning of Miller64 has also generated improved trend with campaign linked to a New Year's resolution of health, wellness, and being active set to continue its momentum.</p>
          <p>Tenth and Blake continues to outperform the growth of the craft segment with volumes up in double digits in the first half of the financial year. Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy has been the major driver of that, delivering 32% growth for the Leinie's franchise in the period, and leading to a year-round rotation of Shandy, starting with Leinie's Lemon Berry Shandy which is doing very well as we speak.</p>
          <p>The Blue Moon franchise also continues to drive growth, continuing this autumn, its Pumpkin Ale and three innovations set to launch in 2013, tapping into the wide range of craft beer drinkers from basic exploration to deeper experimentation.</p>
          <p>Other craft initiatives, Batch 19 and Henry Weinhard's are expanding off a strong consumer feedback. Third Shift is set to launch in early 2013, with Redd's Apple Ale, shown on the slide, to be rolled out nationally by the end of the first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>And then moving to Africa, despite economic and excise tax headwinds in some markets, our operations on the continent continue to generate robust organic lager volume and EBITA growth of 6% and 19% on an organic constant currency basis. Our trade execution and full portfolio focus enable us to drive volume growth ahead of GDP across most markets. We significantly increased our outlet reach and distribution capitalizing on our expanded brewery footprint.</p>
          <p>Our integrated trade service packages create improved drinking environment and cold beer availability shelf created beer category growth. Our product and package innovations are stretching the price ladders attracting new consumers into the category and generating trade-up. The world's first lager made from cassava was launched in Mozambique and has been received enthusiastically. Castle Lite is a resounding success in the markets in which it's been launched, filling the demand for aspirational premium brands into which middle class consumers trade up on special occasions.</p>
          <p>For example, in Tanzania, that brand has grown to over 100,000 hectoliters and driven 31% growth in the premium segment over the past two years. Our partner Castel has also continued delivering good volume growth in both beer and soft drinks. The integration of the business in Angola is delivering synergies ahead of expectations and making a material contribution to Africa's EBITA margins.</p>
          <p>Our Asia Pacific region has reported some mixed performances. As I'm sure you're already aware, growth at cost consumer categories in China has moderated. CR Snow grew volumes by 4% on an organic basis, just ahead of the industry with share increases led by the Snow brand. Beer prices continued to increase, albeit more slowly in an environment of wage and cost inflation. CR Snow continues to penetrate premium outlets with the portfolio of Snow premium variants, notably Snow Draft, contributing to the 11% organic constant currency revenue growth for the region of the half year. However, price and mix, while partly mitigating cost pressures, were not enough to grow margins. Headwinds include higher sales costs in premium channels and increased competitor intensity, particularly in provinces that are clearly attractive to new entrants.</p>
          <p>Our Indian business performed very well, putting volume growth of 23% and strong EBITA growth. Our differentiated state by state strategy continues to succeed. And recent portfolio expansions include Indus Pride, which is shown here on the slide, creating a new segment of lagers with local flavor profiles, extensions to Foster's and Royal Challenge and Miller High Life premium segments in major cities. Our selective investment model should continue to drive both volume and profit here.</p>
          <p>In Australia, the adverse trends within the beer and the alcohol industry continue, exacerbated at the present by low consumer confidence. CUB's volume performance was worse than that of the industry. This is before the start of program of management actions to improve marketing and sales. The trends were partly mitigated by improved pricing discipline and a deliberate focus on revenue management. The integration plan is on track. We recently announced the restoration of the flagship Victoria Bitter brand, back to its full flavor and full strength position. This has been extremely well received with some promising early signs.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, constant currency revenue grew by double-digits driven mainly by continued volume and share growth of Castle Lite in the premium segment. Our increased premium segment share in South Africa is striking, as shown here on the slide. Aggregate lager volumes grew despite challenging economic conditions, including electricity and fuel price hikes. Focus on market-facing investment and retail execution continue to deliver. Mainstream volume performance was led by Castle Lager, which continues to benefit from the sponsorship of national sports teams.</p>
          <p>Our intensified sales efforts and combination of direct and indirect distribution continue to bear fruit in the form of stronger retail relationships and further improved beer market share. The pricing in the soft drink business in South Africa was held back to improve competitiveness in the 2 liter PET format. And this contributed to strong soft drink volume growth of 8% for the half.</p>
          <p>Growth has been driven by our efforts to extend our service to retailers particularly in townships. Looking further ahead, we expect this trend to continue strongly. Demographic segment comparisons versus Mexico on the slide here provide an interesting perspective. Both beer and soft drinks businesses continue to extract scale and efficiency benefits which are driving EBITA margins up significantly.</p>
          <p>Now, before I conclude, I will spend some time on our four strategic priorities highlighting some specific examples of progress against each. The Foster's and Efes transactions now contribute to our balanced and attractive global spread of businesses. And as you can see from the above charts, we are now more evenly spread around the world. We are, without question, the most diversified company in the peer group. Though we do have the highest exposure to emerging markets, it's our ability to nurture and grow our business ahead of underlying economic growth through excellent execution of relevant and appropriate local brand propositions that makes us proud.</p>
          <p>We continue to develop strong and relevant brand portfolios that win in the local market. I want to highlight two examples here. First, the development of MillerCoors' superior craft and import portfolio in the U.S. through a purpose built commercial unit, Tenth and Blake, which ensures that they are given the right focus by MillerCoors and by our distributors.</p>
          <p>This is designed to provide consumers and shoppers with a purchase and consumption environment which matches the premium credentials of each specific brand. Tenth and Blake has delivered significant growth ahead of the market and above the craft import segment broadly. We expect MillerCoors to continue to develop our portfolio in the above premium space and thus drive revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Second example shows the development of our portfolio in Poland, not only in terms of brands but also in terms of how we are winning in the market through superior execution which is an important part of the strategic priority.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, we moved some of our prices downward in Poland at the beginning of the financial year. A key objective was to ensure price compliance at retail across the large traditional trade universe in Poland. This was successfully achieved and was an important contributor to our volume performance in the country.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we've been improving premium and super premium execution through focusing on the right brand proposition, the right outlets. We've also extended our premium portfolio through innovation including new liquids, packaging, and price points. Constantly strive to raise the profitability of local businesses sustainably. One example is Colombia where our premium and super premium brands showed growth of 6% assisted by the enlarged Club Colombia franchise shown here, which is beneficial to brand mix.</p>
          <p>And second, a very relevant example of raising profitability in our local businesses is South Africa, where we've grown margin significantly in both beer and soft drinks over the past three years. This was despite the economic headwinds as a direct result of management actions to drive top line revenue and cost savings. Profitability has benefited from the price mix effect of continued volume growth on the premium priced Castle Lite, while soft drink profitability has been driven by a restructuring and significant reduction in distribution costs.</p>
          <p>Apart from the business capability program and other projects, we're also leveraging our global skill. The new global talent model was approved by our executive committee in September 2010 and is being implemented across our businesses. Implementation in Australia currently underway. The second year of implementation, the impact has been positive, we are making better and more effective deployment decisions for the long term. We're less reactive and much more deliberate about who we move where and are able to take calculated risks with strong high potential talent.</p>
          <p>This financial year, 32 moves of executive talent have been made between and across regions. Our talent pool is truly global, the executives filling our top 200 positions spanning over 40 nationalities of origin, and from all continents, except, of course, Antarctica, where we don't yet have a presence.</p>
          <p>And so to conclude, a reminder of our key points today. Our strong revenue growth continues this half year driving underlying EBITA growth of some 9%. Our proven approach to brand and beer market development continues to deliver, pricing mix and cost efficiencies further contributing to the result.</p>
          <p>We believe that emerging market fundamentals remained strong despite some current moderation in growth this year. Our model of leading local flagship brands, innovation and expanding premium assortment is working as we've shown across many markets. And as Jamie described, we continue to invest in our future growth in the form of capacity, systems and capability.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, we'll be happy to take your questions either over the phone line or through our Internet webcast.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Our first question comes from Trevor Stirling of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Graham and Jamie and Alan. Three questions please. The first one concerning Europe. You've taken the margin adjustment in Europe and that's showing up in the first half numbers. Is it right way you think about this that that adjustment will continue to the second half and then we should be into a somewhat more stable margin environment?</p>
          <p>Second question relates to Africa. I think Graham you talked about the subsidiaries &#x2013; subsidiary margins being under pressure but you still have 90 basis points of organic margin expansion in the half. Does that imply that the expansion came more from the Castel business and less from your fully-owned business?</p>
          <p>And the third question relating to Australia, you talked about pressures on operating leverage being mitigated by revenue management. Is it fair to say that's partially mitigated and at the moment with the 8% volume for all the operating leverage, the pressure on operating leverage is actually greater than the upside from the revenue management at the moment?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Trevor. I would ask Alan to pick up some of these questions as well. First of all, I'll just pick up the Africa one quickly. Yes, your assumption is correct. The improvement in Africa margins comes from the Castel associate but, of course, their own margins are substantially helped by the Angola transaction to which, of course, we contributed through the combination of the businesses there. So, there's an uplift from that, yes.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the Africa subsidiaries, yes, you will know that we've had currency pressure in a number of our markets and that's affected the input costs quite strongly. So there's a slight downward beating in the subsidiary margin, not much but a little bit. Yes. But let's ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But perhaps a bit building on that, Graham, I mean, I think we anticipated that at the full year when we said that our margins in the first half will continue to be under pressure as we brought capacity on.</p>
          <p>I think also just on the subsidiary point, I mean clearly, the mix of our countries is important in terms of the beat as a whole because to some extent, Angola within our hands, was a lower margin business. And therefore, by combining it with Castel, our subsidiary margin overall actually got a uplift as well as the benefit of the synergies from Angola's prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, although that doesn't show on the organic number, yes. But it's a curiousity what you mean by organic growth in the arithmetic here. Did you understand that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, absolutely, Graham. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Alan, got anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, I can then pick up on Europe and Australia. Yes, I think the big impact on margins in Europe this year was the price reset as well as the launch of some more competitive packs in a number of markets but more specifically in Romania where we've driven that quite strongly. So we've seen the result of that being the volume uplift, and together with that share regain in those markets, which has been very important for us, but then, obviously, had the impact on margins and overall profits.</p>
          <p>I mean going forward we think the European environment's going to remain challenging. So those economies are not in great shape at the moment and we think it's going to take a while to build out of that. I mean, very difficult, of course, to forecast exactly when that will happen.</p>
          <p>The other factor, of course, is that the markets are consolidated, so we'll remain highly competitive, I mean, throughout and that certainly is not going to change. In terms of whether this is the bottom, if you like, on the margins, I think the price reset, the share regain and the more competitive stance we've taken in channels was important and I think that we have moved a long way down that track. So, I think, going forward, in terms of our business expectations for Europe, we'd want to see a steady rebuild beginning to come but within, as I've said, a challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>On Australia, the point there about the improved revenue, which we reported 70% in revenue per hectoliter growth, and your question, I think, about how that's played versus the volume decline in Australia, and the reality is that the profitability in Australia on the business now in our hands is actually doing well. So operating profit and financial performance of the business is good, and it's driven largely through that revenue growth plus the synergies that are beginning to come through. I mean, you'll recall the synergy number in your three full year is around $150 million, but, of course, we started getting some of that benefit from the outset. So our synergies and revenue has led to improved profitability in the business and has offset the impact of the volume decline.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question on innovation. It seems to be a theme throughout the release and the discussion today. What kind of impact do you think innovation had on your numbers this half year, specifically on volume, revenue, profit? Is that a sustainable level of innovation? Do you need more, especially in regard to how you're spending on extensions for flagship brands and some of your emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If I could pick that &#x2013; Tony, if I could pick that up again &#x2013; the point as I was going forward within the beer category that we are likely &#x2013; we are seeing and are likely to see ongoing and, in fact, I think an increased momentum of innovation and that's across the globe. I don't think there are any markets in which that will not happen. That's partly a result of the competitiveness between the major brewers around the world. It's partly a consequence of the way consumers are shifting their behavior and their repertoires. And of course, it's an ongoing effort to just present the category as more interesting versus other alcohol types. So innovation is very much a part of the story.</p>
          <p>Going forward over the medium to longer term, I mean, I would say that I would look at &#x2013; we're looking towards the 5% to 10% of revenues coming from innovation. In the shorter term in some of our markets, Europe, perhaps being the most obvious example of that, the revenue contribution has been much higher. So we reported 9% volume growth for Europe in the six months and of that 9%, 60% of it was driven by innovation in brand and pack.</p>
          <p>If we exclude pack, which is less obviously, I suppose, innovation and we focus on product and new products go-to-market then that number would be around 35% to 40%, so a substantial portion of that growth driven by innovation. The majority of them occurring in the premium end so a very important part of the business.  But in the U.S., Australia, Europe, et cetera, Africa we will see innovation growing moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see it as a higher expense essentially going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes. Innovation will cost money in terms of the greater marketing funds and the need to execute across a broader portfolio. But the point is that most of that will be &#x2013; we'll be focusing that on the premium end. So, I mean, at the gross margin level, in fact we'd want to be positive from a mix impact of innovation. That would be the objective is to have a positive mix effect.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Hales from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you, morning, everyone. A couple of questions, please. Just on the business capability delivery, I want to focus &#x2013; just sort of clarify what you've done there. You've delivered $115 million in the first half. Is that the incremental delivery on the $159 million you delivered in the full year to March 2012, i.e. the cumulative amount now is rolling forward at about $274 million? Or is the $115 million the uplift on last year's first half of $60 million, i.e. a $55 million incremental benefit in the first half this year? I just want to, again, make sure I understand you correctly.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, sticking with the cost saving theme and going back to Trevor's question around Africa, how should we think about the Castel delivery as we look forward? Are most of the cost benefits in Angola and Nigeria already being realized or is there more cost saving benefit to come through in the margin in the second half?</p>
          <p>And then perhaps finally, Jamie, you talked about input cost guidance for the second half continuing to run at mid-single digits. Can you give us the flavor towards as to how you're perhaps thinking about things to the whole of coming to 2013 at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if I can pick up the BCP one, first of all, I mean the number we're talking about here is the cumulative benefit from the project to date. This is not the incremental benefit in the current half. So your latter interpretation in terms of the uplift between the 60-odd last year to the $250 million in this year is the incremental benefit delivered this year relative to last year. And that runs along with the guidance we gave at year-end where we're expecting to take this year to around about $250 million of cumulative benefit from the program.</p>
          <p>Hopefully that perhaps clears up that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's perfect. That's brilliant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Africa point, I mean clearly we're some 10 months into the combination of our businesses in Angola and they have done a substantial amount of some of the immediate benefit we could get on the production grid and we're two items of that but there's still a little bit way to go on that. So, there's &#x2013; it's not fully reflected in the numbers yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But it's probably not going to be as significant, obviously, in the second half therefore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because a lot of &#x2013; well, you'll see the benefit we've got so far flowing into the second half clearly. But the incremental amount more to begin is definitely less because the earlier wins were perhaps the bigger wins. And in terms of input cost guidance, yes, we are seeing that that's going to be &#x2013; we see that stable at the moment. I mean, there is no particular reason for us to believe an upward pressure into next year. In fact, maybe a little bit of downward pressure.</p>
          <p>However, as always, at this time of the year, it's a little bit early to predict to what the barley crop will do next summer and so that point remains obviously open. So we're not giving specific guidance into the rest of calendar year. But at the moment, we're not concerned about that.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Spielman from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes. I wonder if I could build on Simon's questions. You've clarified about the incremental BCP benefits but I'm wondering, I think in Latin America, the margin was well above &#x2013; growth was well above what we in consensus was expecting. And I'm really trying to understand, was that because you had a particularly large cost savings program in Latin America?</p>
          <p>I think you said procurement costs were &#x2013; savings were above expectation to that. And if that's the case &#x2013; or where there other cost savings programs in Latin America that aren't really part of the BCP that was driving the margin up? So that's one question.</p>
          <p>The other question, I was just wondering on Australia, whether the phasings of the cost savings are going to sort of &#x2013; we should think of them as being even in each of the three years. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps, if I can answer that. I mean, clearly, the BCP is one of our major cost saving programs, but it's certainly not the only cost saving program that we have in the world. I mean, each of our businesses is constantly focused on any of the operational efficiencies that it can gain. So, in Latin America, yes, there is an element of their ability to constantly look at their variable production costs and other fixed costs and try and keep those as low as possible.</p>
          <p>And having said that, we've also seen in Latin America slight price increases and some mix benefits there which actually also helped the margins. So, really you've got to look at it as coming from both the revenue line and the cost line. Obviously, they get a share clearly of the BCP benefits as they flow through into the regions from our procurement center. But they also have their own programs of making themselves as efficient as possible within the region. So you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On that point, there's also the fact, of course, that the Latin American currencies have been relatively firm. So the raw material costs on translation into those businesses &#x2013; the effect of the increases have not been severe as in other parts of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And so I think from a cost perspective and, sorry, just long time, I've forgotten the second part of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Australia. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you clarify &#x2013; but before we go to Australia, so to make it clear in my mind, there are four things driving up margins. There's ongoing programs to cut fixed and variable costs, there's the BCP program, there's the top line mix benefits and there's FX. And I'm guessing they all contribute and I'm guessing the variance on all of them is roughly the same or that they contribute roughly the same to the margin expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I would say the first three are the more pertinent parts there. I mean, what we haven't seen is any additional downside from the currency in Latin America because we have a currency weakness in the African currencies, in Eastern European currencies. But effectively the Colombian peso and the Peruvian sol have actually stayed pretty steady through the first half. So there's &#x2013; what we're really saying is there's been no need to cycle transactional currency issues in those markets that we've had to cycle in some of the other parts of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And, sorry, the other question was the phasing of the.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes. I think that with the phasing of the benefits flowed was perhaps, it's kind of hard to say, but it was over a three-year period. You would expect to get the bulk of it over the first two years with probably a smaller incremental amount in the third year. And pretty much &#x2013; I would say, even between the first two years was a little bit more in the second year than the first year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to focus on your combination with Efes in Russia. And obviously, it's been a disruptive six months given the integration. I'm just wondering on the outlook from you whether you thought that the teams are well in place to deliver, I guess, a stronger competitive performance as we go forward from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. This is Alan. Yes, I do think we are in a good position and remain very positive about that business. In the nine months' results release a couple of weeks ago, I think Efes were quite straightforward about some of the problems that they had running toward the integration process, and they came I think in three forms. The first was the fact that they had reduced trade terms with key accounts and that had led to delisting in a number of important key accounts and that's something that they have now corrected and so we can see a reclamation, if you like, of the volume and share going forward.</p>
          <p>The second was around the integration of distributors and the timing of the integration. I mean, it's difficult to call that one, but with that perhaps, we should have acted differently. But the point is now that the full integration is well on track and will be completed by the end of December and, again, I think, Efes had been very specific about that. So again, I think that'll settle down. And then the third element was the underperformance of some core brands which is a more difficult challenge and will take perhaps longer to resolve.</p>
          <p>But essentially, there were a number of integration issues. The core of that business, the team there, the portfolio they have and their market position means that we are positive about the outlook.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're going to &#x2013; operator, we're going to go a few of the questions from the Web now. There's a few of them. First of all, Alan or Graham, number one, what's your outlook on the pricing environment in the U.S. beer industry at the moment this year? And secondly, more broadly for the Group, what trend directions do you see in marketing spend, looking out for the rest of this year and next year, either in absolute terms or as a percent of sales?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, for Jamie, the net interest receivable, the interest income on the P&amp;L increased significantly, can you offer any insight on what drove that increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if I can first take the first two &#x2013; first on pricing in the U.S. That's a relatively robust pricing environment. So we've seen the net revenue per hectoliter climbing by around 4% per barrel, probably by around 4% and that is a combination of pricing and brand mix. But we think that the price environment remains relatively robust and we'd see it sustain that way going forward. So, yes, I think that's the answer on the U.S.</p>
          <p>In terms of marketing overall for the Group, I think quite mixed in terms of the moves in different environments. In the United States, for example, we are seeing an uplift in marketing, although that's not necessarily a significant increase versus prior years, but there is a reinvestment coming in marketing.</p>
          <p>We probably, I think, going forward might see some further uplifting in Europe. I think Graham referred to in earlier &#x2013; in the session to the fact that we had put more marketing funds in particular in markets like Poland, and I think we may see some further uplift. Overall, though if we look at it on a percentage of revenue basis, I don't think there's going to be any significant or notably any change in these levels of marketing investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's perhaps worth pointing out that we have had some fairly weird structural shifts there over the last couple of years just to remind you that we've upped marketing expenditures as a proportion of revenue in South Africa quite dramatically over the last two or three years. It's risen in Africa. It rose in LatAm and then came down to perhaps a more sustainable level following a whole lot of marketing initiatives and packaging changes there. So as Alan has said, overall, I think the &#x2013; we're quite comfortable with the marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue for the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last point that was raised was on interest income received. I mean, clearly it's a combination there partly as we manage our cash flows and work towards repayments of bonds which you've seen in the first half and you'll see again towards the back end of this year. We have some slightly higher cash balances on hand, which we'll use to then repay those bonds as they come to maturity.</p>
          <p>The second and perhaps the more important point though is that a number of the sort of hedging instruments we use through derivative that we've used to protect ourselves going forward have had &#x2013; swung quite substantially into our favor and you see those in terms of the actual income or the mark-to-market of those items in our interest receivable line. And so those are &#x2013; that's principally the reason why the interest income has actually risen substantially in the first six months.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Pitcher from Redburn. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Following on the interest question. I think you mentioned that a large element of your debt was still floating rate, and obviously you benefited from the coupon in this half. Is there a plan to fix out more debt and should we expect that 4.5%, 4.4% to go up over time?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the Latin American margin question and just looking to it, I mean, Colombia has obviously been a phenomenal performer in terms of improved profitability. Are you still seeing specifically improvement in the Colombian margins or is it the other markets such as Peru and so forth that are now driving that margin growth? I just want to get a feel on that on a country basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the point on interest first, yes, we keep a fairly sort of steady sort of watch on the mix between fixed and floating rate interest. We have our policy which we &#x2013; guidelines to stay within. I mean, clearly as you know with the bonds that we've put out this year, we've got some very attractive fixed rate interest on that and there is no need or desire to obviously swap that into anything other than those fixed rates.</p>
          <p>However, in the short term, we do have more floating rates, which we don't believe are going to cause us to increase our interest rates. We think in the short-term a number of the key countries that we borrow in their interest rates are pretty stable. So, I don't see this as a driver of interest rates going up. I don't think &#x2013; I think we've seen in the first half a benefit from the retirement of slightly higher coupon debt and the retention of slightly lower coupon debt which is, as I said, in my comment, is what dropped interest rate on average from 4.9% to 4.4% in the first six months.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just say on the margin question on Latin America and whether we think that Colombia will continue to be a major driver of margin uplift versus or in relation to the other markets, the answer is no. I mean the margins in Colombia are good. And we think going forward there'll be a more even straighter contribution from the other markets in Latin America.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions. Firstly, could you just give us the actual numbers for revenue and EBITA coming from the Foster's deal? I know we can roughly get it from the bits you've given us but it'd be useful to get that.</p>
          <p>And the second question was around, I think, it was in Jamie's intro earlier on. You did talk about the slowdown, particularly in Q4 of this year between volumes and profits. Is that just a reference to the Easter situation last year or is there something else that you're thinking about to cause that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, I think if I can answer that. I mean we haven't disclosed the positive numbers directly. I mean, I think the Analyst Workbook, which is on the webpage, allows you to get pretty close to where Australia is in terms of the Asia Pac subsidiaries number because obviously Foster's is the bulk of that. We obviously have some Indian stuff and Chinese stuff that offset with some of the other countries in that region. So I would say if you're looking for a positive EBIT number, if you head towards that spreadsheet and, I mean, maybe take up a fraction, you're pretty close to where you need to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, roughly, Jamie, it looks to me it's about $350 million of EBITA. Is that the right sort of number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly where you would get to from that workbook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the slowdown in Q4, I'm not quite sure where we got that one from. I mean I think what we do have in Q4 is a couple of things. I mean, one, Q4 we cycle the Foster's acquisition and we cycle the Castel and &#x2013; deals in Nigeria and Angola, both of which came in for the full of the fourth quarter. Clearly, the Efes deal was not till March.</p>
          <p>So if you're looking at reported numbers, there will certainly be a slowdown in the uplift because we'll then be comparing with them in the base as well as in the current year. I think other than that, what you've seen in &#x2013; during the other comment that's been made about the fourth quarter really comes from the MillerCoors call, where they were seeing some slowdown in the last quarter as they, basically, put through some cost break off from general marketing uplift in terms of getting them ready for the next season. So I think they've already messaged that in their call in November.</p>
          <p>And then the only thing to remember is that last year South Africa had a very huge fourth quarter both in beer and in soft drinks and we will cycle that so, therefore, growth rates will be hard to continue at the same pace as they were in the first half. So I mean, I don't think we're saying we've got a major concern about that. It's just in terms of extrapolating from those blends of beer there are certain things you should take account of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for clarifying that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wickham from Oriel Securities. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, just two things. I mean you talk about pricing and putting pricing where possible. I mean, just roughly, how much of your volume is capable of coping with price increases? And then just secondly, just on your debt, I mean you've given us the breakdown in terms of both currency and maturity. I mean would the part of your business where you're got the debt beyond five years, would that differ much in terms of currency breakdown from the profile across the Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I can certainly answer the second question rather simply. I mean, obviously, the longest-dated debt that we have is U.S. dollar-denominated debt coming from the $7 billion of bonds that we raised in the earlier part of this year. So, the farther out you go the more dollar-denominated our debt becomes. In the short term, it's pretty well balanced and by short term, I'm talking about really out the next five years. But once you go beyond five years, it skews more to U.S. dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the pricing point, I've made the point over the years that we face very different pricing situations around the world. And clearly, the areas where there is the most pressure on price would be Europe and China for different &#x2013; well, mostly some of the reasons really, the protagonists are different. Europe is extremely price sensitive and you've heard about the price <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:07:11) structural down trading and so on going on. So, pricing is very much under pressure there. And pricing in China is under a great deal of pressure for the reasons that we've elucidated in the release.</p>
          <p>In most of the rest of the world, perhaps America is a different situation, but most of the rest of the world, pricing is more dictated by affordability and by a balance between volume and price, less by direct competitive pressures from other beer operators any way. But certainly we have freedom to price, but it doesn't mean that it's pricing is dictated by policy and a little bit less by our competitor.</p>
          <p>Australia, I think we've managed, as we said earlier on the call, we've managed the pricing and the promotional pricing &#x2013; well, the revenue management are well. In the U.S., pricing has held firm, as you've heard &#x2013; as you know, I think. So it's mixed around the piece. But as I say Europe and China are the ones that face the most &#x2013; the toughest competitive pressures most directly.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just one follow-up on Australia. I mean I appreciate that you're pretty pleased that the synergies are starting to come through now and deliver the profit performance. But how long would you expect the period of market share loss to continue? I think you've been focusing on some revenue management stuff early on, so a bit of share loss might be inevitable. But when would you hope that those sort of effects from initial integration would be through and that you can grow share again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Quite difficult I suppose to predict, but I think in terms of our modeling and where we think we'll get to with that business &#x2013; the key there really is around the brand and portfolio work that is ongoing. And some of which has not come to market. And then, of course, the customer management and rebuilding relationships with some very important customers that will be Woolworths and Coles. And again that has made a significant progress.</p>
          <p>So I suppose from a business performance point of view, we'd be looking to the next financial year as a period of more stability in share and then together with the turnaround of the business to begin rebuilding share from there. Not only that that share rebuild &#x2013; I don't think we believe that share rebuild will be rapid. It's been a long time in its steady decline. So it'll take a long time to build back. But certainly flattening and then beginning to turn the performance would be from next year, next financial year I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And is there any sign of the general beer market background in Australia starting to improve or is the decline we've seen in the first half continuing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; no, the general beer market overall, I've known there are specific improvements that we can notice from a general volume point of view. Quite important though to dig into that to look at what's happening within the beer market. So the on-premise, for example, is holding relatively flat. So bulk beer is &#x2013; continues to do quite well in Australia. So the losses or the pressure is more actually in the off-premise than in the on-premise.</p>
          <p>Then within the segments, I mean, premium continues to do quite well. That obviously from a mix point of view is beneficial. Then the pricing environment, I mean, there is the opportunity to take price in a number of segments. So, the overall industry volume is still down and we think the outlook will be for a while, there are brighter spots within the structure of the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally, can you remind us what your overall target for synergies on the cost side in Australia is and roughly how much you got so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall target was $180 million and so that was the target we're  tracking towards.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was upgraded from the $150 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, originally, if you recall one time a deal, we said the range that was out in the marketplace is between $130 million and $150 million and when we did the seminar in March, we moved up to $180 million. I think if you're looking for where we're trying to track this year, I mean, we got a small amount in the last part of the last year and we're tracking towards the number between $60 million and $70 million this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Just two questions. One, in Latin America, can you remind us about the margin differences roughly between Colombia and Peru and where do you think there's more upside in the medium term between those two countries?</p>
          <p>And the second question, when we think about this 9% organic EBITDA growth as we think sequentially into the second half, what gets better? And the reason I ask that, I mean, of course, you talked about less margin expansion in the next six months. You talked about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:12:44) South Africa. There's been issues &#x2013; in the Latin American business, you talked about lower growth also in the second quarter. So, I'm just trying &#x2013; and I guess with the European volumes, Euro 2012 effect is no longer there. So, what gets better in the second half that would make me think that the EBITDA growth base can be maintained in the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I think on your first point, I mean we don't actually go around and quote margins country by country. So, I think we'd defer that question. We do quote it more region by region. I think another half...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But could you comment in terms of margin upside between the two countries? I mean, which of the two will have more upside? If you can just roughly comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's in to give you the answer in the first one which I said I wasn't going to, but.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alan did say earlier actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He kind of answered the question. I mean Colombian margins are very full. It's a very profitable market. So, we're looking for &#x2013; we'll be looking for a rebalancing from the other countries more than a lot &#x2013; a whole lot more from Colombia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I think in your second question, I mean you're quite rightly point to some of the things we've said. I mean I think we're not saying that the margin pressure in South Africa, we're seeing that's cycling the growth there, means that the growth rate and profits will be slower in the second half than the first half, because your cycling a very, a high competitive comp. You're not actually talking about margin diminution there.</p>
          <p>I think both Graham and Alan have commented in the fact that the number of regions we can take price, so we feel this is appropriate and that is allowed just to offset costs and we've obviously got our ongoing cost programs in a number of areas and we're still trying to liberate the rest of the synergies for this year in Australia and obviously get the remaining benefits of some of the M&amp;A activity from last year. As we cycle that into the second half, we will actually continue to drive synergistic benefit from there.</p>
          <p>So, I don't think we're seeing that these are negative periods from margin. I think there is still margin upside in those areas, but sometimes you've got to watch. You don't start extrapolating growth rates. You got to recognize what the good part in last year was.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Perhaps pulling quite a lot of the earlier points that people have been made together, your guidance for Group margin for the full year back at the beginning of the year was for flat organic margins excluding M&amp;A. On that basis, you were up 30 basis points in the first half, are you still expecting flat margins for the full year or are you encouraged by the first half to think you could do better than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I think the comment we made at the full year, was to say that we expected the margins to &#x2013; between flat and 50 basis points growth. I think for whatever reason, that message was taken as being flat margin expectations for the year, which was not really what we were trying to send to you in terms of the message. We do think the range is still flat to 50 basis points. I think we would say that at the moment, we feel more comfortable in the upper half of that range than we were perhaps at the end of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that, just to be clear, is your flat to 50 basis points, is that all organic or does that include Foster's?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no, that's organic because and the 30 basis points is organic. So I mean, 30 basis points for the first half is already, obviously, in the upper half of that range and we feel comfortable we can stay there for the full year. I mean, clearly, obviously the acquisitions gives us addition &#x2013; on top of that, hence, how we got to the 100 basis points for the half year. But no, that's an organic number.</p>
