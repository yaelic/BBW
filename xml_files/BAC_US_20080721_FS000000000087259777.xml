        <plist>
          <p>Good day and welcome to today's teleconference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I'll now turn the program over to Mr. Kevin Stitt. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome. Before Kenneth Lewis and Joe Price begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. These factors include among other things: changes in economic conditions; changes in interest rates; competitor pressures within the financial services industry; and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn it over to Ken Lewis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Before we get into the analysis, I would like to say a few things.  It is clear to me at least that many investors see the economy getting substantially worse than it is today, causing major problems for consumers, commercial businesses, and consequently bank earnings.  Although we too are sensitive about the health of the economy and monitor it closely, we do not yet see the economy slipping into a prolonged negative growth.</p>
          <p>While we could be wrong, our analysis indicates continued economic sluggishness through the rest of 2008, resulting in some further deterioration in credit quality.  But we see eventual stabilization later this year and a start of a recovery in the first half of 2009, albeit at a slow pace. In addition, I think the market has painted our industry with a broad brush. It seems to me that there is a big difference between those banks that are diversified and those banks with concentration or funding issues.</p>
          <p>Here are things to consider about Bank of America.  First, most of our businesses are performing very well even with the current state of the economy and the problems in housing.  We believe our revenue streams are sustainable, both net interest income as you can see in our results today, as well as non-interest income, which is driven by our attractive market share in several businesses.  However, as I said, we are not in denial.  Credit losses are still going up, but given what we see today, they are manageable.</p>
          <p>Second, the fact that we can absorb $3.6 billion in credit losses, take $1.2 billion in additional write-downs, add $2.2 billion to our allowance for credit losses, and still earn $3.4 billion should tell investors something about the extent and consistency of our earnings power.</p>
          <p>Third, our allowance for loan losses of $17 billion, our Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.25%, and our liquidity strength at the parent provide us with additional strength to weather the issues we see ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Finally, there has been a lot reported about our Countrywide transaction, much of which has been exaggerated and in some cases untrue.  We'll cover the details later in the call but the essential message is that Countrywide is on track and added to the profits of Bank of America as we speak.</p>
          <p>So with those comments, let's go over the numbers. I'll spend a few moments discussing second quarter earnings, focusing mainly on the highlights across the company, with some specific comments on individual businesses.  Then Joe will delve a bit deeper into certain issues such as Capital Markets, credit quality capital, and of course Countrywide.</p>
          <p>As you already know, Bank of America earned $3.4 billion during the quarter or $0.75 per diluted share before the impact of merger and restructuring charges of $0.03.  Total revenue for the second quarter reached record levels at $20.3 billion, up 19% from the first quarter.  Consumer and commercial client flows remained relatively strong throughout the quarter in most of our businesses, even with the continued turmoil in the housing markets.  Net interest income rose 6% from the first quarter while non-interest income rose 38%.  Driving the increase in non-interest income were trading account profits, which returned to profitability from a loss in the first quarter; service charges, both consumer and commercial; and Investment Banking.  Non-interest expense rose 4%.</p>
          <p>Provision expense of $5.8 billion dropped slightly while net charge-offs rose to $3.6 billion. The increase in reserves of $2.2 billion brings the allowance for loan and lease losses above $17 billion or approximately 2% of our loan and lease portfolio.  As expected, credit costs remain at high levels, reflecting weaker housing markets, particularly in geographic regions that experienced significant home price declines.  This weakened income combined with the slower economy resulted in additional credit deterioration, mainly across our domestic Consumer, Small Business, and Homebuilders portfolios.  Similar to the first quarter, there were several bright spots within our core Retail, Commercial Banking, and Investment Banking businesses that indicate ongoing stability and recurring earnings power.</p>
          <p>While I understand that most of you are very focused on capital and credit quality, it is important to recognize our earnings strength since it is paramount in how we think about the future and about our capital adequacy.  Looking specifically at Global Consumer and Small Business Banking, earnings of 812 million for the second quarter were down from the first quarter. But if you adjust for the Visa gain in the first quarter, earnings were up 11%.  Good growth in net interest income and service charges offset lower card income, the IO strip valuation, and lower mortgage banking income.</p>
          <p>Provision was up slightly from the first quarter from higher losses, particularly offset by lower &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; partially offset by lower but still substantial reserve additions.  We once again increased the allowance in our Consumer businesses due mainly to ongoing weaknesses in the housing market and the economy along with seasoning of several growth portfolios, which Joe will discuss.  Product sales were strong in several areas were net new checking accounts up seasonally from first quarter to 674,000.</p>
          <p>In residential mortgage, first mortgage originations across the company were up 2.4% to $22.4 billion compared to first quarter results.  Average retail deposits including money market accounts rose $7.4 billion or 1.4% from the first quarter as growth in checking, savings, and money market levels were partially offset by a drop in CD balances.</p>
          <p>Retail purchase volumes in both US consumer credit card and debit card were up seasonally from first quarter and on a combined basis were up 6% from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Global Wealth Investment Management earned $573 million in the second quarter, up substantially from the first quarter.  Revenue increased 19%, reflecting lower support to certain cash bonds of $36 million compared to 220 million in the first quarter.  In addition, provision decreased 124 million due to less reserve increases than in the first quarter, partially offset by higher net charge-offs.  Asset Management fees in GWIM rose slightly from the first quarter as seasonal tax preparation fees were offset somewhat by market based activity.  Brokerage income increased 6%.</p>
          <p>Premier Banking and Investments experienced good growth in deposit levels, 6% from the first quarter, helped largely by migration of existing customers into Premier.  Assets under management in GWIM closed the quarter at $589 billion, down from first quarter due to outflows in the cash complex as well as the impact of lower equity markets.</p>
          <p>Global Corporate Investment Banking earned $1.7 billion in the second quarter versus 107 million in the first, reflecting improved trading results and lower write-downs.  In addition to lower write-downs, provision expense and net charge-offs were also down from the first quarter levels.  Capital Markets and Advisory Services earned 449 million in the second quarter versus a loss in the first quarter and a profit of 627 million a year ago.  Our Investment Bank was very active in the quarter with Investment Banking fees of $765 million, reflecting increased market share and good results in debt underwriting.  Debt issuance had record market volumes in April and May, led by high-yield, which was almost 13 times the volume in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Excluding CMAS, the rest of GCIB, mainly Business Lending and Treasury Services, earned $1.3 billion during the quarter, up slightly from the first quarter even before adjusting for Treasury Services' portion of the gain of the Visa related transaction.  Business Lending experienced average loan growth of $10 billion or 3% while Treasury Services experienced deposit growth of 6% from first quarter as client demand for these services rose as a result of the recent market disruption.</p>
          <p>This growth in both areas is an example of the REIT intermediation of core commercial lending to larger depository institutions, a trend we view as structural after several years of disintermediation.  Not included in the three business segments is equity investment income of $710 million in the second quarter.  These results were driven by actual cash gains, improved valuations, and dividends from our various equity investments.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Joe, let me make a couple of comments about our thinking given the current environment.  Although concerned about the economy, we were encouraged by the resiliency of our Consumer, Commercial, and Corporate customers.  Continued good revenue performance in both our Consumer and Commercial Bank along with a bounce back in trading and Investment Banking drove what we thought was a pretty decent quarter given the environment.  As expected, consumer credit quality deteriorated from first quarter levels, particularly in home equity.  Credit quality will continue to be an issue in the second half of 2008, with charge-offs remaining at elevated levels.  Going forward, we believe actions by the Fed and Treasury along with eventual stabilization of home values should help to significantly slow further credit deterioration.</p>
          <p>While we don't expect to increase reserves at the pace we experienced over the past few quarters, increases in reserves in future quarters will continue to correlate with the direction of the economy and its impact on our customers.  As I alluded to earlier, our economic expectations project decent GDP growth in the second quarter of 2008, aided by stimulus actions with growth going back in the second half before gradual recovery in 2009.</p>
          <p>We closed the acquisition of Countrywide on July 1 and continue to see that investment as being economically attractive in the long term and we believe in the short term as well.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital ratio closed the quarter at 8.25%, up from 7.51% at March 31.  Although Countrywide will drive our Tier 1 capital ratio under 8% in the third quarter, we think we can continue to move back to an 8% range over two to three quarters.  We measure capital strength from several perspectives, including total shareholders' equity of $163 billion, as well as the allowance for loan losses of $17 billion plus.</p>
          <p>As evidenced by some recent events, I think we were all reminded capital is only meaningful when viewed along with liquidity strength.  We continue to maintain an abundance of liquidity at our holding company where our time to required funding has increased to 22 months, significantly higher than our competitors.  Plus, we believe our deposit franchise leads others in mix, geographic scope, and size, giving us a competitive, stable funding advantage.</p>
          <p>Given these parameters, our outlook for the economy, and our earnings potential, we have not changed our philosophy about the dividend.  I will recommend to the Board that we maintain the current dividend of $0.64.  Given our current economic outlook, we believe the drivers of earnings for the remainder of the year will be most of our core businesses, along with the continued tight grip on expense levels across the company.  Most importantly, we remain committed to serving our customers and clients while driving profitability during these tougher times.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ken.  Let me begin by elaborating a bit more on second quarter results before turning to credit quality, capital, and Countrywide.  Turning to GCIB and more specifically Capital Markets and Advisory Services, CMAS earned 449 million this quarter as revenues increased 2.6 billion from first quarter levels.  Investment Banking fees are very good, up 15% from the first quarter, and only down 7% from a year ago.  Results reflect the success Brian Moynihan and his team have had in the short term, staying focused in the challenging environment and taking advantage of market volatility, client flows, and continued risk reduction.</p>
          <p>Total revenue in CMAS excluding Investment Banking fees, or what we call sales and trading, was 1.2 billion, up 2.5 billion from the first quarter, as additional write-downs were substantially less than we experienced in the first quarter.  We would characterize market disruption charges this quarter as approximately 1.2 billion compared to 2.8 billion last quarter.  These charges continue to be centered in CDO related write-downs and real estate as well as a couple of other areas.</p>
          <p>Let me start with leveraged lending, where we ended the quarter with exposure of 10 billion, 4 billion unfunded and 6 billion funded, which was down 3.2 billion from March.  The reduction since the end of March was driven by cash sales consistent with the past, meaning once again no transfers to the accrual book.  The unfunded portion generally represents new business at market terms.  During the quarter, we wrote down an additional 64 million versus 439 million in the first quarter, as market pricing continued to stabilize due to increased liquidity.</p>
          <p>Legacy or pre-disruption exposure totaled 6.6 billion at June 30, of which 6 billion was funded.  That 6 billion has already been reduced by over $1 billion since the end of June.  For perspective, total leveraged exposure at September 30 of last year was over 32 billion.  As a reminder, we don't have any covenant light exposure of note and over 60% is senior secured.</p>
          <p>On the CMBS side, we ended the quarter with 9.2 billion in exposure, of which 8.5 billion is funded.  More than 80% or approximately 7.6 billion is comprised of larger ticket, floating rate debt, most of which was acquisition related.  This floating rate debt was written down by $100 million in the second quarter.  As we said before, this product is difficult to hedge as compared to the remaining 1.6 billion of exposure, which is primarily fixed rate conduit product. During the quarter, we actually had a net gain of 39 million on the fixed rate exposure, 60 million in write-ups offset by 21 million in hedging losses.  In a related matter, we recorded 184 million of losses associated with equity investments we made in acquisition related financing transactions in the past.  There are several other legacy books where we continue to record losses but to a lesser extent compared to prior quarters given the reduced risk levels.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the supplemental package you can see our CDO and subprime related exposure along with the changes during the quarter where we recorded losses of 645 million.  The losses were largely comprised of 450 million of Super Senior CDO write-downs and a charge of approximately 200 million to reflect the counterparty risk associated with our insured Super Senior positions.  At the end of June, our net subprime Super Senior related exposure dropped to 3.5 billion from 5.9 billion at the end of March, reflecting the write-downs along with reductions of another 2 billion due to liquidations, cancellations, and pay-downs.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, liquidations resulted in us taking onto our books the underlying asset-backed securities. This exposure is included on the schedule in the supplemental package along with the relevant information.  Any losses subsequent to liquidation are included in the 645 that I referenced earlier.</p>
          <p>With respect to overall disruption exposure, not just pre-disruption exposure, not just the CDO related, we remain subject to market price fluctuations but we think the worst is behind us on value declines as evidenced in our results for the quarter.  This thinking is driven more by the size of our exposure, that being it is lower than the remaining collateral content than a comment about future market volatility.</p>
          <p>Now let me switch to credit quality. On a held basis, net charge-offs in the quarter increased 42 basis points in the first quarter to 1.67% of the portfolio or 3.6 billion.  On a managed basis, overall consolidated net losses in the quarter increased 46 basis points to 2.15% of the managed loan portfolio or 5.3 billion.  Managed net losses in the consumer portfolios were 2.82% versus 2.19% in the first quarter.  Managed credit card losses continue to represent more than 60% of total consumer losses.</p>
          <p>Managed consumer credit card net losses as a percentage of the portfolio increased to 5.96% from 5.19 in the first quarter, which is at the high end of the range of expectations we expressed last quarter.  30-day plus delinquencies in managed consumer credit card decreased eight basis points while 90-day plus delinquencies decreased one basis point.  While positive, this was due mainly to the seasonal trend we experience every year in card.</p>
          <p>We have continued to see increased delinquencies in our card portfolio in those states most affected by the housing problems, while other states have actually shown some declines.  California, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona make up a little more than a quarter of our domestic consumer card book but represent about a third of the losses.  As we have indicated before, we think the normalized loss rate in consumer credit card is 5 to 5.5%.  However, we have also indicated that we could see 100 basis points over that under recessionary type conditions.  At this point, we do not foresee loss rates in excess of 100 basis points above the normalized range.  Obviously, deterioration in the economy beyond that outlook could change that.</p>
          <p>Credit quality in our consumer real estate business, primarily home equity, continued to deteriorate from the first quarter as a result of the weaker housing market.  The problems to date have been centered in higher CLTV home equity loans, particularly in states that have experienced significant decreases in home prices. Almost all of these states have been growth markets for the past several years.  Our largest concentrations are in California and Florida, which represent 41% of the home equity portfolio, but 63% of the losses.  Home equity net losses increased to 923 million or 3.08%, up from 1.71% in the prior quarter.  30-day performing delinquencies decreased 6 basis points to 1.27%, while NPAs were almost flat, which is definitely positive. But as we know, one quarter doesn't signify a sustainable outlook.</p>
          <p>Consistent with the prior quarter, 82% of net charge-offs related to loans where the borrower was delinquent and had little or no equity in the home.  Loans with greater than 90% CLTV on a refreshed base currently represent 35% of loans versus 26% in the first quarter.  This change reflects the continued decline in home prices, most acutely in the states that I noted earlier.  Like others in the industry, a large piece of the deterioration is centered in acquired portfolios not originated through the franchise, a practice we discontinued in the second quarter of 2007.  These purchased loans represent only 3% of the portfolio but 21% of the net losses.  Excluding these losses, the net loss rate would be 2.53% for the second quarter versus the reported 3.08% for the total portfolio.</p>
          <p>We believe net charge-offs in home equity will continue to rise given softness in real estate values and seasoning in the portfolio.  We increased reserves for this portfolio to 314 basis points, reflecting a continued elevated level of loss severities.  We have instituted a number of initiatives to mitigate risk in new originations as well as existing exposure, including lowering maximum CLTVs across both geography and borrower, and actively managing credit lines.  So while our view doesn't call for this, the loss rate could approach or even cross the 4% mark if conditions deteriorate beyond our outlook.</p>
          <p>Our residential mortgage portfolio on a managed basis showed an increase in net losses to 151 million or 23 basis points for the quarter. We have seen some deterioration in sub-segments, namely our Community Reinvestment Act portfolio, the total some 8% of the residential book.  Additionally, California and Florida, which comprise 41% of the balances, drove 58% of the net losses.  The annualized loss rate from the CRA book was 91 basis points and represented 29% of the residential mortgage net charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Although approximately 132 billion or 56% of our residential mortgage portfolio carries risk mitigation protection, it does not cover our CRA portfolio.  Of the 132 billion, approximately 91% is protected, where we sell mezzanine risk exposures to cash collateralized structures, thereby leaving us with no counterparty risk.  The remaining 9% is protected by GSEs. We currently see some level of continued deterioration as evidenced by our decision to increase reserves to 34 basis points.  Assuming additional deterioration in the economy beyond our outlook, it wouldn't surprise us to see loss rates between 40 and 50 basis points by the end of the year.  Again, as we said with home equity and card, worsening economic conditions beyond our outlook could change that view.</p>
          <p>Our Auto portfolio at the end of June was about 28 billion in loans. Net losses in the quarter were 82 million or an annualized 1.26% of the portfolio, which is actually down 39 basis points or 19 million from the first quarter, related to seasonal trends.</p>
          <p>Switching to our commercial portfolios, net charge-offs increased in the quarter to 694 million or 84 basis points, up 15 basis points from the first quarter.  Most of the deterioration is driven by Small Business and to a lesser extent homebuilders, with the other portfolios remaining relatively sound.  For example, Commercial excluding Small Business and commercial real estate had a net charge-off rate of 13 basis points, flat with the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Net losses in Small Business, which are reported as commercial loan losses, are up 113 million from the first quarter, and the net charge-off rate has risen to 9.53%.  As we have discussed before, many of the issues in Small Business relate to the rapid growth of the portfolio over the past few years, which is now compounded by current economic trends.</p>
          <p>As we also highlighted, we have since instituted a number of underwriting changes in Small Business, such as increasing the level of judgmental credit decisioning, lowering initial line assignments, and changing our direct mail offerings.  These actions have resulted in an increase in average FICO at origination, a reduction in average line amounts, and a meaningful drop in approval rates.  More recent vintages are showing the positive impact of these actions, and while we expect higher charge-offs in the near term as evidenced by our reserve levels, we expect the Small Business portfolio to stabilize during 2009.  Although it will take some time to work through these earlier vintages, Small Business remains a critical customer segment with attractive, profitable growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Excluding Small Business, Commercial net charge-offs increased 25 million from the first quarter to 217 million, representing a net charge-off ratio of 28 basis points.  The majority of the increase was due to Commercial real estate, mainly homebuilders.  Approximately 60% of the 217 million relates to homebuilders.  Criticized utilized exposure, excluding available for sale and fair value loans, increased 5.6 billion from the end of March, of which nearly half was driven by commercial real estate, again principally homebuilders, and the final stages of integrating the LaSalle portfolio into our credit processes. Non-real estate and non-LaSalle loan and derivative exposure drove the remainder of the criticized utilized increase.  This increase was pretty broad based, rising from very low 2007 levels.</p>
          <p>Commercial NPAs rose 1.1 billion to 4.1 billion. As we saw last quarter, additional commercial NPAs were mostly in commercial real estate, mainly homebuilders.  Utilized homebuilder exposure was down to 13 billion from 14 billion at the end of March and total exposure declined to 19 billion.  57% of our homebuilder outstanding is listed as criticized; and although pressured, we still believe as we said last quarter, the portfolio is well collateralized.  While we expect to see a continuation of an elevated level of charge-offs, we believe this will be manageable.</p>
          <p>Looking again at the total loan book, 90-day performing past due on a managed basis increased 5 basis points to 79 basis points, while 30-day performing past due increased 2 basis points to 2.37%.  As Ken said, second quarter provision of 5.8 billion exceeded net charge-offs, resulting in the addition of 2.2 billion to the reserve.  Approximately 80% of the reserve increase was due to portfolios directly tied to housing, principally home equity and to a lesser extent residential mortgage and homebuilder.  The rest of the increase was due to growth and seasoning, mainly in the consumer unsecured lending portfolio coupled with some stress from the slower economy.  Our reserve now stands at 17.1 billion or 1.98% of our loan and lease portfolio.</p>
          <p>Let me get off credit quality and say a couple of things about net interest income.  Compared to first quarter, on a managed and FTE basis, net interest income was up 810 million, of which core excluding trading related represented 749 million.  The increase in core NII was driven by increased margins in the current rate environment, loan growth, and deposit growth.  The core net interest margin on a managed basis increased 19 basis points over first quarter to 3.86%, due to the positive impact of wider spreads.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the bubble chart, at June 30 our interest rate risk position is a little more liability sensitive relative to the June 30 forward curves when compared to the end of March.  As of June 30, we felt the market expectations of rate increases were a bit aggressive, which influenced our positioning. We should continue to benefit from curve steepening, especially from a short end led steepening, which is what we have experienced over the last several months.  I should note that because of the Fed Fund LIBOR spread widening, we haven't had as much benefit as we otherwise anticipated.</p>
          <p>Now let me say a few things about capital.  Tier 1 capital at the end of June was 8.25%, up from 7.51% at the end of March, due mainly to the 6.9 billion of capital we raised during the quarter.  As we indicated to you last quarter, we have reduced risk weighted assets in our Capital Markets area by around 30 billion to be more efficient in our use of capital.  Going forward, you should expect preferred dividends to be approximately 472 million in the third quarter and approximately 422 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate this quarter excluding the FTE impact was 30.7%, which is lower than the normal range, due to our periodic true-up of the effective tax rate for the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, all of our forward-looking comments up to now apply specifically to Bank of America before the addition of Countrywide.</p>
          <p>So let me switch and talk about Countrywide for a few moments. We closed the acquisition of Countrywide on July 1, so its impacts won't be reflected in our combined results until we report third quarter earnings in October.  We issued approximately 106 million Bank of America shares at an exchange rate of 0.1822 Bank of America shares for each Countrywide share. As required, the shares issued in the transaction will be recorded for accounting purposes at the value as of the day of the announcement, or 4.1 billion, versus Countrywide's July 1 tangible capital of 8.4 billion, which excludes our preferred.</p>
          <p>In our supplemental material, we have included a preliminary P&amp;L and balance sheet for Countrywide reflecting second quarter results.  As you can see, total assets at Countrywide at the end of June were 172 billion. Mortgage loans held for investment were 99 billion. Deposits were 63 billion, and total equity was around 10 billion, which included our preferred of 2 billion.</p>
          <p>The data on Countrywide we are providing today is a preliminary overview as Countrywide's ordinary and usual review process for analyzing the numbers continues.  Once Countrywide's results are fully completed, Countrywide Financial Corporation will file a Form 10-Q for the second quarter, so there will be additional information on the second quarter in that report.</p>
          <p>Obviously their second quarter results, a loss of 2.3 billion, were significantly impacted by continued credit deterioration.  Credit costs included in the second quarter were comprised of credit provision, which included reps and warranties, impairment of available for sale securities, and other smaller items which totaled just under 4 billion pre-tax.  I'll come back to this in a minute but much of this type cost as it relates to the future and to the extent it can be will get recorded in purchase accounting, so it will have a much lower impact.</p>
          <p>Mortgage originations during the quarter were 59 billion versus 73 billion in the first quarter and 133 billion a year ago.  Driving the decrease in the first quarter was a reduction in refi activity that had spiked during what I guess you would call a mini refi boom in the first quarter.  Refi activity dropped 35% in the first quarter to 36 billion while purchase transactions jumped 23% to 25 billion. Activity at Bank of America showed similar trends with refi down 21% at 10 billion and purchase up 34% to 12 billion.</p>
          <p>Under purchase accounting, we'll mark Countrywide's balance sheet to fair value levels as of July 1, our acquisition date.  The impact of these purchase accounting adjustments will be included in our third quarter financial statements that we'll share with you in October.  Let me give you some preliminary purchase accounting estimates around some of the largest exposures, realizing that they will probably change somewhat as they are finalized.  Our estimate at this time on the loan portfolio would be a loss exposure of approximately 15.6% or 14.3 billion for the held for investment portfolio as of the end of June.  Factoring in charge-offs already taken of 1.7 billion, this represents a cumulative loss estimate of just over 17%.  Obviously, the marks are highest for subprime, Option ARMs, and home equity; and lowest for Prime first mortgages.</p>
          <p>From a product standpoint, the percentage marks range from a preliminary high in the mid-20s to a low in the single digits.  Now all but about $1 billion of this loss exposure will be recorded in purchase accounting.  The $1 billion reflects loss exposure on non-impaired loans greater than Countrywide's allowance for loan loss.  Now if incurred, that amount will flow through our consolidated earnings over a number of years.</p>
          <p>After considering the existing $5.1 billion allowance for loan losses at Countrywide and excluding the billion that I just mentioned, the additional credit mark on the loan book before tax is estimated to be 8.1 billion.  In determining these preliminary marks, we assumed peak to trough home price depreciation of 25 to 30%, including estimated deterioration in Florida and California in the high 30s to just over 40%.</p>
          <p>We tried to give you pertinent stats on the portfolio in the material and we'll provide more detail as the marks continue to be finalized, but this should give you some understanding of our relative view at this point.  Needless to say, the loss exposure, while within the range of our initial expectations, is clearly on the higher side, due principally to the continued economic weakness and decline in housing prices.</p>
          <p>The other significant marks include reevaluating the mortgage servicing rights, purchase reserves, and various other items such as the adjustment of deferred loan origination fees, deferred currency gains, and other miscellaneous costs and liabilities. There are several items that cannot be recorded under purchase accounting rules. These include the future loan loss exposure I just mentioned, certain litigation exposure, and a portion of the reps and warranties exposure.</p>
          <p>Let me finish with purchase accounting before I discuss how those items will impact future earnings.  All-in, our preliminary estimates total a net pre-tax write-down of 12 to 13 billion, which when tax-effected and compared to the preliminary June 30 Countrywide tangible common equity, will result in goodwill of approximately 4 billion.  This number also includes our estimate of capitalized restructuring costs.  You can see from the material our updated restructuring cost of 1.2 billion after tax is consistent with our initial estimate.  Currently, we believe around 400 million will be capitalized in purchase accounting with the remainder, or 800 million, flowing through the income statement as restructuring expense through 2010.</p>
          <p>Assuming these shares issued on July 1 pretty much offset our preliminary estimate of goodwill, net capital used in the transaction on a consolidated basis would be that required to be allocated to the Countrywide assets after write-downs.  Given the size of the balance sheet after the markdowns, adding Countrywide to Bank of America on a pro forma basis would reduce our Tier 1 capital by approximately 65 basis points. Estimated risk weighted assets from Countrywide following purchase accounting adjustments are around 125 billion.</p>
          <p>While we originally envisioned selling a large block of loans shortly after the transaction closed, the markets are not currently conducive to such a sale, so we'll table that idea for now.  As a reminder, we closed the quarter with Tier 1 at 8.25% and have continued plans to strengthen our Tier 1 during the third quarter through earnings, the sale of Prime brokerage, and continued management of trading and other asset levels as well as several other initiatives.</p>
          <p>While I'm not going to predict Tier 1 levels at the end of September, I'll reiterate what Ken said earlier and say that we feel pretty good about our ability to manage back towards our 8% target over the next two to three quarters without having to take significant capital actions to get there.  Obviously, future factors could change that opinion, most notably the economy.</p>
          <p>From an earnings perspective, we believe Countrywide on a GAAP basis will be accretive to Bank of America earnings for the second half of '08 and through '09 including the restructuring charge.  The restructuring charge for the rest of '08 impacting the P&amp;L is estimated to be under 200 million after tax.  We won't be any more specific about the impact on '09 earnings until we announce our earnings in January.</p>
          <p>Embedded in our earnings outlook for the next few years are the assumptions for the exposures I mentioned earlier that aren't captured in purchase accounting: litigation, excess credit losses, and reps and warranties, to name the more notable ones or a portion of those.  Let me give you a little more idea of how we are looking at legal exposure.  Although Countrywide did have some legal reserves on the balance sheet, we have assumed additional exposure over a number of years. Our people along with two major outside law firms plus various consultants have conducted a thorough due diligence to define the likely magnitude of the exposure. This work was initially performed in due diligence but has been continually updated. Our approach was to be realistic, not optimistic. We focused on pending and potential claims, realizing that many of these exposures are represented principally by claims in very early stages.</p>
          <p>It is obviously impossible to predict the exact outcome of the various claims at this stage; but based on our review, we sized the exposure, considered it in our analysis, and feel that it is manageable. We plan to defend claims vigorously in order to minimize the litigation expense.  We'll accrue litigation expense quarterly as any losses become probable and capable of estimation.</p>
          <p>With respect to the other exposures I referenced, which are primarily credit-based exposures, we applied the same basic assumptions I went over when describing our loan portfolio marks.</p>
          <p>I mentioned restructuring cost earlier so let me update you on our cost saves we expect to achieve. We expect to exceed our original target of 670 million after tax by about a third to 900 million and expect to realize over 10% this year.</p>
          <p>We have received a lot of questions about Countrywide's public debt. All I can say at this point is we don't intend to guarantee the public debt but we do understand the ramifications of not paying at maturity.  We'll keep you informed as we continue to integrate the Countrywide transaction.</p>
          <p>Now going forward in 2008, let me piggyback on what Ken said and reiterate that there is considerable uncertainty about the economic environment.  It still remains unclear what future impact the housing downturn, higher energy and commodity costs, and the subprime crisis will ultimately have and how long the downturn will persist.  Let me reiterate that we feel good about our relative position in our businesses versus the competition.  Loan and deposit growth generated by the franchise along with the steeper curve are still expected to benefit net interest income in the short term.  We believe growth will continue in non-interest income from our consumer businesses. And as we demonstrated this quarter, we think CMAS has turned the corner and is producing good results.</p>
          <p>Consumer credit quality will continue as a headwind due to what appears to be further deterioration in housing and its subsequent impact on consumer asset quality.  Similarly, we would expect to see challenges in the consumer dependent sectors of our commercial portfolios.  Given this scenario, we would expect net credit losses to be at least at levels we experienced in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On the expense side, we are aiming for improved operating efficiency and heavy expense control as well as savings realized from the LaSalle integration and now Countrywide.</p>
          <p>With that, let me open it up to questions and we thank you for your attention.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the Meredith Whitney with Oppenheimer.  Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I have two questions on credit quality.  The first is on the foreclosed property &#x2013; I'm sorry I can't ask more broad questions. But on the foreclosed property, you see material deceleration, and you don't see that in the national numbers.  Granted, is there lag, but can you comment on what you are seeing in that trend?  And then my second question is, you have a great chart on the commercial exposures and the draw-downs and all the line limits.  Can you provide color on the commercial side of that just in comparison, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start on the first one, Meredith, and you may have to remind me on the second one. First of all, as you might imagine, our first and foremost goal is to keep people in their homes as opposed through going through the foreclosure process.  So if you look at our restructurings and/or workouts as a percent of total people that go delinquent, they are increasing as a percentage of the total; but having said that, the number of customers going delinquent is also increasing.</p>
          <p>From an actual foreclosure standpoint, our foreclosure process in taking on REO [Real Estate Owned] and distributing REO, the numbers are actually increasing; i.e., we are in fact distributing more properties or selling more properties.  But the inflow of properties into that is still accelerating at a slightly higher pace.Net-net, we are seeing growth in the foreclosed property category, if you were to look at any particular point in time given where we are in this cycle.</p>
          <p>On the commercial loan side, I guess you are speaking to what kind of utilizations that we are seeing and then what...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You show a very detailed table on the commercial side.  I'm interested in the consumer side, your experience with line reductions and then draw-downs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me focus on home equity because I think that's probably the place that that's most applicable.  If you look at our unfunded exposure at the beginning of the quarter compared to the end of the quarter, we were about 50/50 funded to unfunded at the beginning of the quarter.  At the end of the quarter, that had swayed more towards funded, but it was driven as much by &#x2013; or it was driven by three or four things.  One, growth; we did continue to see growth in new customers for both the funded and the unfunded components.  We did see draws that netted some $3 billion coming out of unfunded into funded. And then we had line reductions and pay-downs coupled with our charge-offs that drove the remainder of that reduction.  So all in, utilization rates not that different, but that's the components of what drove it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just one final question for Ken.  There has been a lot of activity in the past month in terms of Fannie Mae proposals and short-selling changes. I just wanted to get your perspective on that, and then larger perspective on the industry and how far we are in terms of what the government is doing -- I know that's a larger question, but what the government is doing &#x2013; bottom on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Meredith, first of all, I think what the Treasury and Federal Reserve are proposing are absolutely necessary, the thing to do, and I hope Congress approves them very, very quickly because I can't think of a larger systemic risk than the GSEs.  We have got to restore confidence in them and this is a way to do it.</p>
          <p>With regard to the industry, I don't pay as much attention to the rest of the industry as I do our clients and customers and us. I'm not a member of all these industry organizations, et cetera.  So I don't know a lot about what's happening at other institutions.  But as I said in the comments, what we see at the moment, absent something -- a severe disruption, we see as manageable and see things improving sequentially.  So from our perspective, we have a ray of optimism now that we probably haven't had for a few quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First on capital, the goodwill of $4 billion, what had you expected that to be?  I guess, as you said, the write-downs are higher because I don't recall the goodwill there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had not disclosed anything earlier, Mike, because it was so early and we knew the level of uncertainty in the marketplace.  But I guess I would say, as I mentioned in the earlier comments, that that was on the higher end of that.  I don't know that I ever expected negative goodwill, so that ought to range it for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And book value was flat despite the earnings.  I guess unrealized securities losses went up. Could you size that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most &#x2013; yes, if you look at our OCI, it was relatively flat.  We had some pickup because we, as I mentioned I think in the last call, Itau, our strategic investment in Brazil, actually has gone to one year prior to the restriction lapsing, so that came in as a positive. But our agency backed, mortgage backed securities, because of what you are seeing in spread widening in the market, pulled the other way.  That's what kept it reasonably flat.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then credit quality, you said expect credit losses to be higher than in the second quarter.  That's not exactly going out on a limb.  Can you give any are more of a range for that or what you are thinking?  It sounds like you're thinking home equity might be a little bit worse than you thought before.  Just give a little more color if you could.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I tried to do because all these portfolios have such different characteristics, Mike, what I tried to do in speaking to each of those portfolios was one, give you in the supplemental package what we reserve to, so that can give you a view as to our most current view.  But then also if the economy continues to deteriorate, I tried to size that for you a little bit with those prepared comments on each one.  I think that's the best way to go about it and for you to be thinking about it because that's how we think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe just a more general comment then for you or for Ken.  I mean so far, you have seen problems related to real estate, residential, and commercial.  And it hasn't gotten crazy outside of those areas.  Where are you most concerned outside of real estate?  Is the consumer getting much weaker? Are we going to be here two quarters from now and you guys say well, we just didn't see it coming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have said before that sometime over the next two to three quarters that we do in fact think that consumer losses will peak.  And to the extent that happens, then we are in pretty good shape.  And the thing for us at least, Mike, is that as we see the increases in charge-offs coming at us, they are really very manageable.  And if we can just start diminishing these big reserve bills and these big losses on the CDOs and leveraged loans, which we see happening, then you can see then that the earnings power of this company starts to really show through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me &#x2013; one last follow-up.  Last quarter, you said maybe the dividend would be at risk depending on how things play out. Now you are saying you are recommending keeping the dividend where it is.  So what has gotten better than what you expected before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Earnings tripled.  Even after preferred, the number I think is 3.224 billion or something, so that's the reason.  I try to be balanced and say that obviously you have to &#x2013; as you look forward, be aware that things could change dramatically and you can &#x2013; in this day and time, it is hard to be unequivocal on anything.  But again, the major thing that's different from the last two quarters is we are now starting to really show some significant income and we would be the most profitable financial services company in the United States this quarter, and that gives me some reason for optimism.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi, Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know the tangible common ratio is not one that you focus on. But pro forma for Countrywide, I am getting around 2.6 &#x2013; 2.7%.  Is that a level that you are comfortable with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, the shares issued &#x2013; think of the shares issued in the Countrywide deal as creating common tangible equity that pretty much offsets the goodwill, as we talked about earlier.  So it really just is the added asset base coming off of Countrywide of which -- as I mentioned, probably is a little higher than what we would run on a normalized basis once you get out of a disruption period.  So I think when you consider all those factors together, we are pretty comfortable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we shouldn't expect any common equity raise or anything like that, maybe some preferreds if the market opens, but nothing meaningful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said earlier, the whole &#x2013; the game plan given the outlook that Ken described earlier absent some unforeseen event is to migrate back to our Tier 1 target over the next two to three quarters. And obviously that's done principally with retained earnings generation, which is common &#x2013; which in essence is common.</p>

          <p>A lot of the other items that I referenced that weren't separately broken out &#x2013; again, all these are preliminary. But you have got rate marks on various assets and liabilities.  You have got some incremental components of reps and warranties. You have got miscellaneous things around the insurance operations.  I mean it is a laundry list but no individual item rises to a level of significance of those others we broke out.</p>

          <p>Focus; we decided to make that one of our top priorities at the beginning of the year.  I don't think it is anything more than that.  So you can see from rates that we are not leading on rates.  And it's just prioritization frankly, Matt.</p>

          <p>From a performance standpoint, let me say that cost saves are larger and more rapid than we thought. Core operating earnings from the institution are probably a little weaker given the market disruption, especially the capital markets related component or the wholesale related component given what has gone on in the markets; but also volumes in some of the mortgage type product home equity type product obviously given again the economic environment. But the deposit franchise and other components of consumer are very strong as we expected.  I don't &#x2013; we divided this thing up and put it into the individual business units, so there is not a precise measurement to be able to do it. We are still very comfortable it's accretive but I don't have an exact number because it now has been split up and put out in the various units. From a period to period standpoint, I think if you look at linked quarter, you can take the acquisition noise out as opposed to looking at year over year and that's probably the best place I'd guide you to.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you. Ken, a couple of questions for you.  This is just an add-on to the Washington question.  The things that are being done there seem to be being done on an ad hoc basis; i.e., in response to whatever crisis arises that week.  Are you getting any &#x2013; are Paulson, Bernanke, et cetera, soliciting any input from the banking industry, particularly from the major CEOs like yourself, about a plan going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I hope Secretary Paulson won't mind me saying this, but I talked to him Saturday morning and I assume that I'm not the only one he is talking to, so they really are.  And also I'm on a thing called the Federal Reserve Advisory Board that we see the Fed once a quarter, and they do ask for our input.  And they are trying to think broadly, Nancy.  I know it seems that way &#x2013; I know what you said seems that way.  But to the extent they can, they are thinking very broadly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess there would be an add-on question to that.  You are one of the more optimistic, I think, on consumer credit quality trends peaking over the next two to three quarters.  Either Joe or Ken, if you could just give us what you are looking at to say that; is it 90-day past dues? Is it delinquencies?  What gives you that much more optimism than seems to be existing in the rest of the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start and I'll let Joe follow up.  First of all, it does seem like even when you are trying to give a reasoned, balanced view of things, there is so much cynicism and negative thought out there, Nancy, that you sound Pollyannaish despite the fact we know you are not trying to be.  And we have pretty good ability to predict the largest driver of our charge-offs and that's on the credit card side.  The team there are just very good at doing that.  So we have been within a pretty good realm of ability to predict that; that is the future losses.</p>
          <p>Home equity, obviously the pace has surprised us and that's where we have done a lot of work.  We are doing a lot more collection work than we ever have. We put a lot more people on the issue than we had before, and obviously we changed our policies.  We think some of that will start showing some gains or some ability to mitigate some of these losses.  We're still predicting them to be higher, but we don't &#x2013; we just don't think the pace at which they have increased will continue.  And we think we saw a little bit of that from first quarter &#x2013; fourth quarter to first and now first quarter to second.  So we see a little of that dramatic rise in the pace of the charge-offs to be losing a little steam.  And we think that will continue throughout the rest of this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that apply to Small Business as well?  I realize that's a small piece of the company but that has been really amazing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that would be an exception, Nancy. And fortunately, it is not a big piece.  But we see that continuing into 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two specific questions, I guess one would be for Joe and the second one would be for Ken.  The first one has to do with the commercial loan loss reserve.  It seems like &#x2013; I noticed that the reserve ratio on commercial lending specifically declined by a few basis points in the quarter.  Yet we see pretty large increases in commercial NPAs as well as commercial criticized exposure.  I was wondering if you could just comment on why not much reserve build and an actual decline in the reserve ratio there when you are seeing such large increases on NPAs and criticized on the commercial side.  And does that forebode some noticeable increase in commercial charge-off ratio other than what you have talked about already on the Small Business side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we have built reserves including the Small Business commercial piece pretty aggressively over the last the last two or three quarters, as Nancy implied with her question a few minutes ago.  Take that out for a minute, and we did continue to add to our commercial real estate &#x2013; commercial reserves during the quarter.  But it was a little more of a reallocation of some excess that we felt we were carrying given the underlying quality of the book on the rest of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Then when you're looking at that total ratio though, go back to your base, our outstandings grew pretty good.  We continue to be out there doing business and quite frankly have seen, as Ken referenced in his comments, some pretty good growth in the healthcare, insurance, non-profit, et cetera, groups with the market disruptions in the ARS securities and things like that.  So we have been more of a solid provider for people, for municipalities and others during that period.  Then we quite frankly have seen less people at the party on some other very good business that has enabled us to do some good business. Some of the overall ratio is also driven by the balance in loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would also say we try to get a level of preciseness that sometimes drives me crazy, and so do the analysts at times.  But the reserve is $17 billion.  And I think that defies, at some point, preciseness to the decimal point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I was referring to &#x2013; I'm looking at a commercial reserve ratio that stayed &#x2013; or commercial reserve level on a dollar amount that was pretty flat quarter to quarter.  And that's I think excluding anything that went into the Small Business area.  Yet again, we see these big increases in criticized exposure and NPAs on the commercial side; and again, in NPAs excluding anything to do with Small Business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Ed, all I can tell you is that we are comfortable with that reserve level.  It is based on, as Ken said, detailed analysis that is driven by all the underlying credit quality parameters, loan by loan scenario with all of our knowledge, and we feel good about that.  We have talked about the areas where we feel the exposure is the greatest; i.e., homebuilders and others, tried to give you the parameters around there.  We feel pretty good about the quality of that portfolio, especially relative to others.  And that's how we do it.  So I don't have anything more to add to it other than, as Ken said, the global overall coverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is like the issue of trying to estimate the CDO write-downs.  In this portfolio, you would have to know every single loan and every single risk rating and it's almost impossible to come up with a bank by bank equivalent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think you mentioned &#x2013; I can't remember the exact ratio, but I think you mentioned excluding residential construction and Small Business that your commercial loss ratio was I think I recall in the low teens.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, that's a very low ratio for as big a book we have got, so it wouldn't surprise us to see that up a little bit.  But we don't see a ton of things coming at us at this point that would cause any kind of material change in that.  But we need to be realistic about the economy and weakness in the economy.  So there will be some activity, but shouldn't see precipitous change in it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then a second quick question for Ken.  Would you be willing to give us any color what your plans are starting in the fourth quarter of '08 with respect to liquidating some of your CCB [China Construction Bank] ownership and what's your view there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would be willing to tell you that it is going to be a long-term, significant, strategic relationship, and we will always have a significant ownership position.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any kind of a &#x2013; is it reasonable to take the view that as we see you exercise some of your options position that that could have some correlation with the amount of liquidation we might see in the underlying original investment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ken, Joe, and Kevin.  I think Ed actually just got to my question first. But maybe to put different parameters on it in terms of dollar amounts, when I look at the NPAs in the consumer portfolio, they were up $800 million this quarter and you built the reserves 2.2 billion.  If I look at the NPAs on the commercial portfolio, they were up 1.1 billion and yet the reserve build there was less than 50.  So I guess the question is, does the peak or the less severe losses maybe coming from the consumer portfolio in the coming quarters, do they get offset by rising &#x2013; by I guess an increased need to start building the commercial portfolio &#x2013; I'm sorry, not commercial portfolio, but commercial reserves and therefore the provision expense is maintained at a fairly high level for the next several quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily.  Remember that, and I had this in the opening comments, you probably need to go back and look at them.  But we continue to migrate our LaSalle portfolio into our credit processes, that drove a pretty good-sized component of the increase in both the criticized and NPA numbers in there, so take that into consideration too.  Back to your question, again, not necessarily; I mean, we reserve now for what we foresee in the commercial portfolio as required under GAAP but also as our view, and so not necessarily unless we were to see further deterioration beyond our current expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I'm sorry if we missed this but it looks like you wrote up the value of the MSR to 4.3 billion from 3.2 billion.  I guess was there a corresponding hedge offset or just maybe more color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It pretty much offset.  Actually, I think overall servicing income was a little lower this quarter due to the net number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then secondly, I think, Ken, I think in a speech a couple of weeks ago you made the comment that you thought &#x2013; and sorry if I got this wrong that non-performers actually peak in the third quarter.  Is that correct, and I guess do you still feel that way?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be a number of conforming accounting adjustments which are typical of any merger that we go through, but most of the changes regarding how we are running the business have been previously announced or reiterated in the package today.  And obviously any accounting will follow those.  But there is not any really big significant item in terms of at what point you take charge-offs and things like that.</p>
          <p>Now acquired loans, this large, when you value impaired loans in an acquisition, you have to apply different accounting standards than on a regular basis and that would be Statement of Position 03-03, so that will have a little different optics that we'll have to provide you more detail in the future around. So you will be able to see the underlying as well as the net impact on us as a company given the purchase adjusting adjustments. But that's not a change as much as that's the application of purchase accounting.</p>

          <p>Thanks.  On the point that you mentioned regarding the Countrywide debt where you indicated that you know understand the ramifications of not paying, it's open-ended.  I just wondered if you could clarify a little bit what your implications are there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, that's kind of &#x2013; we don't really have anything else to add to what I said earlier or responded to earlier.  We'll continue to work through the process, and when we decide what the ultimate legal entity structures look like, how we want to operate it, all the other parameters, we'll let you know but that's where we are right now.</p>

          <p>Okay.  Is there a possibility that you might at some point fully bring the CFC subsidiary into the Bank of America...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't made any decisions on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On CDOs, have you indicated how the insurance is, who is covering you on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not specifically.  But I'll tell you because you saw a charge for &#x2013; we called it the CBA charge or the counterparty charge and we talked about the CDOs component.  Most of our insured exposure is high grade exposure to start with.  It is covered by full line insurers all the way down to monolines.  Obviously the CBA charge that we have taken is on the component that is covered by monolines.  And that really is reflective, I think it was just around 200 million this quarter cumulatively on the particular monoline exposure. If you use the exact same valuation process that we have used for the direct CDOs come up with a receivable and then consider that, we probably reserved somewhere around half of that monoline per se receivable, if you want to call it that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just lastly on the trading revenues in the supplement, you have got the breakout between the fixed income products and clearly had an extremely strong quarter this quarter.  I guess I'm just wondering how much of this from your opinion is, from some of the key drivers be it either customer acquisition, spread tightening, increased capital associated with the business, so taking more risk, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the details, you can see it was across the board except obviously with structured products where we had the continued disruption charges.  But on the FX and rates, that's clearly the strong point and if you look linked quarter, remember we had a pretty good sized charge associated with auction rate securities last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So performance is actually pretty consistent, very strong, strongly consistent quarter to quarter even though it looks to be up there.  I think you know the volatility in the market, and so I would say the market making the customer flows although clearly some ability to pick up some just given the positioning in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So you would think that this line item is really more a function of changing market volatility and spreads than new customer acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Brian Moynihan is probably online.  He would shoot me if I said it was sustainable because it is a pretty high hurdle. But we clearly feel pretty good about going forward on that line.  Not suggesting that we can always perform at that level but feel pretty good about it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.  I know the Shared National credit exam just finished at the end of June, but I was curious if you've had any initial feedback on the results of that exam say in terms of the classified trends and what level of reserves or provisions maybe need to be taken for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not speaking specifically to the Shared National. But overall including that, you can see our results and all that's considered because at the end of the joint institution, that exam has been completed.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Ken, you said in answer to an earlier question you thought that consumer charge-offs would peak late this year or early quarter of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. I guess what I'm concerned about is you are talking about HPD continuing, and in one of the charts you show the percentage of home equity that's refreshed over 90% and single family over 90%, a big increase this quarter.  And it seemed to me that would imply that the losses would continue well into '09.  And you also mentioned that credit card losses could go higher.  So I'm just wondering if you could expand on that because it just seems to me that we are not at the &#x2013; we don't see the visibility of the end of the negative trends which would as a second step imply the peak in charge-offs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, is HDD (sic) [HPD] housing depreciation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, housing price depreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>HPD.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>HPD, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about our thoughts about the economy and the fact that we see sluggishness but not a recession and that we see some improvement beginning in 2009, and that we see housing price depreciation being mostly over this year, maybe going into next year, that would be consistent with what we see then therefore in the charge-off peak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there wouldn't be a lag &#x2013; so even if house prices bottomed &#x2013; pick a quarter, fourth quarter of this year, there wouldn't be a lag for the damage that had already occurred and the peak &#x2013; or are you talking about the peak quarterly rate of charge-offs when you make that comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no.  I'm saying some time during either the end of the fourth quarter or sometime into the first quarter, they peak.  I'm picking, trying to pick a month but not being specific about which month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no; I understand, but you said sometime in that period, we'll see the peak rate of charge-offs. Even though charge-offs might continue at a high level, the peak rate will have been passed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, yes, yes, Ron.  And what that would therefore mean is that you are then only dealing with charge-offs and not further reserve build.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.  That's very important obviously when you had 2 billion reserve build this quarter.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I heard you correctly, you were talking about residential mortgage charge-offs, you said they were 23 basis points this quarter, maybe going toward 40 to 50 basis points by the end of the year.  First, did I hear that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point was they were about 23. You could see in the supplement what we reserved to.  That's a better way to think about our outlook but we were trying to be realistic and say given the continued deterioration of the environment, it wouldn't surprise us if we saw something going to that range.  We are trying to give you a feel for if in fact things were to give you a viewpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a little color on the portfolio mix in residential?  I would be interested in prime versus non-prime and specifically in prime, how much is jumbo and Alt-A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have all the specifics at my fingertips but I'll tell you that the principal increase in the charge-offs that we have experienced and that we continue to expect is in our CRA portfolio that in our remarks I did give you some specifics on. And in that particular book, I think the charge-off rate this period was just south of 100, so something in the low 90s.  And that one is driving a big part of our losses, and probably will continue to it be a hunk of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's because of our product mix.  We weren't in subprime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And in the commercial, I know this has been hit a little bit but I just look at commercial loan growth of 7.5% sequentially.  That's a pretty big annualized growth rate.  You talked a little bit about maybe gaining some market share.  Some other people aren't competing.  How do you &#x2013; I guess my concern is, if credit is not necessarily better yet you are growing loans aggressively, how do you know or how can we be comfortable you are not putting tomorrow's problems on the balance sheet today on the commercial portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't recall a time that we have been able to get the credit structuring terms that we can get now, including levels of equity, all kind of &#x2013; the various covenants that you would want.  If there was a time that some were doing covenant light, they are covenant heavy at the moment.  Secondly, the pricing is so much better than we have seen it in decades probably.  So we think we are putting on very good business with the right structure and the right covenants.  And we are very conscious of the fact of the environment in which we are operating.</p>
