          <p>Good morning and welcome to the CVS Caremark First Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Ms. Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. I'm here with Tom Ryan, Chairman, President and CEO of CVS Caremark, and Dave Rickard, Executive Vice President and CFO.</p>
          <p>First let me provide a quick reminder. Our Annual Analyst and Investor Meeting will take place next Friday morning, May 15, at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York City. We've had a big response to the meeting and look forward to seeing several hundred of you there. If anyone else would to like to attend and needs the specifics of the meeting, please call my office and we'll do our best to fit you in. The presentations will also be available via webcast. This is the one time per year that we provide broad access to an extended group of our senior management team, so we do hope you can be there in person.</p>
          <p>Given that we have our big meeting next week, today's business update will be somewhat more brief than usual. We'll focus primarily on the quarter's results. During the Q&amp;A that follows, we ask that you to limit yourself to one to two questions, including follow-ups so that we can get to as many analysts and investors as possible.</p>
          <p>Turning back to our first quarter, please note that we expect to file our 10-Q by the end of day, today, and it will be available through our website at cvscaremark.com/investors.</p>
          <p>This morning we'll discuss some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, namely, free cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations you can find the definitions of the non-GAAP items I just mentioned as well as the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website at cvscaremark/investors.com.</p>
          <p>As always, today's call is being simulcast on our IR website. It will also be archived there for a one-month period following the call to make it easy for all investors to access it.</p>
          <p>Now, before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read this Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation we will make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>
          <p>We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and that you review the section entitled, "Cautionary statements concerning forward-looking statements," in our most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn this over to our CEO, Tom Ryan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. I am obviously very pleased with our first quarter results, which were at the high end of our expectations. Let me review some of the highlights.</p>
          <p>Total revenues increased 9.7% with PBM revenues up 7.2, retail revenues up 13.9 and that's even with one fewer day than last year. Mail Choice prescriptions; Mail Choice is our new metric which includes mail order scripts plus 90-day scripts filled at retail via Maintenance Choice. So Mail Choice prescriptions were up 6.6%. PBM retail network revenues rose 6.8, while mail service revenues rose 8.4. Our EBITDA for adjusted claim adjusted for RxAmerica, Maintenance Choice, and the increase in litigation reserves increased 3.2% to $3.46. David will give you some details later on.</p>
          <p>We achieved the best-in-class generic dispensing rate. Our retail comps up 3.3, once again leading the industry. While the Longs stores are not included in our comps, sales in those stores are performing well overall despite the California economy. SG&amp;A increased as we expected due to the Longs integration expenses, the dissolution of United &#x2013; or Universal American joint venture and other items which Dave will review in detail.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EPS from continuing ops were up $0.55 at the top of guidance and we maintained a healthy balance sheet generating approximately $311 million in free cash. Let me touch on our PBM. As Nancy said, you will hear a lot more about this next week from Howard and Dave Joyner and others.</p>
          <p>As far as the selling season goes, in 2009 we reached a new record level of 8.9 billion in annualized new name sales, that's up previously from the announced 8.2. On a 2009 impact basis our gross new revenues are 7.6 billion, this is up from previously reported 7.0 and our net new 2009 revenues are 3 billion, up from previously announced 2.5 billion. The primary driver here is an increase in Med D revenues due to higher enrollment. We've also seen some gains are in the employer and health plan segment as our sales force remains active in the market.</p>
          <p>While we won't talk about specifics this early in the current selling season, we see plenty of new business opportunities for 2010 and we're very pleased with the early results for the season. In addition, clients are more open than ever to changes in plan design and other cost containment tools to save money.</p>
          <p>As you probably heard last week, we lost the Coventry commercial contract, which is about $1 billion in revenues in a relatively low mail penetration account. This was not unexpected. In fact, as we began to set our goals for 2010, the loss of this account was considered. We have a lot of irons in the fire. We'll provide more details later on as the selling season progresses.</p>
          <p>Our Maintenance Choice offering has really taken off. The number of scripts being filled at retail 90-day is well over our plan. Through Maintenance Choice, rather than relying solely on mail for their 90-day maintenance medications, many of our plan members now have the convenient option of obtaining prescriptions at any CVS Pharmacy using mail-order pricing discounts for both the plan participant and the payer. This is really just an extension of our mail service offering.</p>
          <p>As of April 1, we had over 200 clients actively using Maintenance Choice and the feedback has been extremely positive. We are in the process of finalizing commitments for Maintenance Choice for July 1 starts and we expect &#x2013; we're excited about those prospects as well as the clients that have expressed interest for a start in January '10.</p>
          <p>Dave will review the impact of Maintenance Choice and some key metrics for our PBM and retail segments, and we'll talk in greater detail about the economics of Maintenance Choice at our meeting next Friday but the short story is, Maintenance Choice is profitable to our overall enterprise.</p>
          <p>Let me touch a little bit on MinuteClinic. In the first quarter we saw traffic up 42% on an overall basis. As we said before, our focus is on raising awareness, expanding our services, and increasing third-party insurance coverage. First, we're leveraging our retail advertising spend to drive clinic awareness through messaging in our circulars and in-store signage and ExtraCare communications.</p>
          <p>Second, we are expanding our service offerings to extend our relevance. For example, TB testing as well as injection training were recently launched nationwide. Troy Brennan, our new Chief Medical Officer, will provide many examples of some new services that we're introducing at MinuteClinic at our analyst meeting.</p>
          <p>Third, we are growing our in-network covered lives because utilization goes up significantly when patients have coverage. We've added 17 million additional lives to our network in the first quarter, putting us over 100 million lives in the third-party network for MinuteClinic. I should point out that more than 81% of our visits were third-party paid in the quarter. As I said on the last call, we're investing about $0.05 to $0.06 of diluted EPS in MinuteClinic this year. I expect MinuteClinic will be less of an investment in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our retail business, which continues to perform at the top of the industry. Now, while our business is certainly not entirely recession proof, it's pretty defensive and we continue to gain share. As I mentioned, our first quarter comps increased 3.3%, pharmacy comps rose 4.6 and front store comps increased 0.7% even with the later Easter. I think these are great results in a very difficult economy. In fact, if you look at our March/April comps, which we should really think about because of the Easter shift, our front store combined March/April comps were 3.4% and our total comps were 6.9, when you think about March and April together.</p>
          <p>In our core CVS stores, we continued to gain share versus food, drug and mass competition. That's both in pharmacy and front store categories, which make up about 90% of our front store volumes. Private label sales were 15.4% of front sales, up about 60 basis points and that's excluding Longs and to take advantage of the growing willingness to try private label, especially in this economy, we are introducing a store brand proprietary "Try me" section in over 4,500 stores, we are also adding new private label products. We have introduced 200 in the first quarter alone and I expect private label to grow to be about 20% of our front-end ales over the next several years.</p>
          <p>People are asking about the Longs integration. I will tell you it is extremely &#x2013; proceeding extremely well. We are right on track in every aspect of integration. Our store operations team has done a great job. We have all store systems converted by the end of May. We will be closing down the Longs headquarters in late summer. We have all the store planned resets and remodels completed by probably mid October and then the stores will be reintroduced in marketplace during the fourth quarter. And I'm convinced we can clearly narrow the gap between the sales and productivity margins that these stores had versus our core stores, similarly to what we did with Eckerd and Sav-on.</p>
          <p>As far as new stores go, on the real estate side, we've opened up 92 stores or relocated stores in the quarter. So 92 new and relocated stores and we've closed about 50 others, approximately 40 of those closings were Longs closings. We plan to open about 250 to 300 new and relocated stores in 2009 excluding Longs from our base that will add about 3% square footage growth.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn it over to Dave, let me give you a little update on the CFO search. As I said on our last call, Dave will be retiring sometime towards the end of this year. We're conducting an internal and external search to ensure that we have the best candidate for the job. We have engaged an executive search firm and we have identified a lot of interest in the position. Obviously, you can imagine with a search of this level, it takes some time, I would say probably six to eight months in a situation like this. So we'll have more to report later this year. In the meantime, I can assure you Dave Rickard is fully engaged and committed to stay until his replacement is up and running.</p>
          <p>So with that I will turn it over to David.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. This morning I'll walk you through our first quarter financial results noting the segment detail where appropriate. After that I'll provide initial guidance for the second quarter and update our full-year 2009 guidance. So let's dive right in.</p>
          <p>On a consolidated basis, as Tom said, revenues in the first quarter increased by 9.7% over 2008 to $23.4 billion. Having one less day this year reduced our top line growth by approximately 150 basis points. Putting that aside, a bit more than half of this quarter's growth over the comparable period last year was due to the addition of Longs.</p>
          <p>The $23.4 billion in consolidated revenues is net of 1.6 billion of intersegment eliminations. Those are produced as a result of our PBM clients filling their prescriptions in our stores. The intersegment eliminations as a percent of PBM revenues increased by 230 basis points over the prior year period from 11.9% to 14.2%. This is up sequentially from last quarter's 120 basis point increase providing further tangible evidence that there's a growing base of Caremark customers choosing CVS as their retail pharmacy with unmatched offerings like Maintenance Choice and ExtraCare Health, contributing to the lift.</p>
          <p>In our PBM segment, first quarter net revenues of $11.5 billion increased 7.2%. Adjusting that growth rate for the impact of new generics, net revenues would have grown 11.4% in the PBM. So what drove the growth of PBM revenues? Well, first we saw a positive impact from the addition of RxAmerica. It contributed almost a third of the growth in this year's first quarter. Also, we benefited from net new client additions. Offsetting these we saw a negative impact from the one fewer day due to the calendar adjustment. Given this backdrop, PBM retail network revenues rose 6.8% over 2008 levels to $7.5 billion, the retail network generic dispensing rate increased to 68.8% compared to 65.2% in the first quarter of 2008. At the same time retail network claims grew 4%. This growth was driven by the addition of RxAmerica offset to some degree by the net impact of new business and terminations.</p>
          <p>Total mail revenues grew by 8.4% to $4 billion. Within total mail revenues, our specialty pharmacy unit saw a strong increase of 16.7% compared to the first quarter of 2008. The mail generic dispensing rate rose to 55.5% from 52.8% a year ago. That's an increase of 270 basis points. Our overall mail penetration rate of 23% was essentially flat to the rate in the first quarter of 2008 on a reported basis. However, there are two important adjustments you need to make to understand the underlying growth in mail penetration.</p>
          <p>First and most importantly, RxAmerica's claims mix adversely affected the mail penetration rate by 220 basis points. Second, the shift of some 90-day scripts from mail to retail via Maintenance Choice reduced the mail penetration rate by an additional 50 basis points. Adjusting for these two factors, our mail penetration rate grew from 23.1% to 25.8%, up 270 basis points. So we're aggressively driving mail penetration in our book-of-business despite some scripts moving to retail via Maintenance Choice.</p>
          <p>And what about the retail drugstore side of the business? Well, it turned in a first rate quarter. Revenues increased 13.9% to $13.5 billion in the first quarter. Longs made up approximately 1.2 billion of that growth during the quarter. The retail segments' revenue also saw negative impact from one fewer day, that amounted to about 150 basis points year-to-year. As Tom mentioned, our first quarter comps increased 3.3%. Pharmacy comps rose 4.6% and were negatively impacted by about 310 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Front store comps increased 0.7%. The later Easter had a negative impact of approximately 150 basis points on front store comps &#x2013; I'm sorry, I misspoke; 115 basis points on front-store comps and approximately 40 basis points on total comps. And there is a new impact I'd like to highlight. Maintenance Choice had a positive effect on our retail comps benefiting pharmacy comps by approximately 120 basis points and total comps by approximately 80 basis points. We're really pleased with the strong adoption of our groundbreaking Maintenance Choice offering, which I'll talk more about next week.</p>
          <p>Moving on to gross profit, the overall business improved with margins up approximately 20 basis points despite each segment being down individually. That's because the overall business reflects impact of the intercompany elimination, which reduces revenues while margin dollars remain constant. Within the PBM segment, gross profit margins were down approximately 45 basis points. The primary drivers of the decrease were the margin investment we made this year with certain key contracts as well as the startup costs of a significant amount of new business as expected.</p>
          <p>Additionally, let me remind you here that in the second quarter we'll begin to change the RxAmerica contracts to conform to the Caremark contract structure. RxAmerica contracts are currently accounted for using the net method. As these contracts change over to Caremark's structure, the accounting treatment changes from the net method to the gross method of revenue recognition. The impact will be to add revenues as well as a parallel addition in annual cost of goods sold. So there's no impact on operating profit dollars. When we told you about this in February, there were some contracts for which the accounting was not yet clear. Those have been resolved and they bring the total expected gross up to approximately 700 to $750 million per quarter versus the earlier estimate of about 500 million per quarter, beginning in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin in the retail segment declined to 29.3%. That's down approximately 30 basis points versus 2008 first quarter. That reflects the impact of averaging in the lower-margin Longs business for the first full quarter, less cough and cold due to the weak traditional flu season and customers opting for more sale priced items as a percent of total purchases. Partially offsetting all that was the fact that the retail generic dispensing rate increased 260 basis points to 69.2% and our private label percent of front store was up approximately 60 basis points versus the prior-year quarter.</p>
          <p>And what about expenses? Overall operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by approximately 70 basis points. The increase overall is a lot higher than the increase in each segment. It is again exaggerated by the intercompany elimination, which reduces revenues while expenses remain constant.</p>
          <p>In the PBM segment, the increase was about 25 basis points to 2.7% including the impact of the elimination of the Universal American joint venture, the income from which was historically an offset to expenses and an increase in litigation reserves related to pre-merger matters. In the retail segment, the increase was approximately 20 basis points to 22.7%. That's primarily related to Longs integration costs and simply averaging in the Longs business for the full quarter, which has a higher SG&amp;A percent of sales profile.</p>
          <p>Given everything I have just discussed, we saw operating margin declined as expected by approximately 55 basis points. The PBM segment's operating profit margin was down by 70 basis points year-over-year to 4.2%. Our reported EBITDA per adjusted claim was $3.03 versus $3.35 last year. But to put it on an apples-to-apples basis you need to adjust this year for three things: the inclusion of our RxAmerica, which is virtually all retail claims and was not in the number last year; secondly, the shift of some mail scripts to retail via Maintenance Choice; and finally, the litigation reserves taken in this quarter in the PBM related to pre-merger matters. Those adjustments result in an EBITDA per adjusted claim of $3.46 this year versus $3.35 last year, up 3.2%.</p>
          <p>In the retail segment operating profit margin was 6.6%, down from last year's all-time record high 7.1%. Recall that we accomplished this even with the one-time expenses associated with the Longs integration.</p>
          <p>Moving to the consolidated income statement, we saw net interest expense in the quarter increase to $142 million, reflecting an increased debt position, largely due to Longs. Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 39.8% as expected. And our weighted average diluted share count was 1.47 billion shares.</p>
          <p>As Tom said, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.55, flat to last year's first quarter and at the high-end of our guidance. Recall that the quarter includes the one-time integration expenses associated with Longs, our planned investments in MinuteClinic, and the short-term margin investments we made in key PBM contracts to generate long-term gains, all of which should help drive our future growth. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations came at 51% for the quarter also the same as last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, we generated over $310 million in free cash flow in the first quarter. Net capital expenditures amounted to $461 million in the first quarter. This was the result of offsetting the $466 million of gross capital expended with approximately 5 million worth of sale lease-back proceeds.</p>
          <p>In January, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of 10.5%, marking the six consecutive year of dividend increases for our company. And we ended the quarter with net debt, defined as total debt net of cash and cash equivalents, of $10.1 billion. That's down approximately $300 million from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Now onto guidance, all of my comments here include the impact of loans. For the retail segment we continue to expect revenue growth of between 11 and 13% for the year. Same-store sales are expected to be in the range of 3.5 to 5.5% for the retail segment for the year. For the PBM segment we've revised expectations for revenue growth primarily to capture the additional gross up of RxAmerica contracts as well as the increased Med D business Tom mentioned earlier. As a result, PBM segment revenue should be up between 15% and 17% for the year.</p>
          <p>As for growth in mail-order volumes, we said on our last call that we expect growth of over 10%. Given the uptake of Maintenance Choice and the share gains we have made to date as a result, we expect to do even better this year. Combining our mail-order prescriptions with those from Maintenance Choice, we expect to see growth in our new metric, Mail Choice Scripts, of more than 11%.</p>
          <p>For the total company we expect revenue growth of roughly 12% to 14% for the full year. That's after intercompany eliminations of approximately $7 billion, which is higher than the guidance we last provided, again, partly because of the RxAmerica accounting change. Also impacting the larger intercompany eliminations is the better than expected momentum we're seeing from the Maintenance Choice offering as well as the ExtraCare Health Card, both of which are driving incremental scripts to our stores.</p>
          <p>We continue to forecast that new generics will be beneficial to our gross margins, but to a lesser degree than in 2008. We continue to expect our Med D business to be more profitable this year than last year. For the total company, gross profit margins are expected to be modestly below 2008, with retail slightly up and the PBM segment down. We forecast that total company operating expenses as a percentage of revenues will be modestly up, reflecting the integration and one-time cost of loans, the increase in litigation reserves, as well as first year economics of new PBM business. All of that will lead to operating profit margins for the total company which are moderately below the record levels of 2008.</p>
          <p>We expect EBITDA per adjusted claim to be down slightly on a reported basis, but up low to mid single digits when adjusted for RxAmerica, Maintenance Choice, and the increase in litigation reserves. We forecast net interest of about 540 to $560 million, slightly up from our prior guidance due to our terming out $1 billion in March to pay off the Longs bridge loan and reduce commercial paper balances.</p>
          <p>We expect our tax rate to approach 40% and we are forecasting approximately 1.4 5 billion weighted average shares for the year, including the completion of the share buyback program in the second half of 2009. We still expect total consolidated amortization for 2009 to be approximately $450 million, add in projected depreciation and the number becomes about $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Net capital expenditures or expected to be in the range of 1.1 to 1.3 billion for 2009, free cash flow is expected to be in the neighborhood of $3.5 billion. We still expect to complete the sale leaseback transaction we deferred from 2008 as well as the normal 2009 transactions.</p>
          <p>Adding it all up, we are raising our guidance for the full-year. We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $2.55 to $2.63 and GAAP EPS of $2.37 to $2.45. This increase of $0.02 over our prior guidance comes largely from the better performance we are experiencing in the Longs business including RxAmerica for the full year from both a sales, margin and SG&amp;A perspective. We had previously guided to Longs dilution this year in the range of $0.06 to $0.07 per share. We now expect the Longs dilution to be in the range of $0.04 to $0.05 per share. As with our previous acquisitions, our integration and operation teams are turning in another stellar performance.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you second quarter guidance. In the quarter, we expect revenue growth for the total company to be in the range of 16 to 18%. This significant growth is being driven in part by RxAmerica accounting change in the PBM segment. We expect total same store sales growth to be between 4% and 6%. As the first quarter comp was negatively impacted by a later Easter, the second quarter will benefit from the shift of holiday sales into the quarter. We also expect to see a positive impact from the cycling of ZYRTEC which went over-the-counter during the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>We expect second quarter adjusted EPS to be between $0.63 and $0.65 per diluted share compared to last year's $0.60 per share. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.61 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>So stepping back from it all, here we are in the worst economic environment, we have seen in most of our careers yet we are turning in very respectable results. The company is gaining share across all markets and segments generating significant revenue growth and free cash flow, raising the earnings guidance, increasing the dividend and at the doorstep of a substantial share repurchase program. So we continue to deliver significant shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn it back over to Tom for some closing remarks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions, first of all the comp, retail comp improvement that you talked about in March-April the combined number seems like the 2Q comp guidance may be a little bit conservative. Can you just talk about what's going on there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, can you talk about how the year-over-year PBM profit should play out as we move quarter-to-quarter through the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the front end comps, I told you our front end comps for March and April were 3.4. Obviously, we had a very good Easter selling season and we think it's fairly reasonable projections for the quarterly comps. And the other &#x2013; the second...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you had originally talked about two to 5% profit growth for the PBM this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was down in the first quarter. I know there was some noise in the number here in the first quarter but can you talk a little bit about how we should expect that to play in? Is the profits going to be down again in the second quarter and then turn up in the second half? You know...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The two to five, we're still comfortable with the two to five and the profits should ramp up through the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us any sense, should the profits be up in the second quarter in that business?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're going to ramp up through the year, Eric, and up 2 to 3 to 4 each quarter. I mean, they typically ramp up each year anyway in the beginning to the end. So it would be consistent with typical PBM performance.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good morning. Can you talk on an enterprise-wide basis, is Maintenance Choice more profitable, less profitable or equally as profitable to mail order scripts? So, not comparing PBM to retail, Tom, let's talk about the whole enterprise when you get a person into the store and tell us, is that more profitable?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, a customer of yours, Chrysler, looks like it's going to go through bankruptcy. There's some questions around what's going to happen with the VEBA trust. Can you maybe talk about what's happening in your customer base right now as companies like this try to work through bankruptcy and what it means for somebody like CVS?</p>
          <p>And then just one clarification, I'm wondering if Dave can just talk to us about what that litigation reserve is for as it pertains to the PBM side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll hit the &#x2013; all three, actually. The Maintenance Choice program is definitely more profitable for the enterprise. When you look at the entire book of business, and Dave will go into that. Keep in mind, you have to make sure that either it's a mandatory mail program or it's a mail program &#x2013; has a plan design that drives mail to make sure that happens. But once you have that with the client, when you think about what's picked up in the store and then the ancillary purchases, the overall, the acute scripts, it is more profitable for our enterprise around Maintenance Choice. We picked up share.</p>
          <p>As far as Chrysler goes &#x2013; and David will walk &#x2013; we'll give you kind of the walk-through next week, Lisa, on the details of that. Because I know people are questioning it saying that it's &#x2013; you know, we've had some of the marketplace say, listen, it's just a temporary process. They're just trying to drive it to retail. That's not the case at all. This is a mail order offering that we've extended to retail. It's that simple. So think about it, the mail business in the store and overall it's certainly of more profitable for us.</p>
          <p>Chrysler obviously has its problems and the problems are certainly not due to its PBM contract. They have, certainly, other matters to deal with. But we think, obviously, they're going to emerge from this. The people, the employees need prescription benefits during this time. So it would seem likely that they would maintain their pharmacy benefit program.</p>
          <p>Unemployment obviously is a challenge for the economy and for us and for all retailers and PBMs alike. The good news is that we have COBRA extension. When you look at our book of business, it is a very small percentage of our business around the layoffs. But we're watching it closely. Obviously, the VEBA process is moving forward. There should be some resolution on that in the near future but we're pretty confident that Chrysler will keep the benefits as they go through, even if they go through the bankruptcy and then we'll see what obviously, what happens with Fiat.</p>
          <p>As far as the litigation, we don't obviously disclose the litigation reserves but I will tell you that it's all pre-merger; it had nothing to do with CVS, nothing to do with Caremark. It's three-plus years back and it is an old case.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and congratulations on a great quarter. Can you go through your expectations for specialty pharmacy growth, any initiatives to drive increased distribution and how the integrated specialty management program is going so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our specialty business and you'll hear a little bit more about this also on Friday, but our specialty business continues to meet our plan and grow. It's obviously the fastest growing piece of the pharmacy business.</p>
          <p>We have a few things going on with injection training around specialty in our MinuteClinics, and we also have the program that you mentioned around retail mail pickup that was just introduced. And that's actually a big plus. Once again it's &#x2013; think about it like the Maintenance Choice program: it's about access and it's about ease and it's about low cost. So you have a situation where we don't &#x2013; typically you'd have to call to make sure someone was home as we're delivering this medication because of the storage requirements, etcetera. Now they can pick it up in the store. So it's early on that, but it's going well and overall we expect, I think, specialty to grow in the 14% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question on Longs. Is the timeline progressing as expected? It sounds like things might be going a little better and I know it's early but are there any best practices that are impacting the CVS stores as of now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually going better than the &#x2013; a little better than we expected. We've gotten pretty good at predicting how these &#x2013; how the integrations go. Interestingly enough, I mentioned that we had closed some 40 stores. We retained more customers in those closings than we originally thought, so that's been helpful.</p>
          <p>Most of the work that we've done has been around the back end, so to the customer it's been relatively transparent, which is good news. And we'll have, obviously, some disruption when we redo the stores but it's going very well and especially considering the California market, which we're starting to see some activity coming back. You probably recently read about some housing starts and people starting to come back and spend in the California market.</p>
          <p>So we're pretty happy with the performance there and we are learning some things around seasonality, particularly in the Hawaii stores. We continue to learn there. As I said, we'll maintain those stores separately and we'll apply some of those learnings to the rest of our stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks again. We look forward to seeing you next week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. You did close more of the Longs stores than we thought as well as some of the specialty and mail facilities. I guess I'm a bit surprised why profitability wouldn't have ticked up a little bit higher on some better capacity utilization assuming that was the rationale behind closing the stores. Is that the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, we close stores in &#x2013; when we do acquisitions all the time. We look at store location, we look at the performance of the store, we look at the location of like stores, we look at the location of, if in fact in some markets there's other CVS stores. Obviously, that would be the case in Southern California and Arizona markets in particular, Phoenix etcetera. So our closings are basically right on plan that we expected for Longs. In fact we got, obviously, as I said earlier, a little better retention of some of those customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the mail and the specialty side though, are you done with that infrastructure consolidation or is there more to go there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's more to go there. Yeah, we are still looking at that and how we are going to &#x2013; obviously those are &#x2013; when you start looking at those facilities, different than store locations, there is obviously logistics implications around that. So no, there is more to go as we look to rationalize that network.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and good quarter. Tom, could you discuss your current thoughts on acquisitions given that it sounds like other captive PBMs maybe for sale following the Express-WellPoint deal? Medco has indicated that it may have some interest. I was curious what your thoughts are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we obviously look at all opportunities. We can't comment on individual acquisitions but I think with any acquisition, we have said it time and time again that if we look at acquisitions, we can grow. And one, you've got to make sure that you pay the right price. People overpay for acquisitions, that's a problem. People can't integrate the acquisitions whether it's the retail side or the PBM side. So we'll continue to look at those and appropriately in both segments of our business and we will do obviously the proper due diligence and look at worthy opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the Maintenance Choice side, it looks like the impact to reported mail claims was about 400 basis points. If you just do some math on that from an EBITDA per claim basis, it seems like it may be $0.15, $0.20 or so to this quarter. Is that ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if that's ballpark. I don't think...</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was about 120 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And overall, what, 70 or 80?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 80, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So yeah, that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess when we think about it qualitatively, that impact, whatever it was to the EBITDA per claim will likely ramp throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. We have had &#x2013; won more &#x2013; more clients reach for it and then the utilization is also higher than we expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, is that impact in itself &#x2013; how much do you think it grows by? Is it something that could double by the end of the year or is that much too aggressive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds high to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds high, but it's certainly going to increase, which is why I'm trying to &#x2013; we're trying to talk about the enterprise wide growth when you think about the company. Because there is going to be intercompany transfers, there's going to be pieces back and forth and we're moving people between divisions now, we have our bonuses are incentivized around the enterprise when you look at how people are paid at the highest levels and also at middle management, our middle management teams who are the closest to our customers. So we're thinking about this as from an enterprise wide standpoint and yes, it will certainly ramp up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Tom, just a couple of questions on healthcare reform. You guys kind of sit in a unique position with both the PBM and retail pharmacy business. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on some of the current proposals and your views on reform in general? And then if we think about where you might benefit more in your business from a reform plan that covers the uninsured if you could just talk about that too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I had a crystal ball on healthcare reform. I think there is obviously an appetite for the administration to do it. They certainly have the votes to do it. The question is how -- what will happen in the House versus the Senate and that debate's just starting now, I think the Senate -- the House certainly seems to be more aggressive in their &#x2013; some of the pieces of their reform legislation they're looking at, and the Senate may be a little more conservative, but more to be seen.</p>
          <p>But just from a kind of broad-brush standpoint, we think at the end of the day healthcare reform will be good one, for the country and good for us because one, you're going to have more coverage. Any time you have coverage that's obviously good for us and we think pharmaceuticals are the best return in healthcare when you think about what they do. So people will think about that as they look to expand it and think about wellness and prevention, they're going to strengthen that, which obviously plays in with our disease management, and MinuteClinic approach.</p>
          <p>They have invested &#x2013; I don't know, $165 billion in technology. We think that's a real opportunity for healthcare in this country. We -- I think we do 17% or 18% of the retail scripts in this country and we do about 25 to 26% of all the electronic prescriptions in this country. So we are really pushing around electronic prescriptions, electronic medical records so that we can, obviously improve safety, improve access, improve outcomes.</p>
          <p>And then obviously the push on the biotech drugs, these are drugs that are off-patent, that have generics in Europe and there are opportunities for us here that can lower payers cost, lower patients cost and is good for us.</p>
          <p>So overall, there are obviously puts and takes, people talk about this public plan, what does that mean? Is it -- will it be truly a public plan or will it be public plan that looks like a private plan? We do not know about that. And that, I guess, will be the biggest discussion over the next coming months, how -- what that "Public plan" looks like. So there's a lot of devils in the detail there but overall I think the healthcare, the system will be good for pharmacy in general and certainly our company as we're integrated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then just brief follow-up. You do mention the public plan, does that idea concern you at all that if the public plan is &#x2013; doesn't really compete on a level playing field with private, you know, private sector that that could be a negative for your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we're getting into my philosophical bent on where the government should be. But it's hard to have an equal playing field with a government-run plan. Are they going to be taxed on it? Are states going tax it? Are the regulators going to run it the same people who are going to manage it? Are they going to have the same requirement on reserves? I think all of these issues have to be fleshed out and if it &#x2013; to me &#x2013; this is my just personal opinion: if you have a public plan that mimics the private plan, well, then it's just another private plan. And the question is do we need another private plan in the marketplace? And so, I just think if you have the appropriate regulations &#x2013; maybe we need some enhanced regulations around some of the private plans, I think that's enough. I think it will get done, but like I said those are my personal opinions and from a business standpoint, we can &#x2013; the draconian public plan would be neutral to us at best.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom in the past, you've talked about you win new contracts on price and you keep them on service. Is the dialogue now because of Maintenance Choice and the new model, where does it stand where you can win on service or the new model as opposed to price? Are we getting there, are we close, where are we on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in this economy &#x2013; especially in this economy, price is always going to matter. I mean that's kind of the ticket to the game to get in but when people are making these decisions, especially the big employer groups, big healthcare plans, they are looking at the how can this company help me lower my healthcare costs, not just drug costs? How can they help me engage my members or my employees? And that kind of discussion, we're seeing more of that once you have the price discussion kind of out of the way. What is your price for generics? What's your price for mail, retail, specialty, etcetera? Now the discussion comes around: how can we help them lower their overall health care cost?</p>
          <p>And you know one of the ways is Maintenance Choice. It is why it is so big. I mean, we just came from a client conference and I can't tell you the number of people that have come up to me and just said, we were thinking about mandatory mail, we didn't want do anything mandatory moving our people to more mail-order prescriptions. This is a perfect opportunity for us; it's kind of the best of both worlds.</p>
          <p>So I think that combined with our proactive pharmacy care program where we're trying intervene earlier and help our payers, help our clients lower their overall healthcare cost that kind of discussion is happening more in the last &#x2013; certainly in the last six months to a year than it happened obviously before that. Certainly we never had that discussion before, really.</p>

          <p>Do you think because you bought &#x2013; you re-priced so many of those contracts, and don't have a lot coming up here, how much freedom do you have for you to go out and cultivate new business aggressively on price? You don't want to over-rely on price but it seems like you do have more opportunity to win some business here on price over the next year than lose it because you've locked up a lot already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think price is fairly rational in the marketplace now. If you look at it people understand their cost, people understand what they need for a return and so do clients. So I think there is rationalization in the marketplace. The issue is what are the services and what are the services you can offer and the scale that you can apply. When you look at our prescription drugs, even with the latest acquisition in the PBM industry you look at our purchasing power compared to that entity, we purchased five times the prescription medications than this new combined entity in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So I think scale is important for a variety of reasons and we'll look at clients on an individual basis and you'll see some, I think maybe some lower pricing in certain markets for certain clients. But overall, the issue, the real tenor and tone of the discussion is around the services that one can provide and how it can lower overall healthcare costs, not just pharmacy.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We believe it is. We have evidence that it is and once again, it's the customer's choice. We have people talk about the network and the pharmacies, we have 64,000 pharmacies in our network and we have probably as many or more than most and we haven't cut it down since this merger. So the issue for us is letting the customer decide and we're seeing some uptick in acute medication also.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. A question, a follow-up on the Maintenance Choice, the statistic that you referred to around the contribution to pharmacy comps, that 120 basis points; does that include both the mail conversion as well as the acute scripts uptick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does. And can you give us a dimension or a sizing for what the relative contribution of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard. It's obviously more mail but it's hard to break it out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about in terms of the contribution of existing client conversion versus new client enrollment in Maintenance Choice?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it would be mostly existing clients. But I will tell you we've had some significant wins with clients &#x2013; new clients that one of the reasons they came, they cited, was the ability to have this offer. So it's mostly &#x2013; it was initially mostly mandatory clients and now it's moving up the scale to clients that have plan designs that are moving to more mail. So the first pass was really mandatory mail clients and now it's moving down the line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a second question about the sustainability of the retail script growth, particularly in light of IMS's revised guidance around negative growth in '09; any comments or helping us understand the dynamic at play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there obviously is a slight slowdown, we're obviously benefiting from the ZYRTEC wrap around. But we're also taking share, I believe, when you look in the marketplace we're taking share in the front end of our business, on the retail side and we're also taking share on the pharmacy side from a variety of areas. So we think that's obviously offsetting some of the "slowdown" in the pharmacy trends that you see but our numbers for the last certainly four quarters plus have led the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks guys. Along the same lines with the Maintenance Choice program, Tom, do you have enough data now &#x2013; I know there's been some resistance in the consulting area to Maintenance Choice and actually running those numbers through its comparison. Do you have enough data now to show people that have shunned mandatory mail programs as they choose Maintenance Choice they will actually save quite a bit of money per script?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think there's less skepticism in the market than there was. Now that people, not only from consultants, but also from our clients, no one wants to be on the leading edge. They want to see how this thing plays out and what they're seeing with the number of clients that have taken it and signed up not only now but also in 2010. But we can show clients, I mean the reason &#x2013; I think the reason clients choose it, is because there's better savings. From the &#x2013; the early clients chose it because of better access and convenience, they already had mandatory mail. The clients that are moving towards it, are moving towards it for savings and convenience. So we can show them anywhere from a 10 to 15% savings and they get it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much uptick do you expect in July? I know you said there's going to be another bunch of clients coming in in July. I think it's 2.5 million now. Where is that going to go as we get to July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't quantify that but we have more coming on in July. We have obviously others coming on in January of '10. So we &#x2013; you'll continue to see it ramp up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as a percentage of that 2.5 million, how much do you &#x2013; how many percent, how many are new to Caremark and how much was mandatory mail? Are you going to give us any percentages there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a &#x2013; I tried to quantify. It was definitely mostly existing customers and mostly mandatory mail customers initially. Now that pendulum has swung on both sides. So less mandatory mail customers and it's trending more towards new customers but the bulk of it is existing customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But as we go through this...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'll see &#x2013; yeah. From a penetration standpoint, we still have a lot of runway to go. If it's a nine-inning game, just in penetration of our existing business we're in the second or third inning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as we do this and not to get too excited here, but as we &#x2013; as you pull things from other PBMs and win contracts and they come into Maintenance Choice, it was talked about, the enterprise profitability of someone like that. It seems to me that that is just amazingly profitable business for your company as non-CVS people, non-Caremark people start rolling through the CVS retail platform, is that incorrect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Dave, could you help us frame the Part D improvement this year versus last year? Does it &#x2013; what's the ballparks EPS impact from doing better in that line of business this year versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we haven't broken out the EPS of individual components of PBM profitability but the year-to-year profitability improvement is high single digits. It's related to both the way we bid the business for this year. It's related to the enrollment which is up versus prior year. A number of things are going in the right direction there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly on the Longs revenue, obviously, you're doing better on the cost side of the integration side. But given what's happened in California, when you roll Longs into the comp base, at this point, do you anticipate that to be a positive, negative or neutral effect on your comps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it would be initially neutral to negative actually because you get disruption. Right? I mean --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's &#x2013; so we &#x2013; it kind of runs the same. Now the wild card you have here is, your point, the Californian economy, right? We didn't have that obviously with a Revco, we didn't have it with an Eckerd, we didn't have it with a Sav-on, per se. So you do have that wildcard. But overall, we always know that there is a little bit of a trough on that. And so, it's kind of neutral to negative and then it kind of &#x2013; it ramps up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The only thing to keep in mind there is the effect of net-to-gross markup of revenues. And that will have &#x2013; that will play through there, but in terms of business trend, as Tom said...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that wouldn't &#x2013; would that affect the retail comp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That wouldn't affect the retail comp. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's just the PBM? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then thirdly, it looks like the debt market is starting to un-stick a little bit. Do you have any new thoughts about monetizing some of your Longs real estate holdings? And is there a better shot you might do that sooner rather than later or is the cap rate still not where you need it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to &#x2013; it's loosening up but it's still relatively tight. We're going to look at some sale lease-back offerings. Obviously we have some inventory built up beside the Longs stores. But I would say we'd have other opportunities from the sale lease-back standpoint, in other markets prior to the California market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And a last question, thank you for this. If &#x2013; this is an educational question, at least for me, but let's say we continue to move a little bit left on the political spectrum and the government starts talking about "negotiating" pharmaceutical prices i.e. dictating pharmaceutical prices and using a big stick as part of the public plan to drive down pharmacy cost etcetera. It's not clear to me at least, what role a PBM plays if the government starts dictating those prices and especially if the Lewin Group study suggests we start seeing some migration from private plans to public plans because of the lower costs. I just &#x2013; I know philosophically we have a view, but mechanistically, do you have any insight into how that would work and what kind of efforts you might be making to communicate your views to the policymakers about what that might do to the network of private contracts that are already out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're -- obviously, we think the free market is the way to go and I think if you look at Med D, is kind of really a perfect example of that. That was a program that really was driven by the private sector. We enrolled a significant number of seniors, there's significant savings, the savings is improving each year. Now they may have been off a little on their projections on prescription utilization, but when you look at the total overall return, I think the government is pretty happy.</p>
          <p>I can't -- it's hard to speculate on kind of where they're going to go on that area but I just think from the standpoint you will always need the PBM, when you think about the overall clinical programs, the monitoring, the network, the rebate, the best price issues, working with them on the specialty side of business. So it's more than just setting the price, I mean &#x2013; and I am not making the assumption it's going to go that far left, because I don't think that's where the marketplace goes, I don't think you ever get kind of the best price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take the two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Canaccord Adams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, can you diagnose the customer, both the pharmacy and the front end, in particular the pharmacy putting the IMS forecast aside, it looks like script volumes have been ticking up. Are you seeing anything that would tell you may be compliance is improving, as people all of a sudden are taking their drugs again as they should and then anything observable at the front end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our front-end business &#x2013; I'll start with that, our front-end business in the last few months is actually increasing. We're getting I mean across the &#x2013; our main categories. And we have a slight uptick in promotional mix, not that we're promoting any more but customers are obviously in this economy are leaning towards it. So we're starting to see our best customers are spending more in the categories that we emphasize.</p>
          <p>Around the pharmacy side of the business, we have done a lot of work around adherence in the stores and now we are obviously combining it on the PBM side of the business. It's really &#x2013; there is two &#x2013; it's kind of two opposite poles here, right. You have the consumer in this economy cutting back a little bit, cutting drugs in half, maybe skipping a dose. Yet on the other hand, the pilot programs that we are putting in place, the calls that we are making to customers to restart, to stay on their medication, working with clients in particular, we are seeing a pretty dramatic increase.</p>
          <p>So I think it's &#x2013; I wish I could give you one silver bullet, but it's not. You've got a combination of factors there that I think adherence and the programs that we're putting in place is improving script unit growth, I think that the share that we are taking because of performance vis-&#xE0;-vis some of our competitors is improving script growth and then on the flip side, you still have people. I think maybe cutting back less than they did before, but still cutting back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the follow up to clarify on the Maintenance Choice offering. I understand that a lot of it's coming from existing customers, but that's existing to the PBM. Can you separate out how many of these customers are first time to the CVS store? And of course, there has to be something captured in there because you're citing it in the numbers. But I'm curious, if there is a bigger mix of people that are first time sort of CVS pharmacy customers as opposed to enterprise wide customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is a percentage of that. We'll not disclose that now because it obviously varies. But there are certainly a percentage of customers that haven't been into a CVS store or haven't used our store for acute medications, right. They may be going somewhere else for acute medications. But Maintenance, it's a combination of Maintenance Choice and don't forget, we also have the ExtraCare Health program out there with 8 million cards and another 8 million coming up in by, you know, middle of '10, so where people get 20% discount. So you have a lot of that are also new customers. And then MinuteClinic, we've already -- we've cited that where 15 to 20% and 25% in some cases are new customers to CVS. So I think we're pulling them from a variety of sources.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Your final question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. First, I'd just like to ask you if you want to comment on your wholesale contract. I think there were some discussions with McKesson and Cardinal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We won't comment on our negotiations with our wholesalers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then another question about the business that you believe will be available for the PBM for 2010. There are &#x2013; do you think that there are a significant number of contracts that are up and how does that compare between what you have to renew and what your competitors have to renew?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I told you last year obviously we renewed a fairly significant amount of renewals, more so than we typically do in the past and we obviously invested in price and you kind of heard me talk about that. So just by that nature we probably have less renewals than some of our competitors.</p>
          <p>As far as the 2010 pipeline, the overall &#x2013; it's kind of reasonable from last year, 8 billion plus, maybe 10 billion out there. We're obviously aggressively going after the appropriate business but we think &#x2013; when you think about renewals, where we are right now at this point in the season, we're essentially on plan and in good shape. And obviously we feel comfortable where we are with some of the new business going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm sorry, I have one final question. The economics of Maintenance Choice kind of assumes that you have excess capacity at retail so the marginal cost of labor is not high. Can you talk about how many stores or what percentage of the store base in fact doesn't have excess capacity and I know you had talked about centralizing some of the function, is that still going on or is that part of how you see the economics of Maintenance Choice working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You have to look at Maintenance Choice, right, it's coming from a few mail facilities being spread across 7,000 stores. So on a store by store basis, it may not be a lot. So there are, I guess, some stores, Meredith, that have capacity problems that you may need to add technicians. But don't forget, we're working on taking work out of the stores with our call centers. But where we are now and the uptake that we have had, which is pretty aggressive and more than we thought that would move from the mail to the retail. We haven't seen any dramatic need to add any incremental payroll in the stores because of that.</p>
          <p>Don't forget, you will hear people talking about the cost that they're taking out of the system, we've been taking cost out of our system for a number of years. We did a whole workflow present project. A few years back in pharmacy that took significant savings out of the pharmacy and improved service. So you had significant savings come out, you had improved service and you had better-engaged pharmacists. So we have already done that and now we're taking it to the next level with the call centers and taking out some of the back-end cost. But overall just keep in mind that these scripts that are going through the stores are spread over 7,000 stores and fortunately, we do have capacity.</p>
