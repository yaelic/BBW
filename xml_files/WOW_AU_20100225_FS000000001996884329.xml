        <plist>
          <p>Welcome everybody. At the earlier media session, we had a bit of a technical challenge, so I believe the hotels band-aided it together given and we're back online again. For those joining us, welcome online. Could I just ask those present with us, it actually helps if lot of people can turn your mobile phone off, otherwise the signal coming in and out actually interferes with the listening capabilities of those that are joining us online. So appreciate if we could show courtesy of giving them a clear line.</p>
          <p>Well, today I'm very happy to announce yet another, in an unbroken line of positive results for Woolies. Positive in that we've been delivering once again, great value to our customers, increasing value to our customers and also we've delivered another double digit profit growth for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I think the real story is actually behind the numbers. We've been investing now, as many in the room know, for best part of a decade in becoming a very, very efficient business. And whilst so we still have some headroom in continuing to becoming more efficient, there is no doubt that we're now in a position to actually truly employ the retail double loop, and that obviously enables us to reinvest savings in costs and savings in &#x2013; that we generate through gross margin management into low prices to drive volume and hence profit and increased returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>I mentioned it at the media, it's little bit like riding a push bike. When you get stronger in the legs, you can actually take the hills in a higher gear and think there is no doubt over the last 10 years we've actually delivered a business that has a much stronger engine that enables us to actually take on peaks and troughs within the economy. And I'd say that that's what Woolies is all about. We're about delivering result after result after result after result in a long term and sustainable fashion.</p>
          <p>And underpinning that was another great result from our food and liquor business, both in Australia and New Zealand, where we had both strong sales and also EBIT growth and market share growth in both countries.</p>
          <p>And I want to just take a minute or so to recognize the fact that in June, Marty Hamnett retires after 40 years mainly in senior management positions with our company in every state except Tasmania, including the territory to the north and he's been a wonderful part of the resurgence of Woolworths in the 80s, a great part of our success story over the last 10 or 15 years and we want to just pay tribute to the fact that he's been such a wonderful contributor.</p>
          <p>So in the very near future, we'll announce to the marketplace our plans to transition a new player into Marty's role whilst he's got a very big shoes &#x2013; we've got to pick with someone with very big feet, so I'm sure we'll be able to fix it. You'll need to excuse me today, I've got a bit of a cough.</p>
          <p>So continuing ongoing investment, new stores, additional services, delivering value, lowering prices. 89 new stores, over a 150 refurbishments. That brings our store total to 3172. We've also got just short of 1000 wholesale customers in grocery, in consumer electronics and in hardware. We launched the home improvement strategy. We had continued investment and also gains in efficiency, in cost reduction and announced our price reductions to the market price that have been well and truly supported and we've got an announcement today that we're recommencing our capital management program with a modest on share buyback program of $400 million and Tom will talk a little bit more about that as we go through.</p>
          <p>So the highlights for the year no doubt everybody has had a chance to look at the numbers, strong growth ex-Petrol at 6%, EBITDA up 10.7%, EBIT up 11.1, NPAT up 11.4, EPS up 10% and ROFE up 23 basis points for 17.7%.</p>
          <p>Just quickly some of the highlights. We've announced that over the last nine months or so that we've reduced 3,500 grocery products and we said so fully in the knowledge that we have very strong legal governance around making announcements like that, that are not factual so, we actually have reduced 3,500 prices.</p>
          <p>The point I want to make is that most of them were done prior to the start of this half. So the half result that we have here for the supermarket group actually includes investment by and large probably 60 to 70% of that prior to us commencing the half.</p>
          <p>We have not cut back on our promotional programs so we still have some 2,000 weekly specials and like we have led the market by having transparency in our pricing position by launching our website and whilst there is only 5,000 lines there at the moment over time we will continue to add till we have our entire range there in the longer term and we'll continue add functionality with each of releases so that we will definitely be at the forefront of being very proud of the price that we bring to our customers in market place.</p>
          <p>The new format rollouts in Australia and New Zealand continue and you can see the percentages there for the supermarkets, for BIG W, for Dick Smith and New Zealand supermarkets that have now be converted to the new branding and new formats. And I would like to say that these don't stay still in time. They will continue evolve and each of the businesses are working on variations on the theme as we speak.</p>
          <p>I'd also say that in Australian supermarkets in particular we are now reverting back to our normal refurbishment program having got the critical mass of the new brands out there to support our marketing in the market place and a variation on the theme in BIG W where our normal refurbishments have turned back to where we are, but we have a version of the 2010C happening in BIG W where we are taking the successful elements of our Rouse Hill store and retrofitting them without doing a major refurbishment to a number of our stores and that will continue in the second half.</p>
          <p>Private label and control brands have once again delivered a great customer offer, but also a great contributor our sales and particularly our EBIT performance for the year. And you can see that we are in the process of revamping our Homebrand so you can see an example of our new packaging for Homebrand up there, new packaging for Select and also a very successful launch of the Macro product not only back in to our Thomas Dux's stores but more importantly into our supermarket group and it's been met with tremendous acceptance.</p>
          <p>In a very short time that Macro chicken filets which is a free range I understand Greg probably is selling as much if not outselling normal chicken filets. It's selling more than chicken filets, chicken filets being a major line. Clearly this is a product that we would like to change the mixing for &#x2013; of this commercial reasons, so it's been a tremendous success for us and we will continue roll out that Macro brand going forward.</p>
          <p>The Everyday Rewards program and the alliance with Qantas continues to provide us with increasing ways of making sure that we understand our customers much better, so decisions around promotions, around ranging etcetera will be far richer in the future than there have been in the past and certainly targeting customers with specific offers is part of that go forward.</p>
          <p>Over 4.5 million cards at the end December. That number's actually risen again since then and 2.1 linked to Qantas Frequent Flyer and that number since the end of half has also risen. The Everyday credit card continues to attract new card holders and with now one total of five industry awards. So the product itself is certainly being recognized by the industry as being a quality product and the Everyday mobile that we launched just prior to Christmas has also been to a really good start.</p>
          <p>Just need to eat this ice.  Sorry.</p>
          <p>We launched a whole new offer that has for those that have the benefit of traveling internationally, would know this is a significant category particularly in the U.S. So we have been at the forefront of launching gift card malls in our stores and not only do they have our gift cards which we have tremendous upsurge in sales in the last half particularly over the Christmas, but also other non-Woolworths gift cards, particularly around iTunes and movie and travel, but also charities, so you can actually get a card and donate a goat or a chook or something like that or make a donation to a particular charity as part of a gift. And we believe this is going to be a very strong category for us going forward. It's off to a great start so far.</p>
          <p>BIG W Optical has also been a great business for us, 23 sites in four states. We'll have 27 by the end. Our average revenue per site I know is far in excess of what the industry achieves. We now have got increasingly the very fashionable brands appearing in the fames and certainly it does complement our focus on home and family.</p>
          <p>Distribution and logistics we haven't stopped. We commissioned the Sydney and Melbourne distribution centers for liquor. The Brisbane Liquor DC will be commissioned in quarter four and we'll be exiting our contract with the Metcash wholesale arm. The Tasmanian regional distribution center construction begins this quarter. The Melbourne and Sydney national distributions centers are having some reinvestment in further making them efficient with some new technology and that will give them increased capacity but also increased efficiency.</p>
          <p>We announced and it would have been noticeable to many in the financial papers that BIG W and consumer electronics have secured, I saw it on the Hoxton Park Airfield and we will have a new national distribution center for Dick Smith that will deliver a reduced cost for them going forward and also a third distribution center for BIG W to support their growth.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand we have the redevelopment of the Wiri DC and that will become a part of the NDC/RDC strategy for New Zealand and it should be completed in FY11. Our global sourcing business where we're converting buying through agents, through buying directly has once again had big growth spurt so the volumes that we bought directly increase by 55% in the last contract of the previous year. And we've also invested in some pretty smart technology that enables us to actually track every order that we have internationally right through the supply chain to our stores. So it certainly has opened up visibility in terms of managing particularly working capital over long lead times it makes a hell of a lot of sense, if you know exactly where things are in the stages of both manufacture and then various channels of supply.</p>
          <p>New Zealand has been a great story, positive in that we have actually made some great inroads by one having positive growth over and above inflation. Number two, we've actually made market share growth which is fantastic. The new offering, the new countdowns have been embraced by the consumer. So wherever we've either refurbishing or opening a new store we're having tremendous sales results. So that's really encouraging for us and more particularly as we've been rolling out the systems that we've implemented, we're seeing some tremendous improvements in in-stock available at store level, service levels out of DCs and of course, tremendously improved our shrinkage results as a result to having the right product in the right place at the right time. So to Peter and the team over there, well done on a tremendous half.  Lot more work to go. So we are not declaring victory by any stage but it's off to a good start.</p>
          <p>Consumer electronics, the new format continues to roll out and we're getting terrific sales results from those of have the new badging. We also, of course, have not just done the rebadge we've got a new range a new price promise, we've invested in people, particularly around their selling techniques and particularly a lot of &#x2013; in technology and with new technologies coming onboard all the time, having the best advice is certainly going to be one of our strategic weapons.</p>
          <p>The Techxperts mobile service in-home delivery, installation, trouble shooting has been gratefully embraced by the consumer and we're seeing really good growth in that area as well.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing is that we refreshed our website in Dick Smith. And over Christmas we were over 100% up in online with Dick Smith, so it really was a terrific result and continues to growth.</p>
          <p>Home improvement, great progress to both Don and to Graham. Firstly with the Danks business under Graham's leadership we're going at quite a pace at integrating the Danks business into the Woolworths and generating synergies not only for Danks but also for the customers going forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Oxygen business, I might also say in terms of Danks that we haven't lost any customers in fact, we're getting lots of interest from people that want to change the color of their store.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Oxygen, we're well-advanced in fact on the properties side, we're probably in year two or three so we said 150 sites within five years. We're well in excess of 40 sites locked in and they are terrific sites all of them.</p>
          <p>The supply chain strategy is well progressed. The IT, the ranging, the store design etcetera. Well and truly on schedule if not a little bit ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>We're investing quite a bit of money in online shopping. We believe that this multi channel approach is going to be something that we need to really strong in. So we have got a team that has been working on a new platform that will eventually form the platform for all of our businesses, obviously different branding upfront and BIG W will be the first that to use new technology and that website will be launched in May and then we'll quickly transition the Dick Smith onto the new platform and then eventually the supermarket and liquor businesses.</p>
          <p>So over to the financial results. Our report card, sales in upper single-digits excluding petrol. We've got a tick. EBITDA outperforming sales growth a tick. The EPS obviously, we didn't have any capital management to assist in the last two halves but we are now going to change that. So we didn't quite get there.  And CODB. We didn't quite get our 20 basis points. We had -- still had good result. Once you take hotels and petrol out of it but we actually had a pretty good result particularly in the supermarkets we had a really strong cost petrol -- sorry supermarkets and liquor had a really strong cost reduction, if you take petrol out of the Group results.</p>
          <p>So we are making a good progress there but we have to give ourselves a cross on that one for this particular period.</p>
          <p>Profit after tax up 11.4. EBIT and I think the important thing here is the underpinning of the strong performance of the Group by the Australian Food and Liquor EBIT. Once again CODB I've already mentioned. Gross profit margin, good improvement and not out of putting prices up despite what some people might say was actually about conversion &#x2013; continuing conversion particularly in liquor of the direct store model to distribution centers, global buying that improved volume of 55% certainly help private label helped. And with our refurbs, particularly in our supermarkets we get a better margin mix and obviously a better EBIT outcome from those as well. All of those have contributed to it.</p>
          <p>Dividend per share up to $0.53 per share up 10.4.</p>
          <p>Now for each division I'll just touch on the couple of the highlights. Once again I'll just say on the supermarkets a great result but I take petrol out of the CODB line, the CODB reduction was terrific particularly when we consider that the inflation dropped away dramatically. I mean there's cost for retailers there's cost built in there.  Our largest cost which is our labor typically through enterprise agreements, somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 depending on the retailer. So when you have less than that in your retail inflation numbers then you really have to work hard to gain the fractionalization cost. So the supermarkets have actually done that. Of course the petrol number actually distorts it.</p>
          <p>I think the other important thing is that during the period in our supermarkets we actually saw comp customers grow very strongly. We saw basket size grow very strongly and we saw market share grow very strongly.</p>
          <p>So once again as the largest player in the marketplace, 1.5 times the size our of next competitor, we're actually growing market shares and we're growing faster than the market and individually we grew market share also in the liquor business than we grew faster than market in liquor.</p>
          <p>In petrol, obviously the price of fuel distorted that number in terms of sales. Our volume in a flat to negative market for the half was positive, comparably of course we added some stations as well. EBIT increased by 12% to 51 million. Our margins were 1.8% up on 1.5 and about $0.02 a liter compared to $0.19 a liter. The ePump facility is now at 400 of our petrol stations.</p>
          <p>Liquor we continue to make tremendous gains in our profitability of our liquor business, particularly through the utilization of the new distribution model also the replenishment models that we have transferred from the supermarket group.</p>
          <p>Private label has continued to be a marvelous contributor to the profitability of our business there and our Dry Dock beer was obviously made possible by our acquisition of a strategic stake in brewery in Western Australia and Dan Murphy in particular has another half of strong growth another 10 stores adding to the 114 or up to 114 now.</p>
          <p>New Zealand, I've probably already spoken a little bit about. I think the important thing there is that the rebranding is moving at quite a pace. So we've got 78 stores for about 52% that are now Countdowns, and by June we should have around about 100. and I'll just restate that we actually have gained market share in the last half in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>BIG W, challenging half particularly come the 8 of December. There was no doubt that we did better than just about every other retailer I think capturing the available stimulus dollars stores and the CAGR I think the important thing for the longer term. I note that several large general merchandise retailers that announced half year sales results actually are still behind their half of two years ago significantly, so I think it's really important in this to look at the longer term here, and in particular I am very comfortable that we've got good underlying volume increases in our business in BIG W.</p>
          <p>In Consumer Electronics, it was the tale of two cities. So New Zealand sales were really, really tough and as result we had a bit over $1 million reduction in our EBIT. However, when I looked at the share data that is available to industry, we actually grew share quite strongly in New Zealand, so if we were down 2%, there were a few that obviously did a little bit worse than that.</p>
          <p>In Australia, however, it's a different story. Profit up 28.5%.  I think was a tremendous result for Deborah and the team, so well done. The new formats, we've got a note here to say the Dick Smith brand which includes the old and the new formats, their comp sales were up 12% in the half. The actual new formats, the ones that have been rebranded are traveling significantly better than a 12.2 on a comparable basis, and we are moving quite apace there.</p>
          <p>Good news out of India; we've actually now hit a breakeven, slight profit, so we are very happy about that. I think we've now had four or five months in a row of positive results, and I understand our partner is also heading pretty close to that same position as well. So it's all good news going forward for us in India. So the growth spurt in stores I think is about to start up again. How many stores we got now? So there is another three stores opened just since this was done.</p>
          <p>Hotels was a tough half. There is no doubt that we got quite a kick from the stimulus particularly in December last year. There had been some changes in statutory regulations particularly around trading hours in Queensland that have put a challenge into all pub owners. What I do know is that for those that we can see the results, and we can't see the results for every pub group, is that we have extremely well against the trend in the marketplace, and I guess the important thing for us is that we have got some really good news coming up with the changes in the Victorian gaming structure, and the auction actually gets underway in the next couple of weeks during March, April.</p>
          <p>So I might ask Tom to, while I rest my voice for a minute, come up and say a few words. Thanks Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone. I'll just go through some of the cash flow and balance sheet results for the year. Firstly, on cash flow, you can see we had a very strong increase in operating cash flow, up 39%, that was clearly assisted by some timing issues on creditors we had last year. But overall &#x2013; but still it's a very credible result.</p>
          <p>We spend about $150 million on buying businesses including Danks, Macro and various other liquor and hotel businesses. CapEx slightly down on the year before, about 873 million. What we are doing on CapEx, you will see in the back of the book that CapEx has &#x2013; our forecast has reduced from where it was.</p>
          <p>There is a few things in there. We have resumed normal levels of refurbishment activity for supermarkets and BIG W, so we are still rolling our 2010 format, and the new format for BIG W but we are just doing it as part of the normal cycle now. We have got to critical mass.</p>
          <p>We've reviewed some of the CapEx spend and just made sure that we are doing it at low cost across various projects, and that's accounting for some of the reduction. There has been some CapEx delay just due to timing of when we are going to build our DCs et cetera. So that's the basic flavor of where CapEx is.</p>
          <p>And we were quite fortunate, we sold about $30 million worth of property during the year, and in this market, I think there was a pretty good result. So overall our free cash flow as a percentage of Net PAT is about 77%. So it's a good increase on last year.</p>
          <p>On our balance sheet just a couple of key points here. Our working capital, our negative working capital increased by about 300 million; that's another good outcome. Our fixed assets have really just increased by CapEx less depreciation, and intangibles have increased purely because of the acquisitions. The other good news story is because our cash results was so strong for the period, our net repayable debt is down by 368 million, so again that's a good outcome.</p>
          <p>Inventory days, inventory days increased by one and a half days. It was due to restocking or stocking the new liquor DCs and an increase in imported inventory. As you see, our volumes have increased quite significantly.</p>
          <p>In our retail businesses, if you take those two components out the stock or the inventory in our retail businesses is actually down 0.8 days. So the efficiency y with which we are managing stock through the business has continued to improve. Shareholder payouts, simple slide, just highlights that, we've returned about $7 billion to shareholders since 2002.</p>
          <p>On capital management, just a bit on the &#x2013; on market buyback. As you know we attempt to optimize our weighted average cost of capital. Maintaining our credit ratings but making sure we have flexibility around growth options and investing capital. Those of you who've probably followed us closely would remember that prior to the global financial crisis, we were actually about to launch into a capital management program of which we pulled back at that time, for obvious reasons.</p>
          <p>We were one of the few companies in Australia not to have to raise equity during the global financial crisis, because of the strength of our balance sheet. Now we can see in the medium term the Australian economy stabilizing, but we've still got &#x2013; you know there is still a lot of uncertainty in global financial markets. So you've still got two or three of the big economies of the globe in recession.</p>
          <p>So we've established a modest share buyback of about, on market share buyback of about 400 million. It's that balance between returning capital, retaining flexibility to continue investing capital in growth options and retaining our strong credit metrics. It will enhance EPS and ROE, and I think the key message it's we're really flagging to the market that it's a start of the program that we had prior to us acquiring several businesses in the past and the global financial crisis.</p>
          <p>In terms of future capital management initiatives I'll always caveat saying we'll assess it at the time in the light of what opportunity is around, the capital markets and the credit ratings but it is a program that we are resuming.</p>
          <p>Our debt is strong we don't have any maturity until March 2011, 350 million Aussie.</p>
          <p>Returns on funds employed has ticked up by 23 basis points and our return on equity dropped to 14.63 simply because of the DRP issues and the issues of shares under the employees share scheme. Thank you Michael.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay this slide, obviously is familiar to many people in the room. Our strategy is about having and maintaining and reporting on clearly stated long term performance targets and we will continue to do so and those targets haven't changed. And we also as Tom has mentioned recommencing our capital management program and clearly we have got stated aims there around how we will conduct that capital management program going forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of the key growth initiatives the two major planks of driving our core business focusing on our customer and reinvigorating offer through investment, price, range, merchandise and quality remain and the nine foundations are still there and basically continue to be part of what we do. So leveraging our supply chain capabilities clearly we've being during that in PL in liquor, in BIG W, developing our customer engagement strategy through EDR, Qantas Frequent Flyer et cetera and then in the future really making sure that we use those customer analytics to drive commercial decisions around our business in a much more sophisticated way then we have perhaps done in the past.</p>
          <p>The mission approach to investment. So once again Woolworth is not in the game of betting the ship and we won't be doing that, but we'll be very, very conservative and make sure that when we do investment, we do it in the knowledge that we are going to give our shareholder's a return.</p>
          <p>The expansion of private label I think we covered before. Financial services capability we have, we've got a prepaid debit account that we'll be adding to our suite of offerings in the very near future and that certainly been a growing certainly off the marketplace that we think we should be in.</p>
          <p>The expansion of the global sourcing activities I've talked about, opportunity to grow market share even in our biggest business we're still only in the low 30s of the market, so we believe there is so plenty of headroom for us. And our space plans for growth.  In our existing businesses we've well and truly got all of the property that we need for the next five years looked down.</p>
          <p>You would have seen from the CapEx program that we're actually invested quite a bit in land and taken over a number of projects because developers couldn't actually get any borrowings from the financial institutions unless they put up basically their kids and their kidney. So it was really important that we didn't stop it, so we've actually upped on the balance sheet, on balance sheet development, but in time we'll actually then flow it back again as we have in the past for thing like the distribution centers. And of course, I've mentioned in terms of our growth for our home improvement business we're well ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>So today, we are reaffirming our sales and earnings guidance, sales and earnings guidance for the financial year. It's no doubt that second half will continue to be influenced by cycling the stimulus packages particularly in the general merchandize businesses and discretionary spending will also be affected by decisions around interest rates, how the market reacts to oil in terms of petrol prices along the Aussie dollar of course. But more importantly, how consumers are feeling about their employment and their sting capability.</p>
          <p>So subject to those factors, we're really affirming that we will get overall sales to grow in the upper single-digit excluding petrol for the full year. EBIT will grow faster than sales for the year and net profit after tax will grow in the range of 8 to 11% over the previous year.</p>
          <p>So I think we're now ready for questions. So let's do it.</p>

          <p>Just a quick one to me in relation to your changed CapEx plans. I remember when plan 10 was first been discussed as the front-end rollout. There was a comments saying that you'd be rolling out refurbishing all stores to the 2010 format, by 2010? I mean I don't know whether that was just an off the cuff comment, but it certainly was a very, very high benchmark. So I'm not going to holding to that specifically, but the fact that you've gotten to 50% of your store base. And you're pointing back to normal refurbishment cycle at a time when the market has broadly been a bit concerned over your CapEx spend, and whether you're achieving returns. Your CapEx spend has broadly been in line or the growth I should say, has broadly in line with your food and liquor sales growth. Is there something to that? Is there a concern with the 2010 format?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...compared to what your competitors and Aldi are doing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. We do PIRs on all refurbishments and new stores. And the PIRs are showing that we are getting the EBIT return that we want from those stores. I know a of people look and think it's all about sales, its actually about the EBIT returns, which is a combination of the sales growth that we get the margin exchange and also the efficiency we get from operating a newer store. So we're very comfortable, we're getting the return. It's actually just saying that we've actually completed the ones that needed a cosmetic change and some internal changes to get the benefit without doing a full refurb because the refrigeration et cetera was in the right place and in good condition. So now what we're doing is just continuing on with that same program that we had all along of refurbishing our existing stores and doing full refurbishments.</p>
          <p>In the back, in the appendix, you'll see that we've actually got some CapEx to sales and depreciation to sales numbers and you'll see that we've actually taken that back &#x2013; slightly back to where we were but we still sit below global norms for businesses our size. And whilst it appears we've gone down, if you have a look at the numbers of stores that we refurbished, it's a significant number and will be.</p>
          <p>The other comment that I'd make is that whilst we talked about 2010 for 2010, we're obviously there and I have made comments to say that there will be a 2015 and to be fair in all our businesses whilst we've got formats that are working really well. The buys are actually working on right now, what's replacing them. So, there will be variations on the theme going forward, that we'll share a few at the appropriate time, but it's work-underway at the moment.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly, well done on the primary result to be able to generate a profit from India in such an environment is an excellent result. Has there been, given that yourself and your partner, Tata, has sort of hit that benchmark if you like, as you suggested, has it been a reassessment of the growth potential there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've always thought we had tremendous growth potential. What did happen was that our partner had some pretty ambitious property plans to begin with but of course what happened, particularly in the major cities, was that property went through the roof. There was a real surge in property values and it was important that we didn't put businesses on the ground with long-term yolks around the neck with high occupancy costs. So, we actually or our partner slowed down quite rightly until the property market cooled off. It has cooled off to a certain extent. So we'll probably start to see it &#x2013; seeing it ramp up.</p>
          <p>I think it's a cultural thing in India that whenever you announce a new business that you're going to put 5000 shops on the ground in the next three months. And that's just &#x2013; I don't know whether it's actually a comment that's made or whether it's the Indian press that tend to put large numbers. But whenever there is a new entry, it always has very ambitious program being announced and I guess we've been &#x2013; always been a little bit more circumspect and pragmatic and have managed our business to what we thought was going to be the appropriate roll-out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Michael. Hi, Tom. I understand what you're saying about the return to the normalized rate of refurbs for the stores; was that always the plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've said this in this room at least twice, that we had two distinct programs going. One was the full refurbs and the other one was the 2010 &#x2013; the other one was the 2010 C which were reasonably new stores that we could change the color of the walls, put the new signs, paint the fridges, everything else was pretty much in place. Do a relay in the store, and we would get for a very small amount, a reasonable return. They will be refurbed in their normal cycle, but the other cycle has continued and that hasn't changed. So we haven't slowed that down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's my understanding from probably the last time we were talking as well. So I'm just &#x2013; I guess getting a bit more clarification on why that refurb number &#x2013; not the number of stores, but the actual dollars spent has been revised. Is it a case that the number of stores, no change to that, but the actual dollars per store is being reduced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually what happens is that we have a plan that might be, say, 24 months where we'll have planned stores to be done, and they do vary a little bit. And what happens is, as you start planning your program six months out, you have various issues that might be around it &#x2013; particularly if you're in a shopping center, getting the agreement with the shopping center owner if you want to expand a little bit or change some element of your store that may be to do with the local municipality and their planning process and how long it takes to get through the DA process.</p>
          <p>So quite often we'll have some that might be pretty expensive that we planned to do in a particular month, and we just push it back and it might go into the next half or the next year, and we'll bring forward another one that appears a little bit easier and sometimes a little bit cheaper.</p>
          <p>So that flux number is something that we pretty much look at each month because we &#x2013; at a property committee we look at the way forward and the guys in the property division just sort to say, this one's looking problematic we'll move that back, we'll bring another one forward.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Are you prepared to offer any sort of guidance today on next year's CapEx or at least give us a view on when we can expect to see some home improvement outflow in terms of getting your sites together...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to say put home improvement to one side, but I would say that what you're seeing at the moment will be pretty much what you'll see. We have got a couple of big IT projects that are underway, and over the next couple of years you will see some payment from there.</p>
          <p>But I think have we actually got an FY'11 forecast in <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Do that a little bit later, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the half year includes what was spent on home improvement but the full year forecast at this stage doesn't, and the reason is the combination between owned and leased, we'll know when we get to the end exactly what that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So obviously in what's included in this result's obviously it's pretty small from owned...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the owned. It's the owned store component. And only those that we've executed. A lot of them have options and are subject to approvals et cetera. They are properly secured but they are subject to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's &#x2013; is such a modest amount an off market one would probably create more enemies than friends, so we thought given the size, it was more prudent to do it on market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that doesn't rule out &#x2013; I mean there are variations on the theme going forward and part of our capital management program going forward, we will consider the three major on market,  off market, specialty variations, combinations going forward that are appropriate for the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just last question, Tom, can you tell us what the average cost of debt was across the half and what that would be, what your expectation is for the next half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't got the average cost of debt, but it was pretty flat. You can see it from our interest expense that our interest expense was pretty much flat for the half compared to last half so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You would expect a similar rate obviously for the second half as well?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably will be, actually, yes, because we've &#x2013;  we've pulled back CapEx. We've got strong cash generation so I'd imagine it would be similar.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Shaun Cousins, JP Morgan. Just a little bit about your recent communications on price. You're now suddenly a lot more vocal on price. What does that say about your value proposition prior to these announcements, and given that you are supposed to touch a very strong gross margin result, is this effectively lower commodity costs, lower currency just coming through in prices and the suppliers just pushing it through and Woolworths just crowing about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Wonderful proposition, but the decisions to reduce prices were done independently.  So, hope that wasn't me. My phone's turned off. The price reductions we did the bulk of them before the start of the half, so we did some in April, some in June then we went into July for that, and then we another lot about September, sorry, November, October, November. So the half result actually reflects our investment for the whole half and the EBIT result we got for the supermarkets includes that investment upfront.</p>
          <p>A couple years back over an extended period and we invested a lot of money in getting just to state based pricing. So and that was a very expensive exercise, but we didn't think that it was appropriate for us to actually crow about it, because what happened was in those country towns, when we actually delivered Brisbane prices to Mossman. People in town actually they didn't need us to tell them, they could actually see it in their basket. So we just let that flow through.</p>
          <p>The areas that we have been talking about of course up to now have been roll backs, which are roll backs that have been for a period of time, these are different, so we've actually made a deliberate decision that we are now at the point in time in our history where we've actually got the supply chain humming like a well-oiled machine that we can now with confidence say, we are going to reinvest in the retail loop by taking our prices down.</p>
          <p>Now we understand very fully our legal obligations in making the claim that we have, so I'm absolutely certain that we took them down, and I can tell you that we didn't go to vendors to ask for that money. We invested on an annualized basis about $120 million, but that's included in the result we've just delivered which was a six plus percent EBIT result.</p>
          <p>So we're already there, we're already at national pricing. We're already delivered 3500 prices with some more to come, because we've said this is a journey. This is a journey that other retailers have been on around the world to grow volume that we're very comfortable that we're going to able to do it and do it profitably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we if we're looking forward in your Australian food and liquor business, I mean your sales per square meter is extraordinarily high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>You're more than 50%, sorry you're almost 50% through your refurbishments to 2010, your supply chain is extraordinarily efficient, does that suggest that when we look forward for EBIT drivers, it's getting to stage where, you've got to reinvest in price to drive operating leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No there are plenty more efficiencies, so the additional liquor distribution center in Brisbane. We've got a large liquor business in Queensland and Northern New South Wales. That's going to be a benefit for us. We increasingly are able to squeeze and fine-tune our replenishment systems. We will increasingly be able to convert buy through third parties, to direct purchasing anything that we import. We have made some major changes and moves in our international logistics, so we're far slicker there but we've got &#x2013; still got room to move there. We've got a myriad of things that we're working on, that will continue to deliver value. The moment, that you think you've got it all done is the moment the game's over and that won't happen, not while I'm in charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given you've got an increasingly competitive environment, Aldi, Coles are getting better, I mean they are not as bad as what they've been in previous years. I mean the risk we see going forward is that you won't be able to sustain the level of EBIT margin expansion that you've been able to achieve or, and let's forget about the margins and sales, just dollar EBIT growth, that you'll won't be able to sustain this, you'll need to do these initiatives, to almost standstill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, number one we won't be standing still. So I talked a little bit about some of the things that we're doing but there are a whole host of other things that we are doing. And I wouldn't underestimate the value of the EDR program in changing the way that we do business and relate to our customers. Very valuable piece of investment there. I think it's really important to just look at the size of businesses. So we've got food business that in Australia that's 1.5 times our nearest competitor. We've got a liquor business that is double our nearest competitor in size, double.</p>
          <p>So for the gap to close or not to get any wider, the lower one needs to in liquor needs to grow at double the rate, the food needs to grow at 1.5 times our rate and we are doing it at 6.5% and someone else is doing at a half that rate. And we've done the investment in prices and national pricing et cetera, et cetera. So we are comfortable that we are in a very strong position and we can actually use that position to move forward because we've done a lot of the hard work, but I can tell you we've got a lot more hard work in front of us. We know what we need to do and anyone that thinks that the end of the golden era for Woolies is on the horizon is sadly, sadly, mistaken.</p>

          <p>Can you just elaborate on that part of your strategy and more generally how you plan to combat Aldi as a competitor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Aldi are a really good competitor. It would be fair that the industry seems to think that their growth spurt has slowed somewhat in the last little while.  We are seeing their parent's really struggling in the home town, or their home country where they've had significant negative sales and slowed dramatically in the UK along with the other discounters there so and we are also seeing it the guys in the U.S. tell me they are seeing the same thing.</p>
          <p>But respect is what you need to give every competitor and that's what we do.  The moment that we don't respect every competitor is the moment we start losing. So they are great company with a really good model and there are things around their private label which their business and our private label and you saw a couple of slides of how we are moving our private label and then more importantly in fresh food, there's not going to be an inch given in fresh food and we understand what we have got to do and we are doing it now and we'll continue to do it.</p>
          <p>Give them the due respect that they should as we should as really good retailers. In fact we've really good retailers. Our major competitor is a really good retailer.</p>
          <p>Our specialists that are outside our door are really good retailers. By and large the independent super markets, the IGA Group, have got some fantastic retailers among them. Competition is out there. We've got to where we are by competing against all of those, and we will need to compete going forward, need to compete against the big warehouse offering that has launched in Melbourne. We just need to continue to do so.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on, you said the global sourcing and the volumes are up 55%, you got to have some sort of baseline.  I'm sure you don't want to give an exact number but can you give us a sense of how important direct sourcing for BIG W.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 100s of millions of dollars. So most of what we , a great deal of we sell in Dick Smith, in BIG W and to a degree in general merchandise in supermarkets comes from overseas. Our modeled until a few years ago was to buy them through third parties that flipped the ticket here in Australia, so now what we are doing is actually going back to where it's made, having direct relationships and in many cases getting a far better product but also getting a far better deal. The downside ofcourse is that we take the title of the goods a little bit earlier as Tom pointed out but net, net we are much better off.  And we can actually manage the supply chain all the way through and in terms of efficiency of shipping and container utilization a whole host of things that all add up over a year, we're just becoming a lot more sophisticated than we were in the past. So the Shanghai office in addition to Hong Kong office is now making writing a great deal of business and we recently opened an office in India to look after the subcontinent.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from UBS just historically you have given a bit of an update of how you're seeing current trade. Just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit across food and also discretionary businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The trend hasn't changed much from what we saw in December. So low inflation in food.  General merchandise, there is still as trail of the &#x2013; out there in the market place, so our volumes are still strong. There is still deflation happening in consumer electronics, so we are still seeing stuff that sold for 1000 bucks last year out there on special out there for 700 bucks particularly in large screen TVs. So there is no easy dollars out there you have to actually work very hard for it. But I am continuing to see market share every number that I get we continue to grow market share, as tough as it might be for all of us in a low inflationary period, it's just as it's tough for the general market [indiscernible .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the BIG W side of things and the general improvement you got there, just wondering if you could give us a bit of a feel for how much of that was driven by your offshore sourcing versus say mix, because obviously electronics gains those sorts of things which are lower margin sound like they've been a bit softer conversely parallel to the other high margin things sound a bit stronger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually being a whole host of things including the ones that you've talked about. The global sourcing certainly has been a contributor. The big change has been a big mix, our apparel business our soft goods business has actually performed amazing well and has been positive -- hasn't actually gone into negative territory at all during this period. So it's been probably the major reason has been the change of mix along with the global sourcing. The big thing that we are seeing going forward is that we are now rolling out the BIG W equipment or modified the Woolworths supermarket order stocker program. CARS I think we call it.  Computer Assisted.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Julie. I call it our order stocker and we are seeing some terrific reductions in working capital in the individual stores as we roll out.  But more importantly improved in stock position and reductions in markdowns etcetera as we have much strong forecasting model to replenish our stores.  I think that will as it has been in supermarkets in New Zealand and in liquor are significant generator of gross margin improvement in the years to come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In the electronics side of things I suppose a little bit of surprise such a big lift in margins when some competitors have reported drops and the mix shift.

          <p>I think Deborah and the team have done a great job. We worked very hard, we have worked very hard on our selling techniques. Any one can sell the computer that's on special for 999 where you make no money. You need really good sales people to sell the case, the cable, the extended warranty etcetera which is where make your money. I think we have made tremendous strides in converting both our commission basis, but also selling techniques so that we get the guys and girls to understand that just selling a computer or flat screen without the aerial, without the cables, without the bracket and all that sort of stuff is a zero sum gain. I mean it's good dollars but it' s not great EBIT so you've got to make sure that guys and girls that work for you understand were the profit is.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. You stated an intention to employ the retail loop in supermarkets in Australia. Do you foresee a ramp up in prospective activity in that market and I guess potentially a continuation of lower food inflation beyond the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't seen any ramp-up in we're seeing it in the liquor but I wouldn't say we're seeing any ramp up in food pricing competition. I think we have jumped out there, we are yet to see any quite reaction on the shelf yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess, when you talk about re-importing the retail loop is that I guess to us and to the market that will be aggressively investing in price going forward?'</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in terms of BIG W, Target saw a 250 basis point margin improvement BIG W 22 basis point improvement. Both are very well run businesses. But both benefited from a positive margin mix into apparel in the half and both had I assume some FX benefit from un-hedged suppliers. Is there something that which we considering as to why the BIG W margin expansion was less than Target.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you'll need to ask how it was achieved in the other retailer. I mean it was a big jump and if you guys are doing your job you'd know why they achieved that. We are here today and answering questions on how we got where we got to. I don't have vision of how other peoples got to -- other people got to where they got to. I think the important thing is just to look at long-term trends and to see whether that's a step change or whether it's one that might be a release of a provision whatever it might be but that's your job to find that out not mine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so that wasn't a one-off, one off event, reinvestment in price <mark type="inaudible" /> that held back the margin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...which looks at harm immunization for gambling. Did you have any input into that report? And is that something that you're concerned about in terms of gambling &#x2013; growth in gambling revenue going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we did have input to it formally and informally. I think the important thing to do is to recognize one of the things that's been downplayed, and that is the incidence of problem gambling in this country has actually halved. Since the last study was done from 2% down to 1%. So we'll have to wait for what comes out, and of course what comes out will apply to everybody. I think the commission will come out with their recommendation, of course the regulation of gaming is actually state based and whether states actually take up any of the recommendations.  I do note that many states have come out on some of the more broad and deeper meaning suggestions in the draft of the productive -- commission but they wouldn't be party to it so. It will be &#x2013; we should just wait till it comes out and see what the state <mark type="inaudible" /> governments reactions to it are but they've certainly signaled but they are not &#x2013; state governments are not looking for large changes in their revenue base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wonder whether first of all you can confirm, given the moving parts the <mark type="inaudible" /> on a normalized basis, there was actually a step in gross margin there.  And secondly I guess my take on it is that given your optimizing your business <mark type="inaudible" /> that further reinvestment in pricing during the half wouldn't have achieved enough payback to compensate for the lower gross margin. I'd like your comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, first one is I can absolutely confirm that the gross margin improvement came from the items that I mentioned before. What I can tell you in our supermarket business and in our liquor business is that our cost inflation, that is inflation in our cost from our vendors to us was significantly higher then our sell inflation, which points to one fact and that is we funded it. We didn't ask the vendors to do it, otherwise was cost inflation would have come down.</p>
          <p>Number two, you're absolutely right. Our studies and our knowledge and conversations with major retailers around the world about the double loop is this is a long-term sustainable growth proposition. This is now a quick fix return on switch and automatically it happens. It's actually about reaffirming in the consumer's mind who delivers the best value over the long-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay but there was an opportunity to invest more in price presumably.  Given the gross margin went up, you made the decision that that investment wasn't worthwhile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did the last one in October, November, then we're into Christmas.  And quite frankly doing something Christmas would just get lost in the whole mix and hullabaloo of the season. So, just stay tuned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay <mark type="inaudible" />.  Is this the right time to be <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually our competitive position vis-&#xE0;-vis our competitors improved, so particularly against the discounter in the marketplace and I am looking across at David and Mary who are here from New Zealand today, so our product position is stronger and clearly our sales result is showing that. As we move &#x2013; transition to our Countdown brand, we actually change the nature and the mix of it and become even more competitive, and the benefits that we've got in New Zealand has actually come from all the things that they're basically the equivalent of the Australian business, but because they are early days we're picking a big bunch of low hanging fruit. So just getting the right amount of stock at the right place at the right time and using order stockup to order and manage our fresh foods, et cetera, has  made tremendous difference.</p>
          <p>We also spent a lot of time in things like our meat plant and making them far more efficient so our yield management has been far better.  There's a whole host of things the guys and girls have done over in New Zealand to improve their second margin.  That is once we set our first margin to be competitive, making sure that the things that attack that first margin are mitigated through the use of systems.    And of course there's been also the benefit of a much increased private label program and also been the benefit of a much increased global sourcing program</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering, if you could quantify what the drop in cost of doing business was for Australian food and liquor. Because I have to say it's been a long, long time, since there's ever been a cross on your report card for the cost of doing business as a Group, not reducing by 20 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I can say is if we had have had normal inflation in December, the supermarket and liquor group probably would have had their one of their best cost of doing business results that they have ever achieved. So they actually had a really good result obviously going into December that drop in inflation changes the fractionalization model somewhat until you readjust, and which Greg has done, but once we take petrol out, I was very, very pleased with the number, but unfortunately we won't be quantifying it because then people would be back solving all sorts of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My back solving is it's between five and 10 basis points, but I dare say you probably won't confirm that</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mike you -- one thing it doesn't concern me, but it just intrigues me about your average inventory days</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going from 32.4 to, 33.9. Now I understand why and from an efficiency point of view I understand that your average inventory days have gone down 0.8 days, but taking that into account, your average inventory days as a company is increasing by about 2.5 days in a year. And that's a fairly significant jump and I can't help but think that's going to increase your cost of doing business whether it be increased handling costs or whether it be increased of wastage et cetera because you are taking ownership at the stock a lot earlier than what you've already historically done. And I'm just intrigued how that average inventory day will go to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So looks that's a very good question and in the absence of the tracking of orders. what you could see, if you hadn't managed it is exactly the scenario that you talk about and that is, you get a big lump of stock all turn up and you can't fit it into your DC So what's really important is to try and manage your long lead supply chain in the same JIT fashion that you do for your domestic one. And we do that across from Sydney to Perth and all that sort of business right now.</p>
          <p>Because if you don't you're absolutely correct you'll actually clog up your DC. So we work very, very hard at making sure as we grow our volume and it's probably while we've been a little bit slower start in converting, because up until then you've got the luxury of an agent holding all the stock and you just bring it in. is making sure that you don't just order a season's lock at once, you actually use your forecasting capability.</p>
          <p>And that's where the introduction of CARS into BIG W, the version of order stocker is going to be critically important in making sure that we then use those daily, and weekly and monthly forecasts to actually JIT with mix containers rather getting a whole container of everything and using consolidation techniques and tracking techniques overseas to do that, because if you don't what you describe is absolutely on the cards.  So we obviously spent a long time to walking to others particularly the Wal-Marts of the world about how to do this, really efficiently.</p>
          <p>And we learned some really good lessens on how to do that. So you are right -- the taking title is an issue for us, but you then need to work on your settlement terms and you also need to take into account the quite material benefit that you get in terms of your cost of goods. So net sum &#x2013; it is something that we think is going to generate a lot of value for us going forward, so won't be building any DCs to manage this. We will manage within the capacity that we have <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mike. If I can just add the benefit we are getting in the gross margin, because our buy price is cheaper for liquor and our buy price is cheaper for the imported inventory well offsets the additional holding cost having in the inventory otherwise you wouldn't do it, including the time value of money. So that's the equation, but you know the more we source from overseas the reason we are doing it is the buy cost is cheaper and clearly the buy cost of liquor is cheaper and that's why we have gone to a direct store delivery market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But David the point you are making is absolutely correct. If you don't do it in a very measured and sophisticated way you can bring yourself undone and that's something we have been very focused on and very cognizant of from the moment that we started.</p>

          <p>Hey Phil.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Mike. Just a question on private labeling the non-food businesses, could you give us a sense of how big that is now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In BIG W, it's a significant part of our business and because they don't have Homebrand on them all it's a pretty significant part. So, yes we have got a lot of brand but also we have got a lot of brands that we own.</p>
          <p>In liquor it's a significant part of our business. In Dick Smith, it's a very much increasing part of our business. So there are a lot of brands that are exclusive to us and we're actually taking a bit of lead out of India, who have through our sourcing office in Shanghai and Hong Kong have rapidly ramped up their private label account in consumer electronics in the last little while. So we think that there is some great synergies in that regard that we'll bring back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. [Indiscernible So when you talked about direct sourcing it's not only increasing what you currently do in private label but private label will presumably be also growing maybe faster than....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So food generally and a great deal of liquor's domestically sourced in private label. Most general merchandise including consumer electronics pretty much is international.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that included with the mix shift in BIG W completely change your thinking about long-term margins in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Long-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It' certainly if that change is a permanent one. It certainly seems to be that way. Georgia and the team in apparel have really changed the whole look and feel of our apparel business and things like the intimate apparel and the great offers in the bulk underwear et cetera really changed the nature. Footwear has been a fantastic category for us in the last 12 months, probably 18 months.</p>
          <p>I could probably see that that will change because we have actually exited quite a number of in hardware for instance. We have exited except for key markets, like full <mark type="inaudible" />, et cetera so we don't have big paint sections anymore. We have used that space to move into more space for underwear, more space for baby et cetera et cetera.</p>
          <p>So a part of our plan was to do that and it's pleasing to see that we actually -- have been &#x2013; recently successful in doing it. But there's a way to go yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to clarify, you said the unit day sales were broadly similar to December does that mean comps are still negative in December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From time to time we've been struggling to get positives but the beauty is that volumes are still moving on nicely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. It's actually for Michael so it's on. Can I just take your opinion on three things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. One at a time, I am getting old so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't remember it anyway. The way you see is there a price war in food and liquor and could I just describe price war. I mean there's competition but when does competition become a price war and has it reach that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no price war out there at the moment so we've certainly made some pricing positions. We're yet to see any response other then words at the moment.  In liquor there has certainly being strong competition right across the industry but that's being going on for best part of two years so I would say no price war that I see at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just thinking about the productivity loop are there any limitations to 6% revenue growth driving 10 or 11% impact growth into the foreseeable future for you and the limitation I want to call out is inflation.  At what level of inflation may that your business model in Australian food and liquor not generate that sort of outcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'd basically had what was the half inflation Greg? Have you got that there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was one and a bit for the half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>1.6 for the half. The longer term number is in that two to three mark which is a nice comfortable one because two to three is where you've got your major costs of labor for instance. You've got energy for everybody going up in a quite dramatically so your investment in sustainability in reducing energy cost is going to be very important and thankfully we've made a great head start on that.</p>
          <p>So at zero inflation it really sorts the men out from the boys and our team, men and women they understand what they need to do. But it becomes &#x2013; if you have a zero inflation it becomes a bigger challenge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just take the actual model does it work at 1.6?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Greg , if you go back a couple of years we were running for must have been three years on less than 3% inflation and the model worked then &#x2013; but when you have a rapid decline in inflation like we did this year adjusting that model very quickly is difficult to say and that's what we had in two months the inflation came off quite dramatically so the answer to your question is we've done it before so there's no reason why it can't be done again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know we've probably spent a last couple of years talking about customer facing things but under no illusion as to our focus on costs within the business. A dollar was still worth a dollar in voice and if we are going to spend we need to know where we are going to spend it. So in low inflation time you just need to refocus even harder in doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the last one have you any plans to sort of reverse your position on factory gate prime and freight and return control to the vendors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. because we've had a significant better service level out of it. We proved time and time again we have actually reduce the cost for the vendor, particularly for the small and medium  &#x2013;  now the big guys like the Coca Cola's that have got specifically designed transport for their products, very efficient, we don't want to change that. But for the small, medium guy, that's got mixed loads, one, we can do it cheaper for them. Number two, our service level into our DC which is then eventually translates into a much better service at store without lifting your working capital at the DC to support it. It's just it's like night and day quite frankly.</p>
          <p>Because they know when the Woolies trucks is coming up to warehouse, the trailer better be full because we're not going to be hanging around for it and that's not good for them if it's not ready for us. And it's a win-win for both of us, quite frankly.</p>
          <p>You're sitting with the enemy there, you realize that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Hi, guys. Just, it's Paul <mark type="inaudible" /> from Deutsche Bank.</p>

          <p>Hi, Paul</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick ones. The one was the buyback. Obviously, I understand the sort of conservative $400 million. Can you give us some indication that to have maintained the credit ratings, what number you could have pushed that to and still maintain your A minus and whatever the other one is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. I'm going to try another one and <mark type="inaudible" /> Just in terms of market share, particularly in the Australian business...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You spoke a bit about the competition, but you didn't really say where the share was coming from and obviously we have a situation where people are claiming flat or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the problem is we can actually see in consumer electronics, but in food, a lot of people pack up their bongos because it's unflattering and have retreated into every market or the rest. So we can only look at the rest and what I'm seeing week after week for an extended period of time, except for one or two weeks where there is a mismatch of a particular event, is that our growth is higher than the market and higher than the rest, which includes Coles, Metcash, SPA etcetera. So if you're the biggest and you're actually growing fast in the market, mathematically, it says the gap between you and the other, by definition has to get bigger, it's just &#x2013; you can't escape that.</p>
