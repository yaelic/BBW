      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We start. Leonid Fedun. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome you in our office. Today, we would like to traditionally show you our nine-month results. At the same time, we would like to speak about those strategic innovations of our company, which had been decided by the Board of Directors sometime ago, but we couldn't actually shed enough light on them because we had a lock-up period. So we couldn't really spread this information about placing our Eurobonds in non-American and American markets. So that was just a normal statement made when we said that we were planning or we were hoping, it actually meant that they were meant just what they did. So anyway, we would like to start with the first slide.</p>
          <p>You know, that it's the third consecutive strategic development program. The development strategy in the company has built like this. First of all, we'll make up a strategic development program, which believes that the company make some assumptions for the forthcoming period of development.</p>
          <p>We absolutely know that we cannot plan ahead, just a few more years ahead because the company's activity really depends on some uncertain factors like some hydrocarbon market situation and financial market volatility, some supply and demand change. But, some major targets that the company may set &#x2013; need to be set. So we set a 10-year long period of planning, should I say, vision for the next 10 years of how the company should be changing. So we also set up a three-year plan and we do some planning and then an annual plan is made. So that's how the system works.</p>
          <p>For the six years, which have elapsed since we started setting up our strategic planning model, we have not completely created by some analysts, by some politicians, some changes which have been accumulating for these six years and these changes have been so revolutionary. And I think some people don't speak about them unlike some issues about global warming or H1N1 issues, because these people are not really interested in making this promoted.</p>
          <p>Since we have certain uncertainty of the future, knowing that we decided to take that into account, setting up our future development program. So what are the reasons for us reconsidering this program? We decided to do so, because of the global financial crisis, huge volatility which is still growing and judging by the existing economic model. We know that this volatility is going to carry on for a very lengthy period of time showing some ups and downs and agree with Minister Kudrin completely that next year we'll also see some downturn in the financial markets. That's why we have to deal with the risks growth.</p>
          <p>There is a high level of uncertainty on the world hydrocarbon market, because some people say that oil is going to be $200 per barrel, are long gone. We've got enough oil, but we have to have certain technologies to recover. We have enough gas, but we have to apply technologies to produce this gas. This &#x2013; there is this demand, which is moving from Europe and America to different countries with a higher growth. Those countries, which still have to satisfy these needs, I mean, China, India to a certain extent, India and to a certain extent Russia. That's what we see how the market is going to be developing in the future. We're going to see some growth during the gas production and oil production.</p>
          <p>After pondering for quite a long time fueled by the crisis, we decided to change this model. Moving from the growth of oil production, we decided to make this production more optimal. So this strategy is focusing on the financial stability and value growth, optimization of hydrocarbon production level due to the market conditions change. Thus, we're going to decrease of planned capital expenditures, focus on dynamic growth of free cash flow and higher shareholders returns. These are this three main bullet points that our new strategy focuses on.</p>
          <p>New strategy is focusing on increasing the free cash flow unlike the program for the year 16, where the free cash flow would have to grow up by four times. It is done by curtailing the growth of the capital expenses, decrease of the tax burden and increasing efficiency and scale of operations of the company.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. At the same time, our company will secure growth of production, it's not going to be as significant as we planned before, because that growth involved significant capital expenses and thus we also saw serious financial risks involved. Instead that we have to think about 2.7 million boe per day where the free cash flows is the optimal number for our company.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. One of the legends, which exist in the market says, that in the world and in Russia as well, we have a lack of reserves and people start speaking about the necessity of drilling it in the Arctic Offshore Eastern Siberia. But I've just given you some example, this 3P Group reserves, certain &#x2013; there is a certain risk involved, but it's all the matter of the technology and the money. The reserves are great, huge and considering the recent changes in the gas and oil production in North America, we believe that these reserves are enough just to cover our needs in Western Siberia for the next 100 years, I am not talking about these extreme offshore production projects. The revolution, which is occurring in the oil production is not a nanotechnology revolution, it's not so interesting, but it's a revolution indeed and not so many people see this revolution and take a note of it.</p>
          <p>Some of the reserves, which were considered non-recoverable have been put in production in some places and SEC has actually changed to the standards and they treat this so called shale gas. Normally, those reserves which could not be developed in the few &#x2013; in the past are now recognized. Anyway, we're going to focus not the presence of the reserves, but on the possibility of generating enough cash flow and bringing down the production costs and capital expenses for the development.</p>
          <p>Thus starting the year 2010, we're going to apply the SEC standards to our reserves, because previously, we just dealt with apples and oranges. We applied the SPV reserves with Western companies using SEC standards. So we compared apples with oranges and it turned out that we had huge reserves and previously a Russian model to what we call reserves model is applied. But SEC considered just those reserves, which have very high time efficiency considering the existing cost model.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. Our company demonstrates high geological exploration efficiency. We keep on growing our reserves. And it is not just in the territory of the Russian Federation, but also abroad. We expect a significant increase of such reserves as in Russia with use of new technologies and abroad by having nice discoveries, lucky discoveries, in Africa for instance.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. It's certainly pleasant to say that the Russian government has announced that they are going to open more licenses for more investors. Just I would like to raise your attention to the fact that, draw your attention to the fact that, currently we keep getting licenses for developing new fields. In 2008, we acquired more than 60 of such licenses.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. What is the reason of the deviation from the 2017 program from the 2019 program? It was because that we decided to postpone a part of the gas projects. First of all, we decided to postpone the Caspian project, the Central field in Astrakhan, and some Yamal projects. It could be explained very easily, because you know that there was a harsh decrease of the gas consumption in Europe. It has dropped by more than 20%. If there is a new methodology of the Kyoto Protocol adopted, which we believe is a global lie, just like swine flu. This gas consumption will drop even more, plus two more things. First of all the non-conventional gas production, more than 300 bcm in the USA and approximately by the way they produce about 120 bcm this year without actually promoting it that much, and also they've got colossal reserves of such unconventional gas in Europe. So we believe we are going to encounter a significant problem exporting our gas to Europe in the near future.</p>
          <p>So the situation is not stable. We don't know what's going to happen with the marketing of gas. And I believe very soon, the return from selling hydrocarbons in the internal market is going to be higher than exporting them. So we have therefore decided to postpone the development of these gas projects and we have decided to focus only on those projects, which have very high value.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. Considering all the aforementioned, LUKOIL is going to increase our gas production. We have an advantage, because we have very low lifting costs. For example, these natural gas and unconventional gas, with unconventional gas it's five or six times less expensive to produce, which gives us a huge competitive edge.</p>
          <p>Also we have very low production and infrastructural expenditures, which will help us generate significant cash flow. Knowing the existing price scenario, we expect that for the next 10 years, we are going to get a free cash flow which is higher than $6 billion.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. CapEx optimization. In the Exploration &amp; Production segment, previously, the previous program thought that if we are going to spend at approximately $75 billion on the E&amp;P. We have decided to optimize it and we believe that we are going to spend approximately 60 billion on this program &#x2013; 60. The program significantly optimizes the outcome by approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Now, we're focusing not on projects like previously of the &#x2013; supporting the mature projects, we are focusing on the new projects and some projects located outside of Russian Federation. The production goes down, but free cash flow was going to increase by more than $20 billion with the existing conditions, with the scenario that I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>So on the next slide, we can see the new strategy for refining. Unfortunately, public's opinion is wavering, just like before in the Soviet days. Currently, people think pessimistically about refining and distribution marketing, but we believe it's a very important segment in the Russian Federation. The investments that we're going to put in the refining are going to give approximately 8 billion of free cash flow. We are going to have the growth of light oil products by 60% and we're going to have Group refines average Nelson index as high as nine.</p>
          <p>As far as Europe is concerned, for the next few years, they're going to close down from 10 to 14 refineries in Europe. And I believe those refineries &#x2013; the profit margin is going to go back to the one which we had before the crisis five, $6 per barrel. So we're going to have very good return from the current numbers. Knowing the fact that Europe is experiencing significant problems with this, we decided not to increase their refining capacities and keep them at the current level, all the increase, which will occur is going to be done at expense of the launch in new refineries.</p>
          <p>If there are some quality changes within the next five or six years, we're going to develop that. But refining capacity to production ratio is planned to be 75%. We are going to focus the &#x2013; on the development of petrochemicals and power generation. We're going to get approximately $4 billion of the free cash flow from this. And we are going to monetize our gas reserves. We are going to have our own gas distribution system, which will allow us to have a good level of gas utilization and increasing of its marketing &#x2013; market price.</p>
          <p>CapEx priority. We're going to focus on modernization of the existing refineries in Russia. We believe that what the government has announced about the measures stimulating the refinery like, for example, using the uniform tax to all of the hydrocarbon refined products, which is going to be approximately 55%. We are going to get from it approximately $8 billion. So we are going to go down on the amount of the heavy oil, currently a lot of companies believe the opposite. And by the way, at the last meeting, our Prime Minister said that the new taxation system is not going to be postponed and we believe it's one of the major advantages that our company has. The production of the fuel oil is going to go down by more than 14% as I said.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. Petrochemicals. Petrochemicals are a very important project, which is intended for utilization of gas. We believe that approximately 2 bcm of gas that we get from our Caspian project is going to be based in Budennovsk where we're going to construct our Caspian Gas and Petrochemical complex. This gas will cover all the possible needs for polypropylene and polyethylene, going to use innovational technologies there.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. The same applies to the power generating assets, despite the crisis that we are having, prices for gas and heat are going up, so we're going to have approximately $2.3 billion of the free cash flow producing seven to 8 bcm per year. With the limited investments and the gas to buying power plants share is going to go up and is going to take a very big segment in the structure of our power generating assets.</p>
          <p>Well, in conclusion of the first part of my presentation, I should say that first of all we are going to keep the right balance, proper balance between the growth rates and financial efficiency. We are going to have this transition from the extensive production to the efficient one and increase of the accumulated free cash flow by three times, well, increase the shareholders' returns and we're going to have the level of the return as high as 30%, so also by some buybacks of our stocks and shares from the market.</p>
          <p>Some financial numbers for the nine-month of 2008, for those of you who have been monitoring it, you have seen it on our portal, on our site, we had published it there. So basically here, I should say the following: they are little bit lower than the market expectations and some of our major competitors showed worst results and nobody actually reproached them with that. Despite the crisis, we have shown a higher level of net income $2 billion and free cash flow $1.3 billion, which is the most important thing in the high volatility environment. Some macroeconomic and tax environment in comparison with the second quarter, the prices have gone up.</p>
          <p>What's important that the prices have gone up by 16%, but the export duty has gone up by 68% and mineral extraction tax has gone up by 24%. So the taxes were growing very fast and this definitely impacted the financial results of our company and many other companies. So, Mr. Kudrin's plan is really working here and it's as you can see.</p>
          <p>At the same time, if we have a look at this next slide, the situation is slightly different on this one, the price is going down and the mineral extraction tax is going to decrease, but this produced this effect mainly in the second quarter, but transportation tariffs grew up and electricity tariffs also went up by 15%.</p>
          <p>Next slide. So, the main operating results, oil production has increased by 3.3%, but the marketable gas production has decreased by more than 20%, because of those restrictions implemented by Gazprom when they could not sell their gas in the Eastern and Western Europe. So that was the signal, which was not just by coincident, we are thinking about this long-term considerations, that's why we decided to reconsider our strategy and also the marketable sales of hydrocarbons dropped down because the demand went down.</p>
          <p>On this next slide, you can see that we have been increasing our refining volumes and refining margin as part of the fact that <mark type="audio gap" /> cash went down, still remains at the level higher than the year 2007. At the same time the refining capacities utilization was higher than the 1.25 billion barrels. So some reasons and causes for less income earned, analysts thought that our income is going to be 4% higher, so what are the factors that analysts missed, First of all, the limited gas purchase volumes and group marketable gas production also shrank, we were $100 million short.</p>
          <p>And the second factor is that campaign the result of the FAS pressure on LUKOIL and many other companies FAS blocked the prices, because oil prices did not go down, but wholesales and retail prices were brought down because of these administrative measures, thus it resulted in another loss of $120 million. These are the numbers that we could not earn, so you have to take these numbers into consideration too, because it applies to all the other companies, I believe, almost all of them. And Mr. Artemyev who actually was involved in that. Some financial results, you have seen that these numbers I believe doesn't make any sense for them to go through them if you have questions, later on I will just try to explain them.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses, unlike our competitors, we've been able to control operating expenses, despite the ruble appreciations, the hydrocarbon lifting costs have gone up just by 8.6%, and we have even decreased our refining expenses. That was it with the operating expenses. The ruble depreciation was 17%. The prices in ruble show that we have been able to control the costs by having proper work with our suppliers and contractors. Thus we have been able to control operating costs.</p>
          <p>Transportation expenses were growing in all of the companies. First of all, the pipeline transportation prices went up despite the crisis and it really worries us that they're going to introduce the uniform transportation tariff for oil transportation. Both eastwards and westwards, Rosneft is going to be the main beneficiary. They're going to utilize the eastern direction. Currently, they are paying the highest tariffs, because they are sending their oil to China.</p>
          <p>Administrative costs were even lower, so if we check these numbers for the nine months, we have been able to shrink them. Net income reconciliation is shown here. So the main reason here is the increase of the net income, increase of the depreciation and two more factors, which are noted here. First of all, bringing down our gas exports and some regulations of the consumer prices by Federal Antimonopoly Service.</p>
          <p>Cash flow reconciliation, we have been able to have approximately $1.5 billion and free cash flow is $1.3 billion for Q3 2009. CapEx breakdown, the main part goes to Exploration &amp; Production, but previously all the other sectors have been significantly changed. You have seen that there has been a significant reduction of the expenses in downstream by 30% in comparison with the previous year. Still we keep on developing our international projects.</p>
          <p>Again the structure of the capital costs does not really meet the targets that we had set for our 10-year long program. The change was 43%, because we have not considered any acquisitions, but we do not say no to further possible acquisitions in the future. Still company maintains very strong competitive position in the industry. We have had one of the lowest levels of our capital expenses, have enough free cash flows unlike our competitors including Russian competitors and our profit per barrel, net income per barrel is at the high level despite the high level of taxes, which basically proves that LUKOIL maintains its strong competitive position. And in the end, we have to praise ourselves. These have been our achievements in Investor Relations in 2009; I would like to remind that we are the best in terms of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>And the last slide, what are the main conclusions here? We're going to optimize capital expenses, increase the hydrocarbon production and increase the development of the R&amp;M segment. We're going to develop a program aimed at securing possible positive cash flows and have a conservative financial policy. The state has actually started evolving in the oil producing industry.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we for the first time encountered the situation when the tax burden was not increasing, which we know, but in the year 2011, we will have to be spending more on social purposes because the uniform social tax is going to be cancelled. But by that time, we're going to reconsider the number of the employees and increase the productivity of labor. Thank you very much for your attention and I'm going to take your questions. Yes, please.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pavel Kushnir from Deutsche Bank. You have mentioned that the company is going to increase the dividend payments from 15 to 30%. But what about those requests from LUKOIL to bring down the taxes with new projects in Caspian region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said that, it would be in the end of this next 10-year long period. The strategy we have shown you is the existing strategy, which will allow us to produce 2.7 barrel &#x2013; barrels, 2.7 billions of oil per year. So if the government is interested in the increase of the production, they're going to do some tax holidays, which just share the existing ones. So, I don't think that there is any discrepancy here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrei Gromadin from JP Morgan. Could you please tell us what kind of oil prices you consider in the new strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>64. That's for the barrel of oil and ruble is going to be 34.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Some questions regarding downstream projects. Downstream refining and marketing investments are going to be 25 billion, but the government has been considering the bringing down of their duties for heavy and light products and shrinking the spread, just Rosneft is discussing this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it seems like that you are supporting Rosneft in what they are doing. But their Prime Minister told all of us that there is no other way of improving the situation than improving the refining. There was an assignment given. We're going to provide better refining and we're going to continue moving on this course. I don't think that any company is going to change this policy. Once the spread between refining and export is removed, everyone is going to export it and we're going to remain with the bad quality gasoline. We're going to have a lot of environmental problems. Therefore, no &#x2013; no one wants this. You see, there are lot of opportunities like global change of the climate or may &#x2013; we may face some other problems, but these are the things that we cannot predict.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two more questions, one is upstream related. You said that the priority is given to the new projects, and seems like that you're going to do it where it is most profitable for you. In those regions where it's not profitable, we're going to decrease the drilling. We know that LUKOIL drilling has dropped down by 25% this year, are going to expect further decrease of the drilling volumes by LUKOIL next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe, our drilling is going to increase in comparison with the previous one, but non-significantly. As far as West Siberian fields are concerned, the existing fields, where the existing technologies, where the existing investments are no longer lucrative. From Budyonnovsk, we produce approximately 100,000 tons of oil. It's the field, which has approximately 30 billion tons in Western Siberia. It's &#x2013; it couldn't be recovered here by our technologies. It could be done in America, because they have technologies, but their production costs are higher than $100. You see it's too expensive to produce. It's too expensive to recover. And I have mentioned the press about one ton, to produce one ton you have to pay $100. So I believe there will be demand for oil with quite high prices, and some tax holidays will be implemented, and when this occurs West Siberia share of production is also going to grow.</p>
          <p>Judging from the existing model, when we've got stimulus, with the new projects, we have to focus on the new projects with a higher return on investment. If the macroeconomical situation changes, we are going to go back to the towns and cities with the existing infrastructure. It's just a matter of money and experience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question regarding petrochemicals, you have shown us one slide with lots and lots of numbers, I don't remember all of them. Could you bring back the petrochemicals slide with all the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe its slide 15.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to be a huge decrease on demand on petrochemicals, but at the same time you are going to launch new capacities in the East and Asia, so when are you going to launch these new capacities in LUKOIL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to start it in the year 2015, in the year 2015, a refinery in Lokosovsky with lot and lot of wet gas, which is going to be refined here. We've got lots of large-scale projects, but we know that there's been a decline and the housing construction is experiencing crisis, and polyethylene is only demanded by the construction companies. But we believe crisis is going to end in the near future and our polyethylene production is state-of-the-art one and very efficient and we believe that this Caspian gas and petrochemical complex is going to completely satisfy their needs. We import approximately 1.5 million tons of propylene and polyethylene. So we are going to replace these import numbers by our production are going to use very cheap associated gas as the source for producing these polymers. Thus we are no longer facing the need to burn and flare this gas and therefore we're going to have very good cash flow from it. Definitely, their profit margin is low from such a production, but it's because of the crisis. It lasts for about four years. By the end of this cycle, we are going to face new growth cycle. So I believe we're going to hit it right in the year 2015. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a few questions. First of all, could you please tell us, how much oil, not oil equivalent are going to produce per day, then you mentioned that some of your people are going to be spin-off the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's just do it in turn. Oil production is going to be approximately two million per day. I am talking about oil and condensated, it's going to be approximately two. With the existing model, it would get more -- tax holidays, we're going to produce even more. As far as spinning off some of our people of the company, we'll have to wait for the final answer, such a project exist and we're going to prepare it by the 2011 when some changes are introduced in the social legislation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">

          <p>So when it's going to be considered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Within a year. The next question then. Our Minister of Interior, mentioned this pipeline of, this pipeline is not far away from our oil fields. We're not going to close them down. We have a terminal, which could be used for exporting this oil. As far as macroeconomic parameters are concerned, we are ready to develop this field.</p>

          <p>Hello, Masha Radina, Nomura. I've three questions, the first one is regarding paying the dividends and the net profit percentage, which is spent on paying the dividends. It's good that you are going to make it as high as 30%, but what can investors expect further on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some investors have scared us maybe we're not doing, but anyway what do we expect on the year '11 and '12, each year despite the crisis, we have been increasing the amount of dividends paid, we're going to increase the amount of dividends paid each year regardless of the financial situation. If there is a positive level of the development of the market, the dividends are going to be higher. Talking about the net income, it doesn't really matter for you. It really matters for you how much is going to be 50 rubles, 60 rubles, or 70 rubles. I cannot tell you exactly, but I know that it's going to be higher than previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. The press release that you released on November the 19th mentioned that your company is going to buy back your own shares from the market, do you have any specific plans on buying back the shares, do we need to expect these in three years' times &#x2013; three years time, or it was just one momentarily action?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have some plans, but we cannot announce them. They are not formalized. We have to wait to the end of this year to properly analyze our financial capabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question number three, it's regarding the acquisition of new assets and new companies. The investors have been disappointed by companies spending a lot of funds acquiring assets in Europe and not on paying dividends recently, what do we expect from the Company for the next two to three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the next two to three years, we are going to focus on acquisition of the assets in the production segment. Mr. Alekperov has visited Kazakhstan just recently and we hope that in the near future, we are going to close the deal acquiring our share in Lukarc.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're considering further acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are certainly. There were a few of high scale projects, for example, West Qurna-2, our favorite one on the 10th and auction starts &#x2013; tenders starts we're going to get involved in it. So I think you'll learn more with time about our acquisitions. But I believe the acquisitions that we have done in the downstream segment were quite correct. When the margin was eight, 10, $12 per barrel, people were saying, why are you not buying anything? When the margin dropped down, when everything became very cheaper, they're asking why are you buying? We're buying because they are cheap and we hope that they get more expensive and they're going to generate us profit. That's as simple as that. It would be stupid to buy when it's expensive, but when the market makes us buy it.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Oil Expert Portal. You said that in the near future, we will continue experiencing high market volatility, what is the company's strategy as far as risk hedging is concerned? In the international markets, can we use any tools in the Russian markets, can we use any tools to stimulate this, to hedge it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hedging risks basically means that our capital and operational costs should meet the best practices, best international practice and be competitive. And second of all, we have to focus on producing those products which have very effective distribution system that's what we're focusing on. We are focusing on liquid hydrocarbons and as far as the other ones are concerned, we only do it when we have a nice distribution system. For example, in Asia and in the Caspian region, where we can use the gas by our power generating capacities. There were no other hedging instruments that could be applied for the oil companies. Some companies spent all their extra money to pay dividends, but we don't think that we're going to significantly increase this.</p>

          <p>Well, in Tsentralnaya, Rosneft has nothing to do. We do it together with Gazprom, not with Rosneft, but you send a query.

          <p>Currently, well testing goes on. This well was a parametric well. It was all about defining the borders of the fields and proving the reserves. The reserves have been proven. So the model that we had drafted before was proved by drilling of that well.</p>

          <p>Hello, my name is Natalia Mescheriakova from the Otkriitie Company. I have two questions for the same topic. The first question, do you expect that the government in the near future will provide some export holidays, if you produce it offshore or in some specific regions, what are the chances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not expect anything. These holidays are provided just for one month, even for East Siberia and we keep on extending them. So if there were some difficulties, we're going to cancel them. So I don't share any hopes. As far as the mineral extraction tax was reduced, it's quite enough for us to implement our Caspian projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I would like to clarify it, why do you think that they have provided this holiday just for one month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it's just the mechanism that they use. They give it for one month, and then they extend it for one &#x2013; next month. As far as mineral extraction tax, it is regulated by the government, it's the law and as far as this holiday is concerned, it is given for a very short time and then they keep extending them. It is very limited. There is no strict legislation as far as this issue is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question, you have mentioned that some FAS decisions may decrease your cash flows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They have somehow influenced us, because the prices for gasoline have dropped down everywhere.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's why it's impacted net income. But how come FAS treats you this way, unlike other companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But have you been watching TV, there have been five lawsuits? The biggest one, Rosneft, then LUKOIL, then TNK-BP, then Gazprom Neft, there are nobody else in the market, all these companies have been hit by FAS. But I think FAS and ourselves had a very successful meeting of those lawsuits very unlikely to be won by FAS, because they were talking about the fair price, about how to calculate it. They don't know how to calculate the fair price. It was not just given to us. It was given to all of the companies that I have mentioned. It was an effort that they made just to fix the prices. Currently, they are focusing on the pharmaceuticals, then they focused on us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lesanko from B2B Capital. Your drilling volumes have dropped down, especially in Q3. It was actually not like Surgutneftegaz was doing the, instead increase the drilling volumes, what is the difference between you and Surgutneftegaz? And what about the drilling volumes in Q4, what do you expect to do in the year 2010 in upstream CapEx and what do you expect in 2010 as far as the production in the West Siberia is concerned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Drilling is drilling. Drilling of the conventional well, which is 3.5 kilometers long, requires hydraulic fracturing. It just gives eight tons without hydraulic fracturing. If it's just a conventional well with hydraulic frac at 16 tons, if it's a horizontal well with one hydraulic frac, it's going to give 40 tons of flow and high and higher than the 150 and 40. So, the question is, how effective the drilling is?</p>
          <p>You cannot calculate it. It really all depends what kind of recovery methods are applied later on after the drilling. New technologies should be applied more extensively, that was I was focusing on. We are the only company which started developing the rock with very low permeability. But still they are unlimited as far as volumes are concerned; all that matters is the technology, which is applied there.</p>
          <p>And as far as you have seen the drilling of the new well in new fields, one meter of penetration gives six times more oil than in West Siberia. So &#x2013; but Surgutneftegaz has got no alternative to West Siberia, that's why they are drilling there and we are focusing not on the amount, we are focusing on the quality.</p>
          <p>West Siberia has shrunk by 6%. We have not shrunk by 6%, it's less with us. While if you see it properly, it's going to be a little bit less. The drop is going to be less than the previous year. The existing fields that we have there, TNK has &#x2013; production will be dropping because the fields have been depleted, just like the fields in the North Sea and Prudhoe Bay in Alaska. So we have to use new drilling technologies in West Siberia of the hard recoverable reserves, which is a very expensive thing, or go to some other regions. We are focusing on the Caspian region, I believe that we are going to have approximately 20, 25 million tons of new oil for the next 10 years, it's as simple as that. It's more effective than drilling more and more oils in West Siberia. That's what we think.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please show us the slide about free cash flows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the first one for the free cash flows. That's the one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You have outcasted good free cash flow, but dividend payout is the same, basically, the increase from 15 to 30%, why was that? Why do you need to have so much money unallocated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just like any other company, we don't really know what is going to happen in the near future, where the world will go. ConocoPhillips, our partner for example, they're shrinking it by 10 billion, sell everything and just wait and see what happens. All the other companies, almost all of them I believe, do very similar things. Again I repeat, we are on the verge of very significant, I would say, revolutionary changes of the industry, which we do not quite know and understand. So entering new projects these days for something which could be waste tomorrow is very irrational.</p>
          <p>Here is my answer, I believe in two more years we'd understand it better and come up with a new project, a new program, but straight after the crisis, we are saving up money and when the crisis is over, we'd know where to invest it. If we do not know where to invest, we'll pay it to the shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>We're going to double it. We're going to double it from 15% to 30%. Gradually, would be at 30%, that's the minimal level.</p>

          <p>Yes, there was a court &#x2013; decision made in the court in our favor, but there are some differences which are considered &#x2013; right now, which are being considered. We just need to get it right. This is what is discussed.</p>

          <p>I think there are going to be good volumes. We'll see what happens. There is definitely certain risk involved, but I cannot comment on it. This is it. Thank you for your questions and we need to take these few questions from Sanford Bernstein. I have somehow answered part of these questions. I have mentioned this and I mentioned that.</p>

          <p>Would you say that the strategies, which is increasing cash flows, will damage the company's attractiveness?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. Investors thought about this before the crisis when they thought that financial resources are available, and the company is financially independent and the demand on hydrocarbons would be going up. But we know that the situation has changed and the companies should now be focusing not on growth at any expense, but only on growth which is involving very good financial outcome. We carry on growing at reasonable pace. The growth will be approximately 30% for this period of time, but we're going to first and foremost increase the financial stability of our company.</p>
