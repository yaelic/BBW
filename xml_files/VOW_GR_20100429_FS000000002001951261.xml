          <p>Good day and welcome to the Interim Report January to March 2010 of Volkswagen AG. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christine Ritz, Head of Group Investor Relations, Volkswagen AG. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volkswagen's conference call on the results for the period January to March 2010. I'm joined today by Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG responsible for Finance and Controlling, and for the first time for a Volkswagen earnings conference call by Christian Klingler, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Group Sales and Marketing.</p>
          <p>Last week we released summary details on our financial performance, with our full interim report published this morning. As usual, you can also follow the webcast and download the charts from our website www.volkswagenag.com/ir. Questions can be sent by e-mail or called in.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to mention that after the presentation we will first respond to the questions of analysts and later under those of journalists.</p>
          <p>I would now like to pass you over to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and a warm welcome also from my side to this call today.</p>
          <p>The key to our performance in Q1 was clearly the rebound in global car demand from the very low levels at the start of 2009. With our attractive new models, we have been able to capture an above average share of this growth led by our excellent performance in China. The low Q1 2009 operating result was depressed by measures, in particular, the lowering of production to cut inventory levels offset in part through the one-off gain from the sale of our heavy truck assets in Brazil.</p>
          <p>While the German market is weak following the ending of the scrapping support, our exposure to the emerging growth markets coupled with good performance in Western European markets outside Germany has driven the improvement in operating result to 848 million from &#x20AC;312 million last year.</p>
          <p>Our focused discipline on working capital and investment continues supporting an excellent level of net liquidity in our automotive division of &#x20AC;14.2 billion. Two significant impacts here are worth mentioning in a little more detail. Firstly, we had an outflow of &#x20AC;1.7 billion for our stake of just under 20% in Suzuki. Joint teams of Volkswagen and Suzuki engineers are now working closely together. As we examine a range of potential project, progress so far is very positive for both parties.</p>
          <p>And of course, you're all aware that we successfully raised a net &#x20AC;4.1 billion from the issuance of around 65 million preference shares. Due to the nature of the transaction, just around &#x20AC;3 billion of the total raised was received in the first quarter with the balance received in April. We are grateful for the trust placed in us by our new and existing shareholders and warmly welcome new shareholders to our company.</p>
          <p>Mr. Klingler, over to you now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. A very warm welcome also from my side, ladies and gentlemen. If you can open the charts, you see on this chart development of the world car market last year by quarter. And as well, the first quarter of this year in comparison to the previous one.</p>
          <p>After a dramatic decline of 21% in the first quarter of 2009, the world market showed the first signs of relief, falling only 13% in the second quarter. The market bottomed out in the third quarter and recorded growth by 17 and 19% respectively in the past two quarters.</p>
          <p>However, I have to add some note of cautions. As the car market started to decline from May 2008, the comparison with the previous year's figures shows signs of improvement in relative terms only, while in absolute terms the markets are stabilizing on a low level. To avoid the statistical distortion, a comparison to the last normal year of 2007 seems to be very appropriate.</p>
          <p>So let's go to the next chart. In the second half of 2009 the market grew mainly as a result of the positive influence of the government support measures in many countries. The first quarter of 2010 almost reached the same level as in the normalized year of 2007, again, driven by additional registrations of vehicle contracted in late 2009 before the ending of the scrapping incentive programs in some of the major markets.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter 2010 we expect, as you can see, a gradual normalization of the market trend as the positive effects of the incentive programs start fading out. However, our latest estimation suggests a decline in second half of the year 2010 due mainly to the negative impact of the advanced, let's say, pull-ahead sales in 2009 and the ending of the support measures in major European markets. This will make the second half of 2010 a very difficult period for the whole automotive industry.</p>
          <p>As a whole, the car market in Europe is expected to contract further in 2010, while North and South America as well as Africa are set to maintain their recovery, which has already started in 2009. Despite continuous growth in Asia and robust recovery in North America this year, the world car market will fail to reach its pre-crisis volume again.</p>
          <p>So if you go to the next chart. Since the second quarter of 2009 our deliveries to customers have shown a positive year-on-year development. In the first quarter of 2010 the Volkswagen Group again outperformed the overall car market, as you can see. This was supported by development in China, in North and South America as well as some Western European countries like Spain and Great Britain. Overall, as a result of our outperformance we continue to gain global market share.</p>
          <p>If you would like to go to the next chart. Looking at our performance on a regional base, here you can see the success of the Volkswagen Group in direct comparison to the markets around the world. In every region we have outperformed the markets. Only in Central and Eastern Europe our deliveries to customers declined in comparison to last year by about 9%. But even here we are still better than the markets, which declined by nearly 23%.</p>
          <p>This decline in the region was mainly caused by the Russian market, which contracted heavily by about 27% due to the credit crunch and the massive depreciation of the ruble. So since there there's a scrappage campaign now in Russia which has started last month, unfortunately mostly give an advantage to the Russian manufactures and not to the foreign manufacturers as Lada's taken 75% of the scrappage campaigns on its roll.</p>
          <p>Now if you go to the next page, now turning to the deliveries in absolute numbers by market areas compared to last year. In the first quarter of 2010 our deliveries to customers of the total group exceeded last year's level by 24.4% despite the massive decline of the German car market. After the end of the scrapping campaign, our deliveries increased in Germany by 1.3% and in Western Europe as a whole by 16.4%.</p>
          <p>Now if we go further, looking at the performance of the individual brands of the group. In the first quarter of 2010, all brands achieved an increase in terms of sales. Books on passenger cars recorded the highest growth in the group, delivering 27% more cars than last year, up to over 1.1 million units, driven by strong demand in China, which was up by plus 54%, and Western Europe up by 21%.</p>
          <p>Audi's deliveries were up by an impressive 26% to more than 260,000 cars. Premium brands only marginally benefited from the stimulus programs in the European countries and in the United States. So as the world economy begins to recover, we anticipate growth for premium cars.</p>
          <p>&#x160;koda and SEAT recorded double digit growth, helping them to maintain their market shares in a recovery market environment.</p>
          <p>Bentley benefited mainly from growing wealth in China, where deliveries almost doubled plus 90%, and from the recovery of the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Books for commercial vehicles and Scania participated in the recovery of light and heavy trucks market, especially in Brazil. Deliveries of Volkswagen commercial vehicles in total increased despite the exclusion of the Brazilian trucks and buses, which are now part of MAN since March 2009.</p>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, some highlight of our new models, which we will provide us a strong base for further sales performance in the coming months.</p>
          <p>The Touareg Hybrid. The first Volkswagen SUV to be offered in hybrid version has been introduced on the markets this month.</p>
          <p>The Audi A1 with its emotional design, driving pleasure, customization options and modern information communication technology will capture a new segment for Audi. The A1 will hit the road in August this year.</p>
          <p>The new Sharan sets standards in its segments with lower consumption and low running costs. It combines the highest reliability with ease of handling and outstanding comfort as well as appealing aesthetics design. The new Sharan was recently shown at the Geneva Auto Show and will be introduced on the markets also in August.</p>
          <p>The Amarok is the Volkswagen amongst pickups, smart solutions, German engineered. Its fuel efficiency is best in class, and with the drive concept, which means the two wheel drive and the four wheel drive, and assist systems, it is ready for all terrains tested by the car.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Klinger. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, can you take us through the financials, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, I can. And let's get started with the analysis of sales revenue. Unit sales ex-China grew by just over 20%. Our sales revenue, which excludes our Chinese joint ventures, grew almost in line at 19.4% to &#x20AC;28.6 billion. The key driver being obviously the substantial volume increase that Mr. Klinger just explained. But this growth in revenue was not just growth at any cost &#x2013; we achieved an improvement in price and mix as well as a positive impact from currencies.</p>
          <p>Having sold our heavy truck interests in Brazil to MAN in the first quarter last year, the absence of the sales in our books for this year resulted in a negative of &#x20AC;0.3 billion. Scania reported an uptick in sales revenue of 0.1 billion as the heavy truck markets showed signs of improvement from the depths of recession. Our financial services business similarly enjoyed a small improvement of &#x20AC;0.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now turning to operating profit. The positive volume effect was the major influence in an improvement from &#x20AC;0.3 billion to 0.8 billion versus the first quarter 2009. Combined volume with price and mix effect came to a total positive of &#x20AC;0.9 billion. Currency contributed a further &#x20AC;0.1 billion. You have no doubt heard a lot of comments about raw material costs rebounding as the global economy start to recover. Our strategy of purchasing on a global basis with a long-term view on our supplier relationships has contributed alongside our own ongoing efforts to improve our product costs in engineering and production to a saving of &#x20AC;0.2 billion in the first three months. We have targeted a total savings of more than &#x20AC;1 billion for 2010, and I am confident that we will attain this.</p>
          <p>Scania again had an outstanding performance and contributed an improvement of &#x20AC;0.2 billion. Fixed costs and depreciation increased versus the first quarter last year by &#x20AC;0.3 billion. One element here related to higher wages following our agreement with the unions. Another part relates to higher development costs and investment as we grow our business with new models and invest in more fuel efficient as well as electric and hybrid powertrain technologies. The ramp up of production facilities in new markets also had an impact. The other negative versus last year reflects the one-off gain booked in 2009 from the sale of our activities in Resende that I already referred to.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to cash flow in the automotive division. Operating cash flow improved 6.5% to &#x20AC;3 billion. A good performance from first quarter 2009 has been maintained as we continue disciplined management of our inventory levels, which, in unit terms, are on a slightly higher level than as at year end 2009 while remaining below the level of March last year. Our CapEx ratio of 3.5% will rise as the year progresses and we expect for the full year to come in within our long-standing target of around 6% of automotive revenues.</p>
          <p>Moving to cash flows from investing activities, a couple of influences needs to be stripped out to get to the underlying performance, including the sale of our Brazil interests in 2009 and our investment in Suzuki this year.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Volkswagen has purchased just under 20% of the equity of Suzuki for &#x20AC;1.7 billion. On a like-for-like basis, the underlying cash flow in investing activities fell from &#x20AC;1.6 billion to 1.3 billion, demonstrating our effective management. In total, the operating and investing cash flow for the automotive division came in at a positive &#x20AC;31 million.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to the liquidity in our automotive division. The outflow of 1.7 billion for our investment in Suzuki was more than compensated by the proceeds of 3 billion booked in the first quarter from our capital increase of 4.1 billion. The balance of &#x20AC;1.1 billion from the capital increase has already been received in April.</p>
          <p>The excellent balance of &#x20AC;14.2 billion gives us the foundation to progress with the formation of an integrated group of Volkswagen with Porsche free from any short-term external impact on the global economy or capital markets.</p>
          <p>Last week at our AGM our shareholders granted the Board of Management a global authorization to issue bearer bonds with warrants and/or bearer convertible bonds in the period up to April the 21st, 2015. I would like to emphasize that there are no concrete plans at present as to whether and, if so, when it will be utilized. Let me add that we have committed ourselves to a six months lock up as part of the capital increase.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look now at the financial performance of our nine brands. I am delighted to report that our improvement in performance is reflected in the results of all of our brands. From a loss at the start of 2009, the Volkswagen brand has recovered to report an operating result of plus &#x20AC;460 million, equal to a margin of 2.2%.</p>
          <p>Audi has performed excellently in the first quarter, reported a result of 478 million. &#x160;koda, booked a plus of 100 million as deliveries in major Western European markets outside of Germany grew significantly, up almost 50%. SEAT narrowed its losses by close to 25%. In the face of a very difficult home economic environment the SEAT team is making good progress. Bentley reduced its loss as the luxury car market too remains difficult.</p>
          <p>Commercial vehicles improved once the impact of the sale of Resende is excluded. Scania, as I mentioned before, performed excellently. We see the first signs of recovery in the truck sector and Scania is perfectly positioned to benefit as confidence returns.</p>
          <p>The Other result includes the elimination of inter-company sales and also the adjustments required under IFRS for purchase price accounting with regards to our consolidation of Scania. The PPA charge for Scania remains in 2010, but on a lower level than last year resulting in a consolidated net plus for Scania. Financial services reported a steady 167 million result. Combining the automotive and financial services divisions gives a total operating profit of &#x20AC;884 million.</p>
          <p>The financial result improved to a negative 145 million and is made up of three main sources. First, earnings from the equity consolidation of participations. Second, interest income and expense on cash excluding the trading operations of financial services. And thirdly, earnings on options and the evaluations of other financial instruments, including long-term provisions such as pension funds.</p>
          <p>Now, while the second and third sources remained broadly constant, the Chinese joint ventures were the main driver of the improvement in the overall financial results, reporting a proportional operating profit of &#x20AC;286 million, almost 3 times the level of the first quarter 2009, reflecting our very good sales performance.</p>
          <p>Porsche is also included as equity following our investment in December 2009. While the operating business of Porsche was clearly positive in the quarter, the earnings included in our result are also subject to a PPA charge, which resulted in a small net loss in our books. Suzuki is also included here for the first time, and equally after purchase price accounting reported a small loss.</p>
          <p>This leads me to our 2010 outlook, which you can read in detail in the interim report. Our presence in all the key regions around the world, the multi-brand strategy, our technological expertise and the most up to date, most environmentally friendly and broadest vehicle range that has resulted from that expertise are key advantages for our company.</p>
          <p>2010, Volkswagen Group's nine brands will unveil a large number of new models thus systematically extending our position in the global markets. We therefore anticipate that our deliveries to customers will be higher than in 2009. The group's sales, revenue and operating profit for 2010 are expected to exceed the prior-year figures. Despite a shift in volumes between the markets, interest and exchange rate volatility will remain a drag on profit. We will continue to focus on disciplined cost and divestment management and the continuous optimization of our processes.</p>
          <p>In summary, despite the positive performance in the first quarter, we remain cautious on the full-year market development as government support schemes run out and consumer demand will be driven by the underlying economic framework conditions.</p>
          <p>While pessimism has switched to optimism, we will stick to our conservative stance while conditions remain uncertain.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, thank you very much. We will now begin with the questions and answer part of today's conference call, starting first with the questions of analysts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Horst Schneider of HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. Three or four questions if I may. The first one is regarding the visibility in your order book. Maybe you can specify it until which months you have got now somewhat better visibility. And in that context, I would be interested to know if Q2 volumes will be on the same level as in Q1 or maybe even higher?</p>
          <p>And then I would be interested to know why your current liabilities in the balance sheet have increased to such a large extent this year end. So what is behind that increase? Is it again a higher provisions and hefty professions again for higher or for lower residual values and deleverage? So maybe you could specify how much you have provisioned for that items.</p>
          <p>And then a last question I have is on price and mix. I see that you had in the first quarter &#x2013; at least on the revenue line here, a positive impact from price and mix. Would you expect that also on a full-year basis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Horst Schneider had three questions for us. First he would like to know if we can share some details on our order book, if you have a better visibility now and if Q2 volumes will be on the same level as Q1. Then there is a question about the liabilities and higher provisions, if we can give here some more details if this is related to lower residual values or any dealer risks. And the last question relates on our development in the revenue, if the &#x2013; because we have seen that price and mix is positive and if this is also a valid estimation for the full year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I start with the answer on the order book. The order book, let's say, concerning the order intake in the first quarter was better than anticipated. So we see a better demand in Germany as well as we see in Western Europe as well as in the other regions. So our order book is in a pretty reasonable shape.</p>
          <p>How will be the tendency in quarter 2? The first signs seems to be satisfying and seems to be pretty okay. As well as we have shown before, the seasonality in this year will be much stronger in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year due to the market, as the second half of the year, the market will go down.</p>
          <p>Concerning pricing and mix, we have of course taken advantage of the new models, and as consequence, the possibility to have a pretty reasonable price and mix possibility in the markets. We estimate that it can be for the next quarter a tendency which seems to be similar to this. What will happen afterwards, it's depending on the conditions of the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I can continue with the question concerning the liabilities. Now, first of all a pretty comment as the business is growing again, the pipeline is filling up. It's clear that there are also the liabilities growing in this specific phase over-proportionally. Now, on the provision side, I think I can remind you to the statement we made with regards to the fourth quarter and the third quarter 2009 where we specifically were covering the potential risks on the residual side and also as far as dealer risks were concerned.</p>
          <p>So in the development of the first quarter 2010, there are no specific issues in terms of provisions built for residuals and dealer risks. The main driver behind the build up of provisions are on the one hand the translatory effect coming out of currencies and while you can also remind yourself to the currency situation specifically in what we called the smaller currencies, for example, in the east of Europe. This situation got reversed in the meantime, which is producing a positive effect on the P&amp;L side of the business. But in terms, for example, of pension obligations, of course, means a revaluation, which is contributing to the opposite.</p>
          <p>Another element of course here is also that as the business is being built up back again, some areas are affected, for example, warranties, for example, provisions for all the general marketing and sales expenses. And these are the main reasons why the provisions had to be built up in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, add-on question to that. If I got it right then, you said that part of the provisions will be returned again in the second quarter. Is that right related to currencies or have I got that wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I said of course when you are closing the books of course you have to refer to the currency relationship. And as we saw some firming up of currencies other than Euro, there is a decent effect included, which refers to that point. Now, we needed to know on how these currencies are going to develop further to know exactly which way we are going here.</p>
          <p>Again, just to avoid that there is any sort of misunderstanding, this does not mean to any extent any additional burden, commitment or whatever it is, it is just the translation from a non-euro currency into euros, which, of course, can fluctuate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's have the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We move onto our next question, which comes from Adam Hull of WestLB. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I was going to ask on provisions but maybe I'll hold back a little bit. Could you just give us a little bit more explanation on the PPA charge both within the other eliminations of 366 million and also just a little bit more in the financial line? What is the total PPA in both lines, so we can get a sort of an estimate for trying to strip out effectively non-cash?</p>
          <p>And then secondly &#x2013; well, maybe going just back to the provisions for a moment, I mean, you've charged the P&amp;L with these provisions and then you reversed them in the automotive cash flow at 1.3 billion. Maybe you could just help us a little bit as to how that exactly has worked, because it does seem a very large reversal in the cash flow. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Adam has two questions for us. So the first question is related to the PPA, if we can give them more details where what we have charged, and in the other eliminations or in the financial results, if we can give here some more details. And then again a question with regard to provisions, if we can explain a little bit better what happened in the P&amp;L and in the automotive cash flow? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the first question, as far as PPA is concerned, we have a total effect on the bottom line in the first quarter of 2010 in the neighborhood of &#x20AC;160 million. And that's clearly then including the PPA effect on Scania, on Porsche, on MAN and Suzuki. Now, looking at the figure for the full year, from today's point of view it looks as if we are moving in an area of around 600 million PPA effect, so a quite substantial number. And it goes without saying that this is an effect which doesn't have any cash effect aside it.</p>
          <p>To the second question on the provisioning, I think it's very important also to understand, as I pointed out already, that, for example, the effect with regards to currencies, which I mentioned, is just accounting or bookkeeping, it doesn't have any cash effect.</p>
          <p>So this means if we look at the P&amp;L, of course it has to be fully considered in the P&amp;L, while in the cash flow statements, it has to be reversed because the cash flow statement is built on the basis of the P&amp;L. And in order to identify on whether a specific item is cash relevant or not, you then have to look into the cash flow statement. So there it's clearly been reversed for the reason that, let's say, the large magnitude of provisioning did at least so far not have any effect on the cash side.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just be clear on the number, your 160 and 600 million on the PPA, I'm presuming that's a pre-tax number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's an after-tax number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>An after-tax number. Okay. And then just maybe just an add-on, just on the MAN and Porsche, are you estimating that, I guess, the profits to the end of March then for both or is that a lag? Just remind us of that. And thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My comment on the Porsche side was just for the three months of 2010 where I said that clearly Porsche is in the black, a 3 digit number in the black, but we have to consider the PPA effect. So net of all that means a slightly red number for Porsche including PPA.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We move onto our next question which comes from Thierry Huon of Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's Thierry Huon speaking from Exane. Two quick questions. One regarding CapEx. You are well below at the end of Q1 from your 6% target. You mentioned during your presentation that you should get close to the 6%. So how close should we expect you to be from this 6%? It's going to be 5 or more like 6?</p>
          <p>And second question, could you give us the inventories number you are sharing with us usually for the group at the independent dealer level and for the group level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Thierry. You have two questions for us. The first question refers to CapEx. In the first quarter we had quite a ratio well below 6% and you would like to know what is our guidance for the full year. And the second question relates to inventories at group level, if we can give you some more information. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you probably missed a certain area here in my first comment, because I said very clearly we believe for the full year we will be within the band which we feel is adequate for the company, which is around 6% CapEx to sales ratio.</p>
          <p>Now on the inventory side, of course, my colleague sitting aside me should know part of the answer at least because it's very clear that it's heavily related to the point how the economy is going to develop further because you might also recall that in the past months we many fold times mentioned that we think on a normal basis our inventory levels are too low, but we feel it's adequate to the situation. Now, if the situation would improve further on, of course, we would have to build up some inventory to be closer to what our marketing and sales people are judging as being something as an ideal stock level. But maybe &#x2013; but I'm sure, Mr. Klingler can add a few more comments on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning inventory in general, we could say that we are still on a very strict control. We do have inventory levels which are very much controlled in all perspectives. So we do have the same inventory in March 2010 what we had in 2009 in December. We feel that in the consequence, we are very prudent on one hand but on the other hand we don't take the risk to lose any sales. We will keep on this policy because we believe that there are in some regions still some possible risks, as well as you have seen as in the beginning of the presentation, in the second half of the year there will be concerning our prognosis a market which will go down a little bit compared to the first half of the year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We move on to our next question, which comes from J&#xFC;rgen Piper of Metzler. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. I had two questions, now I have just one left. It's on SEAT. I mean, we see in the first quarter sales revenues going up by 39%, still the EBIT is almost as negative as in the first quarter of 2009. So a question &#x2013; or if you want two questions, can you give us the level of revenues where today's &#x2013; level at today's cost level you would be a breakeven? Or alternatively, do you have today a perspective when this breakeven could come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. J&#xFC;rgen Piper has one question about SEAT, if we can give some information about the breakeven. When can the breakeven be achieved at SEAT and at which level of revenues? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, very quick comment on the situation 2010, I think SEAT started out quite positively into the year. Now, as you're well aware, SEAT is very much depending on the performance of the Southern European market, and that market is currently where there is some government support for these markets. It's difficult to say how long this support is going to continue on, so we want to just create some caution here on the further development.</p>
          <p>Then more concrete to your question on the framework for the breakeven point. Now, clearly speaking, in terms of revenues it has to be more than today, but the answer to the question how can we get to the breakeven point is not only to be done on the revenue side of course. And you might be well aware that we took a fundamental decision to build one of the new Audi products in two years from now in a SEAT location in Martorell, and in doing so, of course, we do absorb a substantial amount of fixed costs which is creating this relief for SEAT. In parallel, of course we are heavily working on the fixed cost side there in general terms.</p>
          <p>So the question is to be answered in a way that, yes, we need a more prosperous development in terms of revenues, but a very important contribution is to come from the cost side also by measures &#x2013; which structural measures in taking fixed costs away from SEAT. We believe in roughly a two years timeframe that's a challenge which is to be mastered.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll move on to our next question, which comes Jose Asumendi of RBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Jose Asumendi, RBS. Three questions, please. Just to come back on the order book, could you please quantify how many months of sales have you got currently in your book?</p>
          <p>The second one would be on the premium segment. Could you please quantify on average by how much have you managed to increase prices for Audi? And if you could please comment a little bit about your competitors BMW and Daimler, how are they progressing to restore the pricing in the market?</p>
          <p>And the third one is, I mean, when I'm talking to the other OEMs everyone is talking about winning market share in especially in Europe. I was just wondering, what are your thoughts on market share for the second half? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jose. Thank you. You have three questions for us. The first question is again about our order book, if we can give some more details for the next month and if you can quantify that? And the next question relates to the premium segment, if we can increase prices for Audi, how is the situation there? And the last question refers to our market share, what do we expect for the second half, especially in Europe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much for the questions; maybe I start with the last one. Concerning market share, we expect in general on a worldwide level a further increase of our market share. This will be as well the case in Western Europe. You only have to be aware that there is a base effect due to the differences of development of the countries, and this has to be integrated into this discussion as well.</p>
          <p>Concerning the order book, as I said before, our order book &#x2013; or our orders in the first quarter has been better than forecasted, so we're in a reasonably high level and as a consequence we're pretty confident for the next quarter to come.</p>
          <p>Concerning the prices for Audi, or what are the competitors are doing, as you know, normally we are not commentaring the actions of our competitors. In general, I would say that the new models, like the Q5, like the A5 Sportback, like the A8, they have received a very good perception of our customers. And all of them have been presented to the market with a huge success. So in general we do have a very good possibility to come to the market with interesting price propositions for Audi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just add one more question, please? I was just wondering in relation to the scrapping plans in Europe and are being &#x2013; if you listen what they are discussing, for example in Spain, there is a chance that they could implement a second round of scrapping incentives or some kind of help for the market, especially in Q3 and Q4. Do you also see that chance and do you see also any other chance at any other European country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So coming back to Spain, as you know this campaign will end in the next few weeks or days depending when the volume is out of it. We don't know what the Spanish government will decide. So in our numbers, Spain is integrated without an additional campaign concerning scrappage. In general, we do not expect that further countries will come up with additional scrappage campaigns.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let's have the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We move on to our next question now, which comes from Michael Punzet of HSBC (sic) [DZ Bank] . Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Michael Punzet from DZ Bank. I have two questions. The first one is related to the charts on page 12 and 13 of your presentation. You posted a positive currency effect of 400 million in your revenues line, but only 100 million in your EBIT line. Maybe you can explain what's the reason for that, if that is related to unfavorable hedges and if the trend continues during the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And then on your VW brand, you posted a margin of 2.2% in Q1. Is that a level we could also expect for Q2 and maybe also for the full year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Michael Punzet has two questions for us. The first one relates to the currency impact on sales revenue and on operating profit, where does the difference come from, if we can explain that a little bit more? And the second question refers to the passenger car business. We have showed a margin of 2.2% in the first quarter, what do we expect for the second quarter and for the full year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the first question, the answer is a bit simple, if you allow me to say. If you imagine a certain country where on the basis of a strong currency the revenues are positively supported, unfortunately you have a similar but negative development on the cost side on the same basis. So the result is of course &#x2013; or must be much lower than what is stated on the revenue line.</p>
          <p>On the margin side of the business, we think that the passenger car business can at least continue on with the margin shown in the first quarter. For the second quarter, for the second half of the year, we again have to remind you that there are some uncertainties on how the markets are going to perform further on volume-wise. And there we are again back to the big question on whether some of the incentives will be prolonged or whether they would be stopped and, of course, the general link to the economical framework conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We move on to our next question, which comes from Charles Winston of Redburn Partners. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and hi, good afternoon. It was just two questions actually. The -- actually back to two topics we've been to already. On the provision side, the 1.3 billion compares to a figure of 562 in the first quarter of last year. So that's about 735 million increase. That increase in costs, where would it appear in your profit bridge? Would it be buried in the plus 0.9 volume/price mix such that without that it would have been plus 1.6? Or would we be looking for it in the fixed cost and depreciation line?</p>
          <p>And my second question just relates actually back to FX. You had a positive impact from FX in the first quarter, but in your guidance you talk about FX being a drag on the year. Can you perhaps give us some flavor as to sort of how FX will become a drag? Is it from the second quarter onwards, and perhaps some sort of quantification of that given your hedging position? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Charles has two questions for us. The first question is again about provisions, if we can give here again further information? And the last question is about currency impact, what is our &#x2013; which impact do we expect for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question where in the shown graph, what the effects coming out of provisioning pop up. It's mainly volume mix price on the one side and a fixed cost depreciation on the other side.</p>
          <p>Then on the second point, why on the basis of positive development currency-wise in the first quarter we would think it possible that we could see a drag on earnings coming from that area. Well, I think we should recognize the high volatility, which we had seen in the last 18 months, and this is just to give a little warning on the basis of the uncertainties with regards to the economic framework conditions that we have a quite decent exposure with regard to currencies which we can't hedge effectively. So this is to say that if there is any negative volatility, we would be hit, and this is definitely on the basis of just one quarter of the year still a possibility. Now, clearly, the likelihood did shrink in the meantime, but still it's something which could hurt us a bit going forward into the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you. Can I just follow up very quickly? You're saying that a chunk of the provision increase was in the fixed cost and depreciation line. If we back that out, would fixed cost depreciation perhaps &#x2013; would it be actually flat or would there still be an adverse impact from fixed cost and depreciation even if we excluded the provisioning move? Thank you. Sorry, then I'll shut up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Just avoided &#x2013; there is a misunderstanding. I made two areas where I pointed towards two areas that would see these effects. One definitely is fixed cost depreciation but the other one is &#x2013; the bigger one is volume mix and price. As I had pointed out that there are some marketing-related costs, warranties and the like, and these costs typically appear on the volume mix and price front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's have the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We move over to our next question, which comes from Frank Biller of LBBW. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just two quick questions. The one thing is on the China sales and earnings development. So really it was a very strong first quarter in China here. Maybe you can give us a revenue line in China and what you are expecting for the remainder of the year on the sales and earnings side?</p>
          <p>And the other question is on Scania/MAN cooperation. Today COO of MAN gave an interview that the cooperation of Scania and MAN goes on, and you are working hardly on cooperating here. Maybe you can give us some news in that direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So Frank Biller has two questions. The first question refers to the business in China. We have seen a strong business in the first quarter and you would like to know what our expectation for 2010 on revenues and earnings, if we can give you some more information? And the second question is related to potential cooperation between Scania, Volkswagen and MAN, if we can give here some more information or an update? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe to start, first some indications about the Chinese market in general. The Chinese market had an impressive development in this first quarter, but there are two effects. The one effect is that last year first quarter was very bad as the change of the legislation on taxes has been implemented only in end of January, beginning of February. So they have lost more than a month concerning the positive impact of this change. So don't be too much impressed by the change of the market. This will not follow up over the next months to come. In general, we expect for the Chinese market on a cumulative basis for the year a, let's say, growth potential of about 10%, so it will flatten up over the second half of the year. So I give over to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So this consequently means that we can look towards a continuation of a pretty positive development in China in spite of the fact, as Mr. Klingler said, realistically we should not just take the first quarter and take it by 4; that would not be realistic in our view. But definitely 2010 will beat the very good numbers of 2009, both in terms of revenue and operating profit. And on the basis of the development we've seen 2009, we do expect another improvement as far as the dividend payment is concerned which Volkswagen AG receives from our Chinese joint ventures.</p>
          <p>So to your second question, I think in order to avoid any misunderstanding here, I think in almost each of the conference calls we were faced with questions on if and how any cooperation between the truck companies and Volkswagen is moving on. And I think we quite a couple of times stated that we are making progress. And while in the past this was more related to single areas, single projects, the cooperation now becomes a more principal nature, and in fact one can say that Volkswagen, MAN and Scania agree that and will have an agreement that an intensified cooperation between all the involved companies is to the benefit for all partners. And consequently, it means that currently concrete opportunities of such cooperations are examined in an in-depth approach and the related discussions. And I think it can be said that these opportunities ought to be advanced jointly in the future.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We move forward to our next question, which comes from Tim Schuldt of Equinet. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions. First one is on two of your graphs in the presentation where you point out the effect coming from volume, price and mix. You have a total effect on your revenue line of 4.3 million and on your EBIT line of 900 million. So if you calculate sort of like an operating leverage you could end up with a percentage number of 21%. Now assuming that price goes pretty much 100% from revenues to EBIT, the effect for volume and mix would only be around 600 million or 15%. And if you see that mix should usually have a pretty high contribution margin and if you see also that you have reduced your gap between production and unit sales by 70,000 cars compared to Q1 2009, it seems to be relatively low for me. Do you have an explanation for that? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>And the second one is on your volume forecast. I struggled a bit to understand why exactly volumes are supposed to go down month by month in the second half of the year, because most of the scrappage incentives have run out until then. And I would expect that a market like Germany, for example, will probably find its low point in the beginning of the year and then the negative effect from the scrappage incentives should ease over time. So maybe you can give an explanation for that? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. So Tim Schuldt have two questions for us. The first question refers to the chart number 12 and 13, if we can explain the difference on volume/price mix at the revenue line compared to the EBIT line, if we can give here some explanation? And the second question refers to the chart number 6. So our forecast for the world car market, why do we expect a weaker development in the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I take the first question on specifically the mechanics between the development shown in revenues and the respective effect on the operating profit side. Unfortunately, I have to produce a little disappointment first of all because the prices spec'd out in the revenue development carried to quite an extent inflationary price effects also.</p>
          <p>Now, this means that in opposite to what you thought, it's not just feeding one by one through to the EBIT profit line, it's just the opposite. It's first of all then to cover inflationary pressure coming up from the cost side. And I could name a number of countries where this is an ongoing issue. And quite normally, if we talk about these kind of effects, you are following a cost development by the respective price development.</p>
          <p>Now, I would not deny that there are some very positive price effects also, but it is not possible just to create a direct relationship between the price effects shown on the top line to the effect on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>And for the second question, I pass on to Mr. Klingler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I try to answer this question, which is a very complicated question, but I like to have that and to make it, let's say, easy to understand. First is, what we have here on page 6 is the comparison to year 2007. So 2007 is some, let's tell it, so-called normalize year. But of course in a normalized year a lot of events have been there. So it just gives an indication which is important to get as a general indication. The second thing is when you say the German market has stopped its scrappage campaign and would not have an impact on 2010, this is unfortunately not the situation &#x2013; or let's say fortunately. Still there are a lot of cars in the first half of the year which will be registered due to the orders which have been taken by the scrappage campaign. As well what we have had, so we have taken cars in our order bank from 2009 to 2010 and the production has now been done so that we can deliver as it foreseen by the government up to the end of June all the cars. So there is an impact first in Germany.</p>
          <p>Second, there are scrappage campaigns in different countries which are running out. So for example, UK has run out. So for example, France has run out as well to a certain extent last year and they had the obligation to make the registration up to the end of March. So you can see there is some artificial bump-up of the market. Spain is about to run out as well in the first half of the year. Brazil has reduced the advantages concerning the IPI with end of March. So again, an artificial boosting of the market. And Mexican situation is not going up. So the situation is that as a consequence there is in general an impact on 2010 due to the scrappage campaigns of 2009 in the first half of the year; this will not happen in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Second, there are scrappage campaigns which are ending in the first half of the year which will have an impact on the second half of the year. And third, if you want to just to add to that, there are some tax issues like in Spain where they built a tax increase of 2% in the first of July which will have an impact on the first half of year and a negative impact on the second half of the year. So that is why we believe that the first half the year will be stronger than the second of the year of the total market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. That's very clear.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We take our next question from John Buckland of MF Global. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just going back to the issue of market competitiveness. You've already sort of been asked a question on this, but perhaps you could answer it in a different way, and that is, looking at the overall market, can you talk about the competitiveness of the market for, say, Volkswagen and &#x160;koda, SEAT brands, and contrast that with your premium brands? Is there any difference that you can see, ignoring the obviously the positive effects that you get from your new models? I mean, can we see that potentially the premium market, which appears to &#x2013; other carmakers seem to suggest us is doing a little bit better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. John would like to have some more information about the market situation and the situation between the competitors, especially if there is a difference between our volume brands, &#x160;koda, SEAT, Volkswagen, and our premium brands, if we have there some more information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we try to answer that in general terms. Concerning the premium brands, I would say there is the effect of the base effect as well from last year. So last year, due to the direct impact of the crisis there was probably more difficulties to impose the prices possible than this year. So this is this year in a different situation; to talk about a general positive impact in the premium segment would be a little bit more prudent on that.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we see that the market shares of the premium manufacturers are increasing, for example, in Germany. But this is mostly due to the situation that the volume brands, which had taken much more profit out of the scrappage campaigns than the premium brands. So coming back to your question, is there a slight positive feeling about the pricing issue in the premium brand? Yes. But there is as well to be taking into account the base effect of last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps could you talk about the fleet and company business. Is that showing some momentum and improving as the year has progressed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On this answer I have to concentrate in Europe I would guess. In Europe, we do have feeling that there is light in the end of the tunnel. But it's really different concerning countries, but in general we do see that. The momentum is there. It is not that strong, but is starting and we hope that it will come stronger over the next few months to come.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, everybody. Just one question as Christine asks. Just on the guidance for full-year 2010. You've stuck to your guidance that operating profit is expected to exceed the prior year. I hear what you're saying about the second half, but I also notice the very strong first quarter. Would it be fair to say that you're getting even more confidant in that guidance and that you would expect there's a good chance of maybe significantly exceeding it or materially exceeding it, or is it really still possible given your concerns about H2 that we're only just going to sort of have a similar result to last year? Just a bit more clarification on what you're feeling about the full year at the operating profit level, please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Max, for your question that refers to our guidance for 2010 and our expectation for the operating profit, if we are more confident now after seeing and showing the performance in our first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually I think basically the comment was already made. The problem is that, as we view the situation, it is not completely ruled out that the second half of the year would be more difficult, and that's why it's clearly a situation which is also heavily influenced by external factors. And that's also why it, I think, it is the statement we made. We feel confident that we can beat the 2009 numbers. But that's it. I think anything else would just produce any anticipation, which is not really well funded and that's why we'd like to stick to the statement made.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We move over to our next question, which comes from Lothar Lubinetski of Mindfirst. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I'm wondering whether you could help us to monitor the cash for development in the next three quarters given that CapEx probably will go up while you are also expecting at least a slowdown in your operating business in the second half.</p>
          <p>And then just two very quick things. Could you give us a guidance or an idea for the tax rate for the full year and maybe a number for the revenue in China in the first quarter this year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Lothar, so more or less you have three questions for us, if I repeat that. So the first one is if we can give some more information about the cash flow and now if you can give an outlook of the cash flow development in the next quarter of this year when production will come up, what do we expect here. And the second question is if we can give a guidance about the tax rate in 2010. And then you are asking about the revenues in China in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as the cash flow in the next quarters is concerned, we clearly said that if we are continuing on with a bit more a positive development economically which should then also build a nice bridge into 2011, it's clear that we have to build up some additional inventory just to bring inventory levels a little bit more to the ideal point. Now expectedly on that basis, gross cash flow generation would be also positive, so a bottom line net cash flow for the full year as we committed ourselves, always excluding the Suzuki investment, we think will be positive.</p>
          <p>I think we also have to look at another scenario where the second half of the year would clearly show signs of weakness on the basis of incentives going mostly completely away. Maybe some other factors are not very supportive for the markets. In this respect, of course the lock-up in additional capital for inventory would be much less, gross cash flow generation also less. But the total we believe, again ex-Suzuki, would mean also then a positive net cash flow number.</p>
          <p>The tax quota for the full year we expect a little bit over 30%.</p>
          <p>And as far as the revenue in China is concerned, for the first quarter it's around &#x20AC;5 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We move forward to our next question, which comes from Aleksej Wunrau of BHF-BANK. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Aleksej Wunrau, BHF-BANK. Just one brief one. The depreciation in the first quarter clearly increased notwithstanding the fact that the relevant assets including property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet were relatively stable and CapEx in the recent past was declining. So I wonder what explains that, the more so as you said that the bulk of PPA seems to be not included here? And what would be your full-year guidance as to depreciation as it is appearing on the cash flow statement? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you have a question if we can explain the depreciation in the first quarter and if we can give a full-year guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the depreciation development in the first quarter should be roughly in line with what we have to expect for the full year. I think it's always difficult to refer to single items on a three month basis. But in principle terms it's clear that as a tendency depreciation will in comparison to 2009 move upwards as the one and the other plant is going through the pipeline &#x2013; for example, the ones in India, in Russia &#x2013; full scale. And in that respect, we expect a certain uplift in terms of depreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Now it's time to ask the journalists for their questions. And again, really due to the limited period of time I would like to ask you to raise only one question. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We move on to our next question, which comes from Christiaan Hetzner of Reuters. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, Mr. Hetzner, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, can you hear me? Thank you. Could you just tell me a little bit about what we've been hearing recently about Scania and MAN? All of a sudden, out of nowhere the two companies are giving the same signal that a cooperation is planned. What exactly is planned? What sort of components are involved? Could you just elaborate further about what is actually a quite momentous event? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Christiaan, we had that question already, but we are happy to answer it again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me again say that we repeatedly pointed towards the fact that cooperation is taking place. Possibly not fully fulfilling external expectations, but I think there is a lot of convincement in the companies that it's an excellent investment first of all to get the relevant people convinced that this is a good way to go. Anyway, there were already in the past a number of successful projects performed and now it's the time to bring this in a little bit a broader framework and that is why one can say that Volkswagen, MAN and Scania have a clear understanding that an intensified cooperation between these companies is to the benefit of all partners, and currently that's what we do. Concrete opportunities of cooperation are being examined in a very in-depth mode that's also very important and these opportunities are to be advanced jointly in the future. And I think this is just another very logical further step as far as the relationship of these companies is concerned.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, the very extensive risk assessment in the prospective for the rights issues sparked some concerns that potential liability from Porsche's side could trigger a delay of the merger or potentially even lead to the deal collapsing all together. Do you at the current point of time see a risk that the Porsche integration won't be finalized in 2011 as planned? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So Christoph has a question which refers to the Volkswagen-Porsche merger, if you see any risks that we cannot succeed with our plans to have a merger in the course of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think first of all it's necessary to refer to the point that you are  talking on the basis of the prospectus for the capital increase, and it's no question that the prospectus for the capital increase included a very detailed analysis of the risks, no matter how small the possibility of the risks occurring. So as part of the agreement to form an integrated automotive group with Porsche, of course we undertook a thorough analysis of all the potential risks where risks might no matter how small the chance that it's sold to Porsche AG from Porsche SE. So Volkswagen sought and received undertakings from Porsche SE to indemnify Volkswagen should those risks occur.</p>
          <p>So to cut a long story short, we are satisfied that Volkswagen is adequately protected with regard to any potential risks occurring. So in that sense I think there is no real basis to talk about any alternative scenario. All the contractual parties are fully committed to support the merger of the relevant companies to form the integrated automotive group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My question is how is the debt crisis in Southern Europe and particularly in Greece affecting Volkswagen? And does Volkswagen see any signs of slowing demand from these countries? And do you have some sort of a worst-case scenario for the eventuality that Greece defaults. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, this Greece situation is pretty recent. Happy we are our &#x2013; let's say, the general impact of Greece in our total deliveries is pretty minor. So even that there were a very deep crisis in Greece, it would not affect substantially our numbers. So that is what we can say to that. If that were an additional crisis possibly in other countries, of course, nothing can to be excluded, but this is not the case today.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I just wanted to take the opportunity to try to understand what you said especially to concerning the MAN and Scania Corporation. You said you wanted to put it into a broader framework. What does that mean? Do we have to expect more cooperation, more issues on this in this year or do you think that Scania and MAN are going to cooperate or are forced to do more together in the time after the Porsche integration? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. So we answered that question already three times, but okay, we will answer it again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may picture one of your sentences, because I think it's very important to understand that nobody is forced to do anything. It's just on the basis that people representing the interest of their companies have to be totally convinced that what they're going after is positive for the company they are representing. And that's why I said it might be a little bit time consuming, but it's always, in our view at least, worthwhile to take the time to get people convinced. And that's why in the past we have performed a number of single projects. There are some very positive effects coming out of these projects and that's always the best thing to get people convinced, and nowadays, we can say that the three companies, Volkswagen, MAN and Scania agree that an intensified cooperation between the involved companies is to the benefit of all the partners. And that's why currently, concrete opportunities of cooperation are being examined in in-depth discussions and we expect these opportunities to advance in the nearby future, of course, always on a jointly basis.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Klingler, you spoke about rising market shares everywhere of the world, but can you tell us something about the reasons for the significant drop in market share in Brazil? That's one of the most important markets for Volkswagen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. So one last question for Mr. Klingler. With regard to the market share situation in Brazil, if we can explain the situation here a bit better because there was a drop in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, as I mentioned before, the Brazilian market boosted in the first quarter due to the situation of the IPI; the IPI is some kind of registration tax which is in Brazil which has changed last year. And it has been beneficial for a lot of people to come into there in general. But that's I think the first thing and the first remark to do.</p>
          <p>The second remark is, as the boost was there we had clearly to be in line with the market in that perspective, so that means in the growth perspectives.
