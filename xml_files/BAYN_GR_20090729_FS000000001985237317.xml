        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.  The figures of the second quarter show how well Bayer's strategy has stood the test of time.  HealthCare turned in a strong and convincing performance, CropScience matched last year's record level, and business at MaterialScience stabilized.  Sales and underlying EBITDA of the Bayer Group improved compared with the first quarter, giving a more favorable year-on-year comparison.</p>
          <p>We made further progress with our working capital management, maintaining spending discipline during the quarter.  There was a clear improvement in free operating cash flow compared with both the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>We continue to make good strategic progress.  Our pharmaceutical business in China has been strengthened for the long term by our acquisition of the marketing rights for Bioton's insulin.  Agreements have been signed with DuPont and Monsanto that will expand our BioScience activities.  We have also announced the new focus on the research and development of enhanced wheat characteristics.</p>
          <p>Based on our achievements so far and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we can reaffirm our ambitious full year financial guidance of limiting the decline in the Group's underlying EBITDA to about 5%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a brief look at the numbers for the second quarter.  As always, I will concentrate on the currency and portfolio adjusted changes.  Group sales in the second quarter were down by nearly 9% year-on-year at about &#x20AC;8 billion.  The decline was entirely due to the economic weakness in major customer industries of MaterialScience.  The HealthCare and CropScience businesses continued to expand.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA was down by 7% to 1.765 billion.  HealthCare improved earnings by nearly 12%.  Earnings of CropScience have steadied.  MaterialScience also underlying EBITDA was well below the prior year quarter at 121 million.  This was clearly in excess of the first quarter figure.  Underlying EBIT of the Bayer Group for the quarter came in at 1.1 billion and core earnings per share were &#x20AC;1.05.</p>
          <p>Sales increased in all of the HealthCare divisions.  Sales in Pharmaceuticals rose by 6% largely due to the positive trend for most of our major prescription products.  The biggest increase was in sales of Nexavar, which were up by over 29%.  Nexavar grew sales in all regions.  In May, it was approved for the treatment of liver cancer in Japan.  The 13% growth in sales of Betaferon was mainly due to the price increases in the United States and a tender contract awarded in Russia.  The Yaz family of products continued to perform well with an increase of 4%.  Mirena was up by 9%.</p>
          <p>In May, we initiated market introduction of the new oral contraceptive, Qlaira, in Europe.  An application for marketing approval in the United States was filed in July.  The new product, a first-in-class oral contraceptive, will strengthen our women's health business.</p>
          <p>Lower shipments of Helixate to CFL resulted in a drop in sales of Kogenate.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA in Pharmaceuticals rose by nearly 15% to 812 million.  The increase was mainly due to the positive business performance and the synergies from the Schering integration.</p>
          <p>We were also able to report important news flow on our most important pharma pipeline project in the quarter.  We have published encouraging study results with Nexavar in combination with an oral chemotherapeutic in breast cancer.  In addition, we have launched two Phase III studies, one in monotherapy in lung cancer, and the other a combination study with Tarceva in liver cancer.  Further progress in building our cancer franchise has been achieved with our MEK inhibitor.  With this drug candidate, we presented encouraging data at ASCO.</p>
          <p>Let me also comment briefly on the Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding Xarelto.  We understand today that our initial assessment was a little too optimistic, but our view of the risk benefit profile of Xarelto has not changed and remains positive.  We and our partner, J&amp;J, are now working on the response and expect to resubmit in the fourth quarter of this year at the earliest.</p>
          <p>We are also happy to announce that enrollment for the ROCKET-AF trial, in which we are studying Xarelto in stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, has been completed.  The project is on track for filing in 2010 in this important indication.</p>
          <p>The Consumer Health business recovered some of its growth momentum in the second quarter, even though the effects of the drop in consumer demand are still being felt.  The OTC business grew by 2.5%, driven by strong sales of multivitamins and Bepanthen.  Sales of Aspirin and Aleve moved lower, however, especially in the United States.</p>
          <p>Our blood glucose monitoring system posted good increases in all regions, particularly Europe.  Sales of the Medical Care division rose by 3.5%.</p>
          <p>The Animal Health division had sales steady year-on-year.  Underlying EBITDA of the Consumer Health segment advanced by 4.5%, driven mainly by the positive business performance.  However, earnings were held back by adverse effects of currency changes on the cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>HealthCare's convincing performance in the second quarter means we can reconfirm our guidance for the full year.  We still plan to grow faster than the market average in all divisions and to improve the underlying EBITDA margin towards 28%.</p>
          <p>The CropScience business continued to expand in the second quarter with sales up 2%.  Growth was driven by higher selling prices, while volumes were somewhat lower.  Crop Protection recorded a slight improvement in sales compared to the strong second quarter of 2008.  Despite unfavorable weather patterns in some major growing areas, herbicides and insecticides posted encouraging growth, whereas sales of fungicides receded in nearly all regions.  The fungicides business was hampered by drought and by low disease pressure in Brazil and Southern Europe.  Our seed treatment business benefited especially from early orders for the fall treatment season in North America.</p>
          <p>Sales of Environmental Science showed a slight increase of 0.6%.  Sales of our products to private customers posted good growth in the United States.  Business with professional products for use in non-agricultural applications again shrank in North America while sales in other regions remained at about the prior year level.</p>
          <p>Sales of BioScience rose sharply on the quarter, posting a 17% increase.  The strength in BioScience for the long term, we signed a licensing agreement with DuPont in the second quarter on the use of LibertyLink traits in corn and soybeans.  We also entered into agreement with Monsanto on the use of Monsanto's glyphosate tolerance trait in our canola seeds and out-licensed our LibertyLink traits in canola.  These are further steps towards extending the reach of LibertyLink traits technology and building our seeds and traits platforms.</p>
          <p>As part of our strategy for further expanding the BioScience business, we have decided to establish a new research platform for wheat trait.  With about 25% of global agricultural land under wheat cultivation, this is the largest cereal crop in terms of acreage.</p>
          <p>In support of this expansion, we established a long-term alliance with Australia's national research organization, which is one of the world's leading institutions in the development of new wheat varieties.  Our goal is to develop new wheat varieties with higher yields, more efficient nutrient utilization and tolerance against abiotic stress.  First products could become available from 2015 onwards.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA of CropScience was level with the prior year period at 497 million.  The main factor preventing even better performance was higher raw material costs.</p>
          <p>The trend at CropScience in the first half confirms our optimistic forecast for the full year.  We still plan to continue expanding sales and maintain the underlying EBTDA margin at about 25%.</p>
          <p>As we expected, the MaterialScience business has stabilized considerably in the course of this year.  Sales were above the first quarter and underlying EBITDA showed substantial improvement.  The sequential recovery in underlying EBITDA was mainly due to higher volumes and lower raw material costs.  However, it was partly offset by erosion of selling prices.</p>
          <p>As of today, we are assuming that the bottom of the cycle has been reached, but there is still no sign of a sustained recovery in demand.  Sales were down more than 34% from the second quarter of last year with all businesses suffering from the generally weak demand in our customer industries.  Lower volumes, down 22%, were the main reason for the decline.  Lower selling prices diminished sales by 12%.  For this reason, underlying EBITDA at 121 million was still 67.5% below the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>We have responded extensively to the economic crisis.  Apart from the mothballing and contingency measures already announced, we began optimizing our asset structure is the second quarter and will permanently shut down certain production facilities at the end of this year.  This includes our production facility for resins in New Martinsville, in the United States, the production of polycarbonate films at Berlin, Connecticut, will be transferred to Deerfield, Massachusetts.  It has also been decided to close the chlor-alkali plant at Baytown.</p>
          <p>Part of the respective restructuring costs were recognized as special items in the second quarter.  Further restructuring may have to take place depending on market developments.  This action shows we have responded appropriately and decisively to the economic crisis.</p>
          <p>But the fundamental question is how do we see the business developing over the coming months?  Sales have improved since December, and that is encouraging.  Order levels in July support this trend.  On the other hand, raw material prices are rising again.  We still have to see whether we can manage to raise our selling prices to offset the increasing cost of raw materials.  However, we assume that underlying EBITDA at MaterialScience will be positive again in the third quarter and for the full year.</p>
          <p>When we presented our annual figures in March, we told you about the new Group-wide working capital project.  This project has been launched with the aim of reducing the cash tied up in working capital by more than &#x20AC;1 billion this year based on constant sales and prices.  We are therefore very pleased to report another substantial improvement in net cash flow in the second quarter.  The significant reduction in cash tied up in working capital resulted in a 57% increase in net cash flow, and 90% growth in the free operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>This strong performance enabled us to fully use the conversion proceeds from the mandatory convertible bonds to lower financial debt.  This is a pleasing result considering the high seasonal payouts in Q2 for dividends, interest and bonuses.</p>
          <p>Net debt at the end of the quarter was 11.7 billion, down 2.3 billion compared with the end of Q1.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our performance thus far clearly demonstrates that Bayer is continuing to deliver reliable performance even during challenging times.  Appropriate actions to improve our cost base and cash generation are underway.</p>
          <p>We continue to make good strategic progress with a series of seed transactions and the purchase of Bioton's Insulin for the Chinese market.  We are getting additional comfort from the substantial progress being made by our important pipeline projects.</p>
          <p>We are reaffirming our ambitious financial guidance of limiting the decline in Group EBITDA before special items to about 5%, and our targets for HealthCare and CropScience.  In MaterialScience, we are planning for positive underlying EBITDA also in the third quarter.  We expect Group sales in the region of 31 to 32 billion Euros.</p>
          <p>That concludes my brief introduction.  We will now be happy to take your questions.  Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  The first question comes from Sachin Jain.  Please state your full name, company name, followed by your question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch.  Just a question on each division, if I could.  Firstly, on Consumer Healthcare, I was wondering if you could provide some color on the regional stocking patterns that are underlying demand.  I was just looking at flat growth you had in the US, how much of that is restocking, and just some color on the underlying demand there.  And then, in Europe I think you've reported faster growth this quarter than the first quarter despite your comments at the analyst meeting in June of a de-stock.  So any color there would be useful.  And then, just a quick question on MaterialScience, any color you can give in terms of year-on-year bridges of that raw material and lower energy cost benefit in this quarter, and color on the extent of headwind going forward.  And then, just one question on Crop.  Are you able to quantify the extent of phasing in the quarter with earlier order received that you referred to.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.  Let's start with HealthCare, Consumer Health, Arthur, and then Patrick on BMS and Mr. Berschauer on CropScience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sachin, I think, first of all, as regards the US, we saw obviously some inventory recovery, but also an improvement in consumption which is a little more positive.  In Europe, we did see some de-stocking, but not as severe as we had sort of been concerned about.  However, there's still some indication that some major markets like Italy that the full extent of the de-stocking has not really been seen in the marketplace.  So, I would say in summary, we can take some encouragement by the stabilization and in some instances growth in both the US and Europe, and as such a little more optimistic about the outlook for our consumer business for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Patrick, on BMS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, if we look Quarter 2 to Quarter 2 '08/'09 comparison, the total raw material and the energy price difference is just shy of a 0.25 billion, or round about 247 million difference.  If we look at it sequentially on a quarterly basis between Quarter 1 and Quarter 2, this year, it's around about a 170 million difference.  Now, if we look ahead, and try and judge what happens next, we are of course faced with a difficult challenge in terms of predicting raw materials.  Clearly, raw materials are on the up at the moment with oil price, and we are certainly expecting there would be a risk on Quarter 3 around input prices.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Phasing in CropScience is very, very limited.  You ask me to talk about Seed Treatment business in North America.  We had a shift from Q3 to Q2 of in the range of about 30 million Euros.  That's all.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Richard Vosser .  Please state your full name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question.  It's Richard Vosser from J.P. Morgan.  Just following up on Sachin's question on Consumer Health, I wondered if you could comment on the profitability trends that you think you'll see in the coming quarters.  We've seen a good increase in the profitability obviously.  The sales trends were good, but you were talking about some cost savings, the plans you were implementing, I wonder if you could see further improvements to the margin from those plans getting forward for the next quarters.  Then on the Nexavar, I wondered if you could elaborate on your plans in breast cancer going forward and potential timelines of potential Phase III trials there.  And staying on Nexavar, I'm just wondering about the penetration of Nexavar in liver cancer in Europe.  I know we're pretty early in the curve -- in the penetration curve in Asia and obviously Japan's just been approved, but how are we doing in Europe would be very useful.  And then, finally one quick question on Xarelto.  I wondered if you could give us an update on the safety across the long-term trails, particularly the signals for any liver injury, I'm just wondering if that's still pretty clean from across the Safety Monitoring Board updates that you see.  Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I will do.  Thank you, Richard.  Richard, as we had predicted in our Q1 conference call that we would see an improvement in margins in our consumers business as a result of more discipline on our expense management.  You've seen that clearly across all of our businesses in the second quarter.  We will continue to apply that level of discipline.  Richard, you can also understand we're trying to gauge that with any recovery in the marketplace.  So I would not want to be too directional in terms of margins apart from clearly they will deteriorate from this position. But we will watch with care, if there is a recovery in the market then we will also make sure that a share of voice is also in line with that.  So that's all I would say at this point.</p>
          <p>In terms of Nexavar and breast, it's probably very exciting news, we are beginning our discussions with regulatory agencies and hope to inform you shortly about a strategy for Nexavar and breast.  Suffice it to say that we are looking to start a Phase III study no later than Q1, 2010.  And in respect to Xarelto, let's make it very clear.  If we have a problem with liver you'll be the first to know about it.  The liver issue with Nexavar remains that we have seen no signal there's any concern that we have a liver issue with Xarelto and that remains to be the position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very reassuring.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Cornelia Thomas.  Please state your full name, company name, followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question.  It's Cornelia Thomas from WestLB here.  I've just got two questions of you if I may.  One is on special items.  You mentioned that there was a 17 million euro payment to the German corporate, pension assurance association.  I'm just wondering if we're supposed to sort of expect more of that this year or if that's it for this year?  And then, question on Xarelto.  You've already mentioned again that you're planning to resubmit in Q4 this year, just wondering what the timelines are from there, what you're expecting and I guess also, if you are able to give any more details on the issues that the FDA has asked to be addressed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Thomas De Win will answer your question regarding the pension and then I'll answer Xarelto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the accrual for the pension has been built based on the already known and existing insolvencies in Germany, so theoretically if there will be no additional insolvency in Germany, we would not have any additional extraordinary accruals on these items.  However, this might be -- let's say improbable, but we don't know what the future will be, so this is the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Xarelto ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  On Xarelto, as we have mentioned, our partner J&amp;J is responsible for the submission in the US. They've indicated, they don't expect to submit a complete response to the FDA until the fourth quarter the latest.  If you assume-earliest, sorry earliest.  Assuming a technical Class 2 review, which would take six months, I think you could do the calculation and say we would not expect to launch now before mid-2010.  In regards to your question about any further details, I would hope everybody on the call today would agree that we've been very transparent in updating you on the process of the registration, however, you also must understand as I mentioned J&amp;J is in the lead in this matter and secondly, they obviously are sensitive to disclose specifics regarding the discussions with the FDA.  So, I think again in our press release of July 14 we explained that the FDA was trying to gain greater comfort on the risk benefits.  And as you heard from Mr. Wenning, we remain very confident that we have a very positive risk benefit as well as some additional information on record study sites.  So, that's the situation.  I think we have given more information than most companies in this circumstance and I hope that's very helpful for you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Jo Walton.  Please state your full name, company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo Walton from Credit Suisse.  One question just on restructuring.  You've reiterated the same special item charge that you told us about before, but you also talk about accelerating changes within MaterialScience, if you do do that acceleration, is it likely that there will be a materially larger special charge this year or can you give us some idea of what sort of charges would come with that restructuring, perhaps they won't come until next year?  And on the pharma side, I wonder if you could tell us a little bit more about Betaferon outside of the US.  You talk about a Russian tender, I don't know how significant that is. Is there any sign of Betaferon slowing down anywhere where Extavia is now available?  On Nexavar, could you give us the China and Japan sales numbers, you've very helpfully given that in the past, so I may have missed it in the mountains of disclosure and could you also give us some idea of how big the opportunity is in China? You mentioned your Bioton deal with insulin; is this something where you can get that drug put on the essential drug list and really is this a very significant opportunity for you?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Let's start with the restructuring in BMS, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the restructuring in BMS, I think you'll remember the story was that we told you the annual savings were around  about 300 million expected by the end of this year in the program which we started towards the end of 2007.  And that's the program that you referred to this as having been accelerated, and approximately 200 million of those savings have already been materialized, of which 160 were in 2008.  Fresh savings this year are around about 150 and the program now totals 350.  And then, on top of that we launched a series of contingency measures because of the current economic recession.  And the expected savings this year for those are around about 50 million.  Now, several of those do not actually require special item charges because they are delaying expenditure or cancellation of travel or other SG&amp;A type activities which don't require restructuring.  If we look at the running program, it requires around about 100 million of restructuring costs during 2009, and costs related to any other initiatives beyond those we've already announced obviously aren't quantified and dependent on the measures that we are going to take and put in place later on in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then Pharma, Betaferon, Arthur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jo, first of all the Russian tender was &#x20AC;20 million.  I would say that we are reasonably pleased with how we have managed the Extavia launch in Europe.  You also may be aware Jo that Novartis published their sales for Extavia in the second quarter; that was &#x20AC;6 million, so that gives you a sense of their initial penetration.  So I would at this point like to say that our original guidance for the year for Betaferon, which was essentially to be in line with 2008, now appears to be a little conservative.  Assuming that we do see Extavia launch in the US in the fourth quarter, and that's yet to be seen whether that will happen, but let's assume that it does happen, I think we would be comfortable to now look towards the full year performance currency adjusted of Betaferon in the range of three to 5% compared to our previous flat guidance.  I hope that's good information for you.</p>
          <p>As far as Nexavar is concerned, let me give you the breakdown across all the geographies, and that will save additional questions coming later.  So of the total worldwide sales of &#x20AC;147 million, which again was a very pleasing plus 30%, we had 39 million in the US with a growth rate of plus 15, 64 million in Europe with a growth rate of 28%, which again brings me back to the question of how we're doing in Europe in terms of penetration of Nexavar HCC versus kidney.  Clearly the majority of the business is coming from liver but as you are seeing from the growth rates, we are still seeing very good development in the European markets.</p>
          <p>In Japan, a very good quarter of &#x20AC;14 million, which was plus 50%, China 9 million, plus 40%, rest of the world 21, leading as I say to a very impressive performance in the quarter of 147 million plus 30% FX adjusted.</p>
          <p>And then on your last question on Bioton insulin, this does represent a significant opportunity for us in China.  We are with Hakuba one of the leading players in the Chinese diabetes market.  We believe that we can have a product with Bioton that's as large as we have with Hakuba, so a very significant opportunity for us.  The product is approved.  We have some work to do to get it to the market, but we expect to be in the Japanese market some time in &#x2013; sorry, Chinese market some time in 2010.  So I hope I've covered all your points, Jo.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  Neil Tyler of JPMorgan. Couple of questions back to the chemicals businesses, please.  Werner, you mentioned that further restructuring will have to take place depending on the market development, I just wanted to confirm the way to read that is, whether or not we should anticipate further restructuring even if things don't improve, namely there will be some but we are not quite -- you are not quite sure how much?  Or if the market improves, then there won't need to be, I just wanted to see whether you could perhaps talk a little bit more around that subject please?</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regard to the raw material headwind in CropScience, I wonder if you would mind putting some quantification around that.  Secondly, what visibility you have over the second half and how that turns out and also into 2010 and also on CropScience, how your negotiations if any have yet taken place are shaping up in terms of price development into the new season.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's start again with the expected restructuring. Patrick, and then we are going to CropScience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Neil, to answer your question I think you are referring to the notes that we have put out talking about the second quarter decisions we've made to make further measures to permanently shut down certain production activities in polyurethanes, coatings, adhesives and sealants and basic chemicals by end of this year.  There will indeed be further restructuring beyond that depending upon market development, especially in polycarbonates.  In that arena, and we've talked about this I know on the Management Day and on other occasions, we are making a number of ongoing assessments at the moment whether certain production corporations coupled with selective line closures in both predominantly Europe and North America are feasible, and we will make those decisions towards the end of this year on whether they are distributed restructuring or more singular locations, more drastic measures.</p>
          <p>Those are primarily driven not just by the current economic crisis, they're driven by the changes in the structure of the polycarbonate market, and as you will remember the market for optical data storage long-term is going to decline as new data storage technologies come out, and therefore that part of the market for polycarbonate will reduce.  Historically it's been up as high as 30% of the polycarbonate market, now it's down in the high 20s, although it has to be said the current release of Iceman 3 and Harry Potter, the death of Michael Jackson has resulted in a huge boost to the optical data storage market, because for each of those three blockbusters you can read in around about 7,000 tons of polycarbonate per film.  So you never quite get these predictions right but long-term I'm convinced the format is going to be redundant.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, CropScience, yeah you asked about the impact of raw material and energy cost this year and what we are expecting for next year, we reported an increase of raw material and energy costs in the first quarter of around about 40 million.  In the second quarter we are expecting to have round about 20 to 30 million increased cost.  We expect some relief in the second half of this year in the range of 10 to 20 million and for the year 2010, I do not have clear figures so far, but overall we should prepare to expect no raw material energy cost compared to the full year of 2008.  In terms of price negotiations...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew Scott , Merrill Lynch.  Couple of questions, one on the capacity closures, the permanent ones you mentioned, what percentage of your total global production are you closing?  And if you can run through byproduct please?  Secondly, a question on CropScience, what's your sense of inventories in the system after a very weak Q2?  I know it wasn't weak for you specifically but for the industry so far it looks as though it was somewhat weaker?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first capacity -- we added capacity BMS, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew the permanent closures we are talking about I can give you some detail of, although for some of the competitive reasons we are not disclosing full details.  The permanent closure of our resins operations in New Martinsville are relatively small as a percentage of our total capacity but represents an opportunity to improve our cost and distribution system.</p>
          <p>The chlorine electrolysis for example in Baytown is a cost opportunity.  It doesn't impact at all on our capacity because it's actually a recycling system inside our plant, which recycles hydrochloric acid back into chlorine.  So there is a cost benefit operating that unit as we no longer need that capacity and we have a similar situation for another unit in Germany.</p>
          <p>One of the things we are doing in America is closing and consolidating a polycarbonates and <mark type="inaudible" /> production plant into one site in Deerfield and really the issue there again is not total capacity, we are not going to impact the supply and demand balance, what we are going to do is save some costs.  And we will also close one small MPI unit which will not be significant or  material in terms of actual capacity but it does again have an impact on our cost structure and simplifies our operations.  So for competitive reasons we don't give the exact capacity impact so perhaps instead of that I can give you some idea as to where we are currently operating in terms of utilization, which is perhaps more helpful in terms of looking forward.  And I can give it to you in two ways, one is as a percentage of name plate which is our traditional way of looking at it and then secondly the percentage in terms of available capacity when you take out old capacity that is currently mothballed or closed.  So on polycarbonates against name plate we are currently operating at around about 60% of capacity and that after allowing for mothballing and closures is just slightly above 80%.  On MDI the numbers are identical:  60% on name plate and 80 on...</p>
          <p>On mothballed capacity.  And on TDI, it's higher, we're operating about 70% nameplate and about 90% allowing for mothballed capacity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, total inventories in CropScience, last year, was the second year the <mark type="inaudible" /> almost was empty and I firmly believe this was the major reason for the excellent performance of <mark type="inaudible" /> ( 45:02) industry in the first quarter.  This year there will be channel inventories, that's obvious.  We will have a clear picture roundabout end of August this year as every year.  I assume in terms of our business that our channel inventories will be on a reasonable level.  That's the present situation.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jean De Watteville.  Please state your full name, company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi.  Jean De Watteville from Nomura speaking.  First question is on the volumes on MaterialScience.  If I compare the volumes that you have reported this quarter with the volumes that you've indicated for April during the &#x2013; during Investor Day, it seems like there has been a month-by-month improvement.  And I was wondering if you could provide some color as to what happens market by market in the course of the second quarter.  And more importantly, getting into the summer, I just would like to know if you can share your thoughts about any potential volume weakness, particularly in Europe with the usual seasonal weakness that we have in Europe.  So that's for the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on actually still on MaterialScience.  Obviously we can track MDI, TDI prices and polycarbonate prices, but it's very difficult for us to track the polyurethane system prices.  And we know there are lagging effects here because of the decline of polyurethane raw material prices.  And I was wondering if you could provide some color again on where we are on potential price declines for the systems and what again you're seeing into Q3.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I would like to ask a question on CropScience that we &#x2013; you've mentioned the fact that the herbicides sales for Liberty North America were particularly strong.  We can see that on your tables, we know there is a couple of agreement of using the Liberty Link traits with some of the other seed companies.  And I was wondering whether we should be aware of any inventory pattern that are related to those agreements, and therefore we should be aware of potential weakness of Liberty sales in the forthcoming quarters.  Thank you.  These are my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll start again with MaterialScience, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jean, the question about monthly volumes, I don't intend to keep going with this reporting every single month volume, but let me help you a little bit.  When we were together last, we talked about April and May sales estimates.  The actual May numbers came out a tiny bit lower, but the June sales came up a little bit higher.  So if I look at all the months year-to-date including July, then there has been a sequential increase in sales in each of those months.  So that's probably the most important thing in terms of the sort of monthly picture.</p>
          <p>You asked for some color about what's going on in volumes around the world.  I would say that the strongest return to normality is taking place in Asia led by China, although other countries in Asia are now recovering.  And in fact if I look at purely the volumes, so the kilotons of materials sold in July, we are close or at similar levels to prior year.  Behind that comes Europe, Africa and Middle East region where we're still below last year's levels.  We're getting fairly close to that sort of level.  And the most affected in terms of volumes is the United States and the Americas where we are still bumping along pretty much at the levels we were on earlier this year at the &#x2013; with regards to crisis.  So there has been less recovery there.</p>
          <p>If we pick out some of the sort of specific markets and then turn to your question on systems, in Asia Pacific I think if you look at the total polyurethanes market, it's only 3% down versus last year on the first half year.  We expect in half 2 to see some growth above last year primarily because of the stimulus packages.  There are some good examples in China for example where the appliance industry, the refrigeration industry is posting record sales.  The largest producer, Haier, has just got record sales because of what's called the appliance incentive program for selected coastal cities and rural areas, which essentially means nearly 400 million people got some form of incentive to actually buy a refrigerator for their home and that's just had a dramatic impact on that market.</p>
          <p>If we look at the automotive area, clearly America has been very unattractive for all of the polymers that we sell and demand is probably 30% down compared to prior year in quarter two.  Small car sales in Europe are being stimulated by government incentive plans.  Actually in July, we saw some of the luxury cars beginning to pick up again.  But more importantly in Asia we're seeing record growth because of government rebate systems again in China and for very high demand for very low cost compact cars produced in India exported into China.  China will probably exceed 10 million car units by year-end, which will make it a bigger global producer of vehicles than the USA.  And Nissan and Honda are now planning to invest I believe into China and start to take advantage of the growth of that domestic market.  So the picture is fairly mixed.</p>
          <p>When we turn to systems and pricing, we really haven't seen such an impact on systems pricing in polyurethane as we have in the more commoditized area of MDI and PDI or slabstock polyols, and generally that is true.  The response is much slower, customers tend to be looking at systems pricing in terms of the value that we bring rather than a oil-derivativized price or some other type of formula price <mark type="inaudible" /> and that is holding still even in this crisis with the change in demand.  And in fact some system sales are doing extremely well, particularly around the area of insulation where specialist <mark type="inaudible" /> insulation systems are doing very good business as people are not moving home, but they're choosing to upgrade their properties particularly in the USA.</p>
          <p>&lt; Q &#x2013; Jean De Watteville&gt;: Okay.  And with regard to lean herbicides, CropScience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you asked about the possible risk of Liberty of 2008 inventories, it's basically not there because we had limited capacities.  We took a decision last year to expand further our capacities in <mark type="inaudible" /> which has been done.  So this was a product still under allocation and there is a huge demand in North America as well in Asia.  So for the &#x2013; at least for the foreseeable future, this is really not a problem.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andreas Heine from UniCredit.  Good afternoon.  First I'd like to come back to the MaterialScience again.  The net working capital was down quite something and was main reason for the very good free &#x2013; net cash flow.  How do you see this progressing in the second half as now raw material prices are increasing and also volume is picking up?  Secondly, also relating to this, the cash flow was very strong, especially in the second quarter, but the target for the net debt has not changed for this year.  Is this just a little bit cautious or are there reasons why you are a little bit more cautious for the second half?  And is it fair to assume in &#x2013; a HealthCare related question, that if there are still some obstacles in Consumer Health in the second half that the margin progression you want to achieve in HealthCare will come this year only from the pharma side?  These are my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Patrick on BMS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, BMS working capital, thank you for that question, Andreas, we have worked very hard on our working capital so far and will continue to push hard.  Seasonally quarter one would normally have been a cash flow out in working capital.  And for the first time in many years it was a positive just over 270 million inflow.  And we added to that in quarter two with a further 165 million of working capital change.  Those are now going to be quite difficult to follow, as you suggest, because the risk in quarter three is higher on high raw material costs with the obvious impact that has on valuation of stock and payables.  What we intend to do is try and hold roughly the end of quarter two position in terms of working capital and keep that to year-end.  So that's our target and that's what we would like to try and deliver, and that will be consistent with delivering a positive cash flow for the full year regardless of the trading conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I mean also, that's because <mark type="inaudible" /> ending that number, I think we have an ambitious target.  We are not yet there.  And the second half is the half where we actually will reduce our net debt further.  First half reduction was mainly due to the convertible.  Second half will be due to further improved net cash flow.  So that was part of our overall project.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andreas, I think your assessment is correct.  So I think if we &#x2013; as we've demonstrated in the second quarter that consumer business can get it back broadly in line with historical levels, that's a very significant achievement in a time of global recession for our consumer businesses.  But net-net, you are right that the improvement overall for the year in HealthCare margins will come from <mark type="inaudible" /> business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello.  Christian Faitz from Sal. Oppenheim.  Three questions if I may.  First of all, can &#x2013; on CropScience, can you be a bit more precise in was the Liberty where you saw second nice sequential improvement, how much of the Liberty sales are actually attributable to the Monsanto deal.  And then, a question regarding MaterialScience, can you be a bit more precise on your assessment of the summer dip which might be there, because quite a few car companies, for example, are taking extended summer holidays compared to previous years?  And then, in Healthcare any update on what you said during the Meet the Management day in June regarding a potential appetite for animal health assets?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's start with CropScience.  Yeah, you asked about &#x2013; our Liberty link sales and <mark type="inaudible" /> sales, our improvements around about half of this can be attributed to our agreement with our partners and the other half is mainly, as I mentioned before, significantly increased demand in Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, coming back to your question about our appetites in -- you mentioned animal health, I would like to make a more general statement.  It is part of our strategy, was, is and will be part of our strategy to improve our Life Science portfolio and of course if a significant stake in &#x2013; a significant asset in life science would be available, of course and it fit into our structure and into our portfolio, of course, we would consider if it makes sense for us to be part of this process.  It's our strategy today and in the future.  But, I can't -- of course, you will understand that I cannot be here much more precise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Christian, you asked a question about the summer dip.  We've argued a lot about the summer dip and we, on balance across all industry sectors, we have concluded there may well not be a summer dip and things are going to be fairly flat through the summer.  There is a couple of reasons for distortions to the normal seasonality.  And in fact, if you look year-on-year-on-year, there actually isn't a normal seasonality in our business overall.  If you look at specific segments, you can see seasonality, for example, the construction industry in Europe.  But for a whole variety of reasons, we think that the seasonal dip will not be as dramatic as it has been in one or two years.  Some of that effect, what we're seeing, in June, for example, we encouraged our customers in the US to place some orders ahead of a first week of July SAP implementation, a major systems upgrade, and that meant that some July sales were pulled into June.  But also, we're also announcing price increases, particularly in polyurethanes, and certainly we're seeing some orders in July coming in ahead of August, because of price.  So I think those factors are having more influence in the movement of order entry rather than the conventional construction l holidays.  To be honest, in the construction industry activity is relatively low, those companies that have buildings to build are getting on and building them to keep their workforce busy.  Some car companies are actually pulling people back into work having taking their holidays a lot earlier in the year, in effect.  So, it's &#x2013; I think this year is looking fairly stable and consistent and not as seasonal perhaps as it might have been, mainly we will see that change in quarter four over the holiday period, Christmas period.</p>

Just one question, going back to the MaterialScience and the raw material cost, if you could give us the absolute number of raw material, costed MaterialScience in Q2 and then also to confirm, you previously talk about &#x20AC;1 billion lower raw material cost for the full year, if current trends would have been maintained in end of May. Just checking whether that was adjusted for lower volumes this year or was that the number that would have been the case if volumes would have been on the 2008 level?  Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look the raw material basket, the estimate in terms of billions for the full year would have been around about 2 billion for 2009, that's our estimate based upon current volumes.  That represents about 8% of our total raw materials.  Previous year it was around about 3.4.  So there you've got the two effects mixed together, one is with volume and the other is with price.  If we look at the underlying price differences and our forecast, we come slightly short of the 1 billion we talked about before.  So you're right, we did talk about a 1 billion year-on-year improvement in costs of raw materials.  But I think now as we look at it, we're seeing the raw materials rising in the third quarter and then it's anybody guess what happens in the fourth quarter.  If you look at the consensus views on oil price and oil delivery prices, they're all over the place and some believe it'll rise in the fourth quarter and some believe it will fall.  You can choose your view.  So, you're right about the 1 billion we talked about earlier.  It will be lower than that 1 billion and it would be around about the range of 800, 800-850.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Rim Bennani from Exane BNP Paribas.  Just actually two questions on the CropScience side of the business.  One of your peers is actually quoting higher year-on-year volumes for H2 for the Crop section business and I want to get your view on that.  As well still on the H2, I completely understand you're still in the middle of negotiations, I just wanted to know what kind of state of mind, you're going into, is it for higher flat lower flat prices?  And finally, just a clarification, it wasn't clear for me.  Do you think that there was an impact of kind of Q1 early orders affecting Q2 or was it not really a driver into your Q2 count?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you talk about the performance of the industry in the second quarter, at least the published number, I have seen so far and you have seen as well demonstrates that the industry is so obvious in  numbers the second quarter of some of our major competitors in crop protection were not very impressive.  Let me say, it might have been no doubt very good performance in the first quarter.  I made this comment also during our last call that first quarter in our business always is mainly flattened fully.  Now talking about the pricing situation overall, we have implemented over our full portfolio price increases of around 4% and we believe we can keep this level for the rest of the year.  And next year we also believe that we can further increase price increases, but it's too early to give you a clear indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the volumes in crop section for H2 where do you actually stand, what's your view on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can speak of our business.  We are expecting still a small growth in volumes for the remaining of the year, and as indicated continuation of the price increases we implemented so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And where do you think growth in volumes will come from for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Well, for the competition market, volumes -- no significant growth, probably flat and so the increase in sales will come from increased prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Thank you for taking my question.  Florent Cespedes, Exane BNP Paribas.  Questions on healthcare, first to go on Betaferon, could you tell us how you see the competition in Europe outside Germany going forward.  And then, another one on Betaferon.  What is your view in the US for next year, given that fact that Novartis is planning to launch Extavia.  Is the German life situation a good benchmark?  Another question on the consumer from which regions of business you could see some potential recovery in the coming quarters and the last one on the research on <mark type="inaudible" />, could we have an update on this project, because I think a good season was expected this time &#x2013; at this point of time?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Start with Betaferon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Again, I think I tried to cover the Betaferon situations earlier.  As I mentioned we're actually increasing our guidance now for the full year. As to what will happen next year with Extavia in the US.  Who knows that when <mark type="inaudible" /> launch, we're not going to get involved in making any predictions on how they will launch.  However what I tried to share with you was based on our experience with the European launch of Extavia and the fact we looked at the rest of the world performance, we still were able to grow in the second quarter.  I'm reasonably confident that we can minimize this impact.  As to Germany, I think again to look at one market is not appropriate, you got to look at the response across the variety of European markets and again I think on that basis, I think we are reasonably comforted with the initial market reaction and aren't about to respond to the Extavia launch.  As for the consumer business, I think a general statement for healthcare, our challenge year-to-date has been in the US a lot of that related to inventory and some softness of consumption.  We have started to see a recovery in the US in the second quarter in our consumer business which I referred to earlier is a combination of both restocking but also of modest consumption and we are expecting growth across all regions of our consumer business in the second half of the year.  As to the products, particularly the Epo phase 2 is ongoing and we will make a decision based on the results of that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thomas Gilbert, UBS.  I have got two questions on healthcare and two on CropScience.  I will start with healthcare, could you quantify what the impact of bolt-on acquisitions was on the bottom line of the consumer health business in the first half please?  Secondly, I still try to understand why just hours after the complete response letter was issued you came up with the statement before Johnson &amp; Johnson who you say is in the driving seat as far as the trial is concerned, just trying to understand where the difference in communication is stemming from.  The third question is then over to CropScience, your seed care business grew 33%, if you strip out the 30 million pre-purchase for the third quarter, it's up 15%.  You mentioned that you lost the business with pioneer <mark type="inaudible" />, can you quantify what you think the market growth in this area is whether you are growing at this point faster, equal, or slower than the market?</p>
          <p>And the final question is on Smart Stax, Monsanto has gotten EPA approval and has quantified the acreage that they want to -- that they target in terms of initial launches and then out to 2012, you have refused to disclose the royalty per acre in the past citing that the regulatory situation isn't clear, it is now clear, would you mind quantifying the royalty agreement with Monsanto?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe let's start with healthcare, the bolt-ons.  Thomas, we do actually also tell you what the portfolio adjustment was, which was 2.5% growth for our consumer care business and if you look at the bolt-ons it's essentially SAG mill and Thompson and combined the represented &#x20AC;70 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As to your comment on the difference -- or perceived difference, there is no perceived difference.  This was a unified statement between J&amp;J and Bayer.  We do however have a the difference of time, our markets start before their markets, so you will -- and many of <mark type="inaudible" /> hear from us before you hear from J&amp;J, so let me reassure you our assessment of both companies in that first 24 hours was identical, the assessment of both companies now having had the benefit of discussions with the regulatory agency is also unified.  So there really is not only a difference, there really is strong alignment between both companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow-up on that -- thank you very much.  On the consumer health, the sales accretion is clear, does that mean it accreted -- does that mean it has accreted a 20 cent EBITDA margin or anything like to the bottom line as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean I don't have that specific, but clearly because these are new businesses they are not as profitable as our existing businesses so you can assume that they're diluted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah <mark type="inaudible" /> you asked question, the first one was free treatment market share.  So far honestly we do not have any details in terms of the performance of the overall markets in free treatment.  The information I am having to provide is that the <mark type="inaudible" /> market shares in the free treatment segment but again we do not know so far how this market overall performance in the first half.</p>
          <p>In terms of our dealings with Monsanto, we have clear agreement with Monsanto that we do not disclose any financials and we will stick to this and have to stick to this fully.</p>

          <p>Okay, sorry.  Is it now better?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, <mark type="inaudible" /> also three of my four question.  First on healthcare, Avelox sales was now second quarter weakish obviously in the first quarter it was potentially something like a seasonal let's say a low flu season effect.  Anything which we should get worried here with Avelox or do you think it will bounce back on to growth path in the next quarter?</p>
          <p>Kogenate, I think you had almost no shipping in Q2, however also USA was clearly weak, you had before a guidance mid single to high single growth, do you have to change anything on that and what is actually that they look for long-term outlook, is still the markets growing in your view high to mid single to high single digit?  In terms of Bayer CropScience, I just want to get a clarification, if I rightly understand you now guide for 4% price increase on the full year 2009 versus 2008 whereas your previous guidance of 2 to 3, is that my right understanding that you will keep that 4% for the full year just to clarify that.</p>
          <p>And last question on Bayer MaterialScience and restructuring.  Obviously, all the permanent closures you have announced so far are based on cost savings -- structural cost savings.  Is it right to assume that this was actually part of your original planning on the cost savings or what assumption additionally and if we look for additional closures, would that be just based for polycarbonate or is also in the polyurethane MDI, TDI anything you could think about of permanent closures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Avelox and Kogenate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ronald, there were two things that you have to take into consideration.  Firstly Avelox is difficult to project because obviously our shipments to Schering-Plough are not necessarily inline within market performance and that was a factor in the second quarter.  Having said that, our performance outside of the US only showed a 3% year-over-year growth and some of that weakness versus-that was probably our initial expectations reflected the fact that we did have a dear Doctor letter in Europe relating to a very <mark type="inaudible" /> skin reaction.  We often find when these dear doctor letters are circulated that it has an impact in the market but we also find that the physicians who had long-term experience on products, normally would gain comfort.  So, I don't think the second quarter performance is necessarily indicative of the outlook for the brand.</p>
          <p>As to Kogenate, the performance of the franchise year-to-date and certainly specifically in the second quarter has been influenced by two key factors.  The first Ronald has been a shift in some tender business between ourselves and CSL <mark type="inaudible" />.  So in other words, within the franchise, that took place in Canada and the UK.  This issue has been exacerbated by obtaining of shipments to CSL.  CSL like I think many companies, ourselves included, are obviously managing inventories very carefully.  As a result we are now being a little more conservative in terms of our outlook for this year but looking at our currency adjusted growth rate of 4 to 6% for the Kogenate franchise, this is slightly below our midterm guidance.  We do expect to return to that guidance in 2010 as we are pretty sure from our analysis, we're not losing volume market share and the market continues to develop in that low single digit range and we are getting a little bit of benefit from that.  So, as this anniversarys out, we would expect the brand to be back in line with our midline guidance of above 6% growth in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to Avelox, so should we then assume to come back to growth as of 2010 or might it be that this product will be now kind of flattish going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we would believe we can get it growing again in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. K&#xF6;hler you asked about our price increases, so I've been talking about our performance in the first half of this year.  We increased -- implemented mix price increases in Crop Protection of round about 4%, in environmental science of round about 2% and in bioscience in the range of 6 to 7%.  Now talking about the second half of the year, in terms of bioscience the business in canola and cotton basically is done, so in second half we just have the <mark type="inaudible" /> business, the vegetable feed business, really had price increases in the range of 3 to 4% in sales which is a indication that this will change.</p>
          <p>In environmental science, I also believe the 2% will be sustainable and in Crop Protection as I addressed before, the crop business going to be of course in Southern Hemisphere here specifically in Brazil.  And as I indicated before, we are just now in the middle of the price negotiations with our major customers.  Our target and what we are really aiming for is again also in Crop Protection a price increase on the same level from the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So which means this is then up to the previous target of 2 to 3% if I rightly understand.  I mean you had more price increases than you initially thought of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have been more -- little bit more successful than originally planned but again if you talk about 2 or 3 or 1% different, it's not too important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ronald on the BMS restructuring to be clear, the program we talked about over the last few quarters does not include the new measures that we announced in quarter two.  So the permanent closures that we talked about in quarter two are in addition to that existing program and that restructuring will continue through the rest of this year and it have its main financial benefit in 2010 although we have taken provisions for those changes in quarter two.  On the further restructuring beyond that, we are primarily talking exclusively about polycarbonates because that's a long term cycle prices despite any short term supply and demand issues.  Longer term we believe we will have to permanently close an asset.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there.  It's Joe Joanne from Citi.  Just a couple of questions left for Arthur if I may.  Firstly, I was looking ahead to ESB, we're going to be getting the bigger term data from the RELY study, so clearly I don't expect you to try and predict the outcome of that study.  But I wondered if you could provide a bit of color around how the results of that study might read through into the development programs particularly in AS.  And also whether there is any particular differences for example in internal design or population that means we should exercise some caution in getting too sort of excited or depressed depending on how that study comes out?</p>
          <p>And secondly on pharma margin, the Schering integration is now complete you've shaken out the pipeline, done a lot of work in R&amp;D particularly, what are your leavers going forward in terms of improving that pharma margin and are you willing to share any sort of middle or longer term targets or programs that are ongoing to keep driving that margin increase in pharma?</p>

          <p>Joe , first of all on dabigatran, no surprise.  We are not going to comment or speculate.  So I may just for the sake of some color and some levity this afternoon say that I share the view of <mark type="inaudible" /> our Head of Development.  And our view is that a positive outcome would be good for this class of agents and I think from our perspective with no real negative bearing on Xarelto, because again we feel that with Xarelto we have a best in class agent that really does address the unmet medical needs in the market.  So we are not concerned and to be honest with some of the issues and nervousness that some regulatory authorities, including the FDA have about new agents, sometimes it is not so bad. There's some positive news out there.  So that's our more colorful view but no desire or need to comment on dabigatran.  As for our pharma business, we are very pleased with how we have been able to develop margins.  I think all I would say this afternoon, we will remain committed to looking at how we ensure we have a modern and forward thinking pharmaceutical business.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jessica Li.  Please state your full name, company name followed by your question.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions.  Jessica Li from Goldman Sachs.  I wonder whether you could comment on your development plan for <mark type="inaudible" /> and how do you see this compound fitting into the mix of our franchise? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jessica, first of all, let's make it very clear.  Fitting into the mix of our franchise is not the way that we look at this asset.  We will develop it as a standalone oncology agent and we will develop it as we do all oncology agents by doing single studies and if we find a signal we will aggressively develop it.  So, I think I wanted to disabuse people of this idea that our strategy will be dependent on Nexavar, it will be solely driven by the data we have available on a vas inhibitor.  That will determine our strategy and so far we are very encouraged by some of the signals and as we mentioned we expect to be in Phase III with this asset in 2010.</p>
