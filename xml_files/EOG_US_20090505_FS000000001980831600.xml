          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the EOG Resources First Quarter 2009 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2009 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.</p>
          <p>This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at eogresources.com.</p>
          <p>The SEC currently permits producers to disclose only proved reserves in their securities filings. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast including those for the Barnett Shale, North Dakota Bakken, Horn River and Haynesville may include other categories of reserves. We incorporate by reference the cautionary notes to U.S. investors that appear at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. An updated Investor Relations presentation and statistics were posted to our website last night.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>We filed an 8-K with second quarter and full year guidance yesterday. I'll discuss this guidance along with our 2009 strategy in a minute when I review operations. I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter net income available to common stockholders and discretionary cash flow. Then I'll review our updated plan for 2009 and operational results. Tim Driggers will provide some financial details and then I'll provide some macro comments and concluding remarks.</p>
          <p>As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter EOG reported net income available to common stockholders of $158.7 million or $0.63 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income available to common stockholders to eliminate mark-to-market impacts as outlined in the press release, EOG's first quarter adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $132.7 million $0.53 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $732.5 million.</p>
          <p>Before I review our first quarter operational activities, it's worthwhile to take a summary look at 2008 final results. We reported our fourth quarter results early in the cycle, and only after all peer companies reported their full year results did we realize that EOG had achieved differentiating results regarding 2008 metrics.</p>
          <p>We finished first among the large cap peer group in every critical category: best stock performance, highest ROCE, lowest all-in finding cost, highest debt adjusted production growth, lowest unit cost, lowest net debt ratio, no significant financial write-downs, and de minimus price effective reserve write-downs.</p>
          <p>They say the past is prologue and we'd encourage investors to focus on the stark performance differences here. It's rare when one company can claim annual outperformance in every single critical metric. And I hope it gives our shareholders a lot of comfort.</p>
          <p>Regarding 2009, we've raised our production growth target from 3 to 5.5% while keeping our CapEx estimate flat at $3.1 billion. This new growth target is notable because we've restricted our Bakken oil production for the first six months of this year due to marketing issues. The incremental 2.5% production growth is comprised entirely of higher North American liquids and Trinidad gas. The largest tranche of the incremental increase is North American crude, condensate and NGLs, driven by strong results from our Bakken and Barnett plays.</p>
          <p>This trend of increasing North American liquids production will continue over the coming years as our horizontal oil plays begin to have greater impact. The increase in Trinidad gas production is due to quicker turnaround on third party plant maintenance than originally forecast. I'll also note that the 5.5% production growth target assumes that we don't curtail any gas production in the second half of the year because of market storage conditions.</p>
          <p>Our North American gas production profile is such that our production nadir will occur at the beginning of the fourth quarter and begin inflecting upward at the end of the year in anticipation of stronger 2010 gas prices. Because of the current low gas prices, we're projecting our North American natural gas production to fall by 1% this year.</p>
          <p>I'll start off our specific play discussion with the Barnett Gas and then follow with the Barnett Combo. Our Barnett Gas activity is going quite well, albeit at a reduced level from last year. We'll average 11 Barnett gas rigs this year compared to 24 last year. Like everyone else, we're benefiting from lower service costs and our Johnson County wells are averaging two net Bcf for $2.8 million completed well cost. To date, we've only drilled half of our total Johnson County locations, so we've got a sizeable remaining inventory.</p>
          <p>In Hill County, immediately south of Johnson County, we're consistently making 1.5 net Bcf wells. To our knowledge, we're the only company consistently making good wells at Hill County. We're also making acceptable wells in our Western counties.</p>
          <p>Now I'll switch to the Barnett Combo play, which is gaining momentum and is one of the reasons we've increased our North American liquids growth rate. During the first quarter we completed 12 new wells that will yield an approximate 30% direct after-tax rate of return based on current NYMEX prices and well costs. As happened at Johnson County, our Montague County well results are improving with time.</p>
          <p>We're now pattern drilling, similar to Johnson County, where we drill and simultaneously complete groups of four to eight wells to get better frac coverage. The Barnett Combo will be a major 2010 through 2015 production growth driver. And this year we're simply setting the stage for more significant volume growth in later years.</p>
          <p>Net liquids production from all of our Barnett activity should average 12,000 barrels per day this year and grow to 21,000 barrels per day in 2010, and reach over 42,000 barrels a day by 2012. Last night we posted a new chart in the IR presentation on our website. The chart shows our 2009 through 2012 estimated total Barnett production from all of our activity, Gas and Combo. We expect to grow these annual average volumes from 460 million cubic feet a day equivalents this year to 700 million cubic feet a day equivalents in 2012, provided that hydrocarbon prices are reasonable.</p>
          <p>As we noted a year ago in our February 2008 Analyst Meeting, our Barnett Gas production will plateau over time and the incremental volume growth will be from the Combo. In summary, we control the vast majority of the combo play acreage and we're now converting this asset to a high ROR multi-year revenue stream.</p>
          <p>Moving north of the border into Manitoba, Canada, EOG has achieved a new horizontal oil success, this time in the Waskada Field. The rock formation here is not a shale, it's a tight silk stone with a water zone immediately below it. This is an old EOG legacy field originally drilled with vertical wells with very low recoveries that we've rejuvenated with horizontals. We've now drilled 29 successful horizontal wells, and a typical well yields a 65% after-tax reinvestment rate of return using current NYMEX prices. We estimate we have 25 million barrels of oil net recoverable reserves after royalty on our acreage, and are currently in development mode. We expect this field to ramp up from the current 1,900 barrels of oil per day to 9,500 barrels of oil per day net by year end 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving to the North Dakota Bakken, we're currently operating an eight rig drilling program compared to last year's 10 rigs. We've deferred almost all well completions until this summer when the frac jobs can be done more economically and the road conditions improve. So we don't have any well results to report at this time.</p>
          <p>In our last earnings call I noted that we were restricting our Bakken production because of marketing issues, high location differentials, and low WTI prices. Recently WTI prices have increased and differentials have shrunk. So we plan to bring back our Bakken production in June and be at full production in July.</p>
          <p>You may recall the issues with Bakken crude marketing, our limited pipeline takeaway from North Dakota, and an inferior price at the Clearbrook, Minnesota market hub. Because we expect our Bakken production to grow for many years, we're resolving both of these problems by implementing a plan to move our crude via railcar unit train from North Dakota to Cushing, Oklahoma or other market hubs. We finalized a strategic transportation arrangement with BNSF Railway and expect to have the rail facilities operational by February 2010.</p>
          <p>I won't divulge specifics regarding the all-in transportation and terminal costs except to say that it will provide us a significantly better long-term oil netback than what we're seeing currently. We can pursue our own transportation arrangements due to the scale of our Bakken position, currently about 500,000 total net acres, and dominance in the core area.</p>
          <p>Regarding two horizontal gas plays, the Haynesville and Horn River, we don't have any specific well results to report this quarter. We're currently running four rigs in the Haynesville and will have specific well results later in the year. We're running two rigs in the Horn River Basin, but are deferring the completions until this summer. We are however firming up long-term transportation and processing agreement for our Horn River gas.</p>
          <p>In the Pennsylvania Marcellus, we're running one rig and have now completed eleven horizontal wells on our 240,000 net acres. We've improved our frac techniques on our most recent wells with net reserves of 1.6 to 3.0 Bcf per well. We currently estimate we have two to three net Tcf captured on our Marcellus acreage.</p>
          <p>Our standard plays in North America are all performing well, particularly with the efficiencies gained by lower service costs and lower activity level. We're getting the results we expected and these plays are acting as a support base that contributes to our increased volume growth. We all get caught up in the excitement of the horizontal plays, but we're still finding many successful vertical plays. One example is our East Texas Travis Peak stack and frac play where we've captured 800 net Bcf at $1.65 per Mcf direct finding cost that we'll be developing over the next few years.</p>
          <p>On the international front, we're currently drilling the first of two exploration wells in the East Irish Sea, and we've started our horizontal drilling program in China. As we noted in the last call, we won't have any meaningful results from China until year end.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss CapEx and capital structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mark. For the first quarter, total exploration and development expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations were $872 million. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant and equipment were $65 million.</p>
          <p>Capitalized interest for the quarter was $12.2 million. Yesterday's 8-K filing indicates a total capital expenditure budget of $3.1 billion, the same guidance that we gave back in February. The capital expenditures this year will be front-end loaded and will taper off over subsequent quarters.</p>
          <p>At March 31, 2009 total debt outstanding was $2.1 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 19%. About $220 million of our debt increase versus the previous quarter was due to an increase in working capital and other assets and liabilities. At March 31 we had $85 million of cash, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $2 billion for a net debt to total cap ratio of 18%.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for the quarter was 40% with a 78% deferred tax ratio. The items driving the effective tax rate during the quarter were lower pre-tax income amounts combined with a true-up of state income taxes.</p>
          <p>Yesterday we filed a Form 8-K with second quarter and full year 2009 guidance. For the full year 2009, the 8-K indicates an effective tax rate of greater than 35%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount at current taxes that will be recorded during the second quarter and full year.</p>
          <p>The deferred tax ratio on a GAAP basis is expected to decline from prior years due to reduced CapEx and IDC expensing, as well as the realization of hedging gains in 2009 that had been taken as mark-to-market income over the course of 2008. The effective tax rate will depend in large part on the relative levels of foreign and domestic pre-tax income.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back to Mark to discuss the macro environment, our hedge position and concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Tim. Our view of the North American gas and oil market is fundamentally unchanged from our previous earnings call. Simply put, we expect North American gas prices to remain depressed until 2010 when we expect recovery to the 7 to $8 range. We expect oil prices to trade within a tight range for the next few months and to slowly strengthen in the second half, ending the year at 60 to $65.</p>
          <p>We expect 2010 oil prices will be pleasant for producers with prices similar to the forward curve or higher. The item to watch on the oil front is non-OPEC production levels, which we expect to fall over the course of next year.</p>
          <p>For domestic gas, just taking a stab at modeling the impact of the rapid decline in drilling activity and we expect year end 2009 production to be 4.5 Bcf a day lower than year end 2008, assuming a yea -end gas rig count of 650. We expect domestic production to begin to decline in April or May. So we've got another two or three EIA-914 reports to endure before the decline becomes apparent.</p>
          <p>Our analysis indicates Texas natural gas production has already begun to decline. We expect full year 2010 total domestic production to average 3.8 Bcf a day less than full year 2009. In Canada, we expect total production to decline by 0.8 Bcf a day in 2009 and another 0.5 Bcf in 2010.</p>
          <p>Recognizing the current gas supply demand imbalance, EOG's 8-K that was filed yesterday indicates our 2009 North American gas production will be slightly lower than 2008. This is consistent with our philosophy of not cramming gas into an oversupplied market. Our 3.9 billion CapEx budget this year is being directed toward liquids investments.</p>
          <p>I'll note one other thing regarding the North American gas market. Remember that the market resets itself every November because of storage limitations.</p>
          <p>Our hedge position is consistent with our macro view. We have added to our hedge position for the second half of 2009. About 47% of our April through December 2009 gas is hedged at $9.04. Based on our macro view, we recently closed out all of our second half 2010 gas hedges, both swaps and collars, that were at a roughly $10 price. We remain lightly hedged for the first half of 2010 at $10.27 per MMBtu. We're totally unhedged regarding oil.</p>
          <p>Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are six important points to take away from this call. First, we've increased our 2009 North American liquids production estimate and we expect further growth in 2010, '11, '12, and later years as the impact of our horizontal oil plays begin to kick in. Each year we expect our ratio of North American liquids versus gas to increase.</p>
          <p>In 2007 we produced 43,000 barrels a day of total company liquids. In 2008 this grew to 61,000 barrels a day. This year we expect to produce 75,000 barrels a day even after limiting our Bakken production. In 2010 we expect 90,000 barrels a day, all organic. We believe this significant organic North American liquids growth is a key differentiating factor for EOG.</p>
          <p>Second, we're now in a manufacturing mode in our Barnett Combo play, which will generate steady and substantial liquids growth for multiple years. More importantly, these per well investments are currently yielding at approximately 30% unlevered direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return at current hydrocarbon prices and well costs. If oil stabilizes at 70 to $90 over the next multiple years, these RORs will be even more advantageous.</p>
          <p>Third, our new Manitoba play further confirms EOG's first mover position in the application of horizontal drilling to an oil play. We've now established first mover positions in the Bakken, the Barnett, and in Manitoba. The Manitoba play is similar to the Barnett Combo in that it generates very strong after-tax reinvestment rates of return even at current oil prices.</p>
          <p>Fourth, our 2009 CapEx program is directed toward liquids investments. But we'll note that our North American gas inventory position is particularly deep and geographically widespread between the Barnett, Haynesville, Marcellus, Horn River and Uinta Basin.</p>
          <p>Practically speaking, we can grow our North American gas production at any annual rate between zero and double-digit per year growth for at least the next seven years by simply deciding what level of capital to deploy each year. We already have the organic inventory captured at early mover cost levels.</p>
          <p>Fifth, we've included a chart in the new IR presentation posted on our website showing EOG's total Barnett Shale production growth through 2012. Our feelings about the growth power of EOG's Barnett are consistent with what we noted in our February 2008 Analyst Conference, i.e., the Combo play will generate aggregate Barnett gas plus liquids growth for many years.</p>
          <p>And sixth, we'll accomplish the above while maintaining one of the lowest net debt to cap ratios in the peer group and keeping our focus on high reinvestment rates of return and concomitant strong ROCEs.</p>
          <p>While we're on the subject of returns, I continue to be amazed that both the buy and sell side treat the large write-offs we've recently seen as one-time events and non-cash charges even though it was cash at the time of investment. It's my belief that by doing so, investors are sending the signal to E&amp;P managements to generate volume growth without regard to investment rate of return. And if it doesn't work out, we'll allow you to treat it as a one-time event with essentially no valuation penalty. I'll close with a question to investors: is that really the signal you want to send to E&amp;P managements?</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&amp;A. Vicky (21.32), you want to queue up the Q&amp;A please?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We'll take our first question from David Heikkinen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mark. I had a question thinking about Horn River Basin first production in July 2008 versus pipeline capacity. What should we expect in July '08? And as you ramp up pipeline capacity into 2012, how does that ramp actually happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of production by 2012, we're slotting at a rough idea of somewhere in the range of about 120 million cubic feet a day by then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Somewhere between 120 and 150 million cubic feet a day. Our &#x2013; it's our belief that the majority of the production and aggregates in the Horn River Basin will really not start to come on until 2012 or later. So because we're on the west side of the Basin, we've got a little bit of pipeline access than some on the east side, so we're going to get a bit more production likely earlier than others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And all your 2012 targets, those are exit rates for 2012, that you mentioned on the call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; well, the 2012 number for example like the Barnett number, that's a full year average number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so you kind of mix and match. Like Manitoba, that would be a year end exit rate, the Canada gas, then that 120 would be an exit rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's probably a full year average on that one too. Yeah, so the one that's an exit rate is the Manitoba one, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just going through each area, can you talk about costs as far as &#x2013; your Hill &#x2013; first Barnett Gas Hill County and Western County and then Barnett Combo, just as far as where your well costs are? And that's it, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the Barnett Gas, which would be the Hill-Johnson County area, we're looking at about $2.8 million well cost right now. In the Barnett Combo play, we're looking at something like about $3.1 million. And then in the Western areas, it's considerably lower, it's probably about $1.8 million. The Western areas are more shallow; that's why the well cost is cheaper there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one follow-up on the Combo, I saw you drilled some wells in Palo Pinto County as well, is that part of the Combo play or is that part of the Western? Just trying to get an idea of where the border is for Combo versus just Western.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're &#x2013; when we talk about Combo play, we're really saying anything that gives us a rich liquid yield on there. So it could cover an area bigger than just Montague County.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But does that include Palo Pinto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It may or may not.</p>

          <p>Hey Mark, I had a question on your rail project. Is there any way you can give us an idea of the total impact on your Bakken oil differential without giving away company secrets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, obviously we're still in negotiations and haven't finalized it, so I really don't want to give a lot of detail about the current agreement. But just to give you some rough ideas, if you look at the fourth quarter of '08, we were &#x2013; and really the first quarter of '09, the stuff that we were able to get into pipeline, the oil we could get into pipeline was a reasonable tariff. But the stuff that we had to truck out of there, we were paying up to $25 a barrel to get that crude trucked to places like Salt Lake City. In some cases we trucked it all the way to Cushing, Oklahoma...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...which was absurd. And so as we looked at this, we said well, there's one pipeline out there. It's called the Enbridge oil pipeline. The problem is it's pretty well maxed out and we can't get all the oil in there because of the upsurge in Western North Dakota production. So we said our first priority is to get as much oil as we can into that Enbridge line, but we expect we'll be producing so much incremental oil above that, that we have to find an option over and above the trucking. And this unit train rail car is the option that we've ended up with. And it's turned out to be &#x2013; it'll be a considerably lower differential. And in many cases, it's essentially competitive with the Enbridge pipeline tariff issue.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. And I appreciate your comments on gas macro. I wanted to get your thoughts on this inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. Specifically, how do you think this inventory has changed over time and what do you think its impact on sort of the gas supply equation will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think it's really a major factor there, Tom. The people who generally are talking about the gas inventory of drilled but not yet completed wells are really the people operating in the urban areas of the Barnett Shale. And that's been a chronic problem years and years and years ago. The issue is that you drill a well in the urban areas of Barnett Shale and it may be one to two years before you can get a pipeline outlet to get it out of there, so there's no real reason to hurry up and complete the well.</p>
          <p>So our read is is that particularly in the Barnett urban areas that that inventory will bleed off over time, but it's not going to affect our view of the macro. So I think that particular aspect of the gas market has maybe been overstressed. We don't think it's that big of a deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I agree. Just from an EOG perspective companywide, what is your average time from say the rig moving off a well to the time it's on sales?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Barnett, it takes about 45 to 60 days. And then that depends on how active you are with completion fleets. We've got three completion fleets there in the Barnett that are under long-term contract to us so we're just utilizing those. So our time from rig release to completion is a little stretched through 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that number would hold up companywide at least on the gas side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on if it's horizontal or if it's vertical wells. If it's vertical wells, it's just a matter of weeks. Probably most all vertical wells are going to be completed and on sales within 30 days. The horizontals, where we hold up and drill a couple and then just come in and complete them together, that's when you have the longer period of time between rig release and final completion.</p>

Could you give some color on that? And could you just give some color on the East Texas Haynesville, how results are looking there for what you're doing? And I've got a couple follow-ups.</p>

          <p>Yeah, Joe, we can acknowledge that there is a Gammage well. We'll share that information. We're currently in the completion and testing phase of that well and really don't have anything further to report on it. And we know it's a very, very closely watched well, but at this time it would just be premature to give any information on it.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got you. And then just in terms of the first quarter results, the oil production was better than guided. Given the fact that you've shut in half of your Bakken production, can you explain why the oil was better than guided?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, some of it is due to just the fact that our Bakken wells are doing a bit better than what we had projected. And the other piece of it is really our Barnett Combo production is starting to feed in pretty nicely now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got you. And then in terms of the question on the Bakken production and the rail and pipeline, when you got that rail &#x2013; when you have that rail system up and running, how much oil do you expect &#x2013; how much capacity do you have to pipe and then how much capacity will be the rail capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of the pipeline capacity on a net basis, it's probably something like about 10,000 barrels a day. So on a net basis, the way to look at the rail is pretty much anything we do over 10,000 barrels a day net is likely to go out on the unit trains. And we've got room for that to go up. We could easily be moving on a net basis an incremental 20,000 barrels a day out on unit trains. The good thing about those unit trains are really you just &#x2013; you can upsize it or you can downsize it pretty readily just by how many trains you run basically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Manitoba area, can you talk about any infrastructure constraints? And what the assumptions and flexibility around the assumptions are for your guidance of 25 million barrels resource and 7 to 8000 barrels a day increased production by 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is an old field that we defined the geologic limits on it 10 or 15 years ago so &#x2013; and we've now drilled enough horizontal wells to give us a pretty good confidence level in what the proper spacing is between wells. So the 25 million barrel net after royalty oil estimate, I would say we have a high confidence factor in that. It's not really potential. It's stronger than a potential situation.</p>
          <p>In terms of the infrastructure, we'll have to upsize the capacity of some of our surface facilities there to handle this. But that's a pretty routine deal. So this one is going to be relatively easy to upscale. A lot of these horizontal plays, whether oil or gas, we find such as in the Bakken area that there wasn't a lot of infrastructure there or in our Barnett Combo area. And so we kind of have to build the infrastructure from ground up. In this Manitoba play, we're fortunate enough that we've got all the infrastructure there essentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And I guess because you know the geologic limits, does that then cap the upside or do you view that &#x2013; what could happen where that 25 million barrels could end up being much more, if anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we may add some additional potential, extend the geologic limits. But I don't &#x2013; this is not one where you're talking about 25 million barrels going to 100 million barrels or so. So we may &#x2013; the upside potential might get as high as 50, but it's &#x2013; we don't want to paint this as a monstrous upside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then switching to natural gas, when you look at some of the vertical areas you operate in, Uinta Basin, East Texas, South Texas, what gas price are you looking for given lower well costs where you would consider bringing back rigs when you think about the second half of this year or into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; we're pretty negative on the gas price throughout the year. So we're not really going to be looking at signals of gas price coming up to make us kind of add gas rigs. What we're really going to be looking at are the production data that comes out each month and to see whether our estimates are tracking correctly or not. And then also, we're going to be looking at what happens to this gas rig count.</p>
          <p>In other words, if the gas rig count falls below 650 by year end, we'd probably be a bit more aggressive in gearing up our gas drilling. Conversely, if the gas rig count doesn't ever get below 750, we'll probably be very hesitant to step up gas drilling. So we're going to look beyond what the current gas price is to kind of what do we expect to happen in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess at some point though when you think about it from an IRR perspective, it would be based on your own internal gas price forecast for what that lower rig count would end up leading to. I guess any sense on numbers there for what you think you would ultimately need to get attractive rates of return?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't want to kind of go at it that way. But I'm saying that until we believe gas prices are going to get back up to $7, we're not going to get very aggressive on our gas activity. I mean basically, kind of from the tone of this call you can tell that we've got a pretty deep oil and liquids inventory and we're going to be attacking that. Now don't take that to say we need a $7 gas price to get a decent IRR on gas drilling. What I am saying is that we're seeing a fatter reinvestment rate of return on the liquids side than on the gas side. And we don't see a big reason to go chasing a bunch of gas drilling for example if gas gets all the way up to $5.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Couple questions. Mark, going back to the Bakken, if you start talking about &#x2013; I mean Marathon and Whiting have obviously been out there saying they've shut in production and they're going to bring that back on April, May. If you bring yours back on to July, how tight will the infrastructure be between then and first part of 2010 before you get the potential rail project underway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the answer to that is it'll probably tighten a bit more than today and we just can't really accurately estimate that. What we do know is when we made the decision to cut the production, the WTI was selling on the NYMEX at $35 or so and now we're looking at something that's considerably higher than that.</p>
          <p>So one point to note &#x2013; you bring up a good point, if we bring the production on in July, and say in August the costs to get the crude trucked out of there just go up exponentially, I mean we may just curtail production in September. So we're just going to watch it month by month. But our current estimate is that we think we're going to be okay, but we still will be suffering a ding on differentials for the stuff that we can't get in the pipeline until February of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Let me go to back to something else you said. You said you took off some hedges in the back half of 2010, did I hear that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, yes</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; and those hedges were $10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are we just &#x2013; the straight surface read that you expect prices at or near those levels? Or was there something else financially going on as far as monetizing those hedges and bringing the cash? Can you just talk about that decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that was just a market call, not so much on bringing the cash forward. It's really the &#x2013; trying to call the low of the market for the second half of 2010 and we believe that perhaps we're getting somewhere near that low. We feel pretty positively that by the second half of 2010 at least we're going to have good gas prices. I'm not predicting $10 but what I'm saying is where we close them out at is somewhere near the nadir, we believe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And let me ask you one more question. As you think about &#x2013; you mentioned it briefly, production guidance assumes no shut-ins. Can you walk me through how you think about and how the Board thinks about shutting in gas? I mean obviously Chesapeake's out there, they're shutting gas and provided a low PP table (40.01). Then you hear [G. Steven] Farris last week at Apache gets on and says, "We could drill more wells but &#x2013; we have economic wells to drill today, but we're going to because we think service costs are coming down." Can you talk about just how you think about shutting in gas and developing &#x2013; or deciding when to put these rigs back to work, particularly on the gas side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the gas rig side, there's a number of gas rigs that we have drilling with the exception of the Haynesville, where we have four rigs running and are essentially &#x2013; we're earning acreage or preserving acreage there. In most other areas of North America for gas drilling, we've reduced our gas drilling to the number of rigs where we have term contracts...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So essentially we've laid down all our rigs that aren't contracted through the year. So that's kind of &#x2013; we made a decision that we're not going to try and buy out of contracts just because you pay the contractor money and you get nothing in return, whereas at least if you're drilling, you're going to get something in return. So that's kind of one of the guiding factors there.</p>
          <p>As to when we specifically will shut in gas, I mean we have curtailed, shut-in gas the past several years, typically in September. And we have kind of a just a threshold wellhead price that &#x2013; in our minds that &#x2013; and I won't give it, but basically we're not too anxious to sell gas below that price.</p>
          <p>So the overall strategy of the company this year is we're not going to cram gas into markets that are already full. If storage gets full before November, we'll probably react to it by curtailing some gas. But we'll just have to see how that plays out. But what we're really doing with the company is we're switching the company toward crude oil and NGL production because we think that's going to be a more consistent value basis on a go forward basis.</p>
          <p>There is a chart in our &#x2013; that we released in the IR charts last night on our website that kind of shows the ratio we expect to get to in North America for liquids versus crude. And the bottom line of that chart is it was at a pretty low level two or three years ago. But we expect by 2013 &#x2013; I mean just to give you an example, in 2006 our North American production mix was 24% liquid, 76% gas. By 2000 &#x2013; and currently, it's about 35 liquids, 65 gas for this year. And we expect that ratio by 2013 to go to somewhere &#x2013; liquids would be 45 to 50% of our total North American production mix. Now that's at a 10:1 BTU equivalency ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And obviously I know you won't give me a price, but can you talk regionally? And then I'll hang up and let somebody else jump on. But regionally, if you look at hub prices today and service costs, and respective rate of returns, what would be one, two, three &#x2013; first would be shut in, second and third, if you get to that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, right now I mean as you look around our asset base, I'd say that the one area that may be the first target would be the Rockies that may have curtailments. The second area would be the Mid Continent, just because the prices are tracking closer to the Rockies there. And Canada prices are holding up a little bit better, and the Gulf Coast prices are hanging in there pretty well. So those might be much lower on that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Mark, I'm curious and intrigued by your chart that shows the Barnett gas production beginning to pick up I guess beginning of 2010 or so. A couple questions around that, you're saying that you would expect to see a supply response in the U.S. on the downward side April, May after rig count peaked back in September. So obviously there's a big delay.</p>
          <p>So looking at that chart for the incline of production in 2010, the first question is when &#x2013; to get that gas to start coming out of the ground faster in early 2010, when would you need to step on the gas, so to speak, to accelerate your drilling program to get that to happen, so how much in advance? And how much of a delay essentially is there between when you accelerate activity and when that gas starts coming out of the ground?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good question, Gil. The predicates of the chart, and this is the chart that's on our IR website again, is that by the end of this year, we've seen enough on the macro picture where we're feeling pretty confident that 2010 gas prices are going to be, shall we say, decent. And at basically in January of 2010, we'd ramp up the gas drilling activity from the current &#x2013; I believe I said 11 weeks for gas drilling right now, that we'd ramp that up to something in the range of about 15 gas rigs. So that production bump is the best estimate we have now. If we become a little less sanguine on the gas market for the first half of 2010, we might &#x2013; that bump might slide a little bit, so...</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, when would that bump up in activity start to happen?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so &#x2013; and you think you could get a production response out very &#x2013; pretty contemporaneously with that ramp up in activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, within three or four months of that, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought your chart actually showed sort of the production responding pretty quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it shows it coming up in about three months, so that's about the same timeframe there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Moving on to something else, could you just give us an update on what's going on in the Cleveland play?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Loren Leiker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Gil, we're continuing with a one rig program to Cleveland right now. And similar to the other stories that you've heard this morning, we're focusing on oil. We've found parts of the Cleveland where liquids are higher, liquid NGLs as well as crude oil come with the gas. That's really where we're focusing our efforts right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it actually oil and liquids or is it just wet gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's oil and liquids in the reservoir. Only certain geologic parameters allow that to happen in parts of the field. It's not widespread throughout the Cleveland play but we happen to have a very strong acreage position where that occurs by design and that's where we're focusing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can you talk about rates and costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the costs really aren't different than what we're doing in the gas play as far as completed well costs. It's the same story in terms of horizontal wells and X number of stages per well. In terms of rates, these wells could come on at two, three, 400 barrels a day and then they fall off like any normal type reservoir would, and of course gas comes with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving on, we'll hear from Leo Mariani with RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning here. A question related to your CapEx, you guys have maintained your CapEx at $3.1 billion. Obviously gas prices have come down a fair bit in the last couple months. Do you folks still plan to spend within cash flow this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is, Leo, on that, that although we're keeping our CapEx flat, obviously the cash flow estimates have dropped a bit particularly with gas prices. So right now we can't maintain &#x2013; we can't say that we're going to stay within cash flow. If you just took the NYMEX prices for the remainder of the year for gas and oil, our &#x2013; we're going to essentially slightly overspend the cash flow. But that's a decision that we've made and we're comfortable with it. It's our feeling that come the end of the year, we'll continue to have the lowest net debt to cap ratio of any company in the large cap independent peer group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jumping over to the Bakken here, can you give us an indication of how many barrels a day you currently have shut in up there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a number just off the top of our head on that, Leo, so &#x2013; and it really varies depending on what it costs to truck on any given day and what wells we have that are shut in. So I don't want to get into too many specifics on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any update on your 320 acre drilling up there in the core, the Bakken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pretty much where we are is that in the core area, we think probably that's going to stay on 640 acres spacing and we're not going to downspace that in a large way. When you get outside the core area to what we call the Bakken Lite area, which is we think a big growth area for us, there because of rock quality and a little bit less in the pressures or less, that that'll probably end up being spaced on 320 acre spacing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess given that in terms of your Bakken drilling later this year as we get into 2010, is your activity more in the Bakken Lite area or do you still have remaining 648 locations in the core?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got something like about 60 to 70 core locations yet to drill and then we've got a bunch to complete this year. So I mean the number would be something like about 100 core locations that are yet really to hit the production meter. And then the Bakken Lite is the area that &#x2013; we just don't know the areal extent of that. We've previously reported that we've got four or five wells outside the core area that have surprised us positively at an average of about 300,000 barrels of oil per well.</p>
          <p>And we'll be drilling more wells in the Lite in the second half of the year and evaluating this. But we think that's the big upside over and above the 80 million barrels that we've already mentioned at &#x2013; for what we think is in the core. We think that the Bakken Lite is the area that over the next year or two may allow us to give a big reserve upside to that. But we just haven't drilled enough wells in a wide enough area to feel good about that.</p>
          <p>And that's where the low oil price and these differentials have really slowed us down. We were geared up at the beginning of the year to get really serious cranking up in the Bakken Lite area but then all the activity in the North Dakota area just slowed down due to these very, very low oil prices in the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jumping over to your Barnett Combo play, you guys said that you were surprised by the strong results in the first quarter which led to some of the oil production upside versus your guidance in North America. You talked about drilling those wells for $3.1 million. What type of EURs are you seeing on those and are some of those approved recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got on our website there, the quote that about 210,000 barrels of oil equivalents is what our current estimate is on those. And we believe that that may well improve with time, but we don't have any data to really show that now. But what we've really seen on the Barnett Combo play is that it's really playing out exactly as we predicted in our February Analyst Conference. We said it will be 2009 before we can really attack this play, because we needed to get the liquid stripping plant infrastructure built and here it is 2009 and we're attacking the play.</p>
          <p>So it's shame in a way that we control the vast majority of the acreage because you as an analyst don't really get to triangulate on it; you can't talk to some of the other operators there and confirm our results. But this is the one play where we're just highly dominant and the numbers are starting to show it in terms of what we expect for production. When we're quoting growing up to 42,000 barrels a day of liquids coming out of the Barnett in not too many years, clearly the majority of that is going to be coming out of Combo play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And I guess is there going to be any issue on the ramp up there in terms of infrastructure? Obviously you got your liquid stripping plant there on in the first quarter. Is there any plans to put more money into infrastructure there or is that plant going to be able to handle a lot of the ramp up in the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got the infrastructure pretty well sorted out. I mean I'll give you just a couple of the quotes on the Combo play or just the impact of the Combo play you may find interesting. In 2009, out of our total Barnett production, we expect 85% of it to be gas and 15% to be a combination of oil and NGL. So 85:15 this year. 2012, that number's going to go down to 64% gas, 36% liquids. So you can just see that we're going to become much more of a liquid company coming out of the Barnett then we currently are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot for your time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Ellen Hannan with Weeden Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on that last comment, Mark, in terms of your liquids output in the Barnett Combo, can you give us a feel of how much of the liquids will be natural gas liquids versus crude oil? And then further, on the pricing on NGLs in that area, is that more determined by the market for natural gas or for crude oil itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the pricing of NGLs &#x2013; and part of our infrastructure issue is we're going to be able to pipe those NGLs to the Mont Belvieu hub, which is kind of the Henry Hub of NGLs, if you will. So the pricing for the NGL is &#x2013; we expect it to be keyed off of crude. Typically 60 to 65% of crude oil is how &#x2013; what the NGL mix typically is. And what we've said about the Combo play previously is that if you really look at the production from a typical combo well, it's about one third crude oil, one third NGLs and one third actual just natural gas, so just like other natural gas. So a significant mix of that Combo play composition is going to be NGLs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And one other thing I just wanted to clarify, when you &#x2013; in your opening remarks, you talked about the nadir of your production for the year being in the fourth quarter. Are you looking at that total companywide or are you just talking about your U.S. gas production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Okay, thanks. Well, just one final question for you, has EOG had any staff reductions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not. In fact, we're selectively adding this year and we don't anticipate any staff reductions.</p>
