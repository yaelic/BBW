          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Sanofi-Aventis' 2008 Third Quarter Sales and Earnings Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I now hand over to Mr. S&#xE9;bastien Martel, Vice President Investor Relations.</p>

          <p>Hello everyone and welcome to our Q3 results conference call. With me today are Mr. Hanspeter Spek, Executive Vice President Pharmaceutical Operations, Mr. Jean-Claude Leroy, Executive Vice President Finance and Legal and Mrs. Laurence Debroux our CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we start I'd like to encourage you to have on hand copies our press release issued this morning, and also the slides for this conference call which are currently available on our website. I must advise all participants that our call today may contain forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>These statements include uncertainties and risk, which could cause actual results and developments to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in our annual report on Form 20-F and in the document of reference.</p>
          <p>I would now hand the call over to Hanspeter Spek for the review of our Q3 sales performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everybody. As you definitely will have noticed that we have decided to raise our guidance for the year 2008 and the basis of this of course was a performance in the third quarter which we consider as good and perhaps even as very good.</p>
          <p>If I kindly ask you to get to the fourth page of our presentation where you'll find sales growth drivers we have identified for the good performance of the third quarter. First of all, we went back to growth, which is partly a technical effect after the negative effect on our cash performance from the Ambien loss of data &#x2013; loss of patent protection has been neutralized after 12 months, but this is also an effect from an overall motivation and mobilization of our sales team. So overall we record on a comparable basis a 5.5% sales increase, which is above the worldwide pharmaceutical market, which is reported at only slightly above 5.</p>
          <p>Second, we see a very strong performance of our five leading brands, which are growing by 13.5%. Our US business in consequence of the Ambien effect is back to a double-digit growth of 11.5% and as you know as US business stands for about half of our sales.</p>
          <p>We are once again the leading flu vaccine supplier for the US American market and we have succeeded to deliver first to this market and abroad as well. Finally we have continue to adopt our business model to changing environment, best highlighted by a continued reorganization and also partially downsizing of our sales force organization all over the world and encourage regionalization as to get closer to our customers.</p>
          <p>On slide number five, you'll see then once again what I have just described in headlines. What you also see that there is an acceleration of growth, because in nine months growth for the overall business is reported as 3.8% on comparable basis. In this chart mentioned in the third quarter 5.5%. This is true for the overall business. Important to note, as I said we continue to maintain our important base business achieving nearly 2 billion over the last quarter as totally stable.</p>
          <p>On page six and receiver the growth of this quarter comes from I could show you for the second quarter a zero growth for European and also zero growth for the United States and you see that the picture has changed. The rest of world is continuously growing by nearly 10%, but the United States are I said before back to an 11.5% growth. Whilst European sales are stable due to the market condition in Europe you are very well aware of.</p>
          <p>Page number seven, and more details on our performance in the United States. We have very strong growth as you see on the right upper side of the page. We are the second leading company only topped by Abbott in terms of overall growth.</p>
          <p>And you see on the lower right side, I said this is evidently due to all of our major brands Lovenox again growing by 11 point by 11%, Lantus more than 34%, Eloxatin close to eight, Taxotere 17% and also Plavix with 17% as well as Aprovel, the two products we are sharing with Bristol-Myers, Aprovel growing nearly 9%.</p>
          <p>So overall, a very strong performance for our total portfolio. We see that the Plavix trend has normalized. There's continued discussion on the precision IMS can deliver, but we see in our &#x2013; out of factory sales a totally consistent picture, which we report for this quarter is 17%.</p>
          <p>We have significantly changed in the American market our feel for our structure by regionalization and you believe that what we see now in the third quarter are the first fruits coming out of this re-organization on an organizational basis.</p>
          <p>Now on page number eight, a picture on Japan. I have said frequently that Japan has been a soft spot in our geographical presence. This has changed. You see in the third quarter, sales of nearly 21%. We are as such the fastest growing company amongst the leading 10 in this very important market.</p>
          <p>And this is driven by reintegration of outsourced sales, which came back from various partners we had in Japan, but also and first of all by Plavix which is repeating its fantastic performance now on in Japan, this constantly growing sales.</p>
          <p>We have successfully launched SoloSTAR in connection with Lantus and you see also on the lower side of the lower right side of page number eight that there is an immediate impact on the performance on Lantus in Japan as we have reported also before in Europe and in the United States. Taxotere which plays a very important role in Japan as well has recently been approved for prostate cancer, which of course is relatively late for this product, but gives excellent perspective for the months and the quarters to come also for Taxotere in Japan.</p>
          <p>Now on page number nine more details on the major products. I said before that Lantus continues on an exceptional growth pattern. In the third quarter, we achieved more than 600 million sales worldwide, 29% growth you see on the right side of the page that we have taken over and now there's quite some distance, Novo Nordisk in the insulin market also in United States. We see also a continued positive combination effect between Lantus and Apidra, which has difficult start some years ago but now is performing quite nicely.</p>
          <p>Overall, we remain extremely confident on Lantus future. A number of studies, which I described on page number nine, are confirming the superiority of the product, we have achieved a significant progress by the newly issued guidelines of ADA and EASD, which clearly states that basal insulin is the core therapy after Metformin failure.</p>
          <p>On page number 10, background on Clexane and Lovenox growth pattern. The interpretation has been difficult during the second quarter and the also partly during the third quarter due to the supply crisis for unfractionated heparin. We see today a growth of 8.5% that's the product is 635 million in the third quarter sales, ahead of Lantus slightly. But when you go into the geographical details, you see that in the United States, we are back to a &#x2013; let's call it normal growth pattern of 10, 11% which we also had before the so called crisis.</p>
          <p>We have continued supply constraints in the heparin market still in Europe and this also touches us in certain markets as in Italy. We continue to have a limited supply. We manage these in the best way possible and we hope that the overall tightened supply of heparin will go away during the beginning of 2009. But overall, you see that the product is back on a good and regular pattern. It remains to be added on despite the first new oral product in this market, the debigatran so far has not made any impact despite the quite intense promotion by Boehringer Ingelheim.</p>
          <p>Now on page 11, Plavix 1.5 billion, sales nearly worldwide, of course including the sales as booked by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which means a growth of nearly 12%. You'll see on page number 11 also what I mentioned before the consecutive growth of Plavix in Japan. Also on Plavix, we can report good progress in terms of medical and clinical guidelines, the European STEMI guidelines recommends Plavix across all management types of STEMI as the treatment of choice.</p>
          <p>The STEMI treatment and the overall stenting field for us remains important. Consequently, we continue to recruit in the CURRENT trial and you see that also there we are on a good progress, with target of approximately 16,000 patients being included into this trial. We expect to report the results in the first quarter 2009 then for an overall of 20,000 patients and of course these results will also have certain impact to be defined when the results are available on our positioning in front of an eventual upcoming prasugrel competition.</p>
          <p>On page number 12, I give you more insight into the situation of Plavix in Germany. For those who are not familiar there are other sources in Germany available through to competitors, Ratiopharm and Sandoz. There has been quite some communication to the financial community in this respect quite recently. And I thought it was good to give some facts behind. As you see on right side, on the bar the impact so far is relatively modest, representing approximately 20% in sales and volume of the overall Clopidogrel market. You'll also see that there is hardly any progress from week-to-week. And I can tell you that we meanwhile have more data into October sales no change.</p>
          <p>Why is this impact so far limited? I believe for number of reasons. First of all, because those products are not fully substituted and I have to make this point to contradict the communication from Sandoz, which claims the opposite. As Sandoz has meanwhile communicated that this information has been not correct. As indications for the salt are limited and we maintain a large part of the market already by the indication.</p>
          <p>Second we have developed a commercial strategy taking advantage of our good partnership with the major sick-funds in Germany, which mean to have included Plavix in to our existing sick-fund contract, which means in clear terms that we discount that we integrated in our overall commercial conditions. So the sick-funds see relatively little reason to encourage the salt. This combined with what I said before on the limited substitutable nature overall that the progress of Sandoz and Ratiopharm is quite limited so far and we are very confident that we will be successful to keep it like that.</p>
          <p>The last page on the product section is dedicated to Multaq during the quarter. As you see on page 13, we have reported more results coming out of ATHENA study. The ATHENA study has reported already before &#x2013; about four weeks before, a very, very impressive and highly significant result in cardiovascular events and hospitalization, because of the cardiovascular events. And you see then on page 13 new research from ATHENA in a sub-population of stroke patients and you see that the results in stroke are even little bit more impressive this decrease of risk of stroke of 34% in the respective patient group.</p>
          <p>We have been granted July 1, the priority review by the FDA, so far there is no indication that there will be an Advisory Board, which does not exclude that there may be an Advisory Board. We have to see this in the weeks and in the months to come. We had filed in parallel with a couple of days of difference only to the European authorities and there is not such a procedure in place. But nevertheless, also from Europe, we expect the first questions and context before the end of the ongoing year 2008. And as you see, we have submitted the file also in Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, and other markets.</p>
          <p>Now on page 14, some comments on the Vaccine performance. As you know of course, the Vaccines are a very seasonal business. Overall, we can confirm that we are perfectly in line with our estimates for the overall business. For the third quarter, we could report a growth of nearly 10%. I made already the comment that we could very early deliver flu products this year, and you see then &#x2013; see the other performances of our Vaccine business on the same page.</p>
          <p>You may look at to the Menactra performances for the first time is negative, slightly negative at minus 2%. This is nothing but a technical effect following new patterns in the public ordering of the various United States organizations working with Menactra. Overall, we are fully in line with our annual purchase for Menactra. And look with a lot of confidence at the end of year.</p>
          <p>Sanofi Pasteur has reported excellent results, 38.2% and you find of course the important contribution from Gardasil on the same page, which achieved 456 million in the first nine months at a growth rate of 43% in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>On page 15 then to conclude another sum up of our key positions and growth positions during the third quarter in vaccines. We had pointed out when we said in our last conference call, had pointed out that see a WHO/FDA has recommended unprecedented three-strain change in the flu vaccination this year, which was quite a challenge from the technical point of view. We are quite proud to have managed this in a record time and as pointed out delivered to the market.</p>
          <p>We have seen important expansion of our pediatric vaccine portfolio in Pentacel, where we have new indications available since mid of July 2008. There also our deliveries are totally in line with the purchase. This is about 4 million doses, which have been delivered so far.</p>
          <p>So overall outlook for vaccine, a very good third quarter which sums it up, we have achieved all of our results in this quarter. We have good visibility for the end of the year and all of this made us contributing to the increased guidance. But of course this has to be further explained in terms of profit and expenses.</p>
          <p>And I'll therefore pass over to Jean-Claude.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hanspeter and good morning everybody. As Hanspeter mentioned in introduction of the call, we delivered a good set of number during the third quarter up to '08, and this is shows it rather easily when you make this comparison between the sales evolutions on a comparable-basis plus 5.5%. With the evolution of the adjusted operating income current which excluding ForEx, so quite comparable to the expression of the sales is plus 14%. And that derives in to the EPS level &#x20AC;1.47, yes, up 5% but express at the guidance rate we're showing in this third quarter 11.5% growth.</p>
          <p>If I again give a quick look on some of the major items in this Q3 P&amp;L, to begin with the sales, worth to explain that we had two negative effects when going from comparable to reported, main are impacting in changes in Group structure. Remember this is the end of the contract of Copaxone in the United States and Canada as of the end of the first quarter 2008. And mainly the impact in exchange rate, which is minus 5.7% this quarter and average around the same number at 75% of which is the US dollar impact and if we look on a cumulative basis it's even a little bit more 77%.</p>
          <p>The main topics in the P&amp;L begin with the cost of sales as you can see it is lower this year than last year. And fair to say that it's thanks to the favorable impact of the end of the Copaxone, we can show this improvement. The figures behind that on the Q3 is a positive impact by 0.9% because of this item.</p>
          <p>For the rest two sets of explanation, which balance in figure, which is the negative exchange rate, sorry to repeat that on each and every line item and the positive favorable product mix of 0.6% this quarter. Just a word on a cumulative basis, and of nine months on the same line item fair to say that the positive Copaxone effect offsets the Ambien IR effect when the currency effect negative obviously offsets unfortunately the favorable product mix effect.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expense, plus 0.5%, this is plus 4.5% excluding exchange rate and as you can see this quarter we started several phase III programs, which explains this increase.</p>
          <p>Page 21 as Hanspeter mentioned so we went on looking at our SG&amp;A. And continuing the policy of cost control but also sales force adaptation in Europe, and I guess that the ratio which goes on decreasing and is now 25.5% to sales at the end of the nine months, shows clearly that this is a continuous effort. Especially and mainly in Europe that the old market is, if I may  put it this way, and again add that at that this level continues to compare favorably with the competition.</p>
          <p>Page 22, as I mentioned the adjusted operating income, current shows an increase by 14% and the ratio to sales, once again, is in improvement at 38.5 % on net sales. By the way, simply to report that the &#x2013; when we are talking this quarter of the exchange rate effect it's not only the US dollar, I am sure you've all noticed that all the rest or the vast majority of the other currencies decreased versus euro which added up to the global foreign exchange effect. Not much to report on the net financial expenses, and income tax not much change.</p>
          <p>So I go directly to page 23 give a word on the share of profits of associates. Fair to say and as Hanspeter gave the figures and comment that we have a positive impact from Plavix in US even though translated &#x2013; the figure are translated in euros &#x2013; that we've an increased contribution from our vaccine JV with Merck, with the underlying Gardasil sales improvement. Unfortunately, the contribution from Merial is impacted by the dollar evolution to dollar conversion. I can report that the figures in US dollar are positive, but when converted in euros, that doesn't show as a positive contribution and positive evolution of the contribution, I should say.</p>
          <p>So we come down to the adjusted net income, which is close to 1.9 billion and a corresponding adjusted EPS of &#x20AC;1.45 and obviously going to the excluding selected items Q3 result and EPS, as you'll probably seen the adjusted &#x2013; the selected items are rather small numbers in Q3 that was also the case last year. So at the end of the day, we are making a 5% improvement in this adjusted EPS at &#x20AC;1.47 for the quarter. And at &#x20AC;4.24 for the first nine months, which is also an improvement by 3.4%.</p>
          <p>But also importantly those two sets of figures are above 15% growth when expressing US dollar. And I remind you that we do that for the purpose of comparison with our peers and once again I can tell you that these sets of number expressing dollar compares favorably with our peers.</p>
          <p>We've taken the opportunity of the &#x2013; set of numbers of the &#x2013; which is are included in the selected item the provision of 258 million for adaptation in the first nine months to give you a broader information of where we are. So I'd like to address that from what we've done since the very end of 2006, remember it was a time of the first measures we took in France in the pharmaceutical operation. And going forward, to the end of what &#x2013; of this year, I am the talking of the year 2008, so over two years period, I can tell you that we will add roughly spent &#x20AC;750 million before tax adaptation restructuring costs. The majorities &#x2013; a vast majority of which being in pharmaceutical operations.</p>
          <p>And out of this figure, we can tell you that we have and we will derive and I am talking now on a full annual basis, an effect of up to &#x20AC;375 million once again before tax of synergy. So as you can see, a figure, which is roughly 50% of the restructuring cost. Obviously, we won't reach this level before 2010 full effect, simply because the last measures are ongoing in once again the French commercial operations.</p>
          <p>Talking about the industrial portrait, obviously, we are not talking there of synergy. We are not taking of cost avoidance, because you know that first; it takes rather long time to implement. And second, this is there to offset the consequences of the loss in gross margin which you are encountering when there are generification of these products.</p>
          <p>Going &#x2013; moving to page 26 now on the financial side of the balance sheet. If I may, as you can see once again, we are decreasing our debt and we've done that by generating 1.9 billion of cash flow this quarter. I have to give the information that this takes into account the payment of our Symbion acquisition in Australia, but it doesn't take into account the 316 million of payment for Acambis in the vaccine area we've said early October. So we are at 3.7 at the end of September.</p>
          <p>I would like to add few words about the environment Sanofi-Aventis and the financial crisis. What I can tell you is that so &#x2013; therefore the end of third quarter, when I said that we at &#x20AC;3.7 billion of net debt, this consists of &#x20AC;2.9 billion of cash investments and &#x20AC;6.6 billion of debt. In our investment, we have no exposure to subprime market or the financial services company that at failed as a result of the financial crisis. I can add up that our investments are essentially done in mutual funds. And to finish up on this item, I can add up that we continue to have access to the commercial paper market.</p>
          <p>Moving to the upgrade in the 2008 guidance, you've seen that we have upgraded from 8 to 9%, obviously at the 2007, euro/dollar priority of 1.37. Given that the good set of numbers we just reported to you and which we are reached during Q3 and we've decided that it was totally fair to reach &#x2013; raise this guidance.</p>
          <p>I have to add up that if you make a calculation, an obvious calculation of the implied Q4 performance, you may determine that it will be less strong in Q4 than it has been during the three first quarters. But remember that it is in Q4 that we will have the impact of the suspension of Acomplia which has been estimated at the stage at the maximum of &#x20AC;50 million net of tax. So in other word this impact has not been considered as an isolated item when we revised our guidance.</p>
          <p>So as a conclusion, and it's only to repeat but I guess it's fair to repeat the good performance of this quarter from an operational standpoint with a performance which outperformed the market. And good behavior of the leading brands as well as good improvement in the operating income margin, this level represents the &#x2013; and there is effect of the ongoing adaptation of the company, which translates once again favorably in the evolution of the bottom line EPS line, and this is particularly true when you take out currency effect. Therefore, the 15% in dollars and all of that obviously explains the upgrade in the guidance in the full year guidance.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you Jean-Claude. We are now ready to open the call to any questions you may have on our Q3 results.  We would very much appreciate if you could limit your questions to one or two at a time to allow as many people to enter the discussion. And also we would like callers not to repeat questions which have already been asked. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I apologize for I missed when you were talking about Multaq, but it does seems as if there isn't an Ad.Com, prior to the FDA's action day, which I think is the end of January, I was just wondering do you think you can get the product's approval without one or are you just still expecting another missed PDUFA deadline from FDA.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I'm just wondering if you can give us a feel for what your SG&amp;A ratios would look like if you included Plavix and Avapro marketing costs from the Bristol-Myers Squibb joint venture? Because do you seem to have one of the lowest ratios in the industry, I'm curious as to whether the scope for further cost reductions would look greater if we actually included those costs in your ratios? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'll take the Multaq question and you will not too much enjoy it but I have to answer. My answer is today absolutely no opportunity to be precise how the FDA will proceed. As you're correctly say, we have a PDUFA-date, but if you look to the environment a PDUFA date today doesn't mean a lot &#x2013; I don't want to be nasty but look what has happened on prasugrel repetitively, I could give other examples.</p>
          <p>So we live in this respect really from one day to the other. We have a PDUFA date, but we have to see what the FDA finally does. And I cannot go any further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving to your SG&amp;A question. What you are saying is correct, we don't include the SG&amp;A related to Plavix and Avapro in the area, we don't manage and which is consolidated by BMS [Bristol-Myers Squibb] as well as we don't book the sale. So we've obviously made the calculation of as if we were consolidating. We are seeing 100% in sales and 100% in SG&amp;A and again, at the affirmative, the ratio would even be lower, which is the reason for which we are reporting the &#x2013; not the figures. But the fact that I mentioned earlier that we are one of the lowest ratio in the competition. Because we know that were we to include this cost and sales we'd show an even lower ratio.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hello gentlemen. Two quick questions. First, could you tell us why did you drop the SGLT-2 inhibitor I guess in terms of the safety profile of the product? Secondly, what has been the &#x2013; can you give us the sense of the price erosion for Plavix in Germany, you've obviously maintained volumes pretty well. What is the pricing environment in Germany right now? And lastly, on Zentiva, when do you expect to close the operations, it seems to me that three shareholders are now holding 42% of share. What is the situation there? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>S&#xE9;bastien, I can take this one. Indeed, we've decided to discontinue this program, mainly for two reasons. One is the lack of a differentiating profile and the other one is also the perceived increased regulatory hurdles for anti-diabetic drugs. But I must add to that that the results of the Phase II trial in Type 2 diabetes conducted with that project will actually be presented very soon at the International Congress of the Endocrinology in Rio on November the 9th. And we will not provide any further details on the data before that date.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now on the price erosion in Germany, we see a discount up to 25% today, but average they are significantly lower because of the non-substitutability of Plavix with the two competitors. As an orientation, I can add that see German price levels for Plavix inside Europe is one of the highest, which means that consequent effects are important in light of strong parallel importation before the appearance of the two competitors. This was about 50%, this now is being lowered because as I have described we discount Plavix to the current customer.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving to Zentiva now, to begin with maybe where we are on the agenda side. As you will remember, we had to take out our dossier from the Brussel Competition Authorities when the deal turned amicable, simply because we had to give a lot more information, which now becomes accessible on the Zentiva side. In addition to that, you may have seen that last week there was new regulation, which were issued by the commission, which asked for a lot more information than in the past. So all in all, we should re-file the dossier with the competition authority in Europe in the next coming days.</p>
          <p>What does that mean? That does mean that it is possible that we will ask to move target date from the authority operation, which is these days set up at the end of November. We'll discuss with the Czech National Bank in order to move that probably into January of '09 when you take into account normal time of review of this competition. Also it is would and I remind you that normal time of review is generally 35 operating days. Now we are simply talking, I say simply &#x2013; but we are talking of the delay in the agenda. We are not talking of something, which we believe is of importance. I mean by that it doesn't endanger the operation in itself, it simply causes delays in the implementation. You mentioned there are several other shareholders. Yes, you're right, I would also remind that these days the share price is around 1,075, 1,080 and our ARPU has been set up at CZK1,150 a share. So we believe that we made a fair offer and this is what is on the table.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Tim Anderson, Sanford Bernstein. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the generic Plavix situation in Germany, do you expect that that volume impact will continue to remain low and that the branded product will retain the majority of its share going forward or could that change? On Multaq, when can we expect to see the head-to-head study versus Amiodarone? And your cholesterol absorption inhibitor for the US specifically, will any outcome trials be required or can you just rely on changes in lipid levels. There's obviously been some controversy with this mechanism in the US this year and I'm presuming you've coordinated the design of your Phase III program with FDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question in Germany is, of course, a little bit difficult to predict because those &#x2013; first of all, perhaps to be really complete, the legal battle is not at all over. We continue to fight for our rights. And there may be of course some change coming from the courtroom.</p>
          <p>Second, the question of substitutability, how long will it be maintained, I can only speculate. Because it is also related to the first part, there's a legal battle behind it. Third, we believe that there is quite some indication from a pharmacokinetic and pharmacology standpoint to become increasingly reserved towards all the salts. And I believe that there is also some movement on the European level in this respect and there maybe &#x2013; and we hope that there will be a consequence on the situation in Germany.</p>
          <p>Lastly, it's of course depending on our flexibility in terms of commercial conditions. Now that's perhaps the most easiest point that we have &#x2013; wherever we have been confronted with generic competition and I know of course that what we have here is not a true generic, it is something quite different. We have never given up.</p>
          <p>Consequently, if you look to products like Eloxatin, we maintain 60, 70% of volume in a totally hostile typical generic situation. So to be very clear, we will do everything, everything to maintain the majority of market share for Clopidogrel in Germany in volume. But this has to develop over time and we have to see.</p>

I'd kindly like you to understand that we are not prepared to answer to this kind of questions today, because first of all, nobody from research is present in the call and we also feel that this call should be really largely focusing on the results of the third quarter. There will be of course opportunity to ask this kind of question when we report next time on the full year and when also research will be present around the table here.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We have a question from Mr. John Murphy, Goldman Sachs. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much, good morning gentlemen. Two questions please, can you tell us a bit about the Ambien CR performance in the US, but also your expectations of timing on Generics for that product and any recent moves you may have made on the legal side there? And second, maybe give us a little bit more detail from what we've seen in the press release regarding Generic Aprovel in Europe. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with Generic Aprovel. First of all, I'd say so far not any impact measurable from Generic Aprovel in Europe. You know that there are only a number of less important marketing Europe today accessible because lack of patent protection. The most important is Spain, we don't believe that there will be a true competition in Spain before the year-end and probably deep into 2009. Consequently to the practice and the access given of such generics in the Spanish market. The other markets are minor.</p>
          <p>On Ambien, what we see with Ambien is stabilization in market share. Ambien CR is the leading brand in the American hypnotic market. We see no progress but we have a stabilized market share now over a couple of weeks, even months and just our expectation.</p>
          <p>We have to recognize that probably, further expansion of market share is difficult, because the generic presence of Zolpidem is simply too strong. We have I don't know probably hundreds of brands of Zolpidem in the US Generic market, also so-called in-house brands. And there is too much substitution and we believe that we have to live with what we have, okay? Which nevertheless is not so bad because, I repeat once again, we are the other leading brand with quite some distance to the others.</p>
          <p>Now when Generics could come I'll pass this thing also over to Jean-Claude from the more legal side, I believe it's once again speculation. We have acquired a good protection specifically for the gallenical form we have in the US American market. And secondly, not much more detailed answer to your question, we have to see if Generics come, are they inside our patent or not. But good to state that so far, there are none on the market and so we remain optimistic. Jean-Claude would you like to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simply the date of the corresponding patent. The first one is March 2009, which reflects the additional six months gains through the pediatric extension, but as Hanspeter mentioned, there is another patent that's 531 to be precise patent which cover the formulation and which this one expire in 2019, 1-9. So for the rest, as you know, we won't develop except to say that if needed we'll defend our right very vigorously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask a follow-up there? You didn't choose the option to prosecute or to file under Hatch-Waxman. Do you still have rights by which you can still appeal against any potential generic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see the overall legal strategy is to say the least really delicate in this field and I really ask you to understand that we don't want to go into more detail. Why we did not prosecute or if we would prosecute, it is really part of our legal strategy and we don't want to discuss on that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Andrew Baum, Morgan Stanley. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple of questions. So firstly, just going back to the &#x2013; your comparative SG&amp;A spend, perhaps you could give us some sense as to SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales for your tail products versus your top 15 as we try and more fairly benchmark Sanofi against the rest of the industry. And then, secondly a question for Jean-Claude, just to clarify the cost cutting or the adaptation program as you call it program, particularly within manufacturing. So firstly, when will we start to see the impacts of the reduction in sites on your gross margin? And can you quantify it for us a little bit more accurately than just describing it as offsetting the generic impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the SG&amp;A spend on the base business, Andrew it's really difficult to give a precise figure because the base business is so inhomogeneous from one continent to the other. The products are different and of course, the investment is different. Also it's important on the regional result, its probably different, it had nearly no impact on the US American result. It is close to 50% of our business in intercontinental and Asia-Pacific. Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb, I would say that the spend, I would &#x2013; put it this way, on the leading 15, if you work with let's say 30%, you are probably well and if you take the base business, it is more 15 than 35.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It also has to do because the way we can promote those products in those markets is quite different. We have more and more single promotion in the &#x2013; let's call it more developed market. But we can &#x2013; in Asia and Latin America or definitely Africa, we have more a kind of portfolio promotion. So the allocated cost &#x2013; for example sales force is for the individual part of the portfolio much lower than in the other market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you said 35 and 15 just to be clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going to your question on the manufacturing restructuring. First, I will answer on what we've done. I mean we've done &#x2013; we will have done about 100 million in restructuring in this area at the end of this year. And because it's &#x2013; as you know, it takes time to transfer products from one site to others I should add. And to qualify, you don't see synergies before three to five years depending on the situation. That is going to be the case at least for what we've done this year.</p>
          <p>Once again, when you &#x2013; we are talking of synergies, we are not talking of merged synergies, this is I'd say rather marginal simply because you are just avoiding the effect of generification of big products. But you're not bringing a lot of tens of millions to the cost of good, I'm talking of reduction. You see you are bringing something that which has nothing to be compared with a kind of synergy, which you can derive from in the pharmaceutical operation area. That's the reason for which I was not more precise. And obviously on the part of the question related to the future. I guess that we will see that in the future. I'm sure that you can understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to be clear, the first benefits of the already implemented restructuring of manufacturing, we will begin to see in '09 or '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I said three to five years. So it's later than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Mr. Ben Yeoh, Dresdner Kleinwort. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. It was just on Eloxatin, I was just wanting more detail on the dynamics of what was happening to Eloxatin. Is the US pretty much fully penetrated now, and how fast do you expect the decline to be in Europe over the next few months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on Eloxatin in Europe I think it's fair to say that unfortunately the worst is behind us see is the product is more or less fully generic in all major markets. As I said before in another context, we maintain high shares of volume between 50 and 80% depending on the market but consequently to the price erosion, the value share is somewhere between, let's say, 30 and 50%. The performance in the US was good. You rightly point out that we are getting close to really saturize this market. We have in the third quarter a growth of about 8% in the US of sales, but we are limited by the out of patent situation of irinotecan, camptosar, which has an unfavorable reimbursement schedule and consequence on us. I spare the details but the methodology in place has a consequence set those negative impacts on our reimbursement situation will be over in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>So consequently looking forward, we are pretty optimistic that we will at least maintain 8% growth. Perhaps even get closer to 10% and which is also because we have some good news from the clinical front. But overall once again you are advice to limit is of course the indication which is a single indication colon cancer and in which we have a higher degree of penetration of 75 to 80% and so that's the limit but nevertheless we continue to believe to see as close to a 10% growth for the quarters to come.</p>
