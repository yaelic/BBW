          <p>Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning everyone, this is Mauricio Fernandes, I am the Latin American telecom analyst for Merrill Lynch. And it's now my pleasure to be hosting Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. On this call with us today, we are honored to have from Mexico City, Daniel Hajj, CEO; Carlos Garc&#xED;a-Moreno, CFO; and then Daniela Lecuona, Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to turn it over to Daniel Hajj for his initial remarks. Daniel, please?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mauricio. Thank you everybody for being in the call. And as always, Carlos is going to make a small summary of the fourth quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Mauricio. We ended the year with our current showing subscriber growth picking up 10 million new subscribers in the last quarter; by the way it was 23% higher than the consensus number that we've obtained. The previous year with 153.4 million subs.</p>
          <p>Overall, in 2007 we gained 28.6 million clients, nearly as many as the organic subscriber additions that we had a year before and roughly 6 million or so higher than the number that we had expected at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we had 2.5 million net additions in the fourth quarter, slightly more than in the same period last year. Whereas in Brazil, we had a robust best quarter ever with 2.2 million gains, 35% more than a year before. Argentina and Colombia obtained over 1 million subscribers in the quarter each. And TracFone in the U.S. got over 700,000 subs. Altogether in 2007, we gained 6.8 million subs in Mexico; 6.3 million in Brazil, which is 22% more than the previous year; 3.7 million in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay; 2.7 (sic) [2.8] million in Colombia; and 2.1 million in Peru, our targeted goal [inaudible]. In Central America, we added 2.3 million subscribers with Guatemala accounting for nearly half of them.  In the U.S., TracFone obtained 1.6 million new subscribers.</p>
          <p>At the end of the year, we had 50 million subs in Mexico, 30.2 million in Brazil, 22.3 million in Colombia, 13.5 million in Argentina and close to 10 million in the U.S. In Ecuador and Peru combined, we have 12 million subs. In Central America, 8.2 million subs and in the Caribbean 3.5 million. In the last two regions, Central America and the Caribbean we also have 3.9 million fixed lines.</p>
          <p>Our 2007 revenues totaled 312 billion pesos. They were up 28.2% from a year before, with service revenues increasing by 31.4% year-on-year. Service revenue growth has been strong in several countries, notably Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, which had 9.9% on the quarter and 38% year-on-year, and Brazil were 8.3% sequential and 24% annual increases.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, the increase was 14.6% year-on-year in nominal terms. Prices per minute have fallen in most operations, with declines being significant in various markets of as much 30% from a year before. Therefore, usage <mark type="inaudible" /> growth in service revenues. Year-over-year, we saw MOUs expand by 35.2% in Mexico, by 12.5% in both Brazil and Colombia and by 16.3% in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Bolstered by this service revenue growth, EBITDA rose by nearly 42% year-on-year to 127 billion pesos. It represented an EBITDA margin of 40.7%. Over a year ago we saw improvements in several operations in terms of the margins. In the case of Brazil and Colombia, margins increased by between 12 and 14 points in the year. They increased by 8 points roughly in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, by 4.5 points in the U.S. and by 2.3 points in Mexico. So we have had strong service revenue growth and higher margins.</p>
          <p>Subscriber acquisition costs come down and all the costs are maintained very much in line. We have accelerated the depreciation of TDMA equipment. It's something that we discussed in the previous quarter. This acceleration was more noticeable in Colombia and Brazil.  And we had expected and we had said last quarter, depreciation charges were slated to come down after they had peaked in the third quarter. So that's what they did, they came down from 15.6% of revenues in the third quarter to 13.5% of revenues in the fourth quarter. We expect them to continue trending down as a percent of revenues.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the year ended up at 86 billion pesos. This is a number that is up 40% year-on-year, and 21 billion of those came in the fourth quarter. The net profit for the year was 58.6 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>I think that one of the exciting things of last year was the big surge in our cash flow. Our capital outlays and dividends together came up to be 115 billion pesos. This is more or less equivalent to $10.5 billion.  And these outlays of roughly $10.5 billion were, for the most part, covered by our cash flow.</p>
          <p>Net debt in the company only went up by 23 billion pesos. So that means that 80% of the $10 billion in outlays, so that's 115 billion pesos; 20% of those were funded with debt, 80% by our own cash flow.</p>
          <p>So we think that these are things that are worth highlighting that we have come up sharply higher than consensus in terms of subscriber growth and we have maintained more or less in line with the market expectations in terms of EBITDA and a little bit higher in terms of revenues.</p>
          <p>I think that 2007 was overall a very strong year, and we are seeing elasticity of response rapidly with usage trending up in most countries, even as we are seeing imported product decline.</p>
          <p>So, with this, I think that may be we can open up the floor for questions. Mauricio.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Cynthia. Just as people line up for questions, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions to Daniel and Carlos. First, just on the ARPU, which is I think one of the main value drivers for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, we were impressed to see that the ARPU in Mexico was down only 2 pesos sequentially, while subscriber net additions were almost 80% higher as you highlighted in your initial remarks, Carlos. Can you comment on your expectations for the ARPU in Mexico this year, particularly in light of the economic slowdown in the U.S. and the launch of 3G services soon? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, ARPU particularly in Mexico, Mauricio, is that we want to tell you that we were being putting the constant peso ARPU. If you don't put in constant peso I think the ARPU was flat for this year. So, I think for 2008 maybe we are going to maintain the ARPUs flat to <mark type="inaudible" /> in 2007, so that's more or less what we budget and what we think we could have this year.</p>
          <p>3G, we are starting 3G, in some countries we start at the end of last year, we are going to start next week in Mexico. So we feel that people is going to spend a little bit more money on data and that will help us to maintain the ARPU because in the other site we are getting subscribers, low-segment subscribers, prepaid subscribers in the countries. As penetration goes higher then people will start to consume a little bit less, so what we are trying to do is we have &#x2013; I've told subscribers that we have &#x2013; if they move to 3G then they are going to spend a little bit more and then the new subscribers in prepaid they are spending a little bit less, I think we can maintain our ARPUs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one more thing. As you said 2007 has very strong subscriber growth, can you talk a little bit about your expectation for 2008 in terms of subscriber net ads and then overall basis for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil as well as in terms of EBITDA margin and CapEx for 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it has been very difficult to estimate 2008 because the economic slowdown in U.S., we don't know how difficult it is going to be, how it is going to hurt all the Latin American countries. So I think for this year our estimating subscribers, also some countries are getting more and more penetrated like an example, Argentina is close to 100% penetration, Chile is around 88 penetration, but in the other side we have good, big countries like Mexico and Brazil, with around 65 penetration. So my view is that we'd be comfortable with 21 million subscribers, between 20 and 21 million subscribers for this year and the CapEx is going to be around $4 billion in 2008. So that is more or less what we feel that we have. In terms of EBITDA margin, we don't give that number. But in CapEx and in subscribers, we feel that that would be more or less the number now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Daniel and Carlos. I would like now to turn it back to Cynthia. Cynthia, please open the call for Q&amp;A now. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will take our first question from Vera Rossi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My first question is a follow-up on the 3G. In terms of the need to acquire licenses across Latin America, is there any other country that AMX will need to buy licenses to launch 3G or the only country was Brazil? And my second question is, if you can give us some data points about your launch of 3G in Brazil and Argentina, what is the percent of net additions so far that you have seen buying 3G phones? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vera, good morning. Well, we just bought the 3G license in Brazil, but even with that we have been launching 3G in Brazil before buying those license. So I don't think in any other countries we need to buy a license to launch 3G but in the future if there is going to be other options, maybe we are going to be interested in being there. But right now we don't need to write any license to deploy 3G. So I don't think 3G is going to be &#x2013; prices in 3G starts coming down. So, really I don't think that our CapEx is going to increase because of 3G. We feel that the $4 billion that &#x2013; I just said to Mauricio that we are going to spend this year are going to include coverage, capacity and quality on 3G. So, it will be around 4 billion. If you include license a little bit more, but I don't think there is going to be much more than $4 billion in CapEx. What we're going to do, we're going to increase our capacity in 2G, we are going to increase our coverage in 2G also and we're going to increase our quality and coverage in 3G. This CapEx is going to be for doing all of those things this year. So, we want to have the most important cities in 3G deployed by the end of March or April. I think all around Latin America we are going to have all the major cities, and then we are going to start to increase a little bit our coverage in 3G. So that's mainly &#x2013; what has happened in Brazil with 3G, I think it's too soon to say anything, but my view is that the actual subscribers are going to start consume a little bit more with using the data. And there is going to be new subscribers who are going to move to 3G that are going to spend a little bit more money. That's more or less how we see. We have &#x2013; we think also that the PC card &#x2013; the broadband PC card is going to be a good, also, service for all our customers. So we think that 3G is going to help us to maintain. And they are of course in all Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the percentage of your net additions to date, is that a relevant percentage of your postpaid net additions that are buying the 3G phones or are migrating to 3G phones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still it is low. We are just launching &#x2013; Vera, when you launch something, we launched in Brazil in Christmas, but we really put a lot of focus on Christmas on the prepaid and we don't want to lose focus on Christmas because we feel that in Brazil, Christmas is a very important month. So, we are going to see the first quarter how those 3G is doing. So really it is too soon to say something on 3G, but I don't have any doubt that there is going to be some services that are going to be very important in 3G: the broadband PC card for the computer, the phones using lot more data, download music. So those are mainly the main services that we feel our actual customers are going to use and the new customers are going move to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Vera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Walter Piecyk with Pali Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Daniel, can you also give us some sense &#x2013; I mean in the past, you've talked about CapEx beyond just one year out &#x2013; if the CapEx should fall off in 2009 and 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, CapEx is falling down in terms of revenues and I think we can maintain our CapEx 4 billion, a little bit more, a little bit less, not too much more not too much less in the next 2, 3 years. No, I don't think that there is going to be big changes from CapEx, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then a question on Brazil, the churn rate improvement was very outstanding in the fourth quarter; you were typically in the close to 3% range, now it is 2%. Is it something that you believe will be sustainable in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; remember that there is some &#x2013; it's a little bit, a cycle,  this churn, because when in Brazil in December, the disconnections are from September or from August. So there is not a lot of disconnections in that month. Mainly in April or May are going to be a little bit more, because of the huge sales that we had in December. But we have been very careful seeing that all our subscribers, and you look that on the ARPU. When you see that the ARPU is stable, that your revenues are stable, even with the big growth that we're having means that you have good subscribers. And well, that's something that in the company what we have been very careful not to put subscribers that they are not going to consume in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />
          </p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The ARPU was stable in the quarter, it was actually up sequentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's not really &#x2013; you can't really say it's seasonal, because your churn rate was 3.3% in the fourth quarter of last year and it's now 2.0%. So it seems like there is a substantial improvement here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are improving. We are being very careful on the new subscribers. And well, ARPUs are improving also, because people have to spend more money on Christmas, non-Christmas season, but I think all overall we're having better subscribers and we are being very careful on the new subscribers that they consume and that they &#x2013; our campaigns, marketing campaigns are &#x2013; campaigns that bring good subscribers and not only a lot of subscribers, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one thing that is important is that we've had this year to note, that the number of postpaid subscribers have increased significantly. The postpaid date was less than 45% year-on-year, I think it's <mark type="inaudible" /> most roughly 50 postpaid subscribers and we probably have a very significant impact on the blended churn...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the ARPU after churn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...that the churn in postpaid is that much lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And Carlos, just one final question. In the fourth quarter, you spent over $3 billion on dividends and your share repurchase was &#x2013; it looks to me like less than a half a billion. Can you help us understand in 2008 the use of free cash flow, I mean it's obviously difficult with the amount of free cash flow you are generating to find acquisitions to invest in. Your leverage is low, can you explain why your mix of dividends versus share repurchase is so high and how aggressive you will be in share repurchase in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we do in 2006 is we do a big share buyback when we merge America Telecom with Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil; we do our big share buyback. Last year in 2007, we do more dividends than share buybacks, but at the end of the day we're going to return the excess of capital, the excess of more need to our shareholders, and we are going to decide what's better to do, if it is better to do it in dividends or it's better to do it in share buybacks. I think -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With the stock at this price, how could you argue that dividends are better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's going to depend on... I think, what we have said before was there is not a &#x2013; very often this has to do with how much we &#x2013; how we have accumulated the liquidity throughout the year. If you recall last year we have expectation system including one that works already at Lyon it was the acquisition company from Verizon.</p>
          <p>And some of these transactions did not materialize, we ended up at the end of the year with far more liquidity that we wanted. It is not practical to dispose of that liquidity in a short period of time. So that's why we declared extraordinary dividend, that's what we did with it last year, it's what we did two years ago. And to the extent that we have better because we did it throughout the year and we are not expecting M&amp;A transaction chances are that we are going to be more looking in terms of share buybacks at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>We look at the share buybacks that we are doing today it's been nearly in the neighborhood of about 5 million shares per day, which is significantly more than what we had at the beginning of last year. So I think that's as we move more to towards that buyback and we told of the late M&amp;A transactions that we are expecting to happen or not to the extent that we are not depending on those M&amp;A transactions that we think are more likely to start distributing some of the cash flows back to the shareholders beyond buybacks from the beginning of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the liquidity that we're going to return to our shareholders, and it's going to depend on share buybacks or dividends. So it's going to depend &#x2013; we're going to be flexible on that, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand that at the end of the year maybe, you can't drop $3 billion in the share repurchase, but if it's on a regular &#x2013; I'm not sure what decision you're going to make &#x2013; if you're going to do, like, say a billion a quarter, why would there be any &#x2013; why would dividend be a part of that consideration with the stock at this price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, maybe you are right, no? Maybe &#x2013; what we are doing right now is to buy more shares at this moment. I think it's what we're doing right now. We just got do an assembly last week to increase our share buybacks in 15 billion pesos more because we have already finished what we have that &#x2013; that's mainly what we're going to do now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning. I was wondering if you could just give us a bit of an update on the regulatory front? In Mexico is there are any new developments in terms of COFECO investigation or what's you're hearing in terms of Spectrum auctions or just anything new on the regulatory side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the Spectrum auctions, I think the Minister of Communications is moving. I don't know exactly, when's going to be the date for the auction. But that's moving and maybe we're going to have it in April or May &#x2013; they don't know exactly what's going to be the date, they are making some changes. They are reviewing, because that's not only for the 3G license, they are also for the &#x2013; I think it's WiMAX. So they are doing that analysis and I think they are going to be soon, may be before the first &#x2013; in the first six months of this year, we are going to have that.</p>
          <p>In the regulatory issue, well, what we have is that COFECO is doing the investigation, its not &#x2013; what they are doing right now is an investigation of interconnection rates. So that's the only thing that officially we have, and it's what we are right now taking care of. No, they are doing an investigation, checking, what are &#x2013; the market on interconnection, if there is something there. That's the only thing that we have. There is further investigations, but the other investigations are not related to the wireless market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the only one that is related to the wireless market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, on the tax rate in the quarter it was very low this quarter, it had been quite high in the third quarter. Was there anything unusual about the fourth quarter that we should take into account going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. I have said that you should look at the tax rates of what would be an expected amount for the year and not look at them on a quarter-to-quarter basis. If you look at the effective tax rate for the year as a whole, it's very close to the statutory tax rate, the average of the statutory tax rate. And it is very close to the one that we had, and it is almost identical to the one that we had the previous year. So what you see in different quarters sometimes has to take into account different tax planning preparations. But in the end, I think you should be focused on what is the guidance that we had throughout the year, which is not something very different from the statutory tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive aspects of Mexico right now, given some of the push that Telef&#xF3;nica made at the beginning of this year. And then also on the equipment side, are you seeing any better pricing in the handset side that's allowing you to put better deals in the market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in the handset side, there is a lot of changes every day. So there is new handsets, the actual handsets are reducing the prices. So there is something that it's moving everyday. So I think you are going to see always better handsets and even 3G handsets, I think, they are starting to be attractive on prices. So they are being reduced a lot from the price that they start in 2007 and that's something that you are going to see always, or better priced or more things that the handset can do for the same price. So that is more or less what you are going to see.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the competitiveness in Mexico, I think Mexico has been very competitive. In the last two years nothing has been changed and that you could see that most, as Carlos said, has been increase in Mexico 36% year-over-year, prices have been going down very fast. So there is, not only in Mexico, there is a lot of countries where the things are in the same as in Mexico, a lot of competition, a lot of price reduction and new handsets. So that's mainly what you're going to see and what we're going to see in 2008 in all the markets. And also what we're going to do is we want to maintain our cost structure to reduce our &#x2013; maintain our costs and to increase our revenue. That's the only way to maintain that good result for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think that it is fair to say that as the price per minute comes down on the revenue side, the cost savings of, say, your 3G will help offset that and keep margins stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe yes. It is going to depend a lot of what &#x2013; for me something unclear is what happening with the economy on U.S. and how it is going to hit us in all Latin America. So it's very difficult to estimate things when you don't know what's going to happen. If it's going to be deep, it's going to take a lot of time.  If it is not going to be so deep then it's not going to take a lot of time. And how is it going to hit Latin American market? So what you're saying, I think, it's more or less what we feel is going to happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just one final question on Peru, it seemed like net adds they were relatively strong sequentially and year-over-year, is there something changing that market that's increasing net adds there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The thing is that in Peru we have 55% penetration, so on prices the competition is really tough. So when you have low penetration and huge competition, the only &#x2013; what you're going to find is a lot more subscribers inside your network. Now it's what you're going to see there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we will take our next question from Rizwan Ali with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. And my question is regarding your margins in Mexico, of course the margin came down because you had very good sub growth. But can give us an idea as to what the service margin was? On a consolidated basis your service margins were up 55.5% but let us know what your Mexican service margin was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have that written but we can give it you. And what is going to happen, the margin for this year in Mexico, I think what we said last year, we feel that over 50%, it's a very good margin. And I think we're going to work a lot to maintain that 50% margin in Mexico. Now maybe it is going to be 53 depending on the competition maybe it is going to be 50, but we feel that we can support 50% for this year. I think, service revenue market needs what they are &#x2013; give the number that they are giving me right now is around 65%, I am not sure but what they're saying is 65% is &#x2013; yes 65% &#x2013; 65.9% is the service EBITDA comparing to service revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Another question is as you launched 3G services, of course you will be advertising quite a bit, I mean is your policy to try to convince your existing high-end customers to switch to 3G services or 3G handset via handset subsidies that you will provide, or you just wait for the natural change in handsets for them to take up the 3G services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, It is going to depend a lot what's the plan in and what customer you are talking to no, so it depend their postpaid customers of 300 pesos and postpaid customers of 30 dollars and postpaid customers of 100 dollars. So it is very different and one thing that we're very clear is one of the biggest costs in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is the subsidy on handsets, and we're being very careful to try to maintain that on control. So, there is going to be a little bit of switch, maybe we give a little bit more subsidy, but they are going to give us a little bit more of revenue. So that is something that we are doing day by day, but it's not the policy in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, we have to look customer by customer to decide what we're going to give them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One last question if I may. With the 3G auctions coming in Mexico as well as in Chile later this year, when you talk about CapEx being $4 billion for this year, are you kind of including the spectrum cost or is that completely excluded for now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 4 billion is excluding the $700 million that we spend in Brazil. It includes, sorry, the seven &#x2013; the $700 million that we spend in Brazil. So I don't think in Mexico and in the rest are going to be big amounts of money, and what I said is there is not going to be more than 4 billion, a little bit more a little bit less, in the next. We can say that it is going to be around $12 billion in the next three years in CapEx for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, including license, including everything.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks for taking my question. On the debate about the dividend versus share buyback I have to say &#x2013; we actually like you guys to commit to a certain payout level as we see dividend as a way to impose capital discipline. Are you guys ready and that is a question for Daniel, are you guys ready to commit to a certain payouts in terms of the dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't understand your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you ready to commit to a certain dividend payout, dividend as a percentage of your earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think no, because I think we still have opportunities in the future. So we don't want to commit a certain dividend and then maybe we can find that there is a good opportunity for us in the region or elsewhere no, so what we are going to be is being very disciplined in terms of &#x2013; how much we're going to &#x2013; the definite that we're going to get. And we're going to return if it's some special dividends or buybacks, the rest of the liquidity that we have. So I think we, as Carlos said, we want to be &#x2013; we want to have the flexibility to do in the next two, three years, to do something if there is some acquisition that would be interested for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the dividend still, is it fair to assume that the dividend will grow at least in line with earnings over the next three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think so. Maybe yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on the regulatory developments in Brazil and also the &#x2013; any potential impact of the Brazil Telecom merger with Telemar, how would that impact your pricing and the sub growth and the competition in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think Brazil Telecom and Telemar are big companies on fixed. Telemar is also big on wireless, but I feel Telecom is not so big on wireless, I think the merger is going to be more on fixed and then they are going to have a &#x2013; both are going to have a big company on wireless. Well I think for us competition right now is very strong, and I don't think it's going to change a lot with that merger, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you don't see any impact on your EBITDA in Brazil from a stronger Telemar &#x2013; Brazil Telecom combination?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not because of that, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a question maybe for Carlos, in terms of the working capital metrics, can you just comment on the evolution of the working capital, because I don't see a balance sheet on your results here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah you're right. The receivables are up 5.5 and they seem to be well behaved here, if I compare it to last year's receivables. Can you comment on the trends that you are seeing in the receivables?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think generally what you have to know about working capital have to do, it's less about flights, invoices because that's pretty steady and have to do with postpaid, and it is much more to do with CapEx. To the extent that we have received equipment and that we are now obliged to pay for that and we account for that in our accounts payable. But also what you have is that there is a lot of work in progress that have not yet been invoiced to us and therefore that part can &#x2013; or have been invoiced to us but we are not necessarily obliged to pay the vendor at that point. We often get certain terms of payment from the vendor, so basically changes in working capital more than anything else, we would say either inventories or changes in the accounts owed to vendors. But if you want we can go through with more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can do it offline. And then one last question in terms of the EBITDA margin, if you look at your emerging markets peers from, I would say from China to Indonesia, the average EBITDA margin is about 40%, and right now you guys are at 40%, but you're growing much faster than everybody else. Should we be expecting margin expansion over the next two to three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all things equal well we have been seeing it, so historical acquisition costs do tend to fall over time relative to revenue. And that has helped to expand margins over time. We have had already two years of very significant margin expansion. But it comes a point at which it is more difficult to increase margins and in terms now of our operations, I think that it is going to be more difficult to increase margins in Mexico and Colombia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Central America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Central America, but we probably still have some time to go in Brazil for we still have 25% margin which we expect to get.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Argentina.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Argentina, which has been growing very rapidly, and we are still not seeing the margin expansion that we would expect to see over time. So I think that in Peru you can think, those operations are growing very rapidly, are still relatively &#x2013; have still relatively low margins today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think over time Brazil can get to 45% margins?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Hi guys. I just want to dig in a bit more to Mexico, and maybe I'm presenting too bleak a picture, but looking at you on your terms, it looks like churn is going up, margins are down, and prices are falling faster than they ever have before. Now just to gain sort of a backdrop I wonder if can you just talk about whether competition has got worse throughout the fourth quarter and into 2008? And also just give me an idea as to sort of where you sit on relative pricing versus Telef&#xF3;nica, both on net and off net.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't understand exactly what you said at the end of the question, but I don't see any big change on Telef&#xF3;nica. Telef&#xF3;nica has been very aggressive since the beginning of last year, and the beginning of 2006, has been very aggressive and I don't see any big change. What I said well sometimes it's different when you &#x2013; my target is to maintain Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil above 50% or 50% margin. So sometimes some months we're going to have 52-53, other ones we are going to have 50. But that's more or less what we feel we can get and also...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's important to note that we had 15% year-on-year growth, with 20% growth of postpaid subscribers, where we have been growing for a long time our postpaid base more rapidly than the prepaid base, and we have managed to have very significant private lines. Not only on the other side of the permit typically but also inter connection rates that have fallen for the last three years. In spite of all of that, we have managed to maintain ARPUs relatively flat. So with strong net subscriber growth and declining prices maintaining ARPU is I think something that speaks of the response, the elasticity that the Mexican markets have been showing to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Can I just have a couple of follow-ups. I wonder if you can just update me, it's probably my ignorance, but mobile number portability in Mexico, my understanding was that was due at some point earlier this year, and if you could just update us as to when that is and what...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>June. Number portability's already everybody is agreed on that, I think that's only time, and it's going to be on June when number portability starts in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>June. And how do you think that will play out in terms of &#x2013; share of gross adds, who do you foresee as being natural winners and losers in that process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In number portability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Will that affect ...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is difficult to say but well what you could see now the market is that the big companies starts to lose a little bit more and then in the time as it starts to be a little bit more stable. So that's mainly what you could see, but we feel very comfortable because our quality is very good, because our coverage is very good, prices are excellent. So we think that we are comfortable with number portability.  Remember that people are going to migrate to the best networks, to good prices, good quality and while we are comfortable that we have the best network, the best coverage, the best quality and we are very competitive on prices. So there is nothing that we can worry about at this moment, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No I guess, my question was more about whether you see this is an opportunity to go after, for example, Nextel International contact base. I mean, you clearly have a better network, better devices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly, the people goes to the best option, and the best option includes price, network, quality, everything, coverage.  So I think that number portability, if you are happy with your company then you are not going to migrate.  There is not a reason to migrate, and that means quality of everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And just one last question on the U.S. and the impact of the economy and the question really stems from that, but just what is the percentage of your revenues in Mexico that are incoming calls from the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that's something that, the calling put in place increased a lot, but I don't think that is going to be something that can hurt us a lot, so with an international calling put in place, calls starts to grow but that's not going to be something that if an economic slowdown in U.S. gets deep, I don't think that's something that can hurt us.  That's not a big percentage of our revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I can't push you on what exactly it is?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys for taking the question.  I guess you answered a lot of my questions already and indeed your answer to Mauricio's question kind of touched on this earlier.  But perhaps just looking into the mechanics of penetration growth going forward, as you say you're continuing to see strong subscriber growth even in the highly penetrated markets like Argentina, though given that a lot of European and Asian markets have even higher penetration, sort of 110, 120%, and are still seeing decent subscriber growth often because prepaid users have more than one account each.  Have you ever looked into the incidence of subscribers in your markets having more than one account each which might be inflating the implied penetration levels and leaving more upside from new users? Just if you have anything to share on that and if there is any variation country to country, that would be great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's really a difficult question.  I think there are some people who has two phones; one is the company phone and the other one is the personal phone.  I think with 3G, there's going to be people who are going to have two accounts, maybe one is going to be their phone, the other one is going to be their broadband and, well, that's the way you can have more penetration than the 100% and I think kids are starting to use earlier the phones so there is still a lot of things that you see that would make the penetration higher than 100%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. I guess it's just when I saw in the release, you said, I think you used the phrase that two out of three people in Mexico have a phone and that kind of instinctively gives you the impression that penetration upside from new users is somewhat limited, you know, given the fact that, you know, infants are not going to have phones and there are certain sections of the population who won't have phones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Argentina today already have 100% penetration; Chile has roughly 90%...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is not any reason why Argentina would have 100% penetration and Mexico and Brazil not, because the economies are the same, the countries are, they are, I don't think there is a big difference between the economic situation and the country, so one country could be at 100 and the other ones could be at 80 and the other ones could be at 50, like Peru. So I think at the end of 2, 3 years more or less, all of them depending on the economies, they are going to be in the same range, so Argentina is coming faster, earlier, but I think Brazil and Mexico and Colombia are going to be there soon and the other ones are also coming fast.  So there's no reason why the other ones are not going to be in that level of penetration.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, thanks very much for the call. Just a couple of questions.  Firstly, on the 4 billion CapEx, what current depreciation would that translate into, including the TDMA write-downs?  And second question, of the 20 to 21 million subscriber goal target, where do you see the majority of that coming from?  And does that target include or exclude Jamaica?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the subscribers, we never provide indication as to where we'll be expecting it, we always the aggregate sum of subscribers that we are expecting for the company, and in terms of depreciation, we have mentioned that last quarter it should be trending down, I think probably throughout this year, it probably will be in differential of about 12.5%, that's what I would expect it to be, probably going below 12% next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are there further TDMA write-downs to happen this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that we are all set...we are all set at the level of the position that we are having today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So 12.5% includes the additional depreciation on TDMA assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly just on the non-operating income and there's a, for the full-year '07 there's a kind of 4.4 billion peso non-operating loss. Could you talk a little bit about that and what the outlook is for non-operating income and expense?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  The first question is regarding the handset subsidies, we take only the revenues and cost of the handset, that suggests there is a big decrease in handset subsidy and the fact is that we have heard there is some increase in competition in some countries.  So, I wanted to know if the competitive conditions are actually allowing you to decrease effectively the subsidy you are granting new subscribers.  And secondly, in the U.S. operations and platform, you have reported a very strong growth in subscribers and also decreasing, a significant decrease in churn.  So, how do you explain that?  What's going on in the market that is making the churn to decrease so dramatically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question on handset side, well, the competition is not only one subsidies, the competition is also on rates and on plans, tariffs.  So, competition has been strong.  And also in subsidies both as we said, well, a lot of subsidies have been going down.  So, there is a mix of everything.  So, what I said is well, there is a big cost on subsidies and we are being very careful to maintain and to be aware of that.  And in terms, what did you said on platforms, what is the question on platform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically with what we saw with the increasing net adds with a strong decrease in churn in this quarter.  So, I wanted to know what was going on in the market that is causing this behavior.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have specifically the answer on the why the churn on platform came down from 5 to 3.6 but we can review it and check with you exactly what's happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But there is definitely something going on in the U.S. market that is making to the operation to grow faster.  Can we expect this growth to continue or it was just non-recurring event in the fourth quarter that shouldn't be &#x2013; we shouldn't see this in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why we have a very strong quarter; first, what's Christmas and Christmas is a very good month for us I think in U.S.  Other competitors have been not doing very good.  On another MVNOs has been very good. The other thing is that we are a GSM operator, there is not a lot of GSM operators in the U.S., as a prepaid &#x2013; reseller prepaid.  So, there is something that has been helping us and that's really why we have been developed and why platforms are in so good shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And going back a little bit on the handset subsidies, do you think that one of the biggest reasons for the lower subsidy is actually Brazil because of the lower growth and lower competition in the market as the margins are reflecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lower competition and lower cost?</p>

          <p>Subscriber growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't have any lower subscriber &#x2013; we have 6.2 million subscribers net adds in Brazil.  So, I don't think it was much higher than what we expect and much higher than -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the percentage of growth, you went from 25% in '07 to 17% this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not the reason.  The reason on the subsidies is that we have been a little bit more careful.  And people &#x2013; all around Latin America, people are not looking only for low-end handsets, they are looking also for camera handsets, music handsets and in those type of handsets, we have &#x2013; those big subsidies are not in those type of handsets.  So, there is a big mix and change between that, and we have been very careful again on taking care of the subsidies on the handsets.  Now, it's a big cost for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil and we are going to be very careful also this year.  As competition and the market allow us, then we are going to be careful there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Yes, so, following up on the last questions, my question is precisely regarding your strategy for net additions during 2008.  Did you plan to put higher entities on lower tariffs rather than on handsets subsidies? In other words, did you plan to trade off lower handset subsidies for a lower service margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't put the conditions in the market.  So, it's going to depend on each country and each market and with all the competitors. So, it's very different in each of the countries.  So, I cannot tell you that we are going to switch between subsidies to rates or rates between subsidies.  So, it's not a tradeoff of anything.  So, in each market, it's different and we have to play different in each market.</p>
