          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to the Lloyds Banking Group Results Presentation for 2008. With me on the platform this morning are Eric Daniels, our Group Chief Executive; and Tim Tookey, the Group Finance Director. They will both make some prepared comments and after that we will open the floor to questions.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased, very pleased at last to have the opportunity to talk to you fully about our results and to respond fully to your questions regarding our group including HBOS. Before we start &#x2013; and you'd also have seen our announcement this morning with regard to the government Asset Protection Scheme. We've confirmed that we are in discussions with the Treasury about participating in the scheme and those talks are progressing well. And whilst I suppose I have to say there can be no certainty about the outcome, we will provide a market update in due course.</p>
          <p>Now, at last we can concentrate on our future and look to it with confidence. As you know, the acquisition of HBOS was only completed on 16th of January, six weeks ago and whilst much of the time since then has been spent working on the detail of the HBOS figures of 2008 made more complicated by the fact that the Lloyds management team had no involvement in the 2008 activities of HBOS, we are now in a position to present not just the figures, but also much of our plans.</p>
          <p>The arrangements of this morning, we'll start with Tim presenting the Lloyds TSB results demonstrating the strength of our underlying businesses and particularly sharing a well controlled organization with high quality risk management. Whilst there's clearly been a significant impact on all the numbers, market dislocation and insurance volatility, the Lloyds TSB relationship based businesses have been remarkably resilient delivering strong momentum. This is the Lloyds you know. Tim will then go through the HBOS figures for 2008 sharing a number of the key issues that we as Lloyds Banking Group are focusing on. I'll then pass over to Eric, who will discuss how we're managing the short-term challenges, we face and how we plan to create substantial value in the newly enlarged group.</p>
          <p>In the presentations, we'll show you how we continue to fund well. We'll highlight some of the high-risk areas in the HBOS portfolio. We'll set out our robust capital position and in particular we'll show you our plans as to how we're going to manage and develop the HBOS businesses including those high-risk elements of the portfolio. I think it's fair to say that historically everyone knows Lloyds as a very conservative organization with a strong risk management culture and these qualities remain in place and we've applied them to HBOS. HBOS was acquired as part of a carefully developed strategic plan for our Group.</p>
          <p>The opportunity to acquire HBOS came at a time when its own business model was being significantly challenged. And this is truth created the opportunity for us to consider and ultimately execute the transaction. That opportunity and the price at which we purchased the assets could only have come out of HBOS adversity. It's the Board's job to look beyond the short term, and to also the future options for any organization. And that is what we on the Lloyds Board have been doing for some time now to enhance our medium to long-term position and performance.</p>
          <p>The HBOS acquisition allows us to extend our earnings platform and to continue to deliver great momentum from our core relationship businesses. I guess it's an understatement to say that 2008 was a very difficult and challenging year for the banking industry, both in the UK and worldwide. We've been through the most tumultuous times over the last few months and have seen significant acceleration in the speed of deterioration in the UK economic environment.</p>
          <p>We are in the middle of a global economic downturn the like of which we have never seen before. But as we look beyond the present and the near term we're creating something important and valuable. The Lloyds Banking Group is now the largest financial services franchise in the United Kingdom with a range of leading market positions and important product lines such as current accounts, savings, mortgages, insurance, long-term savings and so on. We are a leading player in the SME and Corporate Banking sectors.</p>
          <p>The Group has a very significant footprint and with about 3,000 branches is present in more United Kingdom locations than any other financial institution. Essentially we are number one in an attractive and fundamentally profitable UK market, one that's particularly attractive to our core business areas. In short, we saw the acquisition where HBOS has been strategically important for us. Furthermore our strength and size will offer opportunities for growth for the future, which as stand-alone Lloyds TSB would not have been in a position to deliver to the same degree.</p>
          <p>Over the last few weeks and months there have been periods of reflection, when we considered some of the key questions that many of you have been asking, not least will it be a success. Let me just say the view of our Board unanimously and clearly is absolutely yes. The short-term outlook for all financial services companies in the United Kingdom and around the globe is challenging. But significant acquisitions such as the one that we just completed need to be examined with regard to determining their success over time, and not just a few weeks after the deal has been completed.</p>
          <p>Now let me just touch briefly on the role of government within our business. A great deal has been said in recent months about the nature of the government's involvement with the banking sector. We believe that most of the government's initiatives have been positive and well considered. And in particular, we very much welcome the government intervention last year to stabilize the banking system and encourage more lending.</p>
          <p>The dramatic unfolding of events across the world following the collapse of Lehmans the government needed to take swift and decisive action, and it did just that. And just as it took decisive action this week again when it launched the government asset protection scheme in respect to which as I said we're in detail discussions. That's why despite our relative strength, we together with other UK banks were required in October by the government to strengthen capital ratios as part of an industry wide initiative to reduce the systemic risk in the UK banking system. And as a result of that, the government has become a 43% shareholder of the Group.</p>
          <p>Our first real tangible experience of working with our new shareholder came as we selected two new independent Directors for Lloyds. I can only say that the shareholder involvement was supportive and constructive and we now have two new Directors with great experience and great quality in Tony Watson and Tim Ryan. But the Board here will act or it has acted and will continue to act in the interest of all shareholders.</p>
          <p>Whilst in common with the government we recognized the importance of all social aspects of operating within the UK and within the UK banking industry. The Board constantly examines and ensures that everything we do is tested against the broader shareholder interests. Tim and I will cover our results and strategy shortly, but let me just reiterate that our success has been based on building a strong well thought through business model. We aim to add real consistent value to our individual and corporate customers with the full range of banking, insurance and life products that they need to manage their personal lives and businesses effectively. The result is that our model is more conservative, is a lower risk business model, a model that we've already implemented in HBOS.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Eric, let me just point out, well, actually to Tim, let me just point out that they are the two most visible senior executives here today. But they are just too high-quality executives in an exceptionally talented management team. As I look around the floor today, I can see all the other Executive Directors and Group Executive Committee members that form a great team. And they've already made great strides in bringing our two businesses together and they are the ones who'll be responsible for driving the enlarged Group forward.</p>
          <p>Ours is a business that enjoys number one status in the attractive and profitable UK market. It's a business that has clear scale benefits, which we believe will lead to superior returns in our new banking environment. And this is a business that has great opportunities ahead to deliver significant cost and revenue synergies. We are all committed to delivering those benefits to shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand you over to Tim. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Victor, and good morning, everybody. This morning I'm pleased to be presenting to you the financial results for both Lloyds TSB and HBOS along with further detail on the new enlarged Group. I've quite a number of slides to run through with you today and wherever possible I've used the format that we previously used for Lloyds TSB Group to make them easier to follow quickly. And given the significant content and time limitations, I'm going to canter through many of the slides and simply focus on the key points.</p>
          <p>The core business performance of Lloyds continues to be strong and this will be critical going forward. The Lloyds TSB business model is based on developing through the cycle customer relationships, which means that in a downturn our earnings are much more resilient than many of our peers. Clearly, the HBOS franchise has been under more pressure, but there remain a number of core areas that have performed well and will continue to underpin revenues in the new Group going forward. Victor has commented on the key strategic benefits of the HBOS acquisition. However, it is also important to note that it delivered significant tangible net asset value enhancement and significant potential to deliver shareholder value. The new Group enjoys a robust funding and capital position and we continue to fund at market leading rates.</p>
          <p>In terms of this presentation, I'll initially focus on the Lloyds TSB results, then review the HBOS results and finally take a look at the combined entity and provide you with some key information relating to the new Group. So let's start with the Lloyds results. As we previously signaled to the market, the Lloyds TSB statutory profit for 2008 was just over &#xA3;800 million. Insurance volatility continues to be significant as a result of the falls in equity and property markets and movements in bond spreads and once again, policyholder interest was negative. Although, as we previously noted whilst policyholder interest is a debit above the line there was a corresponding credit in the tax line.</p>
          <p>The other one-offs have been previously disclosed except for the &#xA3;100 million goodwill impairment, which relates to our asset finance business. Adjusting for these items, our continuing businesses profit was down 35% and this fall was primarily due to market dislocation, which remains low relative to many of our peers.</p>
          <p>Despite the market environment, our income has remained strong and increased by 2% for the year even after market dislocation. Underlying income grew by 8% reflecting a strong performance from our relationship businesses. Expenses have grown by 5%, but adjusting for exchange rate movements and the impact of accelerated depreciation in the auto lease business, underlying expenses grew by a more modest 3%. And so I could say that underlying jaws were 5% positive.</p>
          <p>Whilst talking about our cost effectiveness, I'd like to draw a line under our efficiency program which was completed at the end of last year, having delivered annual net cash savings of over &#xA3;300 million against a target of &#xA3;250 million. Clearly we've seen a significant increase in payments in line with our recent statement and I will return to these later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>So let's look briefly at divisional performance. All divisions were profitable, even after market dislocation, UK Retail Banking posted a strong trading performance. Income growth was 7% equally balanced between asset and liability performance and cost control continued to be very strong with only a 2% rise in expenses. Insurance and Investments had an excellent year in a difficult market. Profit growth was excellent but in part due to the 2007 flood claims, which were of course not repeated last year.</p>
          <p>And despite market dislocation Wholesale and International was profitable as a result of the strength of our customer relationships across our corporate and SME businesses. Central items includes additional funding costs, but our overall income was achieved at a constant banking margin compared to last year as additional funding costs have been recovered through a variety of pricing initiatives.</p>
          <p>We continue to see good lending growth, but this was also supported by strong deposit growth. The result that our year-end loans deposit ratio was the same as that of the half year and only marginally higher than last year-end. Our underlying charge for impairment losses grew by 57% reflecting the more difficult market conditions. In the retail bank impairments show the impact of falling house prices, which account for approximately &#xA3;150 million of the impairment rise or charge.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, it's our view that in 2009 house prices could fall by a further 15%. In the unsecured book, card impairments were flat year-on-year, but we saw an increase in loan and overdraft impairments reflecting the economic conditions, although our enhanced collections activity continues to make a difference. Whilst overall asset quality in Wholesale remains satisfactory, Corporate impairments continued to rise in the second half as the economy deteriorated further, and the charge in corporate markets does include a &#xA3;150 million for losses relating to Lehman and Icelandic bank exposures.</p>
          <p>Across the various Lloyds TSB businesses, levels of impairment remained modest, reflecting strong asset quality at origination. Where provisions are considered necessary, they are made swiftly and at a level consistent with our sound, active risk management principles and disciplines. And the point I'd highlight to you on here is a significant increase in provisioning for retail impairment to reflect the deterioration in retail credit conditions that one would expect to see at this point in the economic cycle. In summary then, Lloyds TSB's relationship businesses have continued to perform well, demonstrating strong income growth, good cost disciplines and rigorous risk management.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the HBOS results. In line with our recent statement, the HBOS statutory loss for 2008 was &#xA3;10.8 billion. And HBOS incurred a number of one-off items, the main one shown here being the loss of &#xA3;845 million relating to the sale of BankWest and St Andrew's Australia. The HBOS franchise has been under pressure. And the results in corporate and treasury have overshadowed some solid performances in other areas. In Retail, the underlying trading surplus was up 9%, reflecting income growth of 5% and marginally lower costs. Retail impairments were dominated by HPI, as we will see in a minute.</p>
          <p>The Insurance and Investment division performed well, and like Lloyds benefited from the fact that the 2007 floods and associated claims were not repeated. The international results were dominated by the provisions against residential property development in Ireland, which took that country's results from a profit to a loss. During the year, HBOS managed lending very tightly to alleviate funding and capital concerns, with little origination and focused re-pricing, which supported overall income levels and delivered margin stability. The business saw a significant deposit outflows in the second half of September. However, these subsided in October, and there were net inflows in November and December.</p>
          <p>Corporate reported a loss before tax of &#xA3;6.8 billion. Income was down just over &#xA3;3 billion, largely driven by significant investment write-downs. The impairment charge reflects the sharp deterioration in Corporate credit conditions generally and HBOS' exposure to property related sectors, which alone account for about 60% of the charge. The Corporate investment portfolio write-downs included mark-to-market adjustments in respect of interest rate hedges, low realizations from the joint venture portfolio, write-downs on equity investments and of course impairment on investment securities. Corporate impairment charges were broadly spread across the principal portfolios, but included an increase in the collective provision of &#xA3;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>In treasury, the pre-dislocation contribution of &#xA3;300 million was more than offset by market dislocation charges. Losses in respect of AFS impairments totaled &#xA3;1.4 billion, comprising &#xA3;600 million relating to exposures to Lehman, Washington Mutual and the Icelandic banks, &#xA3;700 million relating to U.S. RMBS primarily Alt-A, and other charges relating to ABS CDOs. Losses in respect of negative fair value adjustments came to &#xA3;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>As expected in the current economic environment, impairment losses increased, the main items being the losses in Corporate, which I've just discussed. Retail impairment charges increased primarily as a result of the house price index fall. The mainstream HBOS mortgage portfolio continued to perform well and in line with the Lloyds TSB portfolio. However, there was a further deterioration in the specialist loans portfolio, including subprime and self-cert mortgages. As I mentioned earlier, the provisions against residential property development in Ireland were the major items contributing to the impairment charge in International.</p>
          <p>HBOS impairment losses totaled &#xA3;10 billion last year, and this is some &#xA3;1.6 billion ahead of our estimate in the autumn, when the deal was announced. At that time, we took a very conservative view and anticipated losses for the second half of 2008 of &#xA3;8 billion, a figure more than three times the HBOS internal estimate at that time. When this assessment was prepared, the consensus view was that GDP would fall by 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008. And as we now know, the significant deterioration in the economy during the fourth quarter led to a fourth quarter GDP reduction of 1.5%. I think it is fair to say that the extent and pace of economic deterioration has taken all market participants by surprise. As a result of that deterioration and a more prudent provisioning methodology, we have increased our impairment provisions. And this resulted in the impairment losses coming in slightly ahead of our expectations.</p>
          <p>I'd like to draw your attention to two points on this chart. Firstly, you can see that as part of our conservative provisioning methodology, we've increased our provisions, notably in Corporate, in response to the deteriorating economic environment. And secondly, you'll see that in International, provisions as a percentage of impaired assets actually fell. But this is largely due to the sale of BankWest and St Andrew's in Australia.</p>
          <p>In summary, these HBOS results reflect a major deterioration in the credit performance in Corporate, the associated reduction in the value of the investment portfolio and an increase in the impact from market dislocation to the treasury portfolio. And the core business in the HBOS franchise performed well in the difficult market environment, with good performances particularly in retail and in Insurance and Investments.</p>
          <p>Having gone through the key results issues for both businesses in 2008, I'd like to spend the remainder of this presentation focused on the combined Group.</p>
          <p>Before going into detail, I think it's worth saying at the outset that we've made significant progress with our initial integration plans, and Eric will talk to you more about it shortly. One of the first things we did on day one was to ensure that the whole range of Lloyds TSB's risk management policies and practices were applied across the HBOS businesses. And this has included a significant tightening of risk controls and procedures, particularly with regard to credit sanctioning.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the Group lending base is diverse. As you can see, the Group lending base is diverse and around half is made up of personal mortgages. The book is split approximately 51% retail secured. Can I just pause for a second there, please? Mike, I'm missing a page from my script. Do you have a spare copy? I'm missing page 11. Will you excuse me a second, everyone? Perhaps we could go back up one slide please. Thank you. Okay.</p>
          <p>So I was just talking about the tightening of credit controls and procedures particularly with regard to credit sanctioning. And the new Group launched with a robust opening capital position and a core Tier 1 ratio of 6.4%. In focusing on the new enlarged business, there are a number of key messages. The core businesses throughout the Group are continuing to perform well, particularly the core franchises in Retail, Insurance and the Corporate relationship businesses. Costs have been and will continue to be tightly controlled.</p>
          <p>We expect Retail impairments to rise significantly from 2008 levels to a large extent driven by further house price falls and the expected increases in unemployment levels in the UK. Corporate impairments are also likely to remain at 2008 levels. We do expect to see significantly lower charges from market dislocation and investment provisions, and we're currently expecting risk weighted assets to grow by low teens percent in 2009, largely as a result of pro-cyclicality impacts. The net result is that notwithstanding the good underlying trading performances of our core relationship businesses we do expect the Group to report a loss in 2009 before accounting for the goodwill aspects of the acquisition.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to spend some time on the Group balance sheet, as I know this has been an area of significant interest. As we can see, and now we're back on track, as we can see the Group lending base is diverse and around half is made up of personal mortgages. The book is approximately split 51% retail secured, 7% unsecured, and 42% corporate.</p>
          <p>Looking at some of the key portfolios in more detail and turning first to mortgages. As you can see, 79% of our portfolio is prime mortgages, whereas I will show you the performance is strong across both heritages. The Lloyds TSB buy-to-let book is also performing very well. So, overall we have very low levels of concern indeed over more than 82% of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Let's look at overall mortgage arrears trends. We see here that the HBOS prime portfolio is performing slightly better over time than the Lloyds equivalent and the Q4 kick-ups in arrears trends are mainly arising in the HBOS buy-to-let and specialist portfolios. In 2008, Lloyds TSB saw arrears increase by 47%, while HBOS saw a 40% increase. With the combined Group being 28% of the market, it is reassuring to see our overall portfolios performing so much better than the market given that the CML increase in arrears last year was 72%.</p>
          <p>Lending continues to be tightly controlled, with new prime business being written around about 65% LTV. And we have now exited the specialist sector. Looking further down the slides the proportion of loans, with a loan to value in excess of 100%, I would highlight that although these may seem higher than we've seen in recent years, it is important to put this into context. I've therefore set out the absolute value of mortgages with over 100% loan to value. And as you can see a relatively small proportion of these are in the specialist book.</p>
          <p>Let's look at it another way. The values of our book that are both more than 100% loan to value and in arrears are very modest indeed. In fact they total around &#xA3;2 billion, just 0.6% of the total mortgage portfolio. Having conducted a significant review of our newly enlarged mortgage book, we have identified the areas of focus and have taken the appropriate actions. We have stopped writing specialist, self certified and subprime mortgages and we are focusing on the prime sector and some aspects of buy-to-let.</p>
          <p>Looking at properties in possession, Lloyds TSB has tended to operate at about half of the industry average. It's true to say that HBOS also operates at about the same level. The new repossessions rate as a percentage of total mortgages in 2008 was significantly below the industry average on both the Lloyds TSB and HBOS books.</p>
          <p>The card portfolios of Lloyds TSB and HBOS are very similar and performing almost identically in terms of impairments rates and is a similar story for the remaining unsecured lending portfolio. Wait for it on this one.</p>
          <p>We've historically used dynamic delinquency charts to demonstrate the quality of our new business. And the shaded area or fan shown here depicts the boundary of Lloyds TSB arrears performance for vintages dating right back to December 2004. If I overlay the corresponding data for HBOS, you can see that overall the HBOS trends are within the Lloyds TSB fan though generally towards the top. Recent vintages are showing some early signs of stress, as I would expect at this point in the cycle.</p>
          <p>Turing now to our corporate book, our corporate loans book which stands at just over &#xA3;300 billion is again a reasonably well-spread portfolio, but you can see a predominance of loans and advances to financial institutions and property exposure. And I'm now going to talk in more detail about our property related exposure in commercial real estate and house building.</p>
          <p>Looking at this exposure, I've included exposure to property investment, development, house builders, hotels, housing associations, and of course the related joint ventures in the HBOS portfolio. To put this in context, property exposures represent 17% of Lloyds customer lending and 36% of HBOS lending at year end. Of the Group's total exposure of nearly 100 billion, three quarters comes from the heritage HBOS business and one third is from HBOS overseas.</p>
          <p>Let's look at this in more detail. You are familiar with the Lloyds TSB property profile. This is based on a relation focused lending philosophy, but with little development exposure and then only with significant covenants and lending protection. And the Lloyds TSB house builder lending is about &#xA3;1.3 billion, because the focus is mainly towards larger names we have seen only limited evidence of stress. Residential is holding up well largely reflecting that the majority of lending is to housing associations equivalent to a local authority covenant.</p>
          <p>The HBOS acquisition brings &#xA3;45 billion of UK property and construction lendings to the Group. And this is after significant write-offs and impairments in 2008, which included virtually the full write-off of all housebuilders equity exposures. The residual exposures to housebuilders have significant security including land banks, although this portfolio is suffering acutely in the current economic environment and will require considerable workout effort. About half of the overall exposure is to property investment. And this has an average maturity of nearly five years, strong levels of interest cover, typical lease lengths and excessive debt maturity timings and a well diversified tenant portfolio, which even includes the government as a tenant.</p>
          <p>Whilst the tail of this portfolio is expected to cause further write-offs in 2009 the core is sound. And within commercial exposures here I've included civil engineering and construction, building contractors and property management. And the latter is the largest sub segment exposure of &#xA3;5 billion and is performing satisfactorily at the moment. The residential portfolio is over one-third housing association lending with the balance being a large number of small value exposures. The house builder exposure is largely focused on private house builders with lending predominantly secured against land banks and work in progress and we've written down our equity exposure to house builders to effectively nil.</p>
          <p>Overseas property lending within HBOS is &#xA3;29 billion across Ireland, Australia, Europe and North America. And as you can see the largest individual country exposure is in Ireland, which is split 55% investment and 45% development. Clearly, this is a troubled portfolio and you will see from the HBOS news release today that we have increased our provisions to cover higher impaired assets. Only 7% of the investment book is currently stressed or impaired, however, the development book is under considerably more pressure and 38% is currently regarded as stressed or impaired and we have established a 28% provision coverage against such development exposures.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the leveraged finance portfolio, which amounts to almost &#xA3;15 billion. On the Lloyds side the acquisition finance unit has a well-spread portfolio where the underwriting criteria has always been the same as for transactions that we plan to hold on our balance sheet. And the hung balances are currently only about &#xA3;900 million. The HBOS leveraged finance portfolio is also well spread by sector and we consider just over 2 billion of the combined HBOS portfolios to be high risk or impaired.</p>
          <p>The equity holdings within the Group total nearly &#xA3;6 billion and these are well spread across the HBOS integrated finance, funds investments and joint venture portfolios together with Lloyds development capital. The HBOS integrated finance portfolio comprises over 60 assets that were largely originated pre-2007, whilst similarly almost two-thirds of joint ventures portfolio exposures go back to pre-2007. The Lloyds development capital portfolio is a conservative one well spread around the UK and with low average ticket values and has generally been less affected by the current downturns in other portfolios. The funds investment tranche here reflects over 100 investments in private equity funds written since 1995.</p>
          <p>Looking at our Treasury debt securities portfolio, which totals nearly &#xA3;140 billion, the majority comprises bank notes, certificates of deposits, treasury bills, covered bonds and other government and supranational paper, and the balance is made up of approximately &#xA3;56 billion of asset backed securities. So let's look at that tranche in more detail. You'll note that of the total asset backed net exposure 13% of this is made up from U.S. residential mortgage backed securities and these are priced at a book value of 64. Within the U.S. RMBS category of 7.4 billion, 5.4 billion relates to Alt-A exposure largely originated by HBOS. And you will have seen, possibly if you got that far, from the detailed additional disclosures at the back of the news release that our Alt-A exposure has been written down to a book price of 59.</p>
          <p>The other large holdings are non-U.S. RMBS which reflects that originated in the UK, Australia, and mainland Europe. And these bonds are well-protected senior tranches and overall we believe there is limited risk of losses materializing in this sector. The other major exposure within the asset backed securities portfolio is U.S. student loans and many of you will have heard me talk about these before. As we all know, the vast majority of these student loans benefit from U.S. government guarantees. And the average mark of 88 really reflects a liquidity adjustment rather than a credit problem.</p>
          <p>I've talked in some detail about the exposures we have that the asset class is a concern to market commentators. Over the last few weeks, we've undertaken a significant review process of all material exposures in our corporate and treasury portfolios, to assess the impairment expectations. In corporate, this is focused on commercial real estate, leveraged finance, equity exposures and joint ventures. And within treasury we've focused on the difficult asset classes including CDOs and Alt-A.</p>
          <p>Clear credit risk and risk appetite statements are being put in place across HBOS, aligning all new business flows to Lloyd's heritage risk appetite. In addition, a new credit committee structure was put in place from day one of the acquisition and this has already led to the cancellation of a number of limits and to significantly scale back participation in a number of business areas.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to move on to acquisition fair value accounting. As you're aware, this only arises on acquisition and can have a distorting impact on the way in which a bank's results, and particularly capital position, are reported. Under acquisition fair value accounting, all of the assets and liabilities of the target company whether on or off balance sheet are fair valued. And we therefore reviewed a portfolio level &#xA3;1 trillion of balances of HBOS predominantly loans and advances to customers and general liability balances.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have to offset the HBOS AFS and cash flow hedging reserves against capital on acquisition. The result is we've made a number of adjustments to value and these adjustments will unwind through the income statement over time as I've illustrated here and I currently expect about &#xA3;2 billion net to unwind on a pre-tax basis in 2009. Of course the economics of these assets and liabilities are totally unaffected by such fair value adjustments, but this aspects of the accounting regime introduces complexity, which makes our balance sheet, and as I said, our capital position difficult to directly compare against some other banks.</p>
          <p>On this slide I've broken out the estimated fair value adjustments to both sides of the balance sheet. You can see here that the net impact from fair value in the loans and deposits is a negative &#xA3;10.7 billion of the tax, but this is slightly more than offset by credit for fair valuing HBOS' own debt. The net impact of fair value adjustments that affect core Tier 1 capital is therefore a small credit, which also flows through to tangible assets.</p>
          <p>Now this slide breaks out the overall net negative capital adjustments. In addition to the fair value adjustments, which I've just taken you through shown on the first line here, we've had to adjust for the impacts of the AFS and cash flow hedging reserves that are previously being taken to reserves within the HBOS accounts, but have not had to be deducted from their capital position. Thus, the net impacts of the negative capital adjustment is &#xA3;3.7 billion a number that we will deduct from our capital position. And these last two deductions are made only because of our acquisition of HBOS. And thus had we grown our business organically we would not have had to reflect them in our figures.</p>
          <p>We can see here the distortionary impact of this net negative capital adjustment on our capital ratios, which on a reported basis show a 6.4% core Tier 1 and 9.8% Tier 1. I've commented that only LBG has to offset the AFS and CFH reserves against capital. Adjusting back for these items to reflect a more representative economic basis, which I have labeled here as comparable, the ratios are actually 7.7% and 11.1% respectively. In looking at this impact some of you will comment on the appropriateness or otherwise of the ratios appearing to benefit from the fair valuing of HBOS' external debt. Whatever the merits of this, I would caution you please to note also that only Lloyds has to include the AFS and CFH reserves as a capital deduction or indeed has to fair value normal loans and advances. I regard our ratios as perfectly robust and we have given you both sets to help you do proper comparisons.</p>
          <p>We've previously said that the HBOS acquisition will increase net tangible assets per share for Lloyds TSB shareholders. The increase arises because the acquisition price paid is considerably less than HBOS's December position, even after their second half losses. Also affecting the aunts are our fair value adjustments. Although the net impacts on net tangible assets is only 0.2 billion as shown here. Overall therefore the chart shows that there is &#xA3;10 billion uplift to the Lloyds net tangible assets from the HBOS acquisition.</p>
          <p>In per share terms and adjusting for the January capital raising, net tangible assets per Lloyds Banking Group share rose from 118 pence at year-end to a pro forma basis of 179 pence. And within all the pro forma disclosures in the back of the news release, you will see a pro forma consolidated balance sheet highlighting this number and showing a pro forma net tangible asset value for the enlarged Group of &#xA3;29.5 billion.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to touch on the liquidity position of the Group. Throughout the crisis, we've continued to fund well and at market-leading rates. And this is due to a number of reasons, but one of the key factors is our diverse funding portfolio. Following the merger, our credit ratings have all been reviewed by the respective ratings agencies and in each case our short-term ratings are at the highest possible level and all our long-term ratings remained in the AA range. We have made measured use of the various government schemes and maintained a very significant pool of eligible collateral for further use as appropriate.</p>
          <p>Finally, not only have we maintained a consistent market presence leveraging our long-term relationships, but we have always ensured we maintain a significant funding headroom. Our high and growing customer-funding base is a key part of our funding model. We currently have over &#xA3;350 billion of customer deposits the majority of which are sticky relationship deposits. As you can see, we do have a significant wholesale funding requirement, but this is satisfied from a variety of sources.</p>
          <p>We have a very well spread funding profile and the enlarged Group has a longer-term maturity profile than that of Lloyds TSB previously. Our broad aim is to ensure that we maintain our less than one-year funding balances at about 75% of the Group's Wholesale funding requirement. And at the year-end you can see that only 65% of our Wholesale funding requirement was less than one year maturity. In conclusion, as I mentioned earlier, we've made significant progress on our initial integration plans. We have ensured that the whole range of Lloyds TSB risk management policies and practices have been applied across the HBOS businesses.</p>
          <p>The Group has a robust opening capital position and we spent the last six weeks getting our arms around the HBOS business. Clearly 2009 is going to be another difficult year. But whilst we are preparing the business to take advantage of the longer-term opportunities ahead, we understand the challenges we face in the short term and we are managing them appropriately.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will hand over to Eric who will take you through a further overview of our progress.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tim. Good morning all and thank you very much for coming. You've heard from Victor about the strategic underpinnings of the acquisition and why it remains a good deal. And Tim has taken you through the numbers in some detail. This morning I'll cover three areas. First, I'll give you my brief take on 2008 results for Lloyds and HBOS. This is the last time I'll talk about the two companies separately. The results from here on in will be Lloyds Banking Group.</p>
          <p>The results for Lloyds and HBOS reflect their very different business models that each company had adopted. It's important to understand the difference. Whereas we apply the Lloyds model to the HBOS side of the business, its performance will look very different going forward. I'll speak to you about the near-term economic outlook and the issues that we face as a result.</p>
          <p>I appreciate that there has been a huge concern about the short-term issues, particularly the lending book and how it will fare in the downturn. Pretty clearly the HBOS portfolio is a higher risk book and it will feel the effects of the difficult economy more severely than the Lloyds book, but we understand the challenges that we're facing and that we're addressing them.</p>
          <p>Third, I'd like to give you a view on how the Lloyds Banking Group will create value. With all the attention that's being paid to the credit issues, we should not lose sight of the fact that this is a franchise with great potential. We have a strong core earnings momentum and that's being masked by a bad set of losses in the non-core businesses. As we work our way through the credit issues, the strength of core business will start to emerge. In addition, we'll realize more than 1.5 billion of cost synergies. The programs are underway and they are already starting to deliver.</p>
          <p>I'll also talk to you about revenue synergies. We have not included them in our forecasts, but we believe they are significant and real. Let me start with the results, which reflect how the very different business models performed in the year. The Lloyds performance while down 35% on a continuing business basis is reasonable in a very difficult environment. The performance reflects the through-the-cycle conservative positioning that we've taken over the past six years.</p>
          <p>In addition, we delivered good franchise growth with a 16% growth in customer lending while maintaining our high credit standards. We opened 1 million new current accounts, we grew our retail savings by 12%, and we saw a double-digit increase in cross sales to corporate customers. So all the hallmarks of this performance you would expect from Lloyds.</p>
          <p>Turning now to HBOS, their performance reflects the higher risk business model, which has proved much more vulnerable during the downturn. They had a good performance in Insurance and the Retail business as Tim mentioned and they opened over 1 million current accounts. However, their results were overshadowed by the increase in impairment charges, the mark-to-market losses, a drop in Retail savings and their inability to access the funding markets during the back half of the year.</p>
          <p>With our recent performances as backdrop, let me now move to the challenges facing the Group in managing HBOS portfolios. I'll start with the economic outlook then I'll talk about asset quality and then briefly touch on capital and funding. When undertaking our analysis of the HBOS acquisition our outlook was somewhat more pessimistic than the consensus at the time, and we forecasted impairments based on that more conservative view. Our central case was a drop of 1.6% in GDP and that was at the bottom end of consensus expectations, which was for a relatively mild reduction of 0.2%. At the time our downside case was well below that of other forecasters.</p>
          <p>However, despite our caution we weren't quite gloomy enough, and our central projection now is for a fall of 2.5%. While there is a wide range of uncertainty around that number, we also factored the downside into our risk assessments and stress scenarios. The consensus is now in line with our central case at our downside. The deteriorating outlook has clearly had an impact on the asset portfolios and impairments. Our expectation is that we will not see economic growth retuning until well into 2010 and the recovery thereafter will be slow. We've also revised down the expected fall in house prices this year from 10% to 15%. And we expect that unemployment will rise throughout the year and consumer spending will reduce by more than 2%.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the loan portfolios. The total Group customer lending amounts to some 717 billion. The Lloyds TSB customer lending portfolios of 243 billion are well known to you and are behaving within our expectations given the economic environment. So let me now focus on the HBOS portfolios. Across the three key lending divisions we have about 432 billion of customer lending. In reviewing the portfolios we applied the Lloyds credit criteria to gauge how much of the portfolio would fall within and outside the Lloyds risk appetite.</p>
          <p>As you can see we believe about 165 billion of the HBOS portfolio falls outside the Lloyds risk appetite leaving 60% or 265 billion that falls within. We expect that 265 billion to behave like the Lloyds book. I'm not by any means suggesting that it's bullet proof, but it will behave like the more conservative Lloyds portfolio. Then taking the assets that didn't meet the Lloyds risk appetite; we identified the higher risk assets shown here in the bottom row. The higher risk loans constitute 80 billion or 18% of the total portfolio, which we arrived at through a rigorous application of portfolio-specific criteria. I would remind you that a substantial part of the higher risk book is secured so the losses in this book will be somewhat mitigated.</p>
          <p>Let me go through each of the divisional portfolios, starting first with Retail. In Retail, we believe the unsecured and prime mortgage books will behave just about the same as Lloyds. Of the nonprime mortgage book, we've identified 31 billion of higher risk assets where we classified all nonprime loans with greater than 90% indexed loan to value ratio or anything three months or more in arrears as high risk. As a result of this conservative view, we're treating as higher risk, 46% at the buy-to-let portfolio, 39% at the self-certified portfolio, 100% of the subprime portfolio and all of the so-called mortgage plus product. These are very high percentages. This indicates that the portfolio was not good at origination and that we have used very conservative criteria in assessing them.</p>
          <p>We have a detailed set of actions that we're taking to address these areas. We've revised the new business criteria to stop the higher risk new business from coming in. We're running the HBOS portfolios through our own models and that highlights the immediate problem areas. We have 1,900 staff assisting customers who were in arrears and are increasing that number by 20% in 2009. We've assigned specialist collection teams to manage these portfolios.</p>
          <p>Corporate is a portfolio where you probably have the most concerns. We took a similar approach here. We identified all lending that is outside of our risk appetite. For example, the entire JV and integrated finance portfolios. We then took a second cut and identified 40 billion of higher risk loans in corporate where we have lending that would be on the Lloyds watch list, for example, those at risk of breaching covenants. This highlighted 31% of the real estate portfolio, 57% of the joint ventures and 35% of the commercial lending and so on. These are high percentages. But we are being deliberately cautious. Again, we have a set of specific actions lined up against each of these assets.</p>
          <p>In the first six weeks, we completed a detailed review of the larger and more doubtful exposures. The whole book is subject to ongoing reviews. We're isolating the bad books in each business to provide the necessary focus with separate management and reporting. We're using the workout skills that we've successfully developed in Lloyds over the years. We have 240 dedicated staff within Lloyds with 4,000 years of experience and many have worked through the last two recessions. We will triple that number to 800 people in 2009 to manage the bad book.</p>
          <p>We've undertaken a similar approach in International. These portfolios are smaller and while we have concerns, we initially prioritized our resources against the major portfolios. But we have taken the same set of corrective actions in International. To sum up, within the divisions, we stopped the flows of the higher risk business coming in. We've completed the first task review of the portfolios to prioritize our actions. And we're now going back for more detailed reviews and we're significantly gearing up our workout teams.</p>
          <p>Concurrently, a Group setter we're putting in place the Lloyds risk appetite and sanctioning processes. The center provides an independent view of the state of the portfolio, which gives us the appropriate checks and balances. Carol Sergeant, whom you all know well, is the Chief Risk Director for the combined Group. And she is ensuring that we have full alignment of governance processes and strict adherence to the risk limits. She reports to the Risk Oversight Committee of the Board as well as to me.</p>
          <p>The HBOS central functions were apparently not strong enough to govern their federated model. That will not be the case with the new Group. Over the next few years we will work our way through the problem portfolio. We're permitting only new lending within our risk appetite and this will result in a lower risk, less volatile growth that you've come to expect from us. I don't want to repeat what Tim has already talked about in terms of capital and funding, but I did want to touch on each of them, as they are critical. As Tim showed you, we have a robust capital position. Our core Tier 1 ratio is 6.4% well within our stated range. And we have a comparable ratio. Tim claimed 7.7% and he is probably right. I think I have 7.6% on the slide, which is the comparable figure to other banks. As you would expect we'll maintain all of our ratios above the regulatory standards.</p>
          <p>We also expect our capital strength to improve as we realize the earnings potential within the new Group. We also have a good funding position and enjoy a broad funding base. We have a leading share in current accounts and retail deposits, which give us strong stability and we do see the opportunity to increase the business sector deposits. We have a pricing advantage in the capital markets. Since day one, we've enjoyed a 35 basis point advantage relative to peers at the long end of the market. We've recently taken the opportunity to extend our maturity profile. We expect to maintain our credit ratings in AA range. So we can pace our lending to match our funding risk and capital parameters as we move HBOS to the Lloyds TSB model.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to how we'll drive the combined business to create value. The new Group will drive value in four ways. First, we have leadership positions in the most attractive parts of the UK market, where it's possible to build strong customer relations and generate sustained low risk earnings growth. Second, we're combing two efficient organizations and generating significant cost synergies. This will make us a leader on costs and will enable us to compete extremely effectively. Third, across the Group, we can combine some very strong capabilities in relationship building and in driving sales. We believe this will generate material revenue uplifts as we exploit those capabilities across the much enlarged franchise. Finally, the Group will generate substantial amounts of capital in the medium term as we re-deploy resources away from non-core riskier activities.</p>
          <p>We calculate that over 40% of our capital is currently tied up in non-core high-risk businesses. As that is released, it can be used to generate much better returns for our shareholders. Although, I'm speaking about where the Group will be over the next several years, we're already making substantial progress. The executive team and the Managing Directors were in place ahead of time so that on day one, they were accountable for in managing the combined business. Since then we've selected the next layer of management and we now have the top 500 senior managers in place.</p>
          <p>When we launched on 19th of January, we had all the appropriate performance, all the appropriate governance processes in place including credit sanctioning and we set out the Group values and missions to all staff that day. We've taken the opportunity to put in place a more effective organization. There will be only eight layers in the organization, and we will have an average span of eight direct reports per manager. We're assigning goals on a balanced scorecard basis including economic profit for all businesses.</p>
          <p>As we learned more about the HBOS business, we've been able to improve our synergy targets and we expect more than 1.5 billion or 14% of the combined cost base to be realized in synergies. We have 61 programs underway and the top five initiatives account for 75% of the 2009 benefits and 55% of the 2011 run rate. As an example, procurement offers are major opportunity to drive savings across the enlarged Group. In Lloyds, we achieved 205 million cost savings, a 10% reduction on the eligible universe of about &#xA3;2 billion. The new Group has effectively doubled our addressable expenditure and we expect to deliver 300 million of cost savings. We have a strong pipeline of savings and have delivered significant results in the first six weeks of the newly formed Group. We haven't talked to you about revenue synergies previously, as they didn't make up a part of our financial case for the deal.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I fully appreciate that revenue synergies are not valued until they're delivered, but I did want to share with you the approach that we're using and the potential size of the prize of some of these projects. We've identified a series of major programs and I've listed several examples on this slide. The first opportunity is to drive the Lloyds relationship focus into the HBOS network. As we've shown you over the past several reporting periods, Lloyds has been very successful at deepening relationships and increasing cross-sell. The proportion of Lloyds customers holding three or more banking products is nearly twice that of the HBOS and we estimate that raising the HBOS penetration to the Lloyds levels is worth between 80 to 120 million of additional annual profit.</p>
          <p>A second opportunity is to achieve the same level of SME referrals from retail customers. In recent years, Lloyds has consistently been the market leader in new business startups based on our approach of generating referrals from the branches, and we believe that we can achieve similar results from HBOS. Estimate suggests this could be worth around &#xA3;100 million. I'll talk to you about these opportunities in future meetings. The opportunities are real and potentially very significant. The new Group has a powerful opportunity to create value. We've taken a core and non-core split of the Group. The core businesses are those that fit our relationship bank model and conform to our risk appetite. We will nurture and grow these businesses going forward.</p>
          <p>Non-core businesses are those, which do not fit our relationship model and appetite and have unsustainable revenues or use a disproportionate amount of capital. The chart uses actual 2008 results to demonstrate what the Lloyds Banking Group would look like if you stripped out the non-core businesses. On a continuing basis, excluding market dislocation, the pro forma Group revenues in 2008 were 21.6 billion. Stripping out the revenues of the non-core businesses leaves us core revenues of approximately 19 billion.</p>
          <p>The non-core businesses contributed just 10% to the 2008 Group income but used 45.7% of the Group's capital. If you deduct the operating expenses and impairments associated with the core business, this leaves a core business profit of some 6.5 billion. We have the opportunity to substantially grow that profit in the core businesses over time as the core markets recover, as we deliver on the cost synergies and recapture the revenue synergies, as we deploy the 45% of capital supporting the non-core businesses and we benefit from more normalized levels of impairment as we run down the higher risk portfolios.</p>
          <p>The Group has very significant earnings potential as we drive the strategy forward. In closing, I'd remind you of our key messages. I fully appreciate the huge concern of what we've actually bought. I hope that Tim's slides have helped you understand the numbers in some detail. With my presentation, I hope you share our belief that we have a thorough understanding of the issues and we're addressing them sharply. We have an experienced management team that has been built over the years. They have a strong and proven track record and know how to work together to build a business. We believe we will create significant value from the franchise. We will realize the major cost opportunity. We believe that we can generate substantial additional revenue and as we work down the bad portfolio, the strength and growth of the core earnings will create a terrific shareholder value. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's John-Paul Crutchley from UBS. I want to ask a question maybe for Tim or maybe even <mark type="inaudible" /> about margins actually. And I guess, clearly, it's a difficult competitive environment for margins given what's happening in terms of deposit spreads right now. But relative to other UK banks, you're slightly unusual in that you have a much greater mortgage portfolio relative to your deposits than the competition. And that's, I guess, one area which is repricing with some time lags coming through. I just wondered if you can comment on how you see that playing out and in particular whether you see any differences between the legacy HBOS portfolio relative to the legacy Lloyds portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, John-Paul. The cocktail is quite difficult to predict in how margins are going to perform going forward. We haven't put out today any forward-looking statements on margin, but let me just walk through some of the ingredients, if I may. Clearly, base rates are at their current levels causing some pressure on margins, also putting pressure on margins are funding costs. I would, however, flag that both the heritage Lloyds and HBOS businesses have to a degree had those pressures, certainly the funding cost pressure, during 2008. And each business through a variety of pricing activities as well as pricing any new business appropriately for the full cost of funds has been able to actually achieve margin stability during 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2009 that will be more of a challenge as we will clearly have more of the year operating at the very low base rates that came into effect during the last quarter. So it's a difficult one to predict but I would just say that the businesses have worked very hard on repricing and taking advantage of new business opportunities and making sure they are appropriately priced for the cost of funding and appropriate pricing for risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add on to that, I think one of the encouraging things is that for a good long time, we've been talking about risk not being priced appropriately, whether it's liquidity risk, funding risk, or credit risk. And I think that with this correction in the markets, we are seeing now appropriately priced pricing for risk, something that we have not seen for quite a while, so that's an encouraging sign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Thanks. Next question. Thanks Well, the woman in front I was going to do, but next one, I promise.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Toeman from HSBC. The fair value adjustment on assets, particularly lending, enables you to sort of write down the value of some 10 billion of corporate and retail loans. I mean, to what extent has that write-down made you feel more confident about future impairments going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the accounting fair value exercise has a number of elements to it. One of which, as you rightly say, does regard credit, but it's not so much taking write-downs, it's more about applying at a portfolio level market-based credit default spreads across the different books that make up the HBOS balance sheet. And that's the approach that's been done on both the corporate and the retail books. Another key element of the fair valuing is of course that you update your carrying values to reflect current interest rates. And clearly that has more effect, much more effect on a fixed rate book than it does anything that's bearing a variable price. So to that extent the fair value work is somewhat separate from the impairment exercise, which is clearly done at a transaction-by-transaction level where you look at the expected realizable net present value using current interest rates over any situation where you've had an impairment event.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. It's Ian Smillie from RBS. Two questions please. The first one follows up on Peter's. Of the 15 billion fair value asset reduction that you've taken, Tim, could you quantify how much of that relates explicitly to credit and how much of it relates to the other issues that you just mentioned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ian. That's not actually separated out in the book. But what we've seen since the initial exercise was undertaken in the autumn that clearly there has been a larger adjustment for the credit aspect of it, but also where interest rates have moved, that has given also a larger adjustment. So the two have roughly offset in how it's moved since the autumn, but I haven't split them out in the book. I'll have a chat with you afterwards if you like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The second question &#x2013; thank you for the pre-impairment pro forma number that you gave us for the Group, I think &#xA3;11 billion. Could you give us some sense as how that's split first half, second half of last year because it's important to understand the current trends that the Group is delivering?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, morning. This is Sandy Chen, Panmure Gordon. Thanks very much for the disclosure on sort of the core, non-core view as well. I think that was very much appreciated. What I'd like to do is kind of put that together with probably an announcement you would have liked to make on the government asset protection scheme as well. I mean, putting the sort of non-core bits together, maybe the 165 billion of non-Lloyds qualifying HBOS exposures and 56 billion of asset backed securities, you kind of get to 200, 250 billion that's been reported in the press for assets that you might want to put into the asset-backed as a protection scheme.</p>
          <p>If that's the case &#x2013; and I realize that you can't really comment on any of this &#x2013; is it a good way to think about the potential risk-weighted asset uplift or reduction that you might get in the capital uplift? And also, wouldn't that imply given that you've clearly signaled that you are &#x2013; there's a lot of incentive to ditch the non-core assets, that you might be willing to pay more for your asset protection scheme in order to eliminate the fat-tail risk?</p>

          <p>Hello, Sandy. Good morning. It was a wonderful question and wonderfully framed, and one that I can't answer. So thank you for the question, but as we said this morning, that we're well engaged, and talks are progressing with the government, but that's about as far as I can go.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. It's Jonathan Pierce from Credit Suisse. I've got one for Tim and then probably one for Eric if that's okay. Coming back to fair value adjustments, there was no axis obviously put on the spread of the unwind, but I think we can roughly back out that we must be talking about two to three years for the debit to unwind and three to four on the credit. Would that be about right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, good morning. The chart was purely illustrative. I would encourage you not to read anything into it. What I do expect is I expect a net unwind in 2009 of about &#xA3;2 billion on a pre-tax basis as a credit to income. So I wouldn't read anything into the axes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Is the &#x2013; and then your comment about Group profits in 2009 or actually being losses, is that after the credits as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. The second question is about the longer-term plans with regard to your loan to deposit ratio, because at the Group level with HBOS, it's gone up to about 175%, which is pretty similar to where HBOS itself was at the interim stage of last year. RBS yesterday was indicating they would be looking to take those back down towards 100% over maybe a three- to five-year period. So I'm interested in your longer-term thoughts on that ratio and whether you think it will hold back loan growth aspirations in the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Jonathan. We have not published any kinds of targets on returns or key ratios. But what I would tell you is that very clearly what we're seeing is in the combined Group a relatively conservative Lloyds portfolio, which is the smaller portfolio, and then the larger HBOS portfolio, which I spent some time talking about, as did Tim. We clearly think that the current ratio is unacceptable, that it is the result of a very vulnerable, high-risk portfolio reacting to a very bad economy.</p>
          <p>So we expect a couple of things. One is we've stopped the new flow coming in. That's clear. We have workout specialists who have identified and are now working down the bad portfolio. It will decline over time. And we would expect more normal economic environment and more normal economic environment to return. So I think that in terms of guidance what I'd tell you is if you look at the old Lloyds TSB and the kind of asset quality that we generated year in, year out that would be where I would expect to guide the Group.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Derek Chambers from Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. Can I ask questions in two areas? One is presumably if you do get some settlement on the asset protection scheme you might have to agree to some incremental aspirations for lending and you have set out the areas where you're going to contract. And I wonder if you could perhaps indicate what would be the benchmark levels of growth in the continuing business against any incremental promises would be given as far as particularly in the mortgage and SME areas? And perhaps as a supplement to that could you say whether the agreement you struck last year to take on extra business from Northern Rock is still of any relevance to you? Then as a second area, the business you're creating, the franchise there is clearly heavily dependent on the customer service and customer satisfaction and metrics monitoring that will be very important. I just wonder if you could say anything about, how you see the business you've taken over in HBOS and also how you &#x2013; how that's performing against Lloyds Banking Group and what Lloyds Banking Group will do in future there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, will you tell him?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd be happy to. In terms of the first part, I'm afraid I can't really give you much guidance in terms of lending commitments and how they would fit into a potential commitment under the asset protection scheme. Again, I think I've said just about all that I can say there. Your question on Northern Rock was, is the referral scheme still viable. Is that the question? What I think we would have found and I want to be a little bit careful with my words here is that while this was potentially a valuable source or could have been a valuable source, we did have in fact differences in credit quality and differences in credit criteria. So it probably was not as robust as we would have hoped for. That said, I think that we were very successful in capturing a very large share of the market last year. Lloyds alone, without HBOS, had something like about 30% of the net mortgage lending in the market. As you know, this was lending that were adhered to all of our very high credit standards, it's a prime book. I think our average new loan to value ratio was in the low 60s on that book last year. So, origination is not a problem for us. You also asked about customer satisfaction and the role that it plays within the enlarged Group. Very clearly we have implemented the balanced scorecard part across the new Group.</p>
          <p>If you recall the balanced scorecard has five sections, I won't rehearse them here. But it's critical that we measure each business unit, each manager and I get measured by the Board on those same five criteria, which leads to well balanced healthy growth based on an economic profit discipline. Customer service and customer satisfaction are a very key part of how we build a long-term high quality stream of earnings. So it is one of those things where a manager who produces brilliant financial results, but has poor customer results will not in fact be rewarded. This is something where obviously the manager is doing something in a short-term, but not building long-term value for the franchise. And so that's how we will continue to measure and manage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. It's Leigh Goodwin for Fox-Pitt Kelton. I've just got a couple of questions on the balance sheet, if I may, and then a couple on risk. Just on the balance sheet, if you can confirm, I mean none of these might be a sensitive issue, but can you confirm what the combined Group's UK tax credits are as at the end of 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve I haven't got that information with me on the table. You'll find that disclosure in our reported accounts where there's analysis of any tax balances that are carried forward when their reporting accounts is published in a few weeks time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was thinking, just looking at 2008 and the HBOS tax credits run about 2, sorry, 3.5 billion, would that be a long way out if I was to assume that might be the sort of figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The numbers will be in the report and accounts. But you can see them within the news release the tax adjustments sort of being taken within each of the heritage Lloyds and heritage HBOS numbers. Just be careful because you don't know what's in the balance sheet before you apply that credit there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Agreed. That's why I asked the question. Just another one of the balance sheet, just on the pension deficit, it seems as if the Lloyds pension deficit increased, HBOS came down. And I just wondered whether that's because of different methodologies whether it's the same methodology and therefore this is absolutely fine. I suppose the more important question is, how should we think about the pension deficits and the way in which you're going to close that deficit over the years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The movements in the deficit and accounts are following fairly similar IAS 19 assumptions. So there is nothing untoward in the slightly opposite movements that are seen in there, that's down to partly down to the different asset mix that's in the two schemes and how the different asset mixes have performed. In terms of how we'd close that over time, I mean we're currently &#x2013; both schemes are in discussions with trustees about reevaluations that are going on. You're probably aware that the Lloyds scheme revaluation three years ago actually resulted in, what I call, a deficit ratification program of agreed payments with the trustees and that has continued and still continues today. I'm not expecting the valuation work to be completed for some months yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Then just on risk. Just on the mortgage side, on house price inflation, I mean you've given us your estimate today of 15% decline this year or at least that's where your planning assumption is and I suppose there's two parts of my question. One is what proportion of your book will effectively be in negative equity where we to see 15%? In the past HBOS has given us sort of breakdown by LTV band, which has enabled us to do the calculation and you are at 16 or 17% already, so I would be interested to know where that will go to. And secondly, also in the past, Tim, you've sort of helpfully guided us as to how impairments might change as a consequence of HPI movements and I wonder whether you could just guide us for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. I was trying to give the loan to value split on page 27 of my pack. There was a lot of data on that because what I really wanted to do was draw out the relatively modest amounts of values that are over 100. So it is tranched there in the 80 to 90 and 90 to 100 to help you with that. I guess your follow-up question, which I won't answer, will be that we're guiding to house price move that's halfway between the bands. So I'll save you asking the question.</p>
          <p>In terms of what that turns into in terms of impairments, we're not giving guidance on the impairment impact of that at the moment, because I think the main driver of what happens in 2009 is actually going to be what happens on unemployment, because what happens in unemployment will be what feeds into whether people are seeing arrears on their mortgages, and clearly if you don't have an arrears event on a mortgage, you don't need an impairment provision whatever is going on with house prices.</p>
          <p>So I think it's too difficult to call 2009 at the moment. We've previously guided at a half in advance on 2008, and I'm not giving any guidance on '09 impairment values today, sorry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Good morning. It's Tom Rayner from Citigroup here. And could I just ask you, Tim, on your guidance for low teens RWA growth in 2009. I'm assuming that ignores any potential asset protection scheme impact. But could I ask you whether that does include the switch from point in time to through the cycle approach by the FSA?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly the &#x2013; as we haven't concluded discussions or negotiations with the governments on the APS, clearly my guidance can't take account of something that hasn't happened. So, yes, it is before that, before any benefit from that. Tom, sorry, what was the second part of your question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just &#x2013; on the slide it said it was mainly pro-cyclicality, whether the switch to through the cycle has been accounted for or not in that guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, already the majority of the book is already accounted for on a &#x2013; or the mortgage book, Tom, is already accounted for, on a through-the-cycle basis using the scalars approach that the FSA set out in October 2007.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. I've got three unrelated questions. Firstly on balance sheet risk, I think you highlight that you've got about 58 billion of mortgages with LTV greater than 100%. There's 100 billion of commercial real estate assets and 20 billion of equity exposure and leverage finance. I was just wondering if you could tell me how much of the combined pool has actually already got a cover from the fair value adjustment that you've made, and also the combined balance sheet provision. So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is relating to the impact of fallen interest rates on your margin. I appreciate that there is a hell of a lot of moving parts in terms of asset spreads re-pricing and things like that, but I was just wondering if you could isolate the impact of fallen interest rates on your net interest income, because clearly &#x2013; I'd be amazed if that's not something that you've planned out in terms planning.</p>
          <p>And also just point three is on life insurance capital. Clearly there's been hell of a lot of focus throughout the market on other life insurers. You've got two very big life insurance companies, so I was just wondering if you could give me a comment on your perception of the strength of those two given the fall in market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Can I take them in turn? In terms of the overlap or the coverage allowed for within the fair value exercise on the portfolios that you've referenced, I mean obviously there is a degree of coverage. But I would caution you to look at the two exercises as somewhat separate. When one takes a fair value adjustment against any particular asset on the balance sheet, then you are creating an adjustment, which by definition and by accounting rules will unwind over time. And it will unwind over the contractual or behavioral if shorter useful life of the underlying asset or liability. And clearly it will be replaced by whatever impairments will come from that asset over time. So the impairments that come will come through the impairment line. The unwind to the fair value adjustment will actually go through income. So it'll create a slightly odd texture to the shape of the income statement going forward.</p>
          <p>But in terms of quantum then obviously it's built into the 15 billion pre-tax adjustment that was shown on the earlier one of my slides. But I appreciate that is net of the interest rate benefit. Clearly you do only get an interest rate benefit where you are dealing with fixed price book. So any of those that have got a variable pricing you're looking at a one-sided fair value adjustment, which means that one gets a disproportionate contribution into that 15 from the credit default aspects of looking at fair value.</p>
          <p>In terms of net interest margins going forward, yeah, I mean, as I gave in the answer to J-P's first question, we only have seen the last quarter, or the last couple of months in 2008 being a period in which we've been operating with very low base rates. So we are expecting there to be some margin squeeze during 2009 arising from the current base rate environment. Notwithstanding that of course, we've been pricing business to reflect the true cost of funds in order to protect income and protect margins in both of the heritage Groups, and each Group was able to achieve margin stability on the Lloyds side and margin stability bar 3 bps on the HBOS side. That will clearly be much more challenging during 2009, but I'm not going to sit here today, I'm sorry, and give you any guidance as to what I expect the impact of that to be. I think that's just too difficult to call from a public platform at this time.</p>
          <p>Your third point, Mike, was on life capital, and I'm pretty sure there's tremendous amount of detail been published in the two new releases that have gone out today. But we're very happy with the level of capital that's held in each of the two life and pensions groups that are parts of Lloyds Banking Group. Each of them is very strongly capitalized, got good working capital ratios and don't at this moment cause me any cause for concern.</p>

          <p>Robert Law of Nomura. During your presentation, you highlighted quite a lot of workout or problem assets in the HBOS businesses. Could you comment on your comfort level of the reserving or provisioning balances held against those assets, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Robert, hi. We're comfortable that in the December 2008 balance sheet of HBOS we've got the right level of coverage that's required to cover assets in there whether they're in what we would call the category needing workout, whether in high risk, whether impaired, whether on a watch list. The work that's been going on by the HBOS team and then working jointly with the Lloyds TSB team since the 16th of January when completion took place has left us with a high degree of comfort that the balance sheet at the end of December has got the right amount of provisions in it.</p>

          <p>Following up from Tom's questions on the risk-weighted asset growth in 2009, just putting it in a different way, how much of the low teens growth do you expect to come from say your 139 billion treasuries portfolios, how much is from the rating migrations versus how much is from the underlying loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't provided any further breakdown in guidance on where the growth is going to come from. I would just remind you, I think I mentioned in my voice over that there's a fair degree of pro-cyclicality still to come through in 2009, and that is incorporated within that low teens guidance on risk-weighted assets, but I haven't broken it down by portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So essentially anything that was, say, AAA at the end of 2008 in your forecast would you be still assuming to be a AAA rated asset at the end of 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, not necessarily. That's not what I said. I'm not giving any particular guidance on any particular asset class or its credit rating or whatever. We have proven ourselves to be very effective at managing our risk-weighted asset growth in both the Lloyds side during 2009, and actually within the HBOS franchise as well, although the drivers behind risk-weighted asset management were clearly different in the two organizations.</p>

          <p>Good morning, this is Simon Willis from NCB. Just one quick question if I could. You've, very helpfully I think, given us some planning estimates from back in the autumn on GDP growth, and you've also helpfully given us your outlook for the housing market for this year, whilst not giving us the guidance that you gave us previously on the impact on impairments. But could I ask what your current planning assumption is for unemployment in the UK given the relevance to not just the mortgage book, but also the cards and unsecured personal book?</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Steve Hain from Morgan Stanley. I'm sorry just touching again on the mortgage book, I mean you are the UK's largest mortgage lender and looking at the statistics on as you say slide 27, it is quite shocking. I know we keep talking about the amounts over 100%. But if we take the amounts over 80% loan to value, I mean more than 40% of your prime book, more than 50% of the buy-to-let, more than 60% of the specialist book is over 80% LTVs. And on your own assumptions of house prices falling 15% and all the features indication down maybe 20%, I mean being the UK's largest mortgage lender with that book with cover that's 13% in Lloyds and 18% in HBOS and I admire the fact that you've increased that. But I'm wondering whether that changes your thinking about probability default and loss given default as we move through '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; Steven thanks for the question. I think in looking at the mortgage portfolio, I think it's very important to remember the types of criteria that would have been taken into account when original loan was advanced. And clearly an LTV ratio is something that we talk about and most banks talk about and report and analyze publicly. But remember also that the Lloyds book in particular across the prime and the buy-to-let book has actually built up some very, very prudent lending criteria. But don't just look at LTV, but also look at income multiples and affordability.</p>
          <p>And we've got a track record of being exceedingly responsible lender. And therefore, we would &#x2013; there is a degree therefore of comfort irrespective of where a loan to value goes about the Englishman's home is his castle, he won't want to give it up unless he absolutely really has to. And that's why in response to the earlier question, I actually said that one of the key things here is unemployment, rather than particularly just focusing on loan to values and therefore surmising that there's a bigger issue than might actually be.</p>
