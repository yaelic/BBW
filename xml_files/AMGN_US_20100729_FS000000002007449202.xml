          <p>My name is Christian, and I will be the conference facilitator today for Amgen's Second Quarter 2010 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.</p>
          <p>There will be a question and answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers' prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we ask that you please limit yourselves to asking one question during the Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our second quarterly results conference call. Another solid quarter behind us as we embark on the second half of this year. It's also been a year of tremendous change, as many of the uncertainties weighing on our business have now been resolved.</p>
          <p>To discuss these issues in greater detail, as well as to introduce the many changes we have had on our leadership team, I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO Kevin Sharer. Following Kevin, our acting CFO Michael Kelly will provide additional details on our second quarter financial performance. Bob Bradway, our newly appointed President and Chief Operating Officer, will then articulate his charter for our company's operations, followed by Jim Daly. Jim is our Senior Vice President of North American Commercial Operations, and he will focus on three main topics. First, our product performance during the quarter. Second, an early read on the Prolia launch, and lastly, our perspective on the recent final rule for the bundled payment system for dialysis patients. Our Head of R&amp;D, Roger Perlmutter will conclude our prepared comments by providing an R&amp;D update.</p>
          <p>We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement. What it says in summary is that through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results could vary materially.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased that we delivered a solid quarter. Our base business continues to perform well, both financially and operationally. Internationally we're competing effectively &#x2013; continuing to compete effectively against biosimilars, and we're seeing growth through new markets and products. Research and development, as Roger will report and you've probably concluded, is firing on all cylinders, and we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to look forward to. And I'd also like to take this moment to thank all of the Amgen staff who are listening and others for all the work you've done this year to make a difference for patients and to deliver value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As Arvind commented, we've had quite a number of significant events this year. And before I make specific comments, I'd like to recognize some of those events, put them in context, and give you my perspective on them. Just six short months ago, we were uncertain about whether healthcare reform would happen, and if it happened what might be the effect on us, both financially and in a public policy sense. The progress of Prolia on osteoporosis around the world and denosumab in cancer were not nearly so clear, as they are now. A number of ESA franchise questions were outstanding, important questions that we have much more information on now. And finally, we saw Europe as a region go through &#x2013; to a degree still go through &#x2013; some very significant economic uncertainties with some impact in some countries on the biopharmaceuticals space.</p>
          <p>And I think my summary comment is from Amgen's point of view, each one of these major questions of, say, six months ago have been answered in ways that are either within our expectation or in some cases even better. So sitting here now six months later, I feel proud of what we've done, and very confident about the future.</p>
          <p>Let me talk first about healthcare reform. We'll talk more specifically later, but I think healthcare reform has been internalized by us. We can handle it economically, and we are delighted with the public policy rules that have come about with respect to biosimilars. And I'll let Jim later on talk a bit, and Michael, about the economics, but we can handle them.</p>
          <p>Let's talk a little bit about denosumab and Prolia. We were particularly pleased to receive Prolia's approvals in both the U.S. and the EU in the second quarter, a very, very major milestone we've worked 15 years to achieve. And while it's still early days from a commercial point of view, the launches are progressing both in Europe and the United States as we had planned. Jim will talk about it, but a few highlights. The initial feedback from physicians has been positive, and with GSK, we have a strong partner in the rest of the world. So I'm feeling optimistic, based on where we are today. Jim Daley will give you more input and information about Prolia with a bit of a focus on the U.S. in a moment.</p>
          <p>Recently, as you know, the FDA granted priority review designation to denosumab for the reduction of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced cancer. Priority review designation is granted to drugs that offer potential for major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. So this is a real testament to the data generated in our SRE studies where we compared ourselves to the market leader or the current standard of care.</p>
          <p>Also at the beginning of 2010, there were a number of uncertainties that related to our ESA business. And today, many of these, if not all of these, issues have been addressed, if not resolved. Just to mention a few, the ESA REMS has been finalized; enrollment is under way, and we feel positive about the state of that business. CMS held a MEDCAC meeting on ESAs in nephrology. And we felt that that was a productive discussion. We've all seen the top line Hematide data, and we'll continue to watch its development. The final dialysis bundling rule is now out. We believe it is within our expectations and recognizes the importance of delivering quality care to patients. Roger will have more to say about this. Overall, we have a lot more clarity as we think about the future of the ESA business and look forward to discussing the TREAT study in more detail at an advisory committee meeting later this year.</p>
          <p>The pipeline is the driver of future growth, and ours continues to deliver. We had a good ASCO last month with much interest in our pipeline, and the progress continues. We're moving two of our oncology molecules, AMG 479 and 386, in important tumor types into Phase III. Roger will comment. As you know, we look forward to the more pivotal data yet this year, including the denosumab bone mass prevention data. Roger will discuss this as well.</p>
          <p>I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on some of the management changes that have recently happened. Companies evolve, managements change, and strong companies replace strong management with new strong management. I believe we have done that.</p>
          <p>Before I comment specifically, I'd like to recognize someone who is making an appearance today on the call, Michael Kelly. Michael Kelly is a distinguished and experienced financial executive who's been our acting CFO for a number of months, and I'd like to recognize his contribution and partnership. Michael, thank you.</p>
          <p>Here are some leadership changes that we have announced, and I'll comment. Bob Bradway was recently appointed our President and Chief Operating Officer. Bob's leadership and experience make him the right person for this important position. We recently announced we would be replacing Bob as permanent CFO with Jonathan Peacock. Jonathan will join us later this summer, and he brings a set of skills and international experience that will be critical as we implement our international expansion strategy.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to comment on George Morrow. It's hard to put into words what George has meant for this company for the past 10 years. He's been one of our key leaders. He's been one of my key partners. He delivered for shareholders. He delivered for patients. And he built a very strong management team. In fact, two of the folks who reported to him are moving up in the organization. Rolf Hoffmann has run International, and Jim Daley North America. You'll hear later from Jim today as he discusses the results. We have much to thank George for, and I here publicly want to acknowledge that. George will be with us until early next year, and I want to assure everyone on this call that we continue to benefit from George's advice and perspective, and he remains integral to us.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the year, as it is every year, delivering financially, making our products, particularly, Prolia's success, advancing the pipeline, expanding internationally, and creating value for our shareholders will remain our key priorities.</p>
          <p>I'd like to now turn the call over to Michael Kelly, who will discuss our quarterly performance in more detail. Michael, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kevin.</p>
          <p>On page 5, I'll take you through the adjusted P&amp;L for the quarter. Year-over-year revenues were up 2% in the second quarter to 3.8 billion. In terms of geography, our U.S. sales decreased 2% to 2.8 billion for the quarter. Excluding Aranesp, which was down again this quarter, U.S. sales were up 1% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>With respect to wholesale inventory levels, we exited the quarter in the U.S. with overall wholesaler inventory at the mid to low end of normal ranges. Second quarter U.S. revenues include a 45 million accrual for certain healthcare reform legislation provisions that were in effect during the quarter, partially offset by a 9 million favorable adjustment related to changes in accounting estimates with respect to accruals for U.S. healthcare reform recorded in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Recall in the first quarter we said that we expect the full-year 2010 impact of healthcare reform to be in the range of 200 to 250 million. And that estimate remains unchanged. Jim will speak in some detail in a moment on the topic of healthcare reform and its continued impact on our business.</p>
          <p>Shifting now to our international business, we posted sales of 826 million, an increase of 3% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted second quarter sales by 11 million. Without that benefit, international sales were up 2% year over year. I will have more to say about foreign exchange in a moment. I also want to note that revenues in the second quarter of 2010 benefited from milestone payments associated with certain ongoing collaborations. Revenues reflect milestone payments from GlaxoSmithKline for approval and launch of Prolia in Europe and from Takeda for the approval of Vectibix in Japan.</p>
          <p>Turning now to operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were up 4% this quarter versus last year. Our cost of sales margin increased 0.7%, primarily driven by higher bulk material cost and less favorable product mix. This increase was partially offset by lower royalties and lower excess capacity charges. R&amp;D expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by the 50 million payment in the second quarter of 2009 to obtain an exclusive license from Cytokinetics, partially offset by lower expense recoveries associated with ongoing collaborations in higher staff-related costs. We continue to expect R&amp;D expenses to increase in the second half of the year, consistent with our spending patterns in prior years.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expenses increased 9% versus the same quarter last year. This increase includes higher staff-related costs and spending for activities in anticipation of the approval of Prolia. We expect SG&amp;A expenditures to increase in the second half of the year, primarily driven by Prolia-related activities. Recall that in the second quarter 2009, our Prolia sales force was not yet hired. In addition, SG&amp;A expenses were higher in Q2 2010 due to higher litigation expenses and higher staff-related costs, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share and expense recoveries associated with the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration agreement for Prolia. Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses in the second quarter 2010 increased 14% versus the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20%, compared to 18.1% in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the federal R&amp;D tax credit in the second quarter 2009 and changes in profits associated with our Puerto Rico operations in the second quarter 2010 versus the second quarter 2009. Q1 2010 adjusted earnings per share were $1.38, up 7% versus prior year. And our GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.25, unchanged from the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the balance sheet on page 6. You should note we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow. Let me spend a moment to discuss some key balance sheet items. Our Q2 2010 ending global cash balance was 14.5 billion. We ended the quarter with 12.2 billion of debt. Our adjusted stockholders equity increased by 2 billion year-over-year to 22.9 billion. With respect to our cash flow, we generated approximately 1.6 billion of cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2010, which is down slightly year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures for the second quarter were 177 million. We repurchased approximately 10 million of shares during the second quarter of 2010 at a cost of 600 million, bringing our cumulative share repurchases for 2010 to 39 million shares at a cost of 2.3 billion. We had 3.7 billion remaining under our board-authorized stock repurchase program as of June 30, 2010.</p>
          <p>Next, our updated guidance is on page 7. When we updated our revenue guidance in the first quarter, the prevailing dollar-euro spot rate was in the high 1.30s per euro. The exchange rate has been in the mid to high 1.20s per euro over the past several week. As you know, the majority of our foreign revenue is denominated in euros. Adjusting for the impact of the weaker euro, we now expect revenue to be slightly below 15.1 billion. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at current spot levels for the second half of the year. Our guidance continues to reflect the expected impact from healthcare reform of 200 to $250 million.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that we do not hedge revenues and operating expenses separately. We hedge our net foreign currency exposure over a rolling three-year horizon, with the financial impact of our hedges reflected in the revenue line of the income statement. While foreign exchange volatility could materially impact revenue and operating expense, we do not anticipate any material impact on EPS. Our EPS guidance remains unchanged. We still expect EPS to be towards the lower end of our current guidance range of 5.05 to 5.25. This guidance considers the expected increases in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A in the second half of the year that I alluded to earlier.</p>
          <p>With respect to the tax rate guidance, we continue to expect that our 2010 adjusted tax rate will be in the 20 to 21% range. As a reminder, this guidance assumes that the R&amp;D tax credit will be retroactively extended for all of 2010. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 600 million.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and next to Bob, President and COO, for an operations review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Michael. I'm delighted to have a chance to talk to you today in my new capacity, and it's indeed a privilege to have an opportunity to help build on the foundation of operational success that our company has enjoyed.</p>
          <p>In my new role, I can assure you that we'll be focused on delivery and execution in several areas, including stabilizing and growing our core franchises, that in the face of increased payer and competitor pricing pressures; successfully launching Prolia globally, and here I can report that every sign we see so far confirms what we have believed about the unmet medical need that this therapy addresses, and our operations and commercial teams are right on track at this early stage of the product launch.</p>
          <p>Turning to denosumab for oncology. Obviously, we're excited that our file with the FDA has been granted a priority review, and we will be prepared to bring this important therapy to patients once approvals occur around the globe. Internationally, we remain committed to increasing our global sales footprint through our multi-year expansion initiative, which will increase the number of territories in which we sell our products from the current 46 to approximately 75. We'll remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain through our operational excellence program with the broad objective of continually improving on our efficient and safe supply of medicine to our patients. This area has been a core strength for Amgen, and Fabrizio Bonanni and his team have made great progress in this regard. Finally, we'll continue to look for ways to achieve sustained growth through disciplined capital investing and improving utilization of our facilities.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to provide an overview of our commercial operations during the second quarter. So if you'll turn to page 9. Starting with the year-on-year comparison, our global product sales declined by $21 million or 1%, which was affected by a few key factors. On the down side, our global Aranesp sales declined by $90 million, or 13%, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. And we booked healthcare reform accruals of about $36 million on the quarter. These downsides were partially offset by $69 million in growth across the rest of the global franchise, a 2% growth rate. There was in the quarter an $11 million benefit from foreign exchange, and a U.S. wholesaler inventory benefit of about $18 million.</p>
          <p>Now, I know there's been much discussion about the mandatory price cuts in Europe. So I want to give you some perspective on how it affects us. First, let me remind you that our European sales are about 18% of our worldwide total sales. And we entered the year expecting that the effective price cuts across the international business would be about 3%. That 3% included our expectations for business as usual, payer-mandated price cuts, as well as competitive price cuts related to biosimilars. Now, as a result of the incremental mandatory price actions announced over the past several weeks, we believe the effect on our business internationally this year will be some 4%, or 1 percentage point worse than what we had planned for.</p>
          <p>Sequentially, now turning to global sales, you can see they grew 2% for the quarter, or $85 million, and that was largely driven by seasonal increase in Enbrel demand and aided by, again, a favorable inventory effect. These were partially offset by lower sequential demand for Aranesp and Filgrastim.</p>
          <p>Importantly in the second quarter, we received regulatory approvals for Prolia in key markets and launched our selling effort. In the U.S., we were in the market with product, and our sales force fully trained and deployed as of June 21. In Europe, as you know, we received approval on May 28, and we've already received reimbursement authorization in Germany and expect to receive reimbursement in another handful of countries in Europe over the course of the year. And in the meantime, we're selling into the private insurance markets. We've received regulatory approval in Australia, and we anticipate reimbursement authorization there next year. And so finally, we recorded some $3 million in sales for the quarter for Prolia, which reflects the fact that we had few selling days after the launch.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 10, which graphically illustrates the components of our year-over-year growth in the second quarter for the portfolio. You can see the $90 million decline in Aranesp depicted here in the separate U.S. and international components. Both markets experienced segment decline, reflecting more conservative ESA utilization worldwide. Enbrel also experienced a modest sales decline, largely attributable to a unit demand decline, partially offset by an increase in average net sales price. As you can also see, the newer products, Vectibix and Nplate, are growing nicely and contributed nearly $50 million of growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn it over to Jim Daly, who will discuss each of the product results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.</p>
          <p>Let's go straight to slide 11. Worldwide Aranesp sales declined 13% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 21% year-over-year, while internationally sales were down 5%. The decline in both markets was demand driven, primarily due to segment decline.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 displays actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs are largely a result of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. The red trend lines indicate average weekly sales over the past five quarters. These lines exclude returns and discount accrual true-ups, as well as effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which all serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons shown on the previous slide. As you can see, average weekly sales for Aranesp have declined slightly in the second quarter 2010, reflecting a trend towards more conservative use of ESAs in both oncology and nephrology.</p>
          <p>In late March we launched the oncology REMS, and CMS conducted a MEDCAC meeting on the use of ESAs in the nephrology setting. We cannot rule out a further decline in Aranesp sales as a consequence of these events.</p>
          <p>Filgrastim is next on slide 13. Neulasta/NEUPOGEN combined sales grew 1% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., sales grew 2%, primarily driven by inventory, price, and partially offset by a decline in units. Contributing to the unfavorable unit comparison was the impact of a late first quarter buying by customers to take advantage of favorable contractual terms that expired in late March of this year. Neulasta wholesaler inventory levels exited the second quarter near the midpoint of the normal range, while NEUPOGEN exited second quarter at the low end of the normal range. Internationally, Neulasta/NEUPOGEN increased 1% year-on-year. Neulasta experienced 6% growth for the period, while NEUPOGEN sales declined 9% due to the impact of biosimilars.</p>
          <p>Next is Enbrel on slide 14. Net sales were down 2% in the second quarter year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by market share loss to new competition. Net price growth partially offset our unit decline. On a sequential quarter basis, Enbrel net sales were up 9%. This increase was driven by demand, with growth in both rheumatology and dermatology. Historically both rheumatology and dermatology segments have been impacted by seasonality, with softness typically seen in the first quarter, followed by strength in the second quarter as patients work through their annual deductibles and other insurance changes. In the second quarter 2010, this seasonal pattern has continued. ENBREL maintained its leadership position in both rheumatology and dermatology during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Next is EPOGEN on slide 15. EPOGEN grew by 3% in the second quarter year-over-year, driven by patient growth, wholesaler inventory, and partially offset by a decline in dose. During the year, dose fluctuations may continue as providers refine their treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we'll address the final rule on bundling and dialysis, which goes into effect January 2011. This past Monday, CMS published the final rule. CMS also published concurrently the ESRD Quality Improvement (sic) [Incentive] Program, QIP, proposed rule. This proposed rule will have a 60-day common period ending September 24, 2010, and the final rule is expected in 2011. Key provisions under these rules include the following:</p>
          <p>Anemia management. Under the QIP, beginning in 2012, facilities will be subject to a payment penalty of up to 2% for failure to meet or exceed CMS standards. CMS proposes the penalty be based on a composite score of measures, and that the measure for hemoglobin levels below 10 grams per deciliter constitute 50% of the weight and the remaining measures each represent 25% of the weight.</p>
          <p>Unit of payment. CMS finalized its proposal to continue a per-treatment unit of payment. Consistent with current policy, ESRD facilities could be paid for up to three treatments per week, unless medical necessity justifies more.</p>
          <p>Payment rate. For 2011, the base rate is $229.63, which is based on 2007 claims data and the application of several adjustors. Total spending in 2011 under the bundled payment system is based on 98% of estimated spending, if bundling had not been implemented.</p>
          <p>Oral drugs without IV equivalents. CMS finalized the definition of renal dialysis services to include oral-only drugs but postponed payment for such drugs until January 1, 2014. Oral-only drugs such as Sensipar and phosphate binders will remain under Medicare beneficiaries' prescription drug benefit and paid for under Medicare Part D until 2014. Amgen is supportive of policies that improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery, as well as preserve patient access to important medicines for patients on dialysis. The ESRD final rule demonstrates CMS's strong commitment to these principles. We are continuing to review the final rule to better understand the potential impact on patient access and quality of care.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to Sensipar performance on slide 17. For the second quarter, worldwide Sensipar sales grew 3% versus last year, primarily driven by demand. In the U.S., inventory decreased in the second quarter this year compared to an inventory build last year, partially offset by demand. International growth was 11%, driven by demand.</p>
          <p>Next is Vectibix on slide 18. U.S. Vectibix sales grew 21% versus the prior year, primarily due to demand, while international sales grew 34% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we provide an update on our overall healthcare reform impacts. As the slide indicates, we have already booked $69 million in accruals this year for the three components of healthcare reform that are currently in effect, circled here in red. As you can see, we will be accruing for these three components in the third quarter, and by the fourth quarter the AMP calculation charges will also become effective. Finally, we're maintaining our estimated range of 200 to $250 million impact for healthcare reform in 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 summarizes our international performance. Internationally, sales grew 2%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Growth was driven by new product launches and expansion to new territories, offset by a decline in Aranesp sales.</p>
          <p>On the next two slides, we'll look at the share data for Aranesp in nephrology, followed by share for the Filgrastim franchise. Consistent with previous quarters, Aranesp's nephrology share remained steady, as biosimilars continue to take share from EPO-alpha and EPO-beta. And Mircera growth continues to derive largely from NeoRecormon.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 provides comparable data for the GCFS market. Again, we see very consistent trends despite biosimilar presence in our major markets.</p>
          <p>On my final slide, we'll provide a Prolia launch update. In both the U.S. and the EU, we are on track with our launch plan and encouraged by the early market reaction to Prolia. In the U.S., physicians are trialing the product in some of their most difficult-to-treat patients while assessing reimbursement and patient affordability. Nearly 90% of Prolia sales to date have been accessed via buy-and-bill reimbursement. 50% of patients have had a copay of 0 to $15, and for the remaining 50% of the patients, the copay remains modest.</p>
          <p>It may be useful to you for me to take a minute and outline the buy-and-bill process in just a little more detail. Step one is clinical agreement in which the physicians identify appropriate patients based upon the Prolia prescribing information. Typically these are postmenopausal women with a history of fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture, or who have failed other therapy or who are intolerant of other therapy. Overall, our early experience is that physicians are readily able to identify appropriate patients for Prolia in their practice. Step two is coverage confirmation. The physician's office staff submits an insurance verification request or IVR to our reimbursement hub called ProliaPlus. Within a day or two, the office staff receives back a summary of benefits, which explains what the payer will reimburse and what, if anything, the patient must pay. The staff discusses this with the patient and then orders Prolia from their wholesaler. Step three, the patient returns to the office, and Prolia is administered. Step four, the office submits the claim and reimbursement is paid, generally within 14 to 30 days, assuming a clean claim.</p>
          <p>With new products, it's not unusual for a payer to request additional documentation. To date, many claims have been submitted, and we expect the bulk of them to be &#x2013; start being paid in August and September. Once offices have received paid claims, we expect that they will continue to identify additional patients appropriate for Prolia. This process is the basis for our sales forecast ramp in 2010. In early 2011, we expect utilization of the pharmacy benefit under Medicare Part B to increase as prescription drug plans make their formulary decisions.</p>
          <p>Turning to Europe, Germany is our first major market, with reimbursement received on July the 1st, and we're off to a strong start. We're also encouraged by the positive preliminary NICE recommendation for Prolia reimbursement in the UK and expect to see sales ramp in the fourth quarter of this year, when the recommendation becomes effective. Reimbursement and launch in additional major markets, including France and Spain, is expected in early 2011. We look forward to providing you with more detailed information on the Prolia launch on our third quarter call.</p>
          <p>Now, over to Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Well, as Kevin mentioned, the second quarter of 2010 was an extremely important one for Amgen's research and development group, and especially for our global regulatory and safety surveillance organizations.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 documents that we are pursuing Prolia regulatory approvals around the globe. And again, as Bob indicated, our first approval came in Europe from the European Medicines Agency at the end of May, followed almost immediately thereafter by U.S. FDA approval. We also have approval in Australia, and we are expecting approval in Canada and in Switzerland during the third quarter of this year. I wish also to mention that we are in the process of preparing more than 30 filings around the world in collaboration with our partners GlaxoSmithKline. So in short order, we will be pursuing Prolia launches throughout the globe.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 26, Prolia is denosumab administered at 60 milligrams once every six months, but denosumab can also be administered in a more intensive schedule at 12 times the exposure, which is at 120 milligrams every month in the setting of advanced cancer. I've spoken previously in a variety of settings about the importance of denosumab in this setting in reducing the &#x2013; or delaying the appearance of skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastasis, and we have submitted our file to the FDA and to other regulatory authorities for that indication.</p>
          <p>As Kevin mentioned, the U.S. FDA granted priority review with a PDUFA date of November 18, 2010, and we're working closely with the FDA in evaluating our data set. Also, the review by the European Medicines Agency is proceeding with the usual cadence. Filing has also been completed in Canada and Australia, and our partner Daiichi-Sankyo expects to file for approval in Japan for the skeletal-related events indication in the third quarter of this year. Other filings around the world will be pursued in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline.</p>
          <p>I should mention that in addition to denosumab as Prolia and also in the more intensive schedule for skeletal-related events, we are expecting a lot of important new data which will arrive later this year. And turning to slide 27, there are several key events that I wish to highlight.</p>
          <p>First of all, during the third quarter of this year, we will obtain data on the use of Vectibix in the setting of refractory relapse for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, the head and neck. And these data should be available relatively shortly. We also will gain data from an important Phase III study of denosumab for the prevention of bony metastasis in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for bony metastasis, so-called 147 study, and these data will be available in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>As Kevin mentioned, we've initiated our &#x2013; or we will initiate our first Phase III study for AMG 386, and we are expecting to have patients with relapsed refractory ovarian cancer joining this study in the fourth quarter of this year. And we do intend also to advance the AMG 479 study into Phase III, though likely the first patient will not be admitted to these studies until the beginning of 2011. Additional Phase II data sets from our AMG 386, AMG 479, and from the AMG 827 programs will also become available later in this year, and we'll have the opportunity to share those with you at future earnings calls.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Kind of a multi-part question on bundling. What is your assumption for the providers phasing in over four years versus opting in? Does the composite rate create any sort of incentive? And then what could the strategy be that you guys use make to make EPO utilization declines a little bit more smooth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, thanks for that question. It's really early for us, and trying to predict exactly what our partners in the dialysis supply chain are going to do is a little bit difficult. I'd like to just make a couple of comments, though. First, this bundling rule is within our expectation, and so anything we've said before about our view of the likely effect of bundling is operative. We also are pleased to note that the CMS has recognized patient &#x2013; the quality of patient care and that &#x2013; the uncertainties around what exactly would happen when orals go in the bundle eventually. So we're pleased that that recognition happened.</p>
          <p>I think I'll turn it over to Jim to make a few comments on how he sees this playing out, but I want to emphasize that it's very, very early, and we'll have more to say as events actually unfold. Jim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, Geoff, I think you put your finger on the core issue, which is these new rules could apply to anywhere from 25% of Medicare dialysis patients all the way up to 100% depending on whether providers decide to opt in 100% or phase in 25% a year. Now, CMS interestingly made an assumption of about a 43% opt-in rate. Right now we're working very close with our customers to understand what they anticipate doing. They have until November the 1st to decide one way or the other. So I think this is a situation of stay tuned, and clearly we will be very close to our customers.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second part of your question, what impact will this have on utilization? Well, certainly, there's a couple of things that we do not anticipate happening. One, we do not anticipate wholesale moves to subcu administration, for a number of reasons, including the fact that our label recommends against it, and also the fact that patients do not like it, and also the clinical data is somewhat dubious in terms of what type of dose savings you can actually realize over an extended period of time. So we don't see that as a major drag on utilization. We don't see IV iron creating a major drag on utilization. Most patients, 85%, are iron replete. So we don't see that as being a major issue.</p>
          <p>Where we're modeling right now, potential utilization impact is on hyporesponder patients. Right now, if you define a hyporesponder, as we do on our label, patients who fail to achieve 10 after 12 weeks, that's about 1% of patients who represent about 3% of the utilization.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Can you &#x2013; I had a question about Prolia. Can you give us a little bit of a sense as to, of the 3 million booked in the quarter, just a little bit &#x2013; kind of trying to understand the &#x2013; how should we look at the price in Europe? I know you're kind of looking at maybe between 200 and 400 euros being the competition. So maybe how should we think about the price there relative to that? And also a little bit of a sense as to how do you see ramp happening in the U.S. relative to Europe? Just trying to understand a little quantitatively how we should look at modeling this. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. One the first question, the price of Prolia in Europe, we priced Prolia at a 15 to 25% premium to branded bisphosphonates in Europe. That puts the price at about 550 to 600 U.S. dollars. Second, on the rollout of REMS, I -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the ramp in the U.S. versus Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I'm sorry, the ramp in the U.S. versus Europe. I think it's two different situations. If you contrast Germany, which once you have government reimbursement, as we received on July the 1st, German physicians are free to prescribe for virtually any patient. And as a result, we are seeing very nice uptake of the product in Germany, which is consistent with our expectation that there is a relatively large population of patients who will benefit from Prolia. In the U.S., you have a rate-limiting step, which is reimbursement. Right now we're focused on the medical benefit, and physicians are reluctant to put a large number of patients on the product until they have greater confidence that reimbursement will be adequate, timely, and that patients will not have an exorbitant out-of-pocket cost. So I think you're going to see a faster ramp in European markets where we've secured government reimbursement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that, Yaron, just &#x2013; and everybody &#x2013; I know we're all really understandably interested in Prolia's progress, nobody more than us. That is for sure. I think a summary point of view from our position is: so far, so good. It is very early. The reimbursement issues in the U.S. need to be worked through. We're optimistic. Germany, where we have, as Jim said, a clean reimbursement situation, proceeding well. The other countries in Europe will roll out, based on their own individual reimbursement dynamics. It's early days, but so far, so good.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my call. Just two questions. I think they're both one-word answers, though. First, it looks like you're reducing the guidance, principally because of the FX changes that have occurred over the last three months. Can you tell us what the quarter-on-quarter FX impact was to revenues in Q2? And then second, what share count is implied in the assumptions for EPS guidance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Michael. In terms of the FX, we've assumed essentially that we're planning on sort of the existing spot rate, which today is sort of around the 1.29s, 1.30s. And in terms of the share count, the share count that we're assuming is in the 960 range as opposed to previous year over a billion.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. Just, Jim, a little bit more color on Prolia. First, could you talk a little bit about what reimbursement you're seeing? Do you have a temporary code for reimbursement from Medicare, and what sort of restrictions are being imposed by the commercial payers? Is it prior auth right now, or is there step therapy required? I mean what's going on there? And then could you just talk a little bit about the number of &#x2013; in physician offices that you're actually seeing ordering, and what sort of trajectory that's on? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll answer those two questions, Geoff. But it's interesting. We didn't say that there'd be one question each and I can see the wisdom of saying there'll be one question each, but those are both good ones. And so Jim, why don't you take them on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hey, Geoff. We'll consider that a two-part on reimbursement. In terms of do we have a code, yes we do. It is the miscellaneous J-Code 3490. Some MACs will also use J-3590. In terms of what type of reimbursement we're seeing on the medical side from carriers, we only have a handful of claims to date, of paid claims, and basically they are what you would expect, which is WAC, wholesaler acquisition cost, plus 6%.</p>
          <p>On the commercial pharmacy side, what we're seeing is a whole range of reimbursement situations going from relatively low patient out-of-pocket, with virtually no prior authorization or step-at-its all the way up to a coinsurance of 20% or 30% with prior auths required. So there's a wide range right now on the commercial pharmacy side.</p>

We've been looking at that for some time. The program I referred to, Jim, gets to us 75 countries over the next several years. This year we're expanding into four new countries, and so we're not providing guidance about what the incremental revenue effect will be from entering these new countries.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Given the proximity between the timing of a PDUFA date for a SRE indication and a prevention operable meds in a prostate cancer study data, do you think that the FDA may want to wait to see the data before making a decision on SRE indications?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Eun, it's Roger. I don't think so. Of course, it's always hard to speculate. And the agency in reviewing the file could decide that there's something that they want to look at in more detail. But the SRE file stands on its own. Keep in mind that there are on the order of 7,000 patients, 7,000 subjects in the SRE file. It's very complete. There are three Phase III studies that are active comparator controlled head-to-head studies in breast cancer and solid tumors and multiple myeloma and prostate cancer. So there's a lot of data there to review, and the timing is such that I suspect they will have completed their review, and &#x2013; because they need to in order to get all the documents put together if they're looking at a November 18 PDUFA date. So it really does stand on its own, I think.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Actually a question for Roger. As I guess I think of oncology development, I typically think of programs that you don't know if they're really going to work or not until you get the Phase III data, but then every once in a while, a BRAF inhibitor kind of product comes along with great monotherapy activities. So how do we think about Amgen's oncology pipeline? Are there programs in here that have BRAF potential, and which ones might they be? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, as we've talked about and we had the opportunity to present these programs in some detail at the ASCO meetings, actually &#x2013; the data for AMG 386 and for AMG 479 from the Phase II studies are pretty impressive. Now, for 386, you have data in the ovarian cancer setting in which there is &#x2013; it's placebo controlled data that we actually are doing a direct study of chemotherapy plus AMG 386 versus chemotherapy alone, and there's a dose response curve, so that the 10-milligram per kilogram arm was more impressive than the 3-milligram per kilogram arm, which itself still demonstrated a response compared to chemotherapy alone. And the data showed that not only could you see an effect with respect to the tumors themselves but there's also a quantitative effect with respect to, in this case, a biomarker for tumor mass CA 125.</p>
          <p>So all of that tends to give you more confidence that in fact you will see a treatment effect that duplicates that in the Phase III study. Of course, the magnitude could be different. The extent to which overall survival might be prolonged in such a study could be different. But it gives you more confidence.</p>
          <p>And similarly, the magnitude of the treatment effect, and the fact that there's an exposure response relationship with the AMG 479 study in pancreatic cancer also gives you some confidence. You can never be sure, just as you say, you have to see the Phase III studies, but the data sets are really quite impressive in Phase II and more robust than most that you usually see. Got a lot of other things going on in the cancer area, as we talked about at ASCO, and we can get to that some other time. But I would point out those two studies that we've taken into Phase III are really quite powerful.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. I have an Enbrel question. You mentioned that the drug is losing share to some newer agents. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. What agents are those, and what are you trying to do to counter that?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I think we need to for the Enbrel situation, really break it down into rheumatology and dermatology. In rheumatology, we have now seven biologic competitors, and over the past year, our share has gone from 36% down to 33% which I think is strong performance in the face of seven biologic competitors. We continue to reinforce the efficacy and safety profile of Enbrel.</p>
          <p>On dermatology &#x2013; and so if you look at &#x2013; if you ask where did that share go? It was divided amongst a bunch of new competitors that are picking up 1 or 2% share overall. So you're looking at Simponi, Actemra, Cimzia. So it's inevitable you're going to lose some level of share as the market leader.</p>
          <p>Now, in dermatology, I think it's a little different. The share loss is primarily going to Stelara, which is a new market entrant. Stelara has a 13% share, and we've seen our market share go to 49. Now, the reassuring thing is that the Stelara share has stabilized at 13 quarter-over-quarter. So we think there was a bolus of patients who were refractory to TNF inhibitors. They've moved to Stelara, and we're looking forward to stabilization in Stelara's share gains at the expense of Enbrel.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just one question on the &#x2013; and just really more of an opinion on the approval of generic Lovenox and what it might mean for biosimilars, or path for biosimilars in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give it to Roger on the technical side. I think from a policy side, it's not a harbinger for biosimilars. I think we're going to have to work that pathway out, but I'll let Roger comment on some of the technical aspect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ian, as you know, it's a pretty different product from what you'd see in a biosimilar. You have the same starting material for Lovenox as you do for the Momenta product. And you're simply asking the question of whether you can characterize the degradence to such a point that you believe that they have something in common. In a biosimilar case, you don't have the same starting material. And in addition, there's enormous complexity, which you can recognize just on the difference in the molecular size of these species.</p>
          <p>There's enormous complexity in a biosimilar that's not as easy to characterize, and as a result, it's harder to predict what the clinical performance will be. And that has been past what has been of such great concern, both from the perspective of immunogenicity, as well as from the perspective of overall efficacy. So I don't think you should look at this as a harbinger for the way in which the agency would handle biosimilars. I think it is an understandable development in a regulatory analysis that's been going on for the last nearly five years with respect to low-molecular-weight heparins.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as questions are really simple, I'm going to have two. So first is, you had about 191 other revenue. Could you provide a little more color? And then for your SG&amp;A, where do you see &#x2013; have you finished your building of the infrastructure for Prolia, or do we see some additional increase going forward on the SG&amp;A side?</p>

          <p>Jason, this is Michael Kelly. In the other income, that was principally driven by milestone payments from GlaxoSmithKline of $75 million and Takeda for Vectibix in Japan of 45 million. Those were the principal drivers.</p>
          <p>Relative to SG&amp;A, the biggest piece is, last year we didn't have the sales force and now we're anniversarying that cost, and we're going to continue to build out our large platform for Prolia. So we would expect to see some continued increases in SG&amp;A to support Prolia.</p>

          <p>Hey, Christian, as it's going on top of the hour, why don't we take one last question?</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and thanks for sneaking me in there. Just wanted to ask, on the &#x2013; two questions if I can. On Prolia, can we assume that the $3 million is all end user demand, or is there some inventory build? And then I wanted to get your perspective on France. There's some commentary in the press talking about reductions in erythropoietin spend and curious what your perspective is there.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Prolia U.S. sales of 3 million, you should assume there's some inventory build in that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll have to look into the question about France. We have a strong business in France, a good environment for us. So we'll get back to you on that.</p>
