        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Conference call. Here with me are Eduardo Solorzano, President and CEO of Wal-Mart de Mexico; Marianne Ventura and Mariana Rodr&#xED;guez.</p>
          <p>Now I will start by highlighting that during 2008, our sales, operating income, EBITDA and net income were the best ever for the history of our company. This is more relevant within the context of a year of great challenge. Throughout the year we faced contraction in credit, the slowdown of remittances, inflationary pressures, and by the end of the year we also had an increase in unemployment, a deterioration of the exchange rate, fourth quarter with no GDP growth compared to a 4.2% growth of the previous year.  All these variables affected disposable income and a deterioration of consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>In our case we not only have a unique and solid position to face the environment, but we have had, as always, a determination to work on the side of the consumer. Our financial strength combined with our discipline in expenses and our constant search for efficiencies allowed us to heavily invest in prices in order to drive the store traffic and to increase customer loyalty.</p>
          <p>And we were also able to continue with our profitable growth, efficiently reaching more cities and customers throughout the country.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight the following for the year 2008. The number of customers who visited our stores and restaurants increased 12.1% and 4.2% in comparable stores. Same-store sales grew 4.6% and 5.6% for self-service formats. Gross margin improved despite the investment in prices. The mix of formats has more discretionary formats involved in it that have higher margins underperformed and even despite mix of sales within self-service as customers are pulling out their spending in non-food areas. Inventories were up 9% while we expanded our installed capacity by 12%.</p>
          <p>Now on the other side, the greatest challenge that we faced given the slowdown in sales was expenses. There were three items that made expenses grow more than sales: the bank, remodeling and utilities. If we exclude these items, expenses would have grown less than sales. We decided to continue with store remodels despite the slowdown in sales, as we believe this is to be the best decision for the medium and long-term.</p>
          <p>Utilities expenses grew 32% during 2008. This is related to electricity costs, both from high prices of energy, as well as incremental costs of having no real diesel plant to supply energy to our new stores for an average of four to five months before connecting to the public network. Return on capital employed was 26.3% for the last for the last 12 months, while return on equity was 23.9%.</p>
          <p>Now regarding the fourth quarter, I would like to highlight that sales continue to be driven by an increase in customer traffic of 2.8% and 4.5% for self-service format. It is important to mention that during December, our strongest month of the year, we had two important effects: the calendar effect, as we had two weekend days less than during 2007; and the comparison effect that for 2008 the year-end voucher program that the Mexico City government gives to its employees was assigned to a competitor, compared to the previous year when the majority of them were redeemed at WALMEX. Despite these two effects, customer count during December increased 1.5% in comparable stores and same-store sales for our self-service format grew more than the market.</p>
          <p>As for expenses, we had the same line item pressure for the year, in addition to the true operating expenses. As in the fourth quarter of 2008, we opened 102 stores compared to 63 for the same period last year. If we exclude these items, expenses would have grown less than sales.</p>
          <p>Now, I leave you with Eduardo to talk about how we are driving customers into our stores.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Rafael, thank you very much and good afternoon to everybody. And as Rafael mentioned in 2008 and in particular during the fourth quarter of this year, we strengthened our price leadership through different commercial initiatives, allowing us to considerable increase the number of customers. Let me share with you a few things that we did and I will try to be as brief as I can.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing, I believe that Bodega Aurrera closed the celebration of its sixth-year anniversary by offering our customers special buys and rollbacks. Wal-Mart introduced the "Good News" campaign, informing our customer of over 6300 rollbacks offered through the store. We closed also the price of 500 or above article from our strategic brands at Bodega Aurrera, Wal-Mart and Superama. Also, we held our special sale, returning the VAT, the V-A-T in cash of all purchases at Bodega Aurrera, Wal-Mart and Superama.</p>
          <p>Sam's also held the "Plug into the Best Prices" event with 15% reimbursement and 12 months free-of-interest in all items that could be plugged in, such as television screens, refrigerators, ovens and many other more. Also, VAT for wines and liquors was given back on a gift card.</p>
          <p>Suburbia focuses on apparel solutions, offering one price for an entire outfit. Sam's also launched the Saving Coupons program, offering important savings in groceries and general merchandise for its members.</p>
          <p>In Fresh, Wal-Mart launched the Fresh Tuesday and Wednesday program, with prices especially low in all of our fresh produce and with the produce department as an anchor. All these programs are backed up by our double freshness guarantee. Bodega Aurrera reinforces our One, Two, Three program, adding not only produce, but also meat and bakery to the program. Superama improved the shopping experience in our produce department by means of the Buy with Your Senses program, presenting a new layout based on colors and nutritional quality of our products.</p>
          <p>In Merchandise, and also it is important to highlight that we launched at Wal-Mart and Bodega Aurrera our exclusive brand of electronics, Atvio; Atvio with very good quality items are the lowest price in their category and with a full 12-month guarantee for the physical exchange of the product. Atvio replaces Mitsui, a controller brand and sales are 60% higher than Mitsui. We have a special price of all different formats, which are, for example, our 42-inch screen high-definition television at 9,000 pesos retail. Bodega, with the Compra Facil card, launched the campaign "Take what you want, pay when you can", offering 10% discount on payment.</p>
          <p>In Vips and also in our self-service format, we offer Christmas dinners, dinners-to-go, anticipating that people will opt to stay at home rather than eating out.</p>
          <p>We just only opened the largest toy store in Mexico, with our toy annexes at Wal-Mart and Bodega Aurrera, but we also guarantee the lowest price in the market.</p>
          <p>As you know, one of our strategic priorities is continuous profitable growth. And these investments in prices in the short-term are allowing us to increase the number of customers at our stores and reinforce loyalty and to allow us to increase comp sales for the medium and long-term as purchasing power improves; this on the top of our disciplined multi-format expansion.</p>
          <p>During 2008, we invested 11.3 billion pesos and opened 182 units of all of our formats, both figures the largest ever in the history of our company; as follows: 33 Bodega Aurrera, 33 Mi Bodega Aurrera, 63 Bodega Aurrera Express, 17 Wal-Mart Supercenters, eight Sam's Club, three Superamas, eight Suburbia stores and 17 restaurants. These openings represented an 11.7 growth in sales floor and 3.2% in restaurant seating. We opened stores and restaurants in 52 new cities; thus, today, we have 1,205 units in 225 different cities through the country.</p>
          <p>Regarding talent, another of our strategic priorities, I will only say that I am convinced that we have the resource-oriented management teams that we need to run the businesses under the actual circumstances and also to execute our strategies and achieve efficiencies that would allow us to come out of the current economic situation as a stronger company. During 2008, we invested 9.7 million man hours in training, of which 2.7 million was distance learning.</p>
          <p>Finally, for our third strategic priority, corporate social responsibility, I would like to highlight the most relevant activities for the quarter. In October, the Wal-Mart de Mexico Foundation coordinated the "Date of My Community" program, benefiting 1.2 million people in 192 different cities through the country. 446 activities were organized with the participation of over 16,000 associate volunteers and more than 5,000 customers, a 46 increase compared to the previous year. Activities organized included maintenance work at schools, park and libraries. Reforestation activities were also performed, with the planting of more than 84,000 trees.</p>
          <p>In November, as part of the humanitarian assistance agreement established by the Wal-Mart de Mexico Foundation, the Mexican Red Cross and the United Nations Development Program, 13 relief centers were established in Veracruz and Puebla to collect and channel support for families affected by the floods in those states. As a result of the one peso at a time, with your help, our Help Growth campaign, the Wal-Mart de Mexico Foundation collected 10.3 million pesos for nutritional support programs, benefiting over 300,000 Mexicans. The campaign included the sale of a sticker for 5 pesos that customers will acquire at stores, clubs and restaurants.</p>
          <p>In January 2009, we installed the largest photovoltaic facility in Latin America located in Bodega Aurrera convention in Aguascalientes. This facility will generate 20% of the energy used by the stores and will prevent annually the emission of 140 tons of carbon dioxide.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, the following recognitions and awards were received. The Mexican Association of Food Banks recognizing the Wal-Mart de Mexico Foundation as one of the 10 most important donating institutions in the fight against the hunger and malnutrition. This recognition was due to the 800 annual tons sent to food banks nationwide. Then also the Natural Resources and Marine Secretary recognized Wal-Mart de Mexico for participating in the second consecutive year of the greenhouse gas emission accounting and report voluntary program know as GEI, becoming the only company in the retail sector part of the program. The company reduced 3.44% of its CO2 emissions in 2007 as compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>Now Mariana, I think you have some additional comments to make.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Eduardo, thank you. Let me first remind our analysts and investors that we will be hosting our annual Analyst Meeting next February 18 and 19. This year it will be a joint meeting with Wal-Mart Stores as part of their Annual Sales trip, and it will held here in Mexico City. During the meeting we will be providing comments not only on 2008 results but also on what we are doing to continue creating value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Also, I would like to mention that there will be a webcast of the different presentations on the 19th and you can access it through our webpage, www.walmartmexico.com.mx.</p>
          <p>Both Eduardo and Rafael have commented on our sales being driven by customers. I would only add that our stickers at comparable stores increased 0.4% for the year 2008 and decreased 1% for the fourth quarter. This is a reflection of both the economy context and our price aggressiveness.</p>
          <p>Gross margin for the year was 10 basis points higher than in 2007 and 30 basis points higher in the case of the fourth quarter of 2008. This improvement was driven by efficiencies with suppliers, improvements in inventory management, reduced markdowns as a result of the well planned high season, and efficiencies in distribution.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at some balance sheet items. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 our cash position amounted to 11.3 billion pesos. During the year the company invested 11.3 billion pesos in fixed assets, paid a dividend of 3.2 billion pesos and repurchased 75.8 million shares for an amount of 2.9 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>Inventories had an increase of 9% considering all the stores. A big part it -- a big part of this growth came from the expansion in new stores, since the initial inventory those new stores hold in 2008 was actually zero in 2007. However, that 9% total stores inventory growth favorably compares against the increase in installed capacity of 12% and with the 11.1% growth in sales -- total stores for the year. Additionally, average inventory per store was down by 1.3% from last year.</p>
          <p>Accounts payable to suppliers increased 6.4% since in 2008 we prepaid a higher amount to suppliers than we did in the previous year. Without this effect, accounts payable would have grown faster than inventory.</p>
          <p>Now Rafael has some additional comments before ending the conference call.</p>

          <p>Before I finish this conference I would like to inform that during today's Board of Directors' meeting, it was decided to call for the Annual Shareholders meeting on March 12, 2009. During that meeting, a proposal will be presented to pay a dividend of 0.61 pesos.  This is 61 Mexican cents per share. This will be equivalent to 35% of the year 2008 net earnings.</p>
          <p>With this, we are now ending our conference call regarding the fourth quarter results. Thanks again and we'll be available to receive any calls with questions that you might have. Thank you.</p>
