          <p>Thanks, Sean, and good morning everybody. Our second quarter business performance was marked by Automotive growth, solid profitability and strong positive Automotive operating related cash flow. Both volume and revenue were higher than a year ago and we earned a pre-tax operating profit for the eighth consecutive quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, each of our Automotive operations as well as Financial Services was profitable. Net income totaled $2.4 billion and Automotive operating related cash flow was a positive $2.3 billion. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing Automotive debt by $2.6 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Market share was higher at three of our Automotive operations compared with a year ago, with share in South America unchanged.</p>
          <p>Overall, we had a very good second quarter and first half and we're well on track to delivering our guidance of improved total company pre-tax operating profit and Automotive operating-related cash flow for the full year compared with 2010.</p>
          <p>We accomplished these results while continuing to invest for future growth, focused on developing outstanding products, with segment-leading quality, safety, fuel economy, and technology.</p>
          <p>While this is increasing costs in the short term, it's in line with our plan. These actions also are driving higher volume, richer mix, and stronger transaction prices.</p>
          <p>Slide two summarizes our second quarter business results compared with a year ago. Vehicle wholesales were 1.5 million units, up 101,000 units or 7% from 2010. Revenue was about $36 billion, an increase of about $4 billion or 13%. For comparison purposes we have excluded Volvo wholesales and revenue from 2010.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $2.9 billion or $0.65 per share. This is $64 million lower than a year ago with gains in the Automotive sector offset by the anticipated reductions in Financial Services.</p>
          <p>Net income attributable to Ford including unfavorable pre-tax special items of $272 million was $2.4 billion or $0.59 per share. This reflects a $201 million decrease from a year ago. In the first half, vehicle wholesales increased by 9% compared with the same period a year ago and revenue improved 15%.</p>
          <p>First half pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items was $5.7 billion, a $763 million improvement and income attributable to Ford was $4.9 billion a $265 million improvement. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of Automotive gross cash and with Automotive gross cash exceeding debt by $8 billion. A net cash improvement of over $13 billion compared with a year ago and $3.3 billion higher than the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to slide three and look at our Automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. We ended the quarter with $22 billion in Automotive gross cash, an increase of $700 million from the end of the first quarter. This reflects positive Automotive operating related cash flow of $2.3 billion, mainly the flow through of our pre-tax Automotive operating profit of $2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>In addition, we received $1 billon of distributions from Ford Credit. Our cash flow before changes in debt and pension contributions was $3.6 billion. Net debt payments in the quarter totaled $2.6 billion and we also made payments of $0.5 billion to non-U.S. funded pension plans. In the first half, our cash flow before changes in debt and pension contributions totaled $7.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide four summarizes our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the second quarter. Automotive debt was $14 billion, a reduction of $2.6 billion from March 31. This includes $2.3 billion of payments on our term loans and full repayment of the outstanding balance of $800 million on a revolving credit line. These actions were offset partially by an increase in low-cost loans to support advanced technology. Our net cash as of June 30 was $8 billion and Automotive liquidity totaled $32.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide five summarizes first-half results and our planning assumptions and key operational metrics for full year 2011. We're maintaining our industry outlook for the U.S. but in Europe after a strong first half we're seeing some signs of weakness leading us to update our full year guidance to a range of 14.8 million to 15.3 million units.</p>
          <p>On our operational metrics, as discussed previously, quality remains mixed due to some near term misses in North America which we're addressing. In fact, we're very encouraged by the progress that we've made to date on these near term issues. We're on track to achieve quality improvements in our international operations.</p>
          <p>We expect U.S. and Europe market shares to equal or improve from last year's results and we expect total company pre-tax operating profit to improve compared with the $8.3 billion that we earned in 2010. We continue to expect commodities and structural cost to each increase by about $2 billion compared with 2010. The increase in structural cost is consistent with supporting higher volumes in the short term as well as our plan to grow our business, strengthen our brand and improve our product through our business planning period. Although not shown, we expect our structural cost as a percent of net revenue to improve compared with last year.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we expect Automotive operating margins to be equal to or improve compared with the 6.1% of 2010 despite higher commodities cost. We expect Automotive operating related cash flow to improve from 2010's $4.4 billion and capital expenditures remain in line with our most recent guidance.</p>
          <p>Our first half performance was very good. While we remain on track to deliver continued improvement in full-year pre-tax operating profit and Automotive operating related cash flow compared with last year, we expect second half results to be lower than the first half. In our Automotive sector this reflects increasing commodities and structural cost as well as seasonal factors that tend to favor the first half.</p>
          <p>At Ford Credit we expect lower profit in the second half in line with the factors that we have highlighted previously.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll now turn it over to Mike.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Bob. Slide six shows Ford Credit's operating results and key metrics for the second quarter of 2011. As shown in the left box, our second quarter pre-tax profit was $604 million compared with a pre-tax profit of $888 million in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>In the right box, our June 30 receivables were $84 billion, slightly lower than the same period a year ago. Charge-offs for receivables in the second quarter were $49 million and the worldwide loss-to-receivables ratio was a very low with 23 basis points. I'll speak more on this in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>At June 30, the allowance for credit losses or reserves was about $700 million or 78 basis points of receivables. We paid total distributions of $1 billion in the second quarter and year to date we've paid a total of $1.9 billion and expect to pay about $3 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to assess future distributions based on our available liquidity and managed leveraged objectives. Our managed leverage was 7.5-to-1 at June 30, up from 6.7-to-1 at December 31, an increase from 7.0 to 1 at March 31 2011. At the end of the second quarter, our equity was $9.7 billion</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows the change in the second quarter Ford Credit pre-tax results compared with a year ago. In line with our expectations, second quarter results decreased by $284 million reflecting primarily the non-recurrence of lower credit loss reserve reductions and lease depreciation expenses the same magnitude as 2010</p>
          <p>As shown in the memo, our results decreased by $109 million compared with the first quarter reflecting primarily lower credit loss reserve reductions and a number of smaller items included in other including higher storm losses in our Insurance business.</p>
          <p>For full-year 2011, we continue to expect to be solidly profitable but at a lower level than 2010, reflecting the same factors mentioned previously. We estimate the impact of these items to reduce profits about $1.1 billion in 2011 compared with 2010 and through the first half about $500 million of this impact has been realized.</p>
          <p>Slide eight shows quarterly trends of charge offs and loss receivables ratios. The top box shows loss receivables ratios for our worldwide portfolio on the U.S. Ford and Lincoln Retail and Lease business. The worldwide loss-to-receivables ratio in the second quarter is the lowest level seen in the past 10 years, both worldwide and the U.S. Ford and Lincoln loss-to-receivables ratios in the same quarter are down from the same period a year ago reflecting primarily lower repossessions offset partially by lower recoveries in the U.S. U.S. Ford and Lincoln loss-to-receivable ratios in the second quarter decreased from the first quarter 2011 reflecting lower repossessions.</p>
          <p>Charge-offs in the second quarter were $49 million, down $37 million from the same period a year ago and down $6 million from the first quarter reflecting the same factors just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. Ford and Lincoln Retail and Lease business. Repossessions in the second quarter were a very low 10,000 units or 1.71% of average accounts outstanding, again, the lowest level we've seen in the past decade.</p>
          <p>Severity of $6,500 in the second quarter was $200 lower than the same period a year ago, reflecting improvements in auction values in the used vehicle markets offset partially by a higher mix of 72 month contracts and a higher amount financed. First and second quarter severity per units were the same.</p>
          <p>Over 60 day delinquencies totaled 13 basis points in the second quarter up one basis point from the same period a year ago and down three basis points from the first quarter of 2011. Bankruptcy filings totaled 8,000 in the second quarter, 4,000 lower than the same period a year ago and down 1,000 from the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows the lease residual performance for our Ford and Lincoln U.S. brands. Lease return volumes in the second quarter, at 25,000 units were down 21,000 from the same period last year reflecting primarily the lower return rate and fewer terminations.</p>
          <p>The second quarter lease return rate was 55%, down 10 percentage points compared with the same period last year and this return rate was down 7 points compared with the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter auction values for 36 month vehicles were up $1,070 per unit from the same period last year and up $690 a unit from the first quarter. Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $10.2 billion at the end of the second quarter up from $10 billion in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. In the second quarter we completed $9 billion of funding, including $6 billion in the public market and $3 billion in the private securitizations. We have completed another $3 billion of funding in July, including our first public lease securitization transaction. Year-to-date we have completed $19 billion of funding. We renewed $12 billion of committed capacity in the second quarter including $8 billion of our FCAR asset backed commercial paper program, about half of which are multi-year facilities maturing in 2014 and the rest are 365 day facilities maturing in June of 2012.</p>
          <p>We also syndicated a new three year &#xA3;440 million unsecured facility for FCE Bank. We continue to see lower cost across all our facilities. Our funding strategy remains focused on access to a variety of markets, channels and investors. We completed our second FUEL transaction in June for $1 billion in proceeds.</p>
          <p>In addition, we successfully launched the new Ford Credit Retail Notes program and have issued almost $350 million year-to-date. Although presently certain markets are choppy, we are on track to achieve our full year funding plan. Our liquidity remains strong and we will maintain cash balances and committed capacity to meet our business and funding requirements</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows our trends in funding for our managed receivables. At the end of the second quarter managed receivables were $86 billion. We ended the quarter with $11 billion in cash including about $4 billion to support on balance sheet securitization. Securitized funding was 51% of managed receivables at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We are projecting 2011 year end managed receivables in the range of $82 billion to $87 billion, securitized funding which includes the FUEL Notes is expected to represent about 53% to 57% of total managed receivables. It is our expectation that this percentage will decline moving forward due to our ability to source term funding from unsecured markets over time and the affect of FUEL Notes converting to unsecured debt.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows our 2011 term funding plans for Ford Credit. Year-to-date we have completed $19 billion of term funding, about $12 billion of this was public funding in the U.S., Canada and Europe including two FUEL insurances totaling $2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Additional public funding included our first public lease transaction for $1 billion and a German public retail securitization transaction for $700 million equivalent. We have also issued about $4 billion of unsecured debt. Year-to-date we have completed about $7 billion of funding through our private channel securitizations across all regions.</p>
          <p>We project full year, public term funding in the range of $18 billion to $22 billion consisting of $7 billion to $9 billion of unsecured debt and $11 billion to $14 billion of public securitizations and those include our FUEL program. In addition to the public issuance we are projecting $9 billion to $12 billion of funding from our private sources.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 details our liquidity programs and utilization. The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity which includes unsecured credit facilities, our FCAR asset backed commercial paper program and other asset backed capacity. As of June 30 we had $43 billion of committed capacity and cash. After excluding securitization cash and adjusting for available assets, liquidity was $34.4 billion of which $17.5 billion was utilized, leaving about $17 billion of liquidity available for use.</p>
          <p>Committed capacity at the end of the second quarter was $31.9 billion, $1.7 billion lower than the first quarter. Our renewal strategy will continue to protect our global funding needs, while optimizing available capacity. We ended the quarter with about $4.6 billion of excess committed capacity, providing a funding source for future assets and flexibility to shift capacity among markets and asset classes where most needed.</p>
          <p>So in summary, on slide 15, Ford had a pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, of $2.9 billion. Net income attributable to Ford was $2.4 billion. We ended the quarter with Automotive liquidity of $32.2 billion, including $10.2 billion of available Automotive credit facilities. We reduced Automotive debt by $2.6 billion, primarily reflecting $2.3 billion of payments on our term loan and the full repayment of the outstanding balance of $800 million on our revolving credit line.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with cash net of debt of $8 billion. Ford Credit's pre-tax profit was $604 million and net income was $383 million. Ford Credit paid $1 billion in distributions to its parent in the second quarter and is on track to pay a total of $3 billion in 2011. Year-to-date, Ford Credit has completed $19 billion of term funding, including its second FUEL transaction and the relaunch of the Retail Notes program. We ended the quarter with liquidity available for use of about $17 billion. We are continuing our progress toward investment-grade credit ratings.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it back to Sean to begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Good quarter. Just wondering if you guys have any update in your conversations with the rating agencies. Is there any timing milestone requirements that they have updated you on? And would that &#x2013; is one of those milestones the requirement of the reduction in pension?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, this is Neil. And I think from the perspective &#x2013; and I don't think it's going to change from what we've said previously. Obviously, we keep them fully informed on what we're doing. And they've been pretty explicit in their write-ups of what they're looking at from a standpoint of our financial performance. And the bottom line is we continue to execute, continue to improve our balance sheet and continue to generate cash and support the business. So I think we're doing everything that we feel we have planned to do and they will do what they will do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll tell you, that cash generation has impressed this credit analyst, for all that's worth. Mike, if you could give some color on two things on the Fin Co. side. The status of the consumer, are the delinquency trends currently in line with the seasonal trends and expectations? Or are you guys seeing some slight weakness as some of the higher gas prices roll through the economy and some of the higher unemployment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Eric, actually these trends are phenomenal for us. As I said, they are the lowest we've seen really over the past decade. The delinquencies remain extraordinarily low. The repossessions are very low. People are paying their bills. I can't comment on what's going to happen, but to this stage &#x2013; I don't know what the phrase is, you can sleep in your car, but you can't drive your house to work, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've been to some RV parks where that's different. They may contend with that comment. But looking at &#x2013; and one last question is, when you look at competitors is anybody getting aggressive on rates or terms? Is there any major change in subvention or lease activity? And then stage one, kind of like what you saw in the second quarter. And then looking forward, as the Japanese come back online, what are your expectations on that? And I'll cede the call. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well, obviously, we go to market jointly with the Motor Company and our programs are a function of how they want to set variable marketing. That said, we've maintained our wholesale share. You can see it has been a very steady 81%. We are very confident in our competitive position. We've been doing this for 50 years, through all economic cycles. At this stage, we've been able to hold on and do everything right with our dealers and I think our dealers see it's paying off. So we'll take it as it comes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Nice numbers. Just a question is around what was talked about in the earnings call earlier on incentives, that you're expecting incentives to go up in the second half. And I think that was more of an industry type of commentary. But I just kind of wanted to check with &#x2013; what are you guys thinking? Is this more of a &#x2013; incentives are going to be up on more a truck-based product or just across the board? Just a little bit more color there, because obviously there's a lot of debate around what's going to happen with incentives. Another Detroit three company said earlier that they actually do not expect a significant rise in incentives in the back half, that they think there is going to be discipline in the industry. So, I'm just curious to see if you guys can give more color on that, it would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob. I think, Brian, the market will probably be a little bit more competitive in general in the second half of the year as the Japanese constraints on supply resolve themselves. So, I think that will largely be in probably cars and utilities, where they have a bigger role to play in the broader industry. But the Japanese themselves, normal practice are really quite disciplined. So while there will probably be more activity than what we saw in the second quarter because of the supply constraints, I think in general that they approach the market very responsibly in terms of incentives, and I wouldn't expect that to be much different personally as we look in the second half of the year. So I think we'll see more activity, but I think the overall environment will continue to be relatively disciplined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just the last question. In the past, Ford has talked about like how much cash you need on hand to kind of run the Auto business being around $8 billion to $10 billion. And your working capital looks like you've done a better job managing working capital. Obviously, it's still very seasonal and there are still very big swings and so forth. But can you just give us an update on that? Is that still kind of the number where you need a minimum cash of $8 billion to $10 billion to sort of run the Auto business and the rest is just pretty much window dressing or cushion, call it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, this is Neil. I'm not sure where the $8 billion to $10 billion came from, from a standpoint of from here. I think we continue to find ways to minimize the amount of cash we need to operate the business. I think going global on the ONE Ford product and being able to leverage the synergies associated with that continues to help us with that process. We have not talked externally about how much cash we need to run and how much cash we want to hold, but $32 billion of total liquidity is a sizable amount.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
