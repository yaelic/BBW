          <p>Good morning and good afternoon. I'm Stephanie, the Chorus Call operator for this conference. Welcome to the UBS Third Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. Please note that for the duration of the presentation, all participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to UBS.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to our third quarter results presentation. My name is Caroline Stewart, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations at UBS. This morning, Sergio Ermotti will begin our presentation by outlining his priorities as CEO. He'll then hand over to Tom Naratil, our CFO, who will present the details of our third quarter result. After that, we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>But before I hand over to Sergio, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement with regard to forward-looking statements, and I'd encourage you to take some time to read it thoroughly.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over to Sergio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Group CFO Tom Naratil and me on our third quarter earnings call. Tom and I, along with our colleagues on the Group Executive Board, have been working closely over the past few weeks both in the run-up to today's earnings call and in preparation for our Investor Day on November 17.</p>
          <p>Since this is my first time speaking with you as the CEO of the group, I will discuss the near-term priorities I have set for myself and the business. I will provide brief comments about the results this quarter and how they were impacted by the macroeconomic environment. Tom will then walk you through the Q3 results in greater detail.</p>
          <p>While we will, of course, comment broadly on the direction of our corporate strategy today, we will not be discussing specific business-by-business details nor will we be discussing the details on how we intend to execute on this strategy going forward. These topics will be covered at our Investor Day, and my colleagues and I are looking forward to meeting with you then.</p>
          <p>Now, to my key priorities as Group CEO, first and foremost, I'm focused on running the day-to-day business in order to continue to serve the interests of our clients. More than ever, in these volatile markets and uncertain times, our clients rely on us for advice. Our employees have continued to show real dedication and conviction to their clients and to the bank. I want to thank them for their diligence, their commitment, their loyalty during these challenging times.</p>
          <p>Second, regarding the unauthorized trading event, I'm fully committed, along with our Board of Directors and the Group Executive Board, to addressing all findings and taking the necessary actions to implement an improved business management and control framework, including taking further disciplinary action towards individuals responsible.</p>
          <p>In addition to conducting our own review, we continue to cooperate fully with the FINMA and the UK FSA reviews on this incident and will report on the findings made available to us in the future. I know there is a desire to hear more details. Please don't confuse our willingness to provide more transparency around this issue with the limitations on what we can say at this juncture, given legal constraints and ongoing investigations. Third, we will review the effectiveness and efficiency of our bank's operating model. Fourth, as we move forward, I am committed to communicating on a timely and transparent manner with all our stakeholders, including shareholders, clients, employees and regulators.</p>
          <p>Finally, I, along with my colleagues on the GEB, are working closely in preparation for our Investor Day. Our Board of Directors recently reconfirmed that our Wealth Management, Wealth Management Americas, Investment Bank, Global Asset Management and Swiss retail and corporate businesses are essential and interdependent elements of our unique client franchise. We will leverage our competitive advantages in Wealth Management and strengthen its alignment with the less complex, more focused, profitable and competitive Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>In particular, we hope to give all of you a deeper understanding of our business strategy, both at group level and division level. Importantly, we will provide you with the appropriate metrics for measuring our progress and ultimate results. I want to note, however, that Investor Day is not an end unto itself. Rather, it marks another important milestone on our path forward. We expect to provide you with more detail on the business strategy, but are keenly aware that we will be judged on our ability to execute it.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to provide you with a brief overview of the third quarter results. This quarter was very difficult for the industry and UBS faced its own set of challenges. However, despite these challenges, we recorded a net profit of just over CHF1 billion. Both our Wealth Management businesses experienced positive net new money, which in total was broadly in line with the second quarter. While it was a very difficult trading environment for most of our Investment Bank's businesses, particularly credit-related ones, our foreign exchange business delivered very strong results on increased client activity.</p>
          <p>Our cost reduction program remained on track. Practical and strategic cost management will be even more important in the resource-constrained environment of the future, and you can expect us to remain vigilant on it.</p>
          <p>Our capital, liquidity and funding positions are sound. Our Basel II Tier 1 ratio improved to 18.4%. On a Basel 2.5 basis, the ratio was 13.2%. Now, our tangible book value increased 11% quarter-on-quarter to CHF11.34. Although the fourth quarter has commenced with increased evidence of strain to the financial system, we believe we are on the right track to manage the impact that this may create on our businesses.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn over the call to Tom, who will go through the Q3 results in more detail. Tom?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sergio, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to take you through the details of our results for the third quarter of 2011. I'll begin with these charts, which highlight some of the key developments in the market environment that impacted our businesses during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Equity markets experienced considerable volatility and most major indices closed at lower levels. We saw a similar rise in volatility across all asset classes. Continued uncertainties surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the weakening global economic outlook resulted in increased risk aversion and led to a significant widening of credit spreads for all segments of the credit market.</p>
          <p>The Swiss franc continued to strengthen, as it appreciated approximately 13% against other major currencies in the first half of the quarter. However, this trend reversed in the second half of the quarter, supported by the SNB's intervention in early September. The average rate of the Swiss franc during the quarter impacted our average invested asset levels, reducing fee income and other revenue streams in non-Swiss franc currencies.</p>
          <p>We reported CHF6.4 billion of group revenues for the quarter, down from CHF7.2 billion in the prior quarter. Adjusted for notable items, which I'll cover on the next slide, group revenues declined to CHF5.8 billion, reflecting mainly lower revenues in the Investment Bank. Due to these lower revenues, as well as the inclusion of restructuring charges in our cost base, our reported cost-to-income ratio increased to 84% in the quarter, highlighting the importance of the measures we've taken to adjust our cost base. In terms of profitability, this quarter marks the eighth consecutive quarter we've recorded a net profit.</p>
          <p>I'll now give more details on the notable items for the quarter. In our income statement and on a pre-tax basis, we recorded a loss of CHF1.85 billion related to the unauthorized trading incident in the Investment Bank. In addition, this incident resulted in a foreign currency translation loss recognized directly in equity of CHF102 million.</p>
          <p>As we communicated this morning, as a result of the unauthorized trading incident, we have determined that our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls of procedures were not effective on December 31st, 2010. We have taken and continue to take measures to address these control deficiencies. Nevertheless, we can confirm that our consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report fairly presented our financial position, the results of our operations and our cash flows for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 in accordance with IFRS.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we booked approximately CHF400 million in restructuring charges related to our cost reduction program. Due to a substantial widening of our credit spreads, we posted gains on own credit of almost CHF1.8 billion. This is slightly higher than our initial guidance when we expected it to be in the region of CHF1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, this quarter we sold our strategic investment portfolio of U.S. Treasuries and U.K. Gilts after yields fell substantially following the Fed's announcement of Operation Twist. We had originally created this portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year to hedge the negative effects on the bank's net interest income in anticipation of a prolonged period of extraordinarily low yields. This sale resulted in one-time gains of just over CHF700 million. Adjusted for these four notable items, our pre-tax profit was CHF730 million.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you can see the sensitivity of our reported results to currency movements. This quarter, the most significant effect was on our capital base. Our capital is predominantly in Swiss francs, while our risk-weighted assets are mostly in U.S. dollars. This mismatch creates volatility in our Tier 1 ratio, and we partially hedge the potential negative effects in order to mitigate the impact. This quarter, we took action to increase the effectiveness of these mitigation efforts. As a consequence, our capital base increased despite the weakening of the Swiss franc against the dollar.</p>
          <p>Excluding restructuring charges, total expenses decreased 9% or just short of CHF500 million this quarter, partially reflecting favorable currency translation effects. The decrease in costs also reflects lower salary and variable compensation and reductions in most G&amp;A categories. In the fourth quarter, we expect to book a U.K. Bank levy expense of approximately CHF100 million in the Investment Bank's G&amp;A expenses.</p>
          <p>As Sergio mentioned earlier, we are on track to achieve our goal of eliminating CHF2 billion from our cost base by 2013. Our efforts with this program prepare our expense base for today's market environment while ensuring that we're properly staffed to fully deliver for our clients. We will continue to invest in growth areas, including the Asia Pacific and Americas regions, the emerging markets, and in our Global Wealth Management franchise.</p>
          <p>I'd like to provide an explanation of the components of our tax line this quarter, which resulted in a net benefit of CHF40 million. Our third quarter year-to-date effective tax rate now stands at approximately 16%. We recorded Swiss deferred tax expenses of CHF309 million with respect to the amortization of previously recognized deferred tax assets. Additionally, we incurred a charge of CHF184 million as a result of the re-measurement of our Swiss DTAs on updated assumptions on sources of taxable income. We also incurred other current net tax expenses of CHF11 million for taxable profits in the quarter.</p>
          <p>These expenses were more than offset by a net tax benefit of CHF131 million related to the losses we incurred due to the unauthorized trading incident. And the benefit of CHF413 million arising from the write-up of DTAs for U.S. tax losses incurred in previous years. In the fourth quarter, we'll recognize an additional net benefit of approximately CHF50 million, representing the remaining quarter of the 2011 DTA re-measurement effect. We still expect our full-year effective tax rate to be below 20% as we had previously indicated.</p>
          <p>Our Wealth Management franchise performed well despite tough market conditions. Combined adjusted free tax profit is up approximately 14% on a year-to-date basis, highlighting effective execution by our management teams in these businesses. We attracted a total of CHF31 billion of net inflows in the first nine months of this year compared to net outflows of CHF22 billion over the same period last year. Advisor retention rates have improved, and we continue to be successful in attracting experienced advisors. We ended September of this year with over 11,100 advisors who managed nearly CHF1.4 trillion of invested assets.</p>
          <p>Our Wealth Management unit reported a pre-tax profit of CHF888 million. This result includes CHF433 million of gains on the sale of the strategic investment portfolio and CHF85 million of restructuring charges related to the cost reduction program. Excluding these two items, pre-tax profit was CHF540 million. Revenues adjusted for gains on the sale of the strategic investment portfolio declined 7% as a result of lower client activity levels as well as unfavorable market conditions.</p>
          <p>Asset-based fees declined on a lower invested asset base caused by the strengthening of the Swiss franc on an average basis during the quarter as well as the decline in global equity markets. Expenses were virtually flat quarter-on-quarter when adjusted for restructuring charges. We continue to selectively hire client advisors, in particular, in our strategic growth regions for this division, Asia Pacific and the emerging markets. As a result, our net client advisor head count increased by 49 to 4,252 at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net new money inflows were CHF3.8 billion, and we are comforted that they'll continue to come primarily from our key growth areas. On this chart, we show a revenue breakdown by each main category. As already mentioned, we experienced lower client activity levels which led to declines in transaction-based fees, similarly, a lower asset base to lower recurring fees. In addition, the numbers this quarter reflect the CHF51 million reclassification of year-to-date IPS revenues from transaction-based fees to trading income.</p>
          <p>Net interest income increased 4% from the prior quarter, primarily on higher treasury-related revenues. As a result of the sale of our strategic investment portfolio which I mentioned earlier, we expect to see some pressure on generation of interest income in the coming quarters while we evaluate alternative investment opportunities.</p>
          <p>The gross margin, when adjusted for gains on the sale of the strategic investment portfolio assets, remains stable at 97 basis points. Notwithstanding additional net new money and positive FX effects, invested assets declined by CHF28 billion and stood at CHF720 billion at the end of the quarter, mainly due to weak market performance. Our average invested assets declined 5% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>This slide shows a regional breakdown of invested assets with the respective net new money flows. Net inflows remain strong in our strategic growth areas of Asia-Pacific and the emerging markets, as well as globally from ultra-high net worth clients. Our European onshore business reported net outflows, mainly reflecting outflows of CHF1.5 billion related to the departure of advisors from a past acquisition in Germany. We expect to see further outflows of no more than CHF1 billion related to these advisors primarily in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management Americas, we continued to build on our recent success despite the challenging market environment and seasonal declines in activity. We reported a pre-tax profit of CHF139 million, compared with CHF140 million in the second quarter. In dollars, revenues increased 2% despite lower transaction-based income resulting from lower client activity. Costs were flat in dollar terms, and they included $15 million in net restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>We added 51 financial advisors in the quarters. This is a result of our targeted recruiting of successful advisors, as well as selective hiring of new financial advisors combined with continued low attrition levels. We attracted CHF4 billion of net new money. This compares with CHF2.6 billion in the prior quarter which included approximately CHF1.6 billion of outflows due to the April tax season. Net new money including dividends and interest was CHF8 billion. This is a very good result, strongly fueled by advisors that have been UBS for more than one year.</p>
          <p>This is a breakdown of divisional revenues in U.S. dollars by revenue category. The overall positive trend we have seen over the last two years has continued in the third quarter, despite a significant reduction in transaction-based fees. We saw higher net interest, trading and fee income, as well as incremental realized gains of $8 million from WMA's available-for-sale portfolio.</p>
          <p>Net interest income this quarter included a benefit of $24 million as a result of a reclassification adjustment from other comprehensive income related to mortgage-backed securities held in our AFS portfolio. WMA's balance sheet-driven revenue initiatives continue to show progress. Net interest income increased due to higher client balances and wider spreads in securities-based lending. In addition, we continued to see steady growth in our Jumbo and Super Jumbo Mortgage business with our clients.</p>
          <p>Financial advisor productivity when measured as revenue per advisor continued to improve in dollar terms. Invested assets declined by 8% this quarter, driven by negative market performance which led to a reduction in invested assets per advisor. Despite this drop, we remain the industry leader in invested assets per advisor, reflecting our focus on the high and ultra-high net worth segments. Also, with approximately $900,000 in annualized revenue per advisor, we are now the industry leader in this metric, reflecting our ability to attract and focus on the most productive FAs in the industry.</p>
          <p>We have successfully implemented a focused strategy in a business that many industry observers thought was all about scale. We are now the most productive advisor force in the Americas, and our number one positions highlight the fact that our focused strategy is working, and we expect it to continue to benefit us in the future. The IB reported a loss for the quarter of CHF650 million. Excluding gains on own credit and the loss related to the unauthorized trading incident as well as restructuring charges, the loss was CHF328 million.</p>
          <p>We saw a reduction in overall risk taking in this quarter in light of volatile markets. And we're pleased about the progress we've made in further reducing our residual risk exposures. We commuted the majority of the monoline-wrapped collateralized loan obligations and disposed of the underlying assets. This reduced our CLO exposure insured by monolines by approximately $6.4 billion in notional terms.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, our exposure to monoline insured assets was reduced by $6.9 billion or 57% over the quarter. In addition, we reduced our student loan auction rate securities portfolio by $2.4 billion. In aggregate, the reduction of residual risk positions did not significantly impact our reported pre-tax results.</p>
          <p>Since most of the revenues we generate in the Investment Bank are denominated in U.S. dollars, we are providing you with a year-on-year comparison in both Swiss francs and U.S. dollars. Adjusted for the two notable items, revenues declined 32% in Swiss francs or 18% in dollar terms and reflect the difficult market conditions we experienced this quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were just over CHF2 billion and included CHF238 million of restructuring charges. Excluding these charges, expenses declined 18% from the third quarter of 2010 in Swiss franc terms while there was no significant change in U.S. dollar terms. Revenues and equities declined 30% year-on-year on a recorded basis in Swiss francs and 16% in U.S. dollars. I'll comment in U.S. dollar terms for each of the business lines.</p>
          <p>Despite stable market share and broadly similar levels of commission revenues, cash equities revenues declined 5%. This is primarily a result of weaker trading revenue. Derivatives and equity-linked performance decreased 55% mainly as a result of trading losses in volatile market conditions. Regionally, the Americas delivered a stronger performance than a year ago while performance in APAC and EMEA was significantly lower. Equity-linked revenues were impacted by reduced valuations and volumes.</p>
          <p>In Prime Services, revenues increased by 12% with commission increases in the clearing business and improved securities lending revenues. In fixed income, revenues decreased 23% in Swiss francs or 7% in U.S. dollar terms. Our Macro business delivered a strong performance with significantly higher revenues than a year ago. Foreign exchange revenues benefited from increased market volatility and good client flows. We believe that the investments we made to enhance our electronic platform &#x2013; electronic trading platform, also contributed to this strong result.</p>
          <p>The rates business also improved with strong results in derivatives and short-term interest rates. Additionally, results in Macro included a loss of CHF96 million as a result of changes in the valuation approach for a substantial portion of our collateralized derivatives. Our credit business reported negative revenues as we actively reduced risk across all regions and incurred mark-to-market losses. However, we did see a positive contribution from our Corporate Lending and Structured Credit businesses.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets revenues were also negative on lower client activity and market driven trading losses. A positive performance in FX was more than offset by a weak performance in credit and rates. Other FICC revenues were CHF206 million. These included a DVA gain of almost CHF400 million on our derivatives portfolio and a positive contribution from our commodities business.</p>
          <p>Due to continued deterioration in the market sentiment and widening of credit spreads. We booked approximately CHF400 million of additional credit valuation adjustments against our remaining monoline exposures, which were partially offset by related hedges. Other FICC revenues also include gains of CHF245 million from disposals of loans and receivables, mainly collateralized loan obligations. These gains were largely offset by hedge termination losses related to residual risk positions.</p>
          <p>IBD revenues before risk management charges declined 14% in Swiss franc terms, but increased by 4% in U.S. dollar terms as we reported approximately CHF600 million in revenues this quarter. Our advisory revenues increased 9% in U.S. dollar terms. Both our rank and market share rose, in particular, in EMEA and Asia, ex-Japan. Overall market activity was subdued as a result of economic uncertainties.</p>
          <p>The performance in ECM increased 61% outpacing the overall fee pool, resulting in a higher rank and market share. Fixed income capital markets revenues declined 19%, due to reduced debt capital market activity and lower revenues in leveraged finance.</p>
          <p>A number of deals were not completed this quarter due to market uncertainties. We like the outlook for our advisory business. And regarding our pipeline, we feel we're well positioned for when the markets reopen and confidence returns. We reported negative revenues of CHF288 million in other fee income and risk management. In comparison to the previous year, this amount includes total risk management premiums in line with the revised allocation methodology we implemented in the first quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Global Asset Management delivered a profit of CHF79 million or CHF91 million after adjusting for restructuring charges, which is CHF17 million lower than in the prior quarter. Revenues fell 10% from the second quarter due to lower management and performance fees. Net management fees fell on a lower invested asset base, also negatively impacted by the strengthening Swiss franc in the first part of the quarter. Operating expenses excluding restructuring charges decreased 8% from the second quarter, broadly in line with revenues.</p>
          <p>Gross margin declined to 30 basis points from 32 as a result of lower management and performance fees. Net new money inflows from third parties excluding money markets were CHF1.5 billion compared with CHF5.7 billion in the second quarter. Also excluding money markets, we saw net new money outflows of CHF2.8 billion from clients of our Wealth Management businesses.</p>
          <p>Retail and Corporate reported CHF683 million in pre-tax profit. This result includes CHF289 million of gains on the sale of the strategic investment portfolio and CHF24 million of restructuring charges. Excluding these items, pre-tax profit decreased 1% to CHF418 million. We booked CHF73 million of incremental collective loan loss provision in the quarter for credit loss expenses related primarily to Swiss corporate clients affected by the strengthening Swiss franc.</p>
          <p>The underlying result reflects a 4% increase in revenues on higher client activity levels and volume growth and 7% lower expenses. Both loan balances and deposits increased slightly in the quarter. Loans stood at CHF137 billion and deposits at CHF117 billion at the end of the quarter. Higher deposit balances coupled with higher treasury-related revenues led to an increase in the net interest margin.</p>
          <p>As you have seen on the previous chart, our lending portfolio balances have been pretty stable between CHF135 billion and CHF138 billion over the last three years. Our loan portfolio in Switzerland remains well diversified across regions and counterparties. The overall economic environment is one of the key drivers for stability of the retail and corporate business and the biggest driver for credit losses of corporate and private clients. In recent years, our credit losses have been at historically low levels.</p>
          <p>However, as we noted at our Investor Day last year, given economic uncertainties and the strong Swiss franc, over the cycle, we expect corporate credit losses to increase to more normalized levels. Our increase in collective loan loss provision this quarter reflects this. Nevertheless, we are very comfortable with both the size and the quality of our lending portfolio.</p>
          <p>The corporate center reported a loss of CHF160 million. The quarterly revaluation of our option to buy the SNB StabFund's equity led to a loss of CHF209 million. As the fund has a broad range of asset-backed securities, the option's change in value typically coincides with the change in value of the residential and commercial MBS markets in the U.S. and Europe. This loss was partially offset by a CHF78 million gain on the sale of a property in Switzerland and by CHF35 million in treasury income.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel II basis improved to 18.4% at the end of September on stable risk-weighted assets of CHF207 billion. This is slightly higher than the ratio we expected when we provided a preview of third quarter results on October 4th. We increased our Basel II Tier 1 capital ion the third quarter by approximately CHF700 million to CHF38.1 billion. This was partially a result of the action we took this quarter to reduce Tier 1 ratio volatility which resulted in a higher contribution from FX effects to our capital base, offsetting the equivalent effect on risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>Our Basel II Tier 1 ratio was temporarily affected by elevated market risk RWAs due to the impact of the unauthorized trading incident. Although the impact of this event will drop out of the market risk VaR time series after 60 days, there will be an increase in operational risk RWAs as this event will be captured in the operational risk model.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding adverse FX effects on risk-weighted assets and excluding the impact from the unauthorized trading incident, risk-weighted assets decreased quarter-on-quarter, reflecting active risk reduction. On a Basel 2.5 basis, Tier 1 capital was CHF37.5 billion or 13.2% of risk-weighted assets, which were CHF284 billion. Today, our capital ratios remain among the highest in the industry and we'll continue to maintain a strong capital position as we believe it provides the foundation of our business model.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet increased by approximately CHF200 billion during the quarter to CHF1.45 trillion. This masks significant reduction of risks in our trading, as well as legacy assets, as almost all of the increase is a result of the spike in the replacement values in our derivatives book. The factors that drove the increase in PRVs were higher market volatility, changes in interest rates and FX movements. Our lending assets increased by CHF73 billion, mainly on increased liquid assets held as cash and balances with central banks.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the reduction in risk concentrations we achieved this quarter. Our portfolio of student loan auction rate securities was reduced from $9.5 billion to $7.1 billion. As an indication, the remaining exposure translates into roughly CHF18 billion of risk-weighted assets under Basel III.</p>
          <p>As I already described in the IB results, we significantly reduced our exposure to monoline insurers this quarter. On a notional basis, our exposure is now $5.2 billion compared to $12 billion in the prior quarter. Notwithstanding the increase in our monoline CVA due to widening credit spreads, our net exposure to monoline insurers deceased to $1 billion from $1.3 billion at the end of the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>This chart shows our exposure to sovereign, bank and other counterparties in selected European countries not rated AAA. We also provide you a breakdown between banking and traded products. Traded products are marked-to-market and already reflect the fair values of these positions. In total, our exposure to these countries decreased quarter-on-quarter on a gross and net basis. It remains limited and is not a cause for concern.</p>
          <p>Despite a difficult quarter, we're pleased to see that our book value increased by approximately CHF4.6 billion over the quarter and our equity attributable to UBS shareholders stood at CHF51.8 billion. This was an 11% increase in tangible book value per share. The increase was mainly due to the positive effects of CHF3.1 billion in other comprehensive income and the quarterly net profit of CHF1 billion.</p>
          <p>Other comprehensive income includes fair value gains on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of CHF1.5 billion, positive currency translation effects of CHF1.4 billion and fair value gains on financial investments available for sale of CHF200 million.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your time and attention. From our perspective, the key takeaways from our presentation today are the following: we generated CHF1 billion of net profit in a very challenging quarter for us and the industry; implementation of our cost reduction program is on track; our capital liquidity and funding positions are sound; and as a management team, we're working together to prepare for our future.</p>
          <p>We're looking forward to seeing you at our Investor Day. And we're now happy to take your questions on the third quarter results.</p>

          <p>Just before we commence Q&amp;A, I can see that we've got quite a few on the list in the queue already. So, please, could I ask you to restrict the questions that you have to just three so that we can get through all of you?</p>

          <p>The first question for today is from Mr. Jon Peace from Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. I have questions in two areas, please. The first one is one is on the Wealth Management gross margin. It's remarkably stable given the market weakness. Was there anything unusual in there like hedging gains or should we consider this a more sustainable level now given your pricing actions?</p>
          <p>And the second question I had was just on the usual breakout of expenses you've given to us on slide seven. I wonder if you could give us any more color on what the, sort of, clean run rate was of variable comp expenses? Is it about CHF500 million a quarter evenly through the year, or is it lumpy? And have you increased your deferral percentage in terms of variable comp in 2011 versus 2010? I'm just trying to get towards an idea of how philosophically do you share the unauthorized trading loss between shareholders and staff without unduly hurting either the share price or staff retention. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for those questions, Jon. So, on the ROA, the ROA was quite stable in the quarter. If you noticed, the trading category was up 2 basis points. And on the market volatility, we did see clients increasing their trading activity by converting sale of risk assets into cash during the quarter. So, stability is correct based on the increase in trading activity during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the variable comp line, we accrue the variable comp in line with our performance during the course of the quarter in each one of the business divisions. And I would also remind you that we do have a substantial portion of the expense that's based on the amortization of prior-year awards. And so, the decline that you saw reflects the decline in underlying activity during the course of the quarter.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I've got three questions. The first one is related to your statement or the chairman's statement, Mr. Villiger, where he clearly states that "in addition to serving corporate, sovereign and institutional clients," i.e., where he talks about the IB and how it will look like. Can you &#x2013; since this is a public statement, can you just briefly talk about why institutional business is going to be seen as core and why not just run it purely to support the Private Bank or the Wealth Management business?</p>
          <p>The second question is I read through your claw-back information but I didn't fully understand it. And if you could maybe highlight to me how the claw-backs actually work at UBS? And the third one is more strategic. How is the new or the chairman to come in 2013 involved in the strategy and within the management currently on an operational basis or is he not involved at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess I'll take the question on why the institutional business is extremely important to have a strong investment bank capability. We &#x2013; our aim is to have access to all the client base and having strong capabilities with corporate, institutional, sovereign or national clients is key to create the liquidity and the diversification necessary to manage successfully an investment bank. The real issue is that we will focus on clients. We will focus on clients where we think we can add value and it's not a matter of excluding any segments, but rather trying to fit the client structure into our capabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you think you can still make money with a smaller, more focused client business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that there's a scenario in which we think that we can make money. And, again, I think by selecting carefully the business areas in which we want to compete and be seen as a strong player, we will be able to also to attract the client base that is necessary to sustain this business.</p>
          <p>So, going into the strategy. Of course, Mr. Weber is not going to take on any official role until early this year, but he's already advising in an informal basis, of course, without going into any conflicts on what we are doing. And so, the communication is very fluid with the entire board and also with Mr. Weber.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Kian, on your questions on claw-backs on compensation, on our deferred compensation programs for individuals, we do have a Harmful Acts clause and so as we review the individuals who are accountable for the incident, we'll obviously be reviewing also whether or not the Harmful Acts clause applies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I understand it, it impacts people who make CHF2 million and above. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's not correct. You may be confusing that, Kian. So, the Harmful Acts clause applies to individuals. We also had a special EOP plan for our deferred compensation plan for risk takers, which actually includes profitability calculations on the performance of their business division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Next question from Mrs. Fiona Swaffield from RBC. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I had questions in two areas. One was on the risk-weighted assets and you gave a helpful slide showing that the reduction in the auction rate securities and what is under Basel III, I think you said CHF18 billion. What would it have been before you sold? So, are you basically now accelerating your RWA mitigation plan of CHF100 billion? And also, could you tell us what the FX impact would have been in Q3 on the RWAs? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second is just on the Swiss or the net new money. The Swiss money is a small net outflow that's been very positive the last two quarters. Is there anything unusual in there? Is it seasonal, anything to do with the trading loss, any kind of view on why there's minus CHF0.6 million? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And thanks for that question, Fiona. On the student loan slide, the sales that we made were largely in the category of rated triple &#x2013; oh, sorry, BB minus or above. So, the RWA reduction was moderate. It was not an exceptionally large amount. When looking at the Swiss net new money question, there is nothing particularly notable in those flows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of currency on risk-weighted assets, would we be able to have the number of what it would be if currency had been stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Next question from Mr. Huw van Steenis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Three questions; first, how has your experience of the Q3 trading changed your view about the strategy going forward, in particular, the losses in emerging market trading and fixed income? Has that changed your view about the scope of EM?</p>
          <p>Number two, I was surprised in Investment Bank that the exceptional loss hadn't actually adjusted the cost base based on the way, at least, I've read your financial statement. And I'm just wondering how you came to that decision in the light of maybe shareholders wondering whether maybe staffers, as Kian alluded to, maybe should have taken some of the pain. And number three, how has your deleveraging process impacted your view about the year when you can restart paying dividends? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Huw, on the first question, I think that for sure when we will be able to also disclose and be more transparent about what's happened, you will understand that this exercise, this incident has nothing to do with segment management or activities. So, there is no lesson to be taken out of any businesses other than discipline and focus, if necessary, at all levels, in the front and the back end when people exercise their duty. So, I don't think it's an issue of the segment but rather of how to manage the day-to-day operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Huw, to your question on compensation, one thing I would note, we did have a substantial portion, it's over half of the accrual for the group as a whole in the second quarter related to variable comp has to do with that amortization of prior year awards. So, there actually is a floor on the amount of flex that you have in the compensation expense in any one particular quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the deleveraging process and whether or not we have any insight on future prospects for dividends, that's a topic that's related to the things that we'll discuss on Investor Day in New York.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Next question from Mr. Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Thanks very much. I have a couple of questions and they are mostly relate to slide 31 of the presentation. On your tangible book value formation, can you just elaborate on the CHF1.5 billion positive impact of the cash flow hedge, what the main drivers of that is? I guess just the lower yields, but I was just wondering if there's anything other than that.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the contribution from the DTA effect on equity items, you had a write-up of CHF400 million. I was just wondering whether you'll reassess your &#x2013; revalue your DTAs again or whether that's just the effect of the normal roll forward, I guess?</p>
          <p>The second question I have is on capital. I think it's great that your simple leverage ratio fell again. You're now, I think, 21 times levered to roughly half of some of your closest competitors. I was just wondering, you made a passing comment during your presentation saying that you expect the, it says here, the capital buildup to continue and your capital ratios to continue to increase. At what level do you think that stops? Where do you want to see it fall?</p>
          <p>And the final question I wanted to ask and I'm not sure you'll be willing to answer this, but I don't think it's giving too much away ahead of your Investor Day. When it comes to refocusing the group, obviously, most of what the client business is on the private bank. I was just wondering if you could share with us as to how long do you think that process is going to take. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for those questions, Jernej. I think I'll take the first three and maybe Sergio will want to take the last one. On the cash flow hedge, there's actually not much to that beyond what you know. There's the combination of, one, the decrease in rates and also, two, changes in currency valuation that affect the value of the cash flow hedges. So, they're primarily fixed receiver slots.</p>
          <p>On the DTA, the question on the DTA, the CHF400 million write-up, that was part of our annual process of revaluation of the DTAs. We revalued, specifically, the DTA the parent bank branch in the United States.</p>
          <p>The third question that you had was on capital ratios and how long will we continue to build them and to what levels. Well, we'll certainly have more detail on that when we get to Investor Day, but I would tell you that we continue to remain focused on building our capital ratios. And, as we noted, we do think that having a strong capital ratio is the foundation of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, from a strategic standpoint of view, clearly, moving forward, our goal is to continue and be the preeminent wealth management franchise in the world, together with a very strong presence in Switzerland in our core businesses. This is the core so from that standpoint of view, the decision is taken. What we will do also, clearly, is we want to have a strong, profitable, focused Investment Bank and Asset Management businesses to support this strategy.</p>
          <p>So, it's an evolution. We will not do anything quick and destroying shareholder value or any other things that may prevent, so it's a path for the future. There are things that we can do very quickly and things that will take time. But the strategy in that sense is clearly moving in this direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Christopher Wheeler from Mediobanca. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everybody. Couple of questions, the first one is on equity trading revenues. Even with allowing for dollar declines, about 40% decline quarter-on-quarter, and obviously that contrasts rather markedly with the performance of some of your U.S. competitors who did considerably better but, also, perhaps Deutsche who announced this morning. I see that you &#x2013; obviously, commodities is a big factor there. But could you talk about that business because, clearly, that is one of your strengths. And, obviously, this looks like it wasn't the best quarter.</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, perhaps following up on what Huw asked earlier, if we look at the Investment Bank compensation cost, slipping out the restructuring, I think the costs fell about 21% while revenue was down 42% before the unauthorized trading issue. Are we really at the bottom with that sort of CHF1.2 billion of compensation costs, where there is no flexibility on that in terms of variable? Is that fair to say? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, to Chris, thanks for those questions. First on equities, when I look at the performance, I wouldn't quite characterize it the way that you did. We did have a big decline in derivatives on trading losses due to the volatile market conditions of 55% year-over-year. But in cash we were only down 5%. We had stable market share and similar levels of commission revenue to what we had in the prior year. Prime Services was also up 12%, and we saw improvements in a few of our product lines. So, as a result, I would say that I do think that despite the performance in derivatives, we actually held up quite well in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding the compensation levels, as I mentioned earlier, I do believe that we've accrued appropriately for the quarter on incentives and, obviously, the bonus process is one that's not complete until the year is complete.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But to be at that kind of level despite the decline in revenues, one must assume you had virtually no flexibility of building in any kind of variable compensation elements into that, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'd say, Chris, is we obviously are in a competitive market environment for talent and we need to make sure we have the flexibility to be in a position to deal with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a final question really on flows, Fiona touched on the Swiss flows being a little bit weaker than you've seen. Can you perhaps talk about where we are at the moment? Obviously, the trading incident occurred towards the end of the quarter, are you concerned of any impact on flows, or at the moment, is everything still fairly stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, on flows, I think the largest driver of flows is really going to be the economic and market environment. And we did refer to some of the headwinds, we think, that exist in our outlook statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was the amount that you released during the quarter. I think you said you only sold the BB or higher tranches. My question is what's left below that? What's on the high risk &#x2013; on the high-risk tranches?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning. Couple of questions. Firstly, on the equity derivatives, you did quite well relative to peers the last time the VIX spiked in the second quarter 2010, whereas you didn't so well versus peers this time round. I'm just wondering whether this is as simple as you were structurally short volatility when it spiked and there was nothing you could do about it, so it was just the overall &#x2013; only position going into the quarter on your inventory and had to suck it up or whether this was repeated mistakes or errors during the quarter as things moved up and down?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly on the DTAs, given the fact that you did see a revaluation of the historic U.S. losses in this quarter despite the pretty poor revenue, presumably, for that business. Should we see that as encouraging for your ability to recognize further DTA markups in future years despite the fact your franchise looks to be going under some adjustments downwards versus your prior expectations? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, thanks for those questions. On the question on derivatives, one, I'd say, our client revenues held up relatively well versus 3Q10. And so, I think it's best to characterize the decline there as the fact that our positioning relative to the activity in the market was not the best.</p>
          <p>On your question on the DTAs, if I understood it correctly, in our revaluation process for this quarter, we did consider a forward look, which as you may know, we go through a one-year operating plan and a five-year strategic planning cycle, and we do consider that five-year strategic plan in our revaluation of the DTAs each year.</p>

          <p>Hello. Good morning. It's Matt Spick from Deutsche Bank. I'm sorry to keep asking about the DTAs but my understanding of the audits in this &#x2013; these net of provisions is that essentially your auditors will take or apply a haircut to your future expected profits given a certain number of years, so I think it's five years. So, to write the U.S. parent bank DTA up, either you've added more years into the calculation as you roll forward, you've increased your profit estimate, or you've reduced the discount.</p>
          <p>And perhaps I'm just being thick but I don't feel that I understand which of those three has actually happened? And I guess going back to Matt Clark's question, I would have thought that your five-year strategic plan should be revised down at some point given your own negative outlook, so I'm still really struggling to see how the U.S. parent bank can write up its DTAs.</p>
          <p>And then just a second question, could you remind us what the stock of deferred compensation is because presumably the accounting for that would be that if a number of employees left as part of the Investor Day, purely hypothetically, but on the accounting side of that, you would have to charge that in one go at that point of announcement. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, Matt, I'm sorry that I haven't been clear in explaining the DTA. So, first, to look at the parent bank, in particular, the parent bank, we actually had no DTAs booked at all prior to this. So, this is the first booking of the DTA against the parent bank.</p>
          <p>Second, you did recall correctly previous explanations that we've had of our process surrounding the DTAs where we do take a &#x2013; where in the past, we have taken a discount to revenue assumptions. In the past, that had been a 50% haircut on the investment bank's revenues and the other legal entities other than the parent bank. And it was a 25% haircut on Wealth Management Americas. So, I'd say I think we've been quite conservative on the haircuts. And one could argue that as you get greater clarity on a strategic plan, that could include a less volatile investment bank, one could reduce haircuts if that was the method that you were applying. And your second question, I'm sorry, Matt, I forgot that one.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for the explanation on the DTA. That was very helpful. The second question was, could you give any guidance on what the stock of deferred compensation is that's still outstanding? You've given some guidance on what the quarterly charge is running at, but could you tell us what the stock is? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have roughly CHF1.5 billion outstanding, but I think to your question, now that I recall it, I wouldn't want you to draw the conclusion that you might have been drawing in asking the question which was, if we &#x2013; you're correct in asserting that if we have a reduction in staff, then we have to roll forward the expense on the deferred compensation and incur that as part of the restructuring costs. You seemed to assume that we would announce reductions in staff at Investor Day and I wouldn't want you to go into that with that assumption.</p>

          <p>The last question for today is from Mr. Kinner Lakhani from Citi. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. So, I had a couple of questions. Firstly, given the kind of funding pressures in the market, just wanted to get a sense of how you are positioned, whether you're a beneficiary or not. And also if you're seeing any kind of impact from pressure on the U.S. dollar funding markets?</p>
          <p>And the second question was really to kind of focus on the credit trading part of the FICC franchise. It's historically been a very, very volatile source of revenues, and just wondering your thoughts on why UBS potentially is experiencing more volatility than the peer group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kinner for those questions. In terms of funding we actually feel quite comfortable with our funding. I think we had a slide 38, I think that's in the Appendix that goes through our funding sources by currency and also by type.</p>
          <p>We do benefit and I think many would envy the high percentage of customer deposits that we have as a source of funding, and it's broadly diversified across all currencies, and in particular in the dollar funding markets, we do have more in customer deposit funding than we do from interbank and money market paper issued. Also, I do think given our low exposure to the European countries rated AAA and below, I also think that in times of stress in those markets that we would be seen as a safe haven, and we have been seen as a safe haven as a result of that.</p>
          <p>Your question on our credit performance, and why we appear to be having more volatile performance than others, I would also note that our exposures we've had that when we went into the second quarter, we had a high exposure at the beginning of the quarter. We obviously took down the exposure during the &#x2013; as we moved through the second quarter, but obviously not enough because we did experience negative revenues in credit in 3Q. However, it is in credit trading, in particular in the emerging markets is particularly important to our Wealth Management clients.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And just to come back on your point on customer deposits, I missed the last slide, just on the U.S. dollar customer deposits, which division is that mainly coming from, the Wealth Management Americas, or also Wealth Management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's both divisions but the majority is from the non-U.S. division.</p>
