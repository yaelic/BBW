          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding. Good morning. This is Yvonne welcoming you to ING's Q2 2011 Conference Call. Before handing this conference over to Mr. Jan Hommen, Chief Executive Officer of ING Group, let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comments are subject to a number of current views, assumptions and variables, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and inflation rates, movement in security markets including equity markets, and underlying economic conditions and changes. These are set out in greater detail in our public filings, which we would urge you to read. The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered by unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables.</p>
          <p>Good morning, Jan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Welcome everyone, to the ING second quarter results call. First of all, I understand there were some problems with the website this morning, but in the meantime they have been fixed. So we apologize if you had trouble getting access, but it should be okay now.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to report that the Bank posted another solid quarter, and that the Insurance company showed significant result improvements as initiatives we introduced last year continued to gain traction. We also made great strides in restructuring the Group. We paid &#x20AC;3 billion to the state in May, announced that we were selling ING Direct US for $9 billion and ING Car Lease for &#x20AC;700 million. And also we announced the sale of our Latin American Life Pension and Investment Management business for &#x20AC;2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>I will talk you through the presentation, now and afterwards go Koos Timmermans, Patrick Flynn and Matt Rider are here with me and we are all available to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>ING Group reported an underlying net profit of &#x20AC;1.528 million in the second quarter, up 19.7% from a year earlier, and up 4.4% from the previous quarter. Results on the Bank posted a solid underlying result before tax of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, and the Bank results benefited from a healthy interest margin. We had higher client balances, we had lower risk costs, and we have an improvement in the expenses versus the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Bank results were negatively impacted by &#x20AC;187 million as a result of impairments of Greek government bonds, which largely explain the lower results if you compare Q2 last year versus this year.</p>
          <p>The underlying results of Insurance company showed a significant improvement compared with a year ago and also compared with the first quarter of this year. Operating results were up by 82.5% to &#x20AC;690 million, and the pre-tax result increased to &#x20AC;673 million despite the &#x20AC;123 million impairments on the Greek government bonds.</p>
          <p>We also maintained strong capital ratios, even after repaying the Dutch state the &#x20AC;3 billion in May. Core Tier 1 of the Bank was 9.4, and including the announced divestments of ING Direct U.S. and Car Lease and REIM, the pro forma Core Tier 1 would have been 10.7. The Insurance solvency ratio improved to 252% at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On Slide Number 3, you can see that ING Bank second quarter results were very solid, down from a year ago, but due entirely to the Greek bond impairments, and an &#x20AC;86 million gain on the sale of an equity stake we had in India last year in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Insurance showed a strong increase as performance improvement and incentives are gaining traction. The operating result of &#x20AC;690 million was ahead by 83% from the second quarter year ago, and 35% from the previous quarter, and were driven by higher investments and by technical margins.</p>
          <p>Underlying results of &#x20AC;673 million included the impairment of &#x20AC;123 million of Greek government bonds. For the Group, that left the underlying profits of &#x20AC;1.528 billion, that was up 19.7%; and net profit after tax of &#x20AC;1.507 billion, which included a negative &#x20AC;22 million from divestment and discontinued operations on special items. If I add to that the after-tax impairment of Greek bonds of &#x20AC;231 million, then the net results would have been &#x20AC;1.738 billion, so a significant number.</p>
          <p>On Slide 4 you see the exposure to Southern European sovereigns, impacted negatively by the impairments we took on Greek government bonds. We have taken impairment on the exposure of bonds that we have maturing before 2020. And this means that we still need to impair the market value under IFRS rules, which had a negative impact on the results of &#x20AC;187 million for the Bank and &#x20AC;123 million for the Insurance company. So the impairment was done back to market value.</p>
          <p>Slide 5. You see that when we compare the ambition that was set in 2009 with the ambition we have for 2013, we are making very good progress. We are ahead so far on underlying income. We are doing, I think, relatively well on the cost income ratio, although it went up. But if you eliminate the market impacts, it is down to 54.3% in the first half of this year. Our target still is and we maintain our long-term target to be 50%.</p>
          <p>We see that the underlying risk cost were at the normalized level of 44 basis points in the first half of this year. And you see that the return on equity improved significantly on an IFRS basis 12.7%. And if you look at it based on the original Core Tier 1 of 7.5% at the time that we made the plan, it would have been 18.6%. So a very good performance I would think here.</p>
          <p>Insurance, a clear progress on the ambition that we have set for 2013. Investment margin, investment spreads went up to 99 basis points. Expenses, administrative expenses, came down to 38.9%; a little bit of help here from one-time events, but still a good improvement. Our sales were &#x2013; has been lagging and we are paying a lot of attention to sales, but I must say compared with the first half last year, more &#x2013; a little bit better than the first half last year, more or less at the same level.</p>
          <p>And then the return on equity, I am very pleased with that one, that we are getting into territories that are I think quite respectable; 8.4%.</p>
          <p>On Page 7, you see the Core Tier 1 developments that we start at December 31 with 9.6. You know that we paid the state &#x20AC;3 billion. We generated capital for 0.7%. So we ended up at 9.4, and if we include the divestments we have already announced and the impact of that on our capital, then we would have shown 10.7%, not including yet the addition that we expect for earnings during the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Page 8 shows the sale of our Latin American Insurance and IM businesses to GrupoSura for &#x20AC;2.7 billion. Not included in the transaction is our ownership, 36% ownership, in the Brazilian Insurance company, Sul America. But anyway you look at it, I think we did quite well. We got a good price for this, and at the same time we found, I believe, a very good buyer for the business who has, with the addition that they have already, I think a very good position in Latin America to be one of the premier insurance and pension management companies in the region.</p>
          <p>When you look at Page 9, you see the strong capital generation of the Bank that we used to pay the Dutch state, and we aim to do that some time in May next year, in May 2012. And then if you assume that the proceeds of our Latin American operations will stay within insurance, then the transaction will reduce the leverage in the insurance holding company by &#x20AC;2.8 billion. And that's an important milestone that we prepare for two IPOs; one in the U.S. and one for our Asian Insurance companies. And then the proceeds from the IPOs, we will use to pay back the double average that we have in the Group.</p>
          <p>Our separation process is on track. We call that our readiness program. That is really on track. We are basically at where we should be. There is no delays, no hiccups, no major hiccups at least. We have spent so far this year &#x20AC;51 million in the first half. We did &#x20AC;31 million in the second quarter and we expect that the total will be about &#x20AC;200 million for the year.</p>
          <p>Also we have started preparing for IPO. We have already made some expense. But these are non-regret expense that we have made so far, and that's about &#x20AC;10 million. We expect that could run up to &#x20AC;50 million. It has to do with, let's say, preparing U.S. GAAP statements and things like that.</p>
          <p>We also announced today some major announcements in the management board, announced that Eric Boyer, our Vice Chairman of the Bank will be retiring October 1. Koos Timmermans, our Chief Risk Officer, will become the Vice Chairman in the Bank; and Wilfred Nagel will become the Chief Risk Officer. And we'll take a cautious position in the various boards and the management board Bank and Insurance company until Wilfred has been confirmed by the shareholders, which we expect in the annual meeting next year. Patrick Flynn at the holding company level will be responsible for the Group risk activities, but of course Wilfred will be the Chief Risk Officer and be in all the meetings.</p>
          <p>And I am very happy with these nominations. Eric has been looking at retiring already for some time. We have been convincing him not to do it until now, but the time has come for Eric, and he has been a great performer in ING and we thank him tremendously for what he has done for ING.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the Bank. You see at the performance of the Bank that the underlying pre-tax results of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, including &#x20AC;187 million of impairments for Greek bonds. And on loan losses, we added &#x20AC;370 million, 47 basis points in the quarter, really at normalized levels.</p>
          <p>We anticipate going forward that the losses will be lower than the average for last year. Interest margin still healthy at 142 basis points. Interest results were at &#x20AC;3.350 billion. And the margin development you can see in the lower side of the slide, and you can see also that I think we did quite well in holding up our interest margin. We see a little of slippage here in particular in the Retail business in the Netherlands and Belgium, but we got some positive contribution from our direct activities and in international.</p>
          <p>Also good performance on lending and on funds entrusted to the Bank, and the increased lending activities in our Mortgage business, both in the Netherlands as well as in ING Direct. Not only the Netherlands also Belgium we picked up more activities in the mortgage markets.</p>
          <p>Expenses declined if you compare them with the first quarter. In fact we had two consecutive quarters of decline. The income &#x2013; the cost income ration went up slightly, but at 54.6%, that is excluding market-related volatility, I think is okay. And as I said earlier, we continue to strive for the 50% in the longer run.</p>
          <p>Also I must say that given the circumstances, the economic environment and the financial markets as they are, we are very vigilant on costs. In fact we will be stepping that up. We have taken in the past significant reductions. I cannot exclude them, but at this moment, we have nothing to announce here, but we will be extremely careful on hiring. In fact we will be looking at every vacancy we have very carefully.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, we will continue to look at how can we be very stingy with project approvals and purchasing activities to make sure that if the economy turns the wrong way then we are well prepared for that.</p>
          <p>You see our risk costs, they were 47 basis points. And as I said earlier, we expect that going forward they will be at the level of the &#x2013; a little below the average of last year.</p>
          <p>On Page 18, Slide 18, you see our non-performing loans that remain stable at 2.1%. As the risk costs were &#x20AC;38 million higher here than the first quarter and it was mainly driven by the mid corporates and the SME segments in Retail Benelux and the ING Real Estate Finance activities. And the latter one was mainly due by two cases; the specific files we had in the Netherlands and in Australia.</p>
          <p>And on the right-hand of the slide, you can see that the Bank's non-performing loans as a percent remain stable at 2.1%, and the areas that showed an improvement, except for Real Estate Finance and leasing and factoring, they showed a slight increase.</p>
          <p>Looking at Slide 19, you see our funding. We have been very active lately in our long-term funding. The remaining exposure that we have in 2011 is quite manageable. And what we have done here, we have really I think made the funding point of our balance sheet stronger by having more long-term debt, and that really has helped our liquidity position as well.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to insurance. A strong improvement in results in the second quarter. Operating result of &#x20AC;690 million; non-operating result was negative &#x20AC;17 million, and that included a &#x20AC;123 million impairment on the Greek government bonds; and also around a &#x20AC;109 million impact related to changes of provision for guarantees on separate account pension contracts in the Netherlands, and that was offset by positive revaluations and by hedging gains.</p>
          <p>On Page 22, you see the investment spreads that increased to 99 basis points. The investment margin went up to &#x20AC;476 million and that was mainly attributable to reinvestments into fixed income securities in the Netherlands and the U.S. and also because we had lower swap rate expenses in the U.S. as well as higher dividends on equity securities and a &#x20AC;28 million of non-recurring items in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>If you compare that with last year, then the investment spread now is at 99 basis points compared to 79 a year ago. So a significant improvement compared with a year ago. Also you should include the fact that LatAm was not included in these numbers any longer because they are reported as discontinued operation, and that has reduced the spread by about three basis points.</p>
          <p>Technical margin was strong. Fees and premium-based revenues grew by 3.6%. That was primarily driven by increases in the Closed Block VA and the ING Investment Management. Technical margin was &#x20AC;260 million; that is about 53% higher than Q2 of last year. And that result benefited from an early surrender of a contract of a large fund in the Netherlands. It had an impact of about &#x20AC;70 million.</p>
          <p>Administrative expenses. They were under tight control, and you can see that reflected in the graph on the right side as well as also on the left side. They declined administrative expense as a percent of total operating income to 38%, and that was resulting largely from the increased operating income.</p>
          <p>New sales, Slide 25, of &#x20AC;944 million. That was about 14% lower, but 6% of that had to do with currency effect from the second quarter of 2010 mainly as a result of lower sales in the Benelux and in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In the Benelux and in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, the fact that sales were down had to do with seasonal effects. Traditionally the first quarter is the high quarter. But also in Hungary and in Poland, pension sales were negatively impacted by some regulatory changes that were made by the governments.</p>
          <p>When you look at solvency, solvency ration strengthened. It went up to 252% at the end June, and that is eight points of which was driven by the decrease in the goodwill due to declassification of Latin America Pension and Life Insurance assets and the liabilities as held for sale. And the remaining improvement was related to retained earnings.</p>
          <p>The expected net transaction results of approximately &#x20AC;1 billion of the sale of the Latin American business will again increase the solvency ratio by an additional 12 percentage points at the closing.</p>
          <p>And then we have the risk-based capital ratio further improved to 493%, and that was largely driven by market-related impacts.</p>
          <p>I think that is what I had to say as the formal presentation, and now we open it up for questions. And again, Koos, Patrick and Matt will be here to help me with the questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Duncan Russell. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Good morning, Duncan Russell from JPMorgan. First question is on Latin America disposal. Obviously you were paying the proceeds within the Insurance business. Are you at the leverage ratio you want now for the Insurance business? And does that mean that any subsequent disposal of South America will definitely get upstream to the holding company?</p>
          <p>Could you also then give us the economic capital impact of the Latin American disposal? And then finally on Latin America, I am just interested as to why that was taken out from the underlying earnings, whereas ING Direct was not taken out from the underlying earnings. Particularly given that you &#x2013; that ING shareholders retain the Latin American earnings until point of disposal but don't retain ING Direct, which doesn't seem very consistent. So if you could just give us any insight into the accounting decision there, please.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is on the balance sheets for the Bank and your strategy of integrating the ING Direct balance sheet into the overall Bank Europe balance sheet. How will that be impacted do you think by this whole too-big-to-fail and SIFI debate? Will that leave you requiring an extra premium by regulators due to the fact that your balance sheet will now be versus not integrating it? And will that change your decision-making or thinking on that front? That's it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Duncan. On the leverage ratio I would say we &#x2013; and the Insurance company, in whole the company is a little bit too high at this moment. We like to bring that down to have a little bit more flexibility. But in principle I would say anything we do is Group-related. We have &#x2013; as far as I am concerned, we have the ability to take it back to the Group. And there is only normal decision-making and economic decision-making and rational decision-making that will determine where we take these cash flows when we need them. But our leverage ratio today is a little bit too high. I think we like to bring that down. We like to bring it down to levels that are more related to market so that by the time we do an IPO, we don't have a problem is that.</p>
          <p>With respect to the underlying earnings, and not why we have that with ING Direct, Patrick, would you like to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yes, Duncan, I mean this isn't &#x2013; it does seem that; I can understand your point it does appear perhaps a little inconsistent, but we are just simply applying IFRS and with a new one &#x2013; discontinued operations is where you have entire segments which you are disposing, which is the case in respect of Latin America, whereas health for sale is whether it's a part of the business within a segment. So ING Direct U.S. is part of &#x2013; does not constitute all of ING Direct, of course. So that piece goes into health for sale on the balance sheet, but it's not separated in the P&amp;L, whereas Latin America is an entire segment, so it's excluded in P&amp;L and balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Matt, the economic capital impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we don't have the economic capital numbers in front of us. But we can get this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then your question, Duncan, on the second one, Koos, you want to deal with that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Duncan, on the SIFI part, I know the criteria on the SIFI, which has to do with size interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity. I think overall you could argue that if we try to integrate the balance sheet, it will basically make sure that the size of the balance sheet doesn't get bigger show. So I would say overall SIFI would not be a showstopper for balance sheet integration. In fact I see it actually supporting it.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Farooq Hanif. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Just a few questions. Firstly, could you update the Basel II to Basel III reconciliation of the pro forma core Tier 1 ratio? I am guessing it probably hasn't changed that much, but if you could just give us an idea.</p>
          <p>And secondly, when you look at the insurance RoE of 8.4% adjusted, if you add back the Greek impairment, I am not sure if that's included or not, but you're basically within spitting distance of your 10% RoE already. I was just wondering, when you look at the margin trends, that being technical margin and the cost, is there anything that's kind of one-off that will bring that RoE back down or are you actually going to be hitting that early?</p>
          <p>And the related question of the Bank, could you just give us a comment on the margin trends there? Because it looks like everything is very stable ex-Greek impairment. So any change in the message in NIM, in loan loss provision and commission? I mean, is there anything that we need to take into account? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You take the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Farooq, although we don't want to disclose every quarter a sort of full implementation of Basel III which is something which is going to be implemented over 2009, I think the biggest difference between &#x2013; 2019, sorry. I didn't want to rush things &#x2013; overall what you can see is if I would make the <mark type="ph" /> assumption yourself (27:32) then you say that revaluation of ING on the bond side improved by approximately &#x20AC;200 million. That is probably the biggest driver of difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, the 8.4%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the 8.4% in the second quarter was exceptionally strong. I think a couple of important points about the quarter though. So normally the second quarter is when we get the majority of our dividends on public equity so those were reflected in the figures and you see that a bit of seasonality in our figures although it's reasonably small I think the dividend number over the prior quarter last year was about &#x20AC;10 million something on that order. But there is also two one-offs things that are in our figures and these are in the operating result margin and the first is about a &#x20AC;70 million basically surrender charge that we took in respect of a partial surrender of pension contract in the Netherlands. And then the investment margin is I think boosted up about &#x20AC;28 million on some one-off things and again Group pension contracts. These are all I think pretty well led out in the quarterly report when you have more time to go through it. Those are the important ones. But having said that, the results are actually quite good. So we see frankly improving trends in all the margins other than those one-offs even, expenses are under control. So these are very solid results.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, interest margin for the Bank. Yes, we said, we indicated that we thought it would come down gradually from 147 in Q4 144 first quarter and it's come down two basis points, broadly in line with what we said. So the guidance is the same. We think that we would expect a continued gradual decline. We are seeing a little bit more pressure in terms of margin on the deposit side, as Jan mentioned earlier. In the Netherlands we increased rates in June by between 10 and 20 basis points. ING Direct has increased rates following the ECB rate rises which were late in the quarter. So you won't have the full effect of that in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we still have good production as you have seen in the production numbers which on mortgages albeit that will help the quantum, not necessarily the margin, because the margin is neutral. But also specialized structured finance continues to have good production as healthy margins, which can mitigate somewhat the impact on the deposit side. So all in all the guidance stays the same and we still expect margins to hold on above previous pre-crisis levels.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, just three questions if I may. Starting with banking regulation, I just wondered if you could give us a run-through of your understanding of the Dutch proposals regarding ring fencing, and in particular any funding implications you might envisage on that?</p>
          <p>Turning to the Insurance disposals, I wondered if you could just update us on your thoughts around ING Insurance Belgium. I think you'd always find that one a slightly more difficult piece of the kind of IPO plan. And then finally just on VA hedging, I mean could you just update us where you are on that, in particular how much of that book is unhedged? I think that part of it actually was still unhedged. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe, Farquhar, if you talk about ring fencing, are you talking about the new Dutch regulation liquidity measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean there you could say that what we have seen over the past is that the Dutch &#x2013; the liquidity measures we already work with liquidity measures since 1996, so in that sense it's not new. What you have is slight changes in definitions and that is something where we have to adjust to but for the rest I mean it is not something entirely new for us. So, and that is something, which you just take into your normal operations to comply to the new regulations there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Belgium, there was some news today that I did not really fully understood. In one of the newspaper have an article on issues in Belgium related to our Insurance operations there. Nothing has changed. We have European Commission Directives that says that we have to sell our Insurance operations and that hasn't changed and we also have to diverse our operations of WestlandUtrecht in the Netherlands. So, these two things are still on the table. We are working on them. And I have no further update on that, so I cannot really relate to the article that I've shown in one of the newspapers. Matt, on the hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, with respect to the hedging in the VA in the U.S. no real change since the last quarter. We remain hedged on all the for equity exposure on all the guaranteed benefits and I think we ended up the quarter something like 47% interest rate hedge which is sort of very similar to where we want &#x2013; where we were in 1Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from William Elderkin. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everybody. It's William Elderkin from Soc Gen. First just a follow-up from Duncan's question. I didn't quite get the answer. For the Insurance business pro forma for the Latin America disposal, is that capital structure now where you want it to be, and will any further gains you may take in the Insurance business be distributable to the holding &#x2013; I'm sorry, I didn't follow the answer you gave to that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the headline I think related to your press call earlier saying that you won't try and adjust the European Commission restructuring plan. If that's a sort of correct representation of what you said, I just wondered how we should think about that in terms of your outstanding appeal with the European Commission later this year?</p>
          <p>And finally, just a detail question: within the leasing profitability of the Bank, how much is attributable to the Car Lease business which has been sold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the LatAm, the &#x2013; in principal, all the things that we do, all the sales that we do are basically the cash that's been generated is basically always cash for the Group. But when we decide it's not, it is for a reason and that's why we explain. We believe that the debt level and the leverage in the holding company for insurance is a little bit too high when we compare that with normal participants in the market and we like to bring that down. That's all we are doing. And then I simply cannot answer it anyway else.</p>
          <p>Cash for me always is a corporate asset. With respect to the European restructuring, yes, we have an appeal running in the European courts. There have been hearings in the court but we don't expect that the court will decide any thing before let's say six, seven months and yes, I cannot give any further information on that. We are waiting the decision by the court.</p>
          <p>And the last one, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you clarify your question with respect to car leases was that the &#x2013; in respect to impact in margin going forward, or the contribution to capital on the sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Within the overall leasing profits you report for the second quarter how much is attributable to the business that is up for sale or has been sold?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The profit element is about &#x20AC;56 million for car lease for the half year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just come back on one point, say pro forma for the Latin American disposal and the retention of those gains within the Insurance business, does that lead the Insurance company capital structure where you want it to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can only determine that by the time you go to an IPO and I think that's the time that we determine that. I would think at this moment my answer would be yes. They will be well capitalized. It is what we are doing today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning gentlemen. I have two questions from my side. First of all, again on the SIFI surcharge, you have got already some feeling how the discussions with the regulators are going? If so, any indication for which level you should work with in future respect to your core tier one or CET1 on the Basel III? Any feeling on which direction we should think?</p>
          <p>Secondly on your investment spreads, a good development already in Q2. How do you see developments with investment spread going forward? Do you see from the current level without of course exception to further clear improvement? Or you take additional measures there to further improve the investment spread? I know you have a target of slightly above 100 basis points, but could you give us some more feeling on what you are doing at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the SIFI one, ING at the moment we have a 7% minimum requirement, and on top of that there will be the SIFI bucket. We expect ourselves to be in one of the more lower buckets and that is also what we have seen in some of the researches and some of the list. But we don't have the final answer and that is what we are awaiting. So again, anticipation one of the lower buckets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the investment spread I think we have been pleased at the pace with which it's grown, but it's certainly an uncertain market environment. You want to be a little bit careful to re-risk too quickly. So we are at 99 basis points now. We had given our guidance at 105. I think removing Latin America actually reduced it by a couple of basis points. At this point we are not changing our guidance but we want to be cautious about this.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Thomas Nagtegaal. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thomas Nagtegaal, RBS. I have two questions remaining. First of all, could you say something about the margin or volume outlook for structured finances, being clearly the star performer of your commercial Banking franchise? And do you expect, let's say new volumes and margins to remain at the same level for other remainder of the year?</p>
          <p>Second, regarding the investment income in the Benelux, which is extremely strong, did the &#x2013; was the margin uptake realized during the quarter or at the beginning, do you expect some further uptake during Q3? And could you explain exactly what did in terms of reinvestments? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect to structured finance, the margins have held up well. There have been limited changes. They are broadly stable as compared to the prior quarter. Maybe good production, we are seeing some more competition. So it's focusing on trend, which is normal, given &#x2013; what you see is a very healthy market and performance by ING. So we're focusing on margin preservation. Volumes are relatively stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the investment margin in the Benelux, a couple of key things. I think, first of all, we already had called out about &#x20AC;20 million kind of one-off things related to interest credit, more so than investment income. And also we have seasonally high dividends in the quarter and that's a change that we've seen from last year. We actually see higher dividends out of our holdings there. So that's a positive result. Whether they occur at the beginning or at the end of the quarter is not so meaningful.</p>
          <p>For the balance, if you just &#x2013; if you look at the sort of the core investment margin over the prior quarter, it's just simply due to reinvestment of cash in longer-term securities and a little bit of credit re-risking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Benoit P&#xE9;trarque. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Benoit P&#xE9;trarque from Kepler. Yes, a few questions. On the funding, I was wondering here what has been the average funding maturity of your issues this year and where are you going to be next year as well? I mean, what can we expect in terms of duration of your funding as a Bank on the banking side?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the Retail Benelux, which is a bit up in terms of level of loan loss provision. So can you dig into &#x2013; a bit into the outlook there in terms of SMEs and also pure Retail? And do you have actually a split of the loan loss on the &#x2013; in the Benelux between what is SME at last mid corporate versus a pure Retail?</p>
          <p>And then finally, we see long-term rates coming down sharply in the U.S. and in Europe. So could you just update us on the MCV there on those business, and also on the reinvestment spread? What do you think we're going to end up end of 2011 on the &#x2013; at the margin, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe so, Benoit, on the funding side. On average what we've been doing is issuing this year more in the five-year range. I think if you go back to the presentation Page 19, what we try to establish is not so much that I have a target in terms of issuing five year, if you want to create more or less equal buckets of refinancing. So in that sense you try to get more 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 buckets filled right now rather than the earlier buckets but again that also has to do with what the markets are prepared to give. So but overall a bit longer maturities is what we have done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think what you see on the Retail loan loss side is to be honest we had in the first quarter and that is what I mentioned at that time when loan losses were &#x2013; made a steep drop then we really had on the SME side, we had actually just a fantastic quarter without any incidence at all. Now it's a little bit more turning back to normality because I mean on the SME side you will still see some loan losses happening there. So it's more sort of a return to normality in terms of levels. So in that sense not something that it's a steep increase, it's a bit back to normality. And you see a little bit of an increase in Belgium and you see a little bit of the decrease in the Netherlands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the effective lower interest rates, I think, first of all we provide some earnings sensitivities on interest rate movements within the quarterly reports. So you can go back and look at those. With respect to MCV movements, I think you know that we don't publish MCV but I think good to go back and look at the annual accounts where we do give the available financial resources, which is a decent proxy for it. And there you can see some of the interest rates sensitivities in that disclosure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, in respect of interest margin and we don't really go into the last level of detail in terms of what we disclosed. So I am afraid &#x2013; can't give you that level of granularity. What we can say, I mean in terms of the market, the mid-corporate still remains demand somewhat muted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Jan Willem Weidema. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, Jan Willem Weidema, ABN AMRO. Few questions. Firstly, on the sequence of the insurance IPOs, when will you take a decision on which business to IPO first, and when will you inform the market?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the EC court case, do you still expect a possibility that you will settle with the EC before the court comes to a verdict? Those are my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jan Willem, with respect to the timing of the sequence, we cannot give you any more guidance than that we will be watching this very carefully. We are watching the market carefully. The only thing we can do is we need to make sure that we are ready and that's what we are working on. We are ready with respect to what needs to be done performance wise, that we are ready with respect to the separation, the preparation that needs to be done and we have everything in place to be a standalone company on both sides of the ocean, and the U.S. as well as here for Asia. And that's what we are working on. So whoever is first will be determined by the market and whoever is ready.</p>
          <p>With respect to the European court case and are we talking with European Commission, no we are not talking except for regular updates and discussions on specific topics. But we are not negotiating in any way and we want to, I think we want to hear what the court has to say. We are eager to hear that of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Lemer Salah from SNS Securities. Couple of questions from my side. First of all, a follow-up question with regard to the IPOs. Well, you have mentioned often that it depends on environmental development. Can you highlight which factors are crucial for you to come up with an IPO? And that's my first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you elaborate on the disentanglement of ING investment and how this process is evolving at this moment?</p>
          <p>And my final question regards what can ING do beyond disposal of the Insurance units and with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:51) to reduce complexity even further and sharpen its focus? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I did not really catch the environmental issue related to the IPO. It's that you relate it to the weather or so, or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean the market. Market-wise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes. No, no, I think, the market &#x2013; of course the market has to be ready to accept an IPO. And we also want to do that at a price that we think is acceptable to our shareholders. And I don't think at this level that we can say that that we are very satisfied with the way the market is today, and I don't get the impression that they are ready for an IPO right now. So we have some time. We don't need to worry about that. We have time until 2013, so same time as your <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:41) in this project. But it doesn't mean that we are sitting here waiting. No, we are sitting here preparing ourselves to be sure we are ready when the market is ready for us.</p>
          <p>I take the last question. I did not hear the second one. The disposals, further disposals on complexity, I think what we have done is we have really de-complexed the organization quite a lot already. If you look at the slides &#x2013; some couple of slides that we have to show what we have done in a very short time, I think it is just incredible that has happened here. And we continue with the work that we're doing and surely the work that Koos will be doing in his new capacity as Vice Chairman of the Bank where we're looking at opportunities related to new regulation and how can we then structure our balance sheet in the best possible way relative to our strategic positions. And operationally I think that will be very important.</p>
          <p>But we have done, I think, a lot of work on making our organization simpler, more compact. I think we have a lot more focus. So I don't see at this moment a big need to really say, yes, we have additional things on the agenda. But we are working our normal schedule that we have outlined for you, and I think that's where we're staying with. What's the second one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, perhaps I can rephrase my second question. Can you update us with regard to the investment management unit and how this process of disentanglement or even other possibilities are evolving at this moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we had actually taken most of the different entanglement steps back in 2009 when we announced that we would really try to make this as standalone investment management organization. So it's always been part of Insurance and since 2010 we've reported at separately we've an arms-linked pricing agreement already in place, so that goes along quite well and not a lot of change. The only thing that's happening right now is since we go with the two IPOs scenario we have to take the additional step of sort of getting the organizations right in the U.S. and right in Eurasia, but that goes along I think quite smoothly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you the next question is from Matthias de Wit. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Matthias de Wit from Petercam. Two questions from my part. First of all on the Insurance capitalization, you remain cautious despite the retention of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:20) and the recent debt-to-equity swap. I wondered whether you see any regulatory pressure from Solvency II in the U.S. to further strengthen the capital base going forward prior to those IPOs, because you haven't provided a lot of details in this respect.</p>
          <p>Then second on ING Direct, how confident are you in getting regulatory approval in the U.S. following NCRC's attempt to plug the transaction?</p>
          <p>And then last question is on the NPLs of the Real Estate segment. We see them creeping up a bit quarter after quarter. We also see some warning signs in several countries. Could you maybe comment what's happening in your book and where you see the NPLs this segment going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the time that we would go to market with our Insurance companies of course and certainly in the meantime as well we will have discussion with regulators to make sure that they are comfortable and certainly if you have many companies involved there are also many regulators that we will have to satisfy. So that is a process we will be engaged in and that's one of the things we need to do and that's why it takes time in preparation time to get all the approvals really got lined up. So that will take some time.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; with respect to ING Direct and NCRC, yes, I think that's an issue that you need to discuss more with Capital Loan. They are in control of getting all the approvals. I think I am not in a position to really comment on that.</p>
          <p>And with respect &#x2013; Koos, with the Real Estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe on the Real Estate side a few comments here. The first is if you looked at Q1 it was exceptionally low. If you look at Q2 it picked up a bit again due to some larger files. Overall what I had stated the trend is that we see a gradual decline of our overall loan losses to at the levels below the average of last year. And that is what you see happening. But the market share of Real Estate indeed will pick up because that is a type of lending which just has a longer cycle than some of the other products.</p>
          <p>And if you take then by and large the other product which is that we have a &#x20AC;34 billion portfolio and you see a &#x20AC;110 million there which is not a significant part of the dancing that you have a portfolio in great difficulty. I would say on the contrary it's holding up well. And overall if you look at Real Estate, it's modestly declining in terms of overall exposure. So those are my remarks with regards to the Real Estate in the total perspective. So in that sense, now not to get too excited too much about it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:53:30). Mr. Hommen, can you give us an update? I mean, is it still reasonable to assume you will dispose of it in the coming months, say before year-end, despite the recent volatility? And what's your view around that? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning. Yes, the disposal of Latin America is the group of Sura and we are working together with them very hard to make sure that we can get it done as quickly as possible. But it will take some time, because we need to get approvals here as well, local approvals in the various countries we operate in. Our plan is to do before the end of the year. And I think that is also that the plan has &#x2013; the plan is that that you're looking at.</p>
          <p>The other question you asked was related to Brazil, I think. Yes there we, I cannot give you any further comments here that it is not included in the transaction we have done with Latin America with group of Sura, and we will at some point come back to you with an update where we stand on that one, but at this moment I have nothing to add.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Fran&#xE7;ois Boissin. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. This is Fran&#xE7;ois Boissin from Exane BNP Paribas. Coming back to your Insurance operations, could you give a bit more detail on the &#x20AC;111 million positive impact that you saw on alternative assets and CMOs? And the follow-up question on that is when &#x2013; I mean, in what timeframe do you see a 10% plus return on equity for Insurance operations?</p>
          <p>And second question is on the sales. At Insurance, it seems that you are quite behind your long-term target there. I mean, could you give us a bit of comment on how you see things going forward?</p>
          <p>And last question on Insurance in Belgium. Why not include in an IPO? Could you give us some background on the choice to actually sell it separately? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me take the first couple of these. I think the &#x20AC;111 million gains that you saw in the U.S. was roughly split 50-50 by alternative assets like private equities and also a gain on the result of portfolio of CMO securities that are mark-to-market. And effectively that one is even though interest rates are down normally we would expect to see gains and as people end up not refinancing their mortgages, the issue in the U.S. now is that you got home prices that are significantly below where mortgage balances are, so you don't see refinancing and that's what driving that. But it's &#x2013; about 50-50 would be the private equity in that CMO B asset class.</p>
          <p>As to the 10% RoE, we've said that, I think in the April 2010 Investor Day, that we would shoot for something north of 10% by 2013. We've not revised that estimate. We would expect to keep it in that same area.</p>
          <p>With respect to sales, it's actually quite a mix bag in the quarter because even though sales are I think a little bit down from the year-ago quarter, what you're seeing is different things in different regions. You're seeing, for example in Asia where you have sales that include Japan as basically flat to last year, but if you exclude the <mark type="ph" /> coli (57:04) sales in Japan that we had in the second quarter of last year, I think the rest of the APE was up something like 14%. So the region was actually quite good.</p>
          <p>Similar thing that's going on for the U.S. business where you had overall again 12.5% decline excluding currencies, but you'd had stable value sales which are actually quite low margin. They were down 58%, whereas the sales of the core Retirement Services businesses were up 17% and Life Insurance was up 32%. So it's actually quite a mixed bag and I guess the bottom line is that we are getting even though the topline sales numbers down we are actually getting the sales in the areas that we want them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to Belgium, we have to separate the Insurance operations in Belgium from the Bank, and if Bank Insurance has worked anywhere, it has in Belgium. You see that the Bank really is the channel and has integrated Insurance in the operations of the Bank. So it is quite a cumbersome process to separate them. And then they need to find the place where they have a home as well to someone who wants to sell these products. And I think we are evaluating all the options that we have to see how that can be done. But we have basically very strict orders what we need to do. We simply cannot renege on that. This is a requirement that we have as a result of the European Commission and we need execute that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just have some questions or detail about your Southern European sovereign slide. Can I confirm the impairment that you have done on Greece, have you impact to the market price at the of June or to some other reference period &#x2013; reference data? And what would be sensitivity now to future market prices movements up or down?</p>
          <p>Secondly, the &#x20AC;123 million for the Insurance business is that net of any sharing of losses with the policy holder or has the shareholder taken the whole whack and can you explain to me the logic of whatever the answer is?</p>
          <p>And then finally, can I just confirm that basically we are seeing the full picture here of your sovereign exposure, and that you haven't for example only shown us AFS and ignored held to maturity or loans or whatever, and specifically on that point, is there any synthetic exposure from CDS underwriting in the Bank or the insurer, that may not be captured in this slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will answer that. We have taken the impairment for bonds maturing up to 2020. We have taken that to market value, which is standard IFRS accounting. So that is an impact, which is higher than what maybe the ultimate 21% targeted cost on the IAF agreement. So the mark-to-market is at 30 June, which is the date at which we took the accounting closed book and took the impairment charge. So standard vanilla IFRS accounting.</p>
          <p>Going forward it does mean that if the market prices were to drop below the level of 30 June, you could have a further hit to P&amp;L. On the other hand, which is hopefully more likely is when the IAF agreement starts to be executed and banks have signed, insurers have signed up, start to exchange their bonds under the four options that are provided. You will see hopefully the prices tightening towards the price employed by the exchange, which could result in a positive. We have no synthetics, there are no trading book or held to maturity. So this is it, which is all we disclose for the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x20AC;123 million impairment that we took in Greece that is, it is a gross number. But, and there is a very small amount of it that would be subject to discretionary policy holder profit sharing, but it is a very small amount. And so basically our liabilities are in euro.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Just a quick question please, again on the progress we've got at the insurance IPOs. Where are you in terms of legal restructuring of the insurance entities ahead of the IPO. And I guess the key question I have is whether the insurance holding company &#x2013; whether you've decided whether that insurance company will ultimately stay within ING and the operations underneath it go, or it goes as part of one of the IPOs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, that's one of the topics that we are working on at this moment. Legal restructuring is one of the first things that you do and then we had &#x2013; once we are determined how to do that you need to do the capital planning around it and then, by the time that you have done that and all the other things are in place, you are ready for and the market is ready to go to market.</p>
          <p>Now we are in the process of all doing that. We are looking how to restructure the holding company is it with or without. That is still one of the topics that we evaluated further. Once we have that all figured out and decided then we can communicate that back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Duncan Russell. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Back to the European Commission, it's not clear to me what you are hoping to get now from the European Commission. So could you just outline what you'd like to see happening from your arbitration with the European Commission? What do you like to change about your agreement? And could you please explore that &#x2013; on that if possible.</p>
          <p>And then secondly the just &#x2013; coming back onto the leverage ratios, who is giving you the guidance that your leverage is too high? Is it rate agencies? Is it the rate collectors? Or is there some other participants in the market? Just wondering how you get to that conclusion and particularly given the difficulties that are clearly apparent when you try to compare leverage amongst financial groups both in terms of the definition of debt and obviously in the calculation of shareholders equities? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Duncan, I cannot give you more color on the discussions we have as the European Commission. I have said earlier we update them we make sure that we are in touch with them and needed on particular files. With respect to the court case the only thing we can do here is wait, we have hope, we have &#x2013; you know there is no more than that. And of course if we did not believe that we had a case we wouldn't have file that to be &#x2013; to the court. So, all we can do now is wait and see what the ultimate decision will be and then we can determine further about the next steps will be for us.</p>
          <p>Leverage. Leverage has to do with how the market sees it. We do comparisons with peers. It's not so simple because as you know, not everybody is showing very clearly how leverage is working in these companies. The other thing we do is, of course we have our discussions with rating agencies and we have our plans with respect to what type of company do you want to set in the marketplace and what rating do you want and all that will determine at the end what type of leverage that we put in into these companies.</p>
          <p>And as I said earlier to another question, we are still working a lot on the legal part, how the framework will be and how exactly it will look like when we go to market. All that has to be done before we can really be extremely specific on how the leverage at the end will be, but you can be assured we are working on all these angles. It's laborious work. Sometimes it's first rating because you need to have a lot of approvals for local regulators as well for the legal parts, but doing it as diligent as Greek, but also as well as we can do it.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Cor Kluis. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. <mark type="ph" /> Cor Kluis of Rabo Bank (1:05:48). I've got a few questions, first of all about ING Direct, especially ING Direct Germany. The pre-tax profit increased quite something in the second quarter, while the deposits did not rise and mortgages did not rise either what is going on there and can you highlight a little bit if this is a normal run rate or just a model change somewhat there.</p>
          <p>Other question about ING Direct, do you see especially in the big countries Spain and Italy some flight to safety maybe not on a volume basis but on a net interest margin basis or especially the last two months?</p>
          <p>And third question is about the U.S. insurance solvency. It's now 493 RBC ratio; it's better than peers. Is it high enough given the fact that ING has some variable annuity business over there and maybe you can highlight in that perspective a little bit about the ratio of inadequacy of the variable annuity business, how that has been developing? So those were my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On <mark type="ph" /> DiBa (1:07:00), yes you did note that the deposits have not grown in the quarter but if you look back you will see that there has been a significant growth since the beginning last years, some &#x20AC;5 billion. So the promotional campaign which helped drive that has stopped, which helped a bit on margins. So it's the flow through of the volume growth in preceding quarters and healthy margins is what's driving it there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at the ING direct part overall, what you can see is that we are keeping our clients and our deposit holder and we are not paying the top rate in the market. So implicitly what you clearly see is that the savers who stay with us is either for the service or for the safety. So in that sense we are benefiting for that and we don't have to push on all engines to pay a very, very high rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the U.S. solvency, we are obviously pleased with where it's going. It's increased to 493% in the operating companies, so with that approaching 500% it looks very strong again in the operating companies. But as Jan has kept on saying about capital structure, we want to be really cautious about how we go into this and how we look at capital structures as we do the, as we prepare for the IPOs.</p>
          <p>With respect to the reserve inadequacy, I believe on the U.S. VA business, in the last quarter we were sufficient at the 58% level which is really leading for that business and I think the number was about 1.1 billion. And I think it's come down a little bit to &#x20AC;900 million, something like that given the equity market decreases, but still comfortably there.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Hans Pluijgers has a follow-up question. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two follow-up questions. First of all to come back on the SIFI surcharge, I understand you have, you expect to be in the low buckets with respect to local regulator, do you expect that they will charge some additional surcharge above those, the SIFI, normal SIFI surcharge, because of course ING is relatively big for the Dutch economy.</p>
          <p>And secondly going back on Poland, how do you see developments there with respect to consolidation and also what are your abilities after you have repaid this state in May of next year. Are you then able &#x2013; allowed to make any acquisitions, or is the divestments of the Insurance operation still there an issue for you &#x2013; allowed to do anything with respect to acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe on the SIFI part I think and again all this has to be firmly decided. But we tend to look more like a GC fee than an LC fee, so in that sense yes, we will be in any bucket defined by the GC fee and that means like I don't think we will get in local SIFI buffer on top of that. So it's just a GC fee where I think we are heading to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to Poland, yes, there was a consolidation going on and we are watching that of course with a great deal of interest. We cannot make acquisitions. ING cannot make acquisitions at this moment, and of course once we have repaid to that state, that condition will be liberated and we can. But first of all it's still to be paid at that state before we can make acquisitions as ING.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. On government bonds, I've been seeing some of your competitors selling huge chunks of Italian bonds. Is there any agreement you're steering from the ABA or any organization to prevent massive flow from banks to the markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think you mention the ABA, Jan Willem. The ABA is the vehicle which who runs stress test, so I don't think they are the ones. But &#x2013; and again overall, I think there is no sort of government or public instruction on something like that what I'm aware of.</p>
