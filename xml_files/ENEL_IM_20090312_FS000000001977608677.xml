        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we can get started with a warm welcome, and a good morning to all of you, ladies and gentlemen for hosting here 2008 Results and Strategy Presentation.  I will like to welcome members of our Board who are sitting here and a set of the auditors as well as to our friends coming from Madrid.  Rafael Miranda and qualified members of the team of Endesa are present.  And our Andrea Brentan from the Enels Madrid is also joining us and I shall extend my warm welcome to all of them.</p>
          <p>Today we'll present our strong set of 2008 results, which I think are confirming Enel's ability to deliver growth even in an unfavorable economic and financial environment.  Then I will take you through the key points of our 2009-2013 plan, which will end with a focus on major overall financial targets.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to say that together with Luigi and &#x2013; we will be obviously taking with contributions from all of our Directors sitting in this room, all of the questions that you might be raising after the presentation.</p>
          <p>I also like to remind you that we'll be extending an invitation for all of you in the near future for a follow-up presentation in which we will discuss individual operational performance in detail, including an Investor Day for renewables.</p>
          <p>Let me first of all give you an overview on the initiatives we are taking to maintain our strategic progress and respond to the current environment.  And I have that chart moving on.</p>
          <p>With the final acquisition of the 25% remaining stake of Endesa, I think we have substantially completed the international expansion program, positioning ourselves as a worldwide integrated energy leader.</p>
          <p>As we will continue to integrate Endesa assets in our portfolio, we now see greater scope for synergies, which you will see detailed later on this presentation and which will enhance our profitability in the next five years.</p>
          <p>We've also incorporated our new renewable energy company, Enel Green Power.  And we'll continue to strive for efficiency programs throughout the plans.  Also, we have finalized into disposables of some of the assets that we have earmarked for sale, such as the Ofresid high voltage grid to Terna. I do expect cash to be received in April at the earliest and early May at the latest.  And we now just receiving two offers for the low pressure gas pipelines, which we will be commenting.</p>
          <p>Let me underline first of all that all of this has been achieved in a deteriorating economic and financial climate.  And against this backdrop, maintaining the current A- / A2 rating is central to development of our strategy.  Because this is enabling us to preserve our leadership position and to achieve what I consider key priorities for the Group over the next five years; consolidating existing assets, delivering strong results and maintaining financial stability.</p>
          <p>Now let me say a few words about what Enel has become these days.  With operations across Europe, Russia and the Americas, total installed capacity will be reaching 95 gigawatt, with about 60 million customer being served throughout.  I believe Enel is a company of truly to national scope and influence.</p>
          <p>The past year has been a transformational period for us.  The big leap forward we have achieved with the acquisition of the remaining 25% of Endesa has confirmed our position as a major international integrated player.</p>
          <p>Our expanded position enables us to leverage significant economies of scale and a well-diversified regulatory and technological profile.  The progress we have made across all of our regions has positioned Enel as a company that can deliver strong results to shareholders, even on a challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>This footprint is key to remain competitive in the world energy arena.  Furthermore, our portfolio benefits from a unique mix of assets and technologies, which means good balance between unregulated and regulated activities.</p>
          <p>As far as the unregulated activities are concerned, Enel can rely on the technological and geographical diversification, focused on minimizing the Group risk profile.  But also a well-balanced fuel mix, with nuclear at 13%, hydro and hydro renewables at almost 30%, coal at 27%, with balance mainly consisting of CCGTs and oil and gas open cycles.  I think all of this, coupled with our ongoing hedging strategy allows us to expect solid cash flows for the coming years.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a look at financial stability as a key priority.  In response to a difficult microenvironment and a commodity price decline, we intend to implement initiatives to ensure our financial stability.  In particular, we'll be focusing on the following three areas; increasing our cash flow generation through efficiency and CapEx optimization. Disposing of those strategic assets and minority stakes in growth business to support our balance sheet.  Strengthening our capital structure through a combination of rights issue and a revised dividend policy.</p>
          <p>To give you more detail, in this chart, I think you will see that we can generate additional 10 billion euros of cash flow in the period, which will be available for further debt containment and reduction.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the cash flow generation level.  Well, first let me tell you that in 2008, we have already achieved a target of &#x20AC;400 million versus 2006, a cost savings we committed to.  But we have room to do more and we have programs to deliver more.  This through ongoing projects which are obviously available for you in the annexes, if you want to dwell on this.  And by the way, this is just Enel standalone prior to the integration of Endesa, which I think will continue to deliver synergies and implement others' efficiency programs.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we launch a second wave of program aimed at increasing efficiency, mainly through cost savings and working capital optimization.  We call this Zenith.  And some of the major projects the improvement of this program are:  workforce management, &#x20AC;50 million; ICT initiatives, &#x20AC;140 million; billing revisions, &#x20AC;120 million; clean organization, 130; maintenance and sourcing, 40; unbalance and reduction, 95. This just on the cost savings side.  And all of these project will be follow through with individual presentation to all of you, to double prove that we commit and deliver.</p>
          <p>On working capital, we'll be managing inventory for a reduction of 207 million.  We'll optimize billing with added 200 million and we'll change and revise terms of payment throughout the organization to yield another &#x20AC;200 million of working capital reduction.  With all of this, we'll be reaching almost 3 billion euros of additional cash flow by 2011 versus 2008.</p>
          <p>As far as CapEx are concerned, you can see that from this chart, our plan investment program in the next five years have been revised.  And this just to reflect the lower demand growth and a changing economic outlook worldwide.  Yet the new plan will continue to pursue selective organic growth opportunities, which we see as primarily focused on the following areas.</p>
          <p>In Italy, clean coal and gas in this freeing facilities, renewables and some initial nuclear initiatives.  In Spain and Latam, CCGTs and renewables.  In Slovakia and France, nuclear.  In Russia, CCGTs and gas extraction.  In networks, in all the areas where we are already present, we see opportunities to enhance service quality through technological improvements.  All of this yielding fair results for us.</p>
          <p>As far as maintenance investments are concerned, we'll not cut back on any project.  But our spending will be reduced to improve efficiency and lower prices.</p>
          <p>Let me move now to asset disposal.  We are closely reviewing our portfolio to ensure that we remain focused on strategic assets going forward.  We will consider the disposal of a number of non-strategic assets and minority stakes and growth businesses, which include the high-voltage grid that you have heard of.  This will yield us about 1.2 billion and this will be cashed in late April and May.</p>
          <p>We now looking at two offers that we have received for a majority stake in our gas distribution network.  We will open negotiations to dwell on those two offers starting tomorrow.  And I do expect to have an early closing for this deal.</p>
          <p>As far as Enel Green Power is concerned, we have received interest from international infrastructure funds.  We'll start discussion to finalize this sale and we're working towards concluding the deal by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We also have identified other assets, which are peripheral and less strategic to our business model, which I remind you is based on vertical integration in areas, where we're already present.  We have initiated a disposal program for those assets as well.  We will give you further details on the assets and the sale process in due course.</p>
          <p>These are high quality assets.  And we firmly believe that we will be finding suitable buyers at the right price.  But you will bear with me, I cannot give you right now the names and address of those assets.  The total of these planned disposals will amount to approximately &#x20AC;10 billion by 2010, which again will go entirely to net debt reduction.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look into the strengthening our capital structure.  As I've described, we're undertaking asset disposal program against a backdrop of deteriorating economic and financial condition and also looking at stricter rating agencies parameters.  Clearly, it will be a crucial element to the success of this program that we maintain a single A- / A2 ratings.</p>
          <p>It is with this in mind that we have decided to promote a rights issue of eight billion euros to all of our shareholders.  At this regard our Board of Directors yesterday resulted upon calling an extraordinary AGM to approve the right issues to be executed by the end of June, early July.</p>
          <p>And let me also stress that the Italian Minister of Economy, a majority shareholder, has confirmed its interest to participate in this operation.  And let me also conclude that we have an underwriting syndicate that has already been formed to guarantee the offering.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are revising our dividend policy from a stable 0.49 cents per share to a 60% payout on ordinary income.  Starting from 2009 results, we do expect our dividend yield to remain in the top tier of the market.  These two measures together will reinforce our financial position, will fortify the Company against market volatility and will set a sound platform for our future.</p>
          <p>To sum up, while there are short-term challenges, our long-term priorities remain clear.  We are committed to delivering attractive returns to shareholders, taking advantage of the opportunities created by our expanded international profile in our efficiency programs.  This will permit to our Group reinforcing a strategic geographical position that will prompt us to seize opportunities for further organic growth as soon as the recession is over.</p>
          <p>Now let me over to Luigi for commenting the 2008 results, and I'll be back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fulvio.  And good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm really pleased to report a very strong set of financial results today.  But before going through into details, let me mention that the 2007 results have been adjusted to take into account the completion of the purchase price allocation process and the discontinuation of the Italian gas distribution business.</p>
          <p>In the annexes, you will find all the relevant details.  But now, let's have the look at the numbers.  First, I'm going to give you a snapshot of some financial highlights, then I will take you through the 2008 financial results.</p>
          <p>Group EBITDA increased by 45.5%, driven mainly by the consolidation of Endesa, as well as by the positive contribution of all the other divisions.  Without the contribution of Endesa, EBITDA grew by almost 12%.  Group net income grew by about 35% to almost &#x20AC;5.3 billion, also due to the effective tax rates decrease.  Net debt has decreased to &#x20AC;49.9 billion, in line with our commitment to bring the level below &#x20AC;50 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, starting from EBIT down to net income.  EBIT increased by almost 41% driven by EBITDA improvements.  Our net financial charges amount to &#x20AC;3.2 billion.  This is the net effect of the following:</p>
          <p>First, higher interest charges for &#x20AC;1.6 billion.  This is mainly due to the result in net debt position following the acquisition of Endesa, OGK-5 and Muntenia.  The comparison with 2007 is affected by the inclusion in the last year figures of &#x20AC;300 million relating to dividend distributed by Endesa.</p>
          <p>Second, lower income resulting from differed value valuation of the Acciona put option for &#x20AC;102 million.  The average costs of debt has been equal to 5.5%.  The Group's tax rate fell from 33.1% to 9.2%, or 33.7% on a like-for-like basis.  This was the results of the benefit coming from the 2008 financial low, which I have already explained at the nine months results presentation.  The annexes will give you further details also on this.</p>
          <p>But before going through the EBITDA evolution, let me explain that 2007 EBITDA has been reclassified in order to reflect the new organization of the Group.  In particular, during 2008, we have transferred some operations from Generation and Energy Management Italy and the International Division, to the newly incorporated Enel Green Power.  Moreover, we transferred some other operation including Endesa from the International Division, to the Iberia and Latin American division.  In the charts you can see all the effects of such organizational changes on 2007 EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to our EBITDA evolution.  The 45.5% increase in EBITDA has been the results not only of the consolidation of Endesa for 12 months, but also of the excellent operational performance of each division.  I will just go through details of Generation and Energy Management Italy, Endesa, Russia and Enel Green Power.  You will find details of all the other division in the annexes.</p>
          <p>First, Generation and Energy Management Italy.  The increase in the generation margin equaled &#x20AC;337 million, thanks to the following; &#x20AC;388 million higher generation margin due to the contribution of higher unit margin, higher volumes and better generation mix.  This is was offset by minus &#x20AC;51 million lower margin in the ancillary service markets.</p>
          <p>Additional items are &#x20AC;104 million of trading activities mainly due to trading of CO2, better shipping condition to third parties, trading on gas and power, partially offsets by a lower gas margin.  &#x20AC;328 million due to the capital gain from the disposal of some idle assets to Dolomiti Energia, and minus &#x20AC;399 million, mainly due to the delta per value for &#x20AC;302 million on commodity and on the CFD with a single buyer and higher cost for external and intercompany sources.</p>
          <p>But let me give you an update on our agent strategy, in particular on forward electricity sales.  As far as Italy is concerned, we have hedged over 97% of our 2009 domestic production at 45% for all 2010 production at an average base load price equal to &#x20AC;80 per megawatt hour for 2009 and &#x20AC;84 per megawatt hour for 2010 related to retail prices to final customers, stood in the region of &#x20AC;85 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>As far as Spain is concerned, we are 70% hedged for 2009 and 25% for 2010 at an average base load price of &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour.  In Slovakia, 2009 domestic production is almost 100% hedged, while we are already 27% for 2010, at an average price of &#x20AC;68 per megawatt hour for 2009 and 62 for 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a quick look at the fuel cost evolution in generation and energy management in Italy.  Well, net of ancillary services in spite of a substantial rise of the average fuel cost, the unit margin in the domestic thermal generation market increased from &#x20AC;22 per megawatt hour to &#x20AC;23 per megawatt hour.  This, of course, is the results of our forward sales and commodity hedging activities.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to the following division, let me give you just a quick look at the Russian activities.  First, let me remind you that EBITDA has been included in the results since the end of May.  OGK-5 reported full year EBITDA of &#x20AC;153 million.  That represents a 41% increase on a like-for-like basis versus last year.  As you can see in the charts, the electricity price, net of capacity payment is up by 18% versus last year.  This confirms that the liberalization process of the Russian market and the alignment of its prices to the European average level is progressing according to the government agenda.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on Endesa results.  EBITDA for 100% of the Company totaled &#x20AC;6.9 billion, representing an increase of more than &#x20AC;500 million versus full year 2007.  This growth has been boosted by a balance contribution of the Iberia operation and Latin America operation in particular.</p>
          <p>In Iberia, growth has been obtained, thanks to 53% higher pool prices versus last year, 15% better thermal load factors versus the rest of the market and a more efficient commodity cost base, 40% lower than the average of the sector, sustained by better generation mix with a greater weight on nuclear and hydro capacity.</p>
          <p>EBITDA growth of 3.7% is reporting, including the negative effect of Royal Decree on CO2 that I remind you, has been recorded for a total amount of more than &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, higher power prices improved distribution margins and additional capacity boosted Endesa EBITDA by 17% increase on last year, nearly doubling the growth path during the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>EBITDA growth of 17% is reported, including lower output and lower distribution revenues in Argentina, affected both by lower rainfall and inflation-linked increase in fixed cost.</p>
          <p>Due to the recent events in this country, I would like to underline the limited exposure we have in terms of net attributable profits and total capital investment.  We are talking about less than 1% on our total assets in both cases.</p>
          <p>And now, Enel Green Power.  EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;1.2 billion, representing a 20% increase on a like-for-like basis versus last year.  This improvement is due to the contribution of &#x20AC;57 million from Italy, mainly driven by higher generation margin, partially offset by negative effect of energy incentives.  &#x20AC;62 million from North America, due to the contribution of higher volumes and &#x20AC;51 million from South America, mainly the result of higher volumes produced in Panama, which has totaled &#x20AC;38 million of additional EBITDA.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt evolution is concerned, you see that overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;49.9 billion, net of the discontinued operation.  The reduction of the debt is mainly due to the impact of extraordinary activities.  In particular, the sale of Endesa Europe and Viesgo to E.On and the acquisition of further 22.6% OGK-5 and Muntenia.</p>
          <p>2008 net ordinary cash flow was positive by about &#x20AC;200 million and we expect it to be even more positive this year.  You can find all the relevant details about our liquidity profile in the annexes.</p>
          <p>Thank you for you attention.  And now I'll hand over to Fulvio Conti for the strategic plan 2009-2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luigi.  As you just heard, 2008 results are confirmed that we are delivering a strategy that we initiated back in 2005.</p>
          <p>In the meantime as we already commented, we are facing an economic and financial environment worldwide turning down, a dramatic deterioration that we need to take into account.  And to counter this, we have outlined already key priorities in terms of financial stability.</p>
          <p>Now, its time to move to the other major key areas of our interests.  For consolidation and integration, the best practice transfers control of the whole value chain as well as upstream and mainstream integration in commodities, will be our top priorities.</p>
          <p>We will also maintain our leadership position in our core markets, which I remind you are Italy, Iberia, Slovakia, Russia, Eastern Europe, Latam, renewables in our all our exiting geographies.</p>
          <p>We will be making targeted investments as well as selective divestments, aim at maintaining our cost leadership in a vertical integrated business model.  With about 60 million customers, service quality will continue to be a must.  And we'll export the technological leadership that we have developed in Italy across the whole Group.</p>
          <p>Renewables will continue to represent a strategic industry characterized by high growth rates and we intend to strengthen our footprint here, as you will hear later on.  We will capitalize on the quality of our assets which are less dependent than the peers on subsidies and incentives, more resilient than others.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we'll continue to promote new technologies, investing in particular in carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen, solar and smart grids.</p>
          <p>But before going into Italian operations, let me give you a base assumption underpinning our plan.  This chart shows the commodity price and the electricity demand scenario on which we have based the strategy and targets to our plan.</p>
          <p>In particular, as far as demand is concerned, we have assumed a material slowdown in 2009 in all of our key markets, while we do expect growth of gradual return from 2010 onwards.  But thanks to the action that we'd taken, you will see that our margins will remain stable despite this general negative environment.</p>
          <p>Moreover, I would like to underline that despite a collapse of electricity demand the last few months, our fuel mix coupled with a well-diversified customer base and our forward sales program allowed us to protect margins and achieve a consolidated EBITDA for the first two months of this year, higher than in 2008.  Indeed our preliminary January and February results here to-date are showing an EBITDA of &#x20AC;2.5 billion versus &#x20AC;2.2 billion, with Endesa still consolidated at 67%.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look in Italian operations in more detail.  On average we expect Italian electricity demand to grow by about 1% a year over the course of the plan in the next five years.  This year we anticipated demand will be reduced by economic weaknesses and we forecast that demand grow will return from 2010 onward.  That's already made clear.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, we see competitors reconsidering their CCGT investments profile.  And thus these technology are likely to suffer the largest impact from demand weakness.  We confirm the soundness of our generation mix by the way, which is made up of hydro, coal and CCGT which burns a more competitive end for gas and which will give Enel &#x2013; which is giving Enel a more efficient cost structure than our peers.</p>
          <p>In light of all of this, our strategy for Generation and Energy Management division in Italy will be based on two key areas.  We will continue our clean-coal conversion plan.  Now I'm very proud to remind you that our state-of-the-art Civitavecchia plant is now in operation.  The first group is moving forward quite nicely.  Moreover by 2010, coal production will be 40% of our total generation mix, even without the contribution of the Porto Tolle plant, which we'll be striving to get up and running by 2014.</p>
          <p>Developing our mid-stream strategy in gas sourcing is of particular importance to us.  I confirm our commitment to the Porto Empedocle gasify unit, a capacity of about eight billion cubic meters, a total investment of about &#x20AC;600 million.  We do not expect any major impact from the move to a payer as bit mechanism, while we're forecasting a gradual reduction in the contribution from the ancillary services.</p>
          <p>Let me move to the domestic market.  As you know the liberalization process of the Italian market has been completed in bulk electricity and gas sector.  In this framework our strategy will be one of maintaining a leadership position by reaching close to nine million customers by 2013, reducing our cost-to-serve from 45 years to 24 years per customer by 2013, mainly by optimizing back office and improving on our quality standards.  That's a lot of money to save.</p>
          <p>We continue to serve retail markets with innovative commercial proposal to appeal customers and reduce churn rate to a bare minimum.  You will hear starting from Sunday a new offer, which is going to be introduced by us to prove that point to the Italian retail market.</p>
          <p>On domestic Infrastructure and Networks, we'll continue to be focused on cost leadership and technological innovation.  This will go together with maintaining our high quality standards, which have been strengthened also by the completion of our digital-meter program.</p>
          <p>Our average cumulative duration of interruptions per customer will go further down from the 56 minutes to 47 minutes in 2013.  Our innovations such as development of the Smart Grid, which can also integrate electrical vehicles, public-lighting system based on LED technology and digital meters for gas will help to strengthen our leadership position.  Moreover, this division will contribute almost 14 billion operating cash flow in the next five years.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at International division.  First, key important areas are in this regard Slovakia and Russia.  In Slovakia, despite the recent decrease in electricity demand, we still believe this market to remain tight in the medium term with a reserve margin lower than 15% before the operation of the new Mochovce plant will be available.  As for Russia, the liberalization process is progressing as planned.  Internal gross pricing are rising and this will be reflected ultimately in higher electricity price.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to expand our nuclear activities in France by participating in the EPR project with a total investment of &#x20AC;400 million.  And we are looking into the second EPR unit at Penly after the Flamanville, which we're working together with our friends in EDF.</p>
          <p>Finally, in Romania we continue to invest to improve quality standards of the electricity grid and will continue to be focused on customer satisfaction by yielding very attractive returns on investments.</p>
          <p>Few more words on Slovakia and Russia.  In Slovakia, the investment for the completion of unit three and four of Mochovce nuclear plant is a key priority.  It will allow us to allocate capacity constraints and strengthen our presence in the central region.  In addition, we will reduce outages and optimize maintenance to maximize competitiveness of our generation fleet.</p>
          <p>In Russia, we will be investing &#x20AC;2 billion, mainly in improving our generation mix by building two new CCGT plants for a total of 100 megawatts of new capacity, which will increase our margin as we will be replacing less efficient open-cycle units.  And we'll continue to invest in the upstream gas.</p>
          <p>By the way, we do expect to deliver first gas from Severenergia in 2010 and to ramp up its production of equity gas at 20% ownership, up to six billion cubic meters, a big production.  And all of this will be feeding our combined-cycle plans into the Russian market, thus further increasing our marginalities.  In the meantime, we're focused on significant efficiency programs.  To sum up, I strongly believe Russia will continue to be a key market for Enel.</p>
          <p>Let me move into Endesa.  Endesa will pursue a leadership strategy in each of its key markets, developing organic growth in line with expected demand, and continue to invest in maintenance and quality standards.  Therefore in line with current microeconomic conditions, over the next five years Endesa will invest a total of slightly in excess of &#x20AC;13 billion.</p>
          <p>Despite this unfavorable economic environment, Endesa will preserve its margins, targeting an EBITDA level in 2010 in line with the very good results achieved in 2008.  We will deliver this result focusing on operational excellence, efficiency and a major synergy plan, on which I will dwell on in a moment.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Endesa's pipeline project in renewables will reinforce overall strategy of the Group in this field.  More specifically, Spain will continue to remain a strategic market.  In the medium term, we expect peninsula electricity demand to grow by about 1.7% per year on average.  In this scenario, the reserve margin will be stable just below 20% with electricity prices remaining stable in the region of 45 to &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour up to 2010.</p>
          <p>In regulation, we see signs of positive developments.  In July 2009, with the introduction of the tarifa Ultimo Recurso, final tariff for the unqualified customer, the market will conclude its path towards full liberalization.  The government is committed by the way to solve also the structural debtor's issue.</p>
          <p>As regard to generation, Endesa will keep its current leadership position through a more balanced generation mix in the mainland, thanks to an efficient investment plan in new CCGT capacity, amounting to 1.6 gigawatt and &#x20AC;0.7 billion.  And new pump storage capacity, investing &#x20AC;250 million for around 400 megawatt capacity.  And this will allow Endesa to catch market opportunities arising from the strong growth in renewables.</p>
          <p>As regard to sales, Endesa will keep its current balance and leadership position.  On the extra-peninsular system, where demand is growing at higher level than the peninsular system, Endesa will invest about &#x20AC;1 billion to develop one gigawatt of capacity, with a mix of CCGTs and fuel oil.  Other investments will be done to ensure good level of service to its customers and they're in attractive regulatory framework.</p>
          <p>In renewables, after the recent agreement with Acciona, Endesa can still rely on a pipeline of 7,000 megawatt of viable projects and a base of 800 megawatt uninstalled capacity.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to distribution where the regulatory scenario is moving towards a RAB-based system, rewarding investments and quality.  Endesa's adapting its investment plan in line with expected demand, while ensuring a good level of service to its customer base.  Moreover, we do expect Endesa to implement the digital metering system over its entire network by 2015.</p>
          <p>In Latam, I think Latam represents a strategic platform for growth for Endesa.  And our EBITDA will continue to increase in the short and medium term.  The macroeconomic environment is less gloomy than in other regions, God bless them.  Most of the countries in this area are not deeply affected by the current economic crises, thanks to the successful economic policy implemented in recent years.</p>
          <p>Hence we foresee average demand growth between four and 5% for the next five years.  Most of these markets are basically tight and power price forecasts in the medium and long term are expected to guarantee satisfactory returns on investments.  Moreover, regulatory frameworks are advanced, transparent and stable, providing stability and predictability for the medium and long term.</p>
          <p>More than 80% of EBITDA coming from distribution belongs to companies that have completed or about to complete their tariff revisions with a four to five years horizon.  Most countries, and mainly Chile, have implemented long-term generation pricing and contracting schemes.  Endesa will invest in new capacity generation in Chile, about 700 megawatts of both thermal and renewables, in Columbia 400 megawatt hydro, in Peru 200 megawatt of gas, keeping its current leadership position in the area.  In all of our operations we'll pursue maximum efficiency ratios, maintaining optimal quality-of-service levels and reducing grid losses.</p>
          <p>As far as synergies are concerned, the acquisition of the further 25% of Endesa will allow us to accelerate the implementation of the synergy program and to enhance the final amount of 750 million per annum by 2012, indicated as a target on December 2007.  More specifically, in 2008 we extracted synergies of &#x20AC;266 million, about &#x20AC;100 million higher than the original target.</p>
          <p>Relevant projects which are part of this program, involving all relevant business areas are focused on distribution, generation and procurement.  Moreover, other projects will be developed.  And we are committing now to a new synergy target of at least &#x20AC;1 billion of savings by 2013.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to Enel Green Power.  Renewables will continue to play a very important role in the future of Enel's and Enel's Group.  Across all of our markets, there are strong condition for growth fueled by incentive schemes and requests for reaching a general CO2 abatement in mass European countries.  I'm also very comforted by the new energy program of the U.S. administration, aiming at boosting renewable industry in the U.S.A., for which Enel has a very solid head start.</p>
          <p>In this industry, we can leverage on a unique mix of geographies and technologies, delivering not only growth but a strong cash flow from year one, which can also be used for shareholders' remuneration.</p>
          <p>Our strategy here &#x2013; I think our strategy is based on the deployment and new projects from our pipeline, some of which are already authorized.  Growth will be mainly focused on wind, on which we will invest about &#x20AC;2 billion in the next five years, bringing us total capacity from 1.2 gigawatt in 2008 to 2.8 gigawatt in 2013.</p>
          <p>In geothermal, we will add another 130 megawatt to our existing asset base, reaching 800 megawatt in 2013.  This 20% increase will consolidate our world leadership in the geothermal field.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to our overall financial targets to finish my presentation to you.  I think the numbers projected in this chart are already affected by tougher conditions in terms of commodity price and electricity demand.  But the initiatives we have taken such as those to strengthen our capital structure and to improve our efficiency are now boosting our cash flow and will protect us from the short-term challenges.  But we also finally lay a robust platform for growth in the medium and long term.  The targets we are setting here clearly show the benefits we are gaining from the Endesa transaction and we expect to drive earning growth through 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Well, thank you very much for the attention and we're now pleased to entertain any questions you might have.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  I remind you that we will be collecting questions not only here, but also from people who are lively connected from the web, which I thanks for staying with us, and also from people who logged in via phone call.  Let's start from here.  First question, Alberto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning.  Alberto Gandolfi, UBS.  First of all, I wanted to ask you about, you've given 2010 and 2013, but I was wondering if we could have bit more clarity on &#x2013; a sort of a normalized situation, given the macro environment for 2011? 2011 is the first year where you don't have much forward selling, so what do you expect in terms of EBITDA and net income then? And can you elaborate your underlying assumptions just, for instance, if we take the carry forward curve?</p>
          <p>The second question is about &#x2013; you have, I think, in Slide Six, you're talking about 68 billion of operating cash flow, which I understand is already post-tax.  Now that is based on quite, let me say, probably aggressive long-term oil assumption of 83.  Can you explain how you do the build-up to that? So what would expect for '11 and '12 as well for oil? And if we were to see oil at 50 from here to 2013 how would that look? How would that 68 billion change and how would you react to it? Would you cut CapEx?</p>
          <p>Or &#x2013; and the third question is about dividends.  Sorry, that's the last one, I promise.  On 60% payout, my personal view is that the visibility on dividend is going down.  It isn't anymore a flexed dividend, which means that you're probably a bit more exposed to the power price and commodity evolution.  So for instance, I hear you're assuming constant spark spread in Italy and in Spain, but if we are in a demand-induced oversupply and 2011 numbers are bad and you do the rights issue, is there a floor you can put to that dividend per share? Even if you disagree with this view of the world, but is there a floor you can put on the dividend? Or if we see a really bad net income then you will stick to 60% pay out? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alberto, you could have asked also, what happens if I die tomorrow? The world will be maybe less polluted.  Several questions, I mean, very technical and I'm afraid I have to bother our audience over here with a different explanation.  But in general, let me put this way, and then I'll ask Luigi to integrate the more precise answers on your individual questions.  We have used our, let us say, common-sense approach to building our plan.  We don't want to be seen as pessimistic or optimistic.  We want to go straight into what we consider to be credible, in terms of commodity-price assumption, in terms of demand, we take stock of today's situation.  But we're not saying gloom and doom forever.  We're saying recession come and go.  The only question if I would be exactly knowing when recession will go, obviously I will be making a lot of money but &#x2013; and you as well.  But we're taking the view that economic worldwide variables will start recovering into 2010.  I think it's most economic assumptions of major institutions are purporting this case.</p>
          <p>And as a consequence of this, we think that if you make a stress case of one event in 20 years or one event in 50 years, as some of the bankers over here in the room will know it, I think we are in the solid path of solid assumptions.  And a solid assumption, looking at today's on commodity pricing, is going to tell you that as an inventory low.  Low price in a certain given time reduce the level of investment, the level of investment reduce, ratify the supply side of the oil, the price goes up and therefore you have to expect this same phenomenon to occur.  And I've seen this in my 40 years career many times.</p>
          <p>That's why I believe that what we're giving you is real fact-of-life assumption, a solid assumption and we should stick into &#x2013; we should stick to that.  Now we also have run sensitivities.  You would expect that to be our role, to check what happen if everything goes berserk.  In the short term, it will not be that dramatic because, as Luigi will tell you, 2011, it will continue to be right at the same level, if slightly more increasing &#x2013; slightly more than 2010 onward.  And again, this is based on the assumption that the &#x20AC;55 &#x2013; $55 a barrel of crude oil is slightly ramped up, based on the development of the economies.  As far as dividend is concerned, you are too smart of an analyst not to appreciate the point that we said three elements here.  We said we're going to make 60% payout.  I'm giving you guidance of what I do expect in terms of ordinary income.  And the only unknown factor will be how many shares you will be facing at that point in time because this will be dependent on the capital-stock increase.  But you can calculate it for yourself, Alberto, you don't need to ask me the same question.  If the net income will go down, it's the same question that you might ask, what happen if I die tomorrow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Just to add few figures about what Fulvio said.  The assumption that here we have in terms of Brent in 2011 is $68 per barrel.  So it's a slow increase versus the 55.  It is even slower if we look at the base-load price that we have assumed in our plan in 2011.  I'm referring for instance to Italy, which is, I would say, the market most influenced by the Brent variations.  If you look at Italy, we have a base-load price in the region of &#x20AC;65-per-megawatt-hour in 2011, which means &#x20AC;5 more than 2010.  So I think it's realistic.  And I don't want to say conservative, but it's in line with a slow increase of the Brent and consequences on the electricity price.  Because you know the gas is &#x2013; and the commodity fix in the price in Italy and therefore we have a six-months, nine-months delay in seeing the change in the Brent into the base load.</p>
          <p>We made of course some sensitivities.  As you know our key markets are Spain, Slovakia and Italy.  I would say that Slovakia is mainly driven by the coal rather than the Brent, whilst Italy and Slovakia &#x2013; Italy, sorry, and Spain are much more driven by the Brent.  Then we have the Latin America, which is a little bit a different story, it's a little bit more complex, but just to give you an idea, at the end of the day, let's assume that rather than having 68 in 2011, we are going to have again 50.  The impacts on our total EBITDA could not exceed more than &#x20AC;500 million, assuming that we have not sold forward, that we have not hedged, so just in a free situation.  Of course that will not be the case because we are going to sell forward.  And as usual there will be a slow decline of the prices and therefore the margin.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.  Susanna?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome back, Susanna.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Susanna Invernizzi from Barclays Capital.  A few question, if I may.  If I look at the CapEx...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you speak up, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The CapEx savings that you mention in generation, can you elaborate how much of those savings are associated with the reduced cost of equipment and raw material? Then talking again about the sensitivity but this time for the short term, what if you don't succeed in selling assets for 10 billion in the next couple of years? What sort of flexibility you have vis-&#xE0;-vis the target to maintain your credit rating? And then just a quick question on Porto Tolle, if you can just give us an update on the implementation schedule that you have in your plan? And when you expect the investment to kick-off? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for CapEx I will ask also engineering department here, Livio, if he wants to answer to that.  But in general principal we say the ongoing CapEx, the one already earmarked at today's price, today's meeting, the final months of 2008, or whenever the order has been placed.  As you know some of the items that we are using for our CapEx are long lead times, therefore you pre-commit and there is a sort of phasing in of the new pricing system.  Today commodities such as steel, copper, whatever are obviously dramatically reduced by the economic conditions.  So we're trying to get the most locking in for our committed capital expenditures, a lower commodity price and "renegotiating" with our suppliers all these items.  I think overall you would expect in general principal to have, for the same unit, something close to 15 to 20% saving, if you are tough negotiator.</p>
          <p>The second question related to what if.  What if? Well as you see we, first of all, strongly believe in what we say and therefore, it's &#x2013; let me say without being aggressive or arrogant that there's a fair assumption that we're taking the view to dispose of those &#x20AC;10 billion.  So that's the same.  The fact that we are commenting on execution rather than what if, it's an indication that we believe in those.  But if the situation will not be as favorable as we consider it to be, well there will be still the usual items that you can work on, caps reduction, working-capital reduction, dividend readjustment.  Again this is more a theoretical case because I think we're taking caution and timeframe length to not fire sale any of these assets.  And with the comfort of a rights issue being available I think we can take a longer-term view on the matching the quality of our assets with the <mark type="audio gap" /> for those assets.  Have I answered you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Porto Tolle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was the question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Porto Tolle, yes.  Sure, sure.  Sorry.  Porto Tolle is obviously intimate part of our strategy of growth, growth meaning growing margins capability in Italy more than growing market share.  And coal, as you've seen from the chart, especially with the new technology and the high efficiency of 46, 48% yield is obviously very important to us.  We're stubbornly working across the pond of bureaucratic infrequencies of the Italian system.  There we are not yielding, not inching at all.  We continue to strive for getting this final approval, possibly this year.  Difficulties are bureaucratic, difficulties are administrative, are not conceptually, are not physical.  But are just a matter of being persistent and get to the final point of final approval by the Italian authorities.  Right now we are in the final stage of this process.</p>
          <p>There is still some resistance coming from a court that is thinking that this plant might be polluting.  And so it's preventing the good fellows of the &#x2013; called the Commissione VIA to take the final decision that is instrumental to this.  Now it's difficult to assess that a plant, which is right now on paper, it will be a polluting plant, because it's on paper.  And preempting this by court, it's an invasion of authorities, so to speak.  If you want it's like if you would be restrained from taking your car in the morning because you might be colliding with someone and create damages to someone, you know what I mean.</p>
          <p>So we're fighting that issue and we think at the end common sense will prevail.  This is a plant that a great majority of the local people want to have.  This is a plant that has already passed through the entire administrative and technological engineering processing.  And we now are obviously heading on to get approved by the commission, so that we can start breaking ground before the end of the year.  And that's why we're saying we do expect to have it in 2014, not in the horizon of this plan.  But definitely we want to progress with that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I've got three questions.  The first one, can you please give us visibility in terms of what are your thermal margins assumptions for &#x2013; in the business plan? And the ideal load factors for Italy, given that we expect 2009 to be a rich year in terms of load factors, but what about the long-term? Now coming back to your guidance, on your long-term guidance, would you be able to give us the sensitivity on your 2013 EBITDA on the basis of your last year assumption of $75 per barrel, which was your long-term assumption, or even at $60 per barrel? And finally, can you give us some visibility in terms of your expectations for 2009, in terms of EBITDA? And in particular, can you give us visibility in terms of your forward selling, if they are kind of take-or-pay base? Or what is the kind of volume impact that you might have in a weakening economic environment and slowing demand? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to go through the entire plan again, okay.  That's fine, that's fine.  For the margins and the hydro, I'll ask our friend Gianfilippo Mancini, who's heading this division, to stand up and making the answer.  Luigi, you can intervene if you want, and for the &#x2013; well, you're preparing the answer for the rest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, yes.  On margins, on thermal production, the margins we expect are in the range of &#x20AC;20 per megawatt hour.  The overall margins in terms of spark spread, we have seen in the market, also in 2008 are in that range.  When we deal with CCGT technology, though, you have to consider the fact that in addition to that level of margin which is the base load margin, you have to add the positive impact in our portfolio. Refer to the fact that we modulate with this fleet and that we are able to get sourcing conditions for gas better than the competitor.  So that would add up an additional &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour in terms of margins.</p>
          <p>When we move to the hydro production, we have basically incorporated in our business plan a sound I think scenario which forecast the level of production and hydraulic conditions similar to the average conditions we had in the past 30 years.  Of course this year, we have entered into this year with a much better condition.  We have seen a 30% increase compared to the 30 years historical path.  When we &#x2013; maybe we can address also the other question relating to the hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the hedging, 2009 hedging positions, we have seen before that we have hedged the whole portfolio of generation at a base load equivalent price in the range of &#x20AC;80, which translates into sales to final customers for something around 65 terawatt hours in the range of &#x20AC;85 per megawatt hour, base load equivalent again.  The downturn in terms of demand, we might have a marginal impact, refer to the decreased consumption, particularly by the industrial sector.  Of course, we expect that impact to be in range two terawatt hours on a yearly basis with a very minor impact on margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Thank you, Gianfilippo.  Now I will take care about the last three question.  The third, if I'm not wrong, was about the difference in terms of spreads versus last year Brent.  Last year we have utilized the $75 per barrel.  Here we are assuming $83 per barrel.  I think I can answer with a different sign, what I said before, if we have a decline of $10 per barrel what happens to our margin.  And we said there could be an impact in the region of &#x20AC;500 million.  Therefore, if we assume 83 versus 75, we could assume that we are very close to that effect versus last year.  Of course, keeping all the remaining assumption unchanged, otherwise we have to factor additional impact.</p>
          <p>When it comes to 2009 EBITDA well, I think first of all we are going to benefit of the 100% consolidation of Endesa, which reasonably I think is going to start close to June.  And on top of this, if I look at what happened in the first two months, as our CEO said, we have recorded an improvement versus last year almost in the region of 10%.  So we should assume that's for sure it will be higher than this year because of the effect of the consolidation of Endesa, but also because of the effect of our margin.  In particular, as I said before, we have a backlog in Generation and Energy margin management division of contract with an average base load price of &#x20AC;80.  And so I think we should expect a slight improvement on a like-for-like basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.  On the contracts, are those take-or-pay or is there a volume &#x2013; potential volume effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a potential volume effect.  They are not take-or-pay.  Therefore, there might be a difference in the price, as we said, should the effect go ahead &#x2013; should the reduction volume go ahead in this way.  If I'm not wrong, which I believe, we are talking about 50, the total impact of it.  Let's assume that this year the electricity demand will go down 10%, just to give you an idea, in Italy.  And therefore, we have to consider that some customer might reduce definitely their consumption, then what happens to our margin? Well I think we have made some assumption in the region of 100 million euro, nothing more, maximum, even less.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think we got one other question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Dario Michi, Banca Akros.  Could you please give us some detail on the portfolio rationalization program you are carrying on, mainly focusing on Enel Green Power? Are you going to lease the company or are you going to sell a minority stake to some private investor? And the the non-strategic assets you are going to sell in 2009 and 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it's on the chart, as you've seen, that we are speaking about, Enel Green Power.  A wonderful opportunity for an investor who likes to promote the green power concept and would like to reap the benefits of strong cash flows.  And with this basis, we are receiving a lot of attention, in particular from sovereign funds today, which are specializing in renewables energy.  You will have to bear with me, I cannot give you names and address, of course, on a confidential basis.  And this would be my preferred route, because it will have the impact of crystallizing the value of what we have built over time, and will give further latitudes for expansion in the future.  And we started with this assumption that, in 2009, it will be difficult to go to the markets and ask for a secondary offering to be under written.  That's why I think it's worth exploring to the extent that they are coming to us, this route as opposed to a flotation of the Company.  But we cannot discard anything, if the conditions of the market will change.  We've obviously entertained these things.</p>
          <p>And the fundamental point, as you see, this Company is delivering 1.2 billion EBITDA today, and 1.5, 1.6 in five years time.  And we're not selling you pie in the sky projects.  We're not selling you astronomical pipelines just for the sake of appealing you.  As good common sense businessmen, we will go piecemeal into developing what we believe is going to be accretive.  And I wish to stress once more the point that our EBITDA on renewables is less dependent than everybody else on the prince giving you incentives.  It's business that's standing alone, deliver results.  And that's good really omen for good valorization of the asset.</p>
          <p>For the rest of our disposal, we have seen two years, 2009 and 2010.  The two things that I've mentioned are fore coming.  One is already done, the other one is being done by us because we have received two offers, and we will be &#x2013; possibly go to an early summer closing of this deal for the gas distribution network.  Green Power, we commented already.  I do expect to achieve a decent valuation for that, and I'm taking a prudent approach.  I'm not asking 20 times EBITDA.  I'm more content of a lower valuation.  And there's still room for improving the value because today, you would be valuating your sum of the parts.  Our renewables may be a mere eight or nine times EBITDA.  Well, I like to get more than that, but not 20, because I don't think it will be appealing to anybody.</p>
          <p>On the other end, for the other strategic assets, as I mentioned to you, because of the quality of the assets that we are earmarking, because of the position that there will be qualified buyers for those assets that we know already, like has been the case for our high voltage distribution network, we are confident.  We are definitely confident that we can achieve those results in the years 2009, 2010.  The reason why I'm not telling you the names and the latitude of those is because I don't want to under sell it.  I don't want to create public announcement on things that are requesting confidentiality and intense labor to work it out.  And you will bear with me on that.  Would you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But going on here, a couple of interesting questions coming from the web.  A couple of guys are asking about detail, possible details of our credit maturities, debt maturities expected for the year 2009, 2010.  And also there are a couple of question showing interest in what we've indicated as, let me say, initiation of our nuclear projects in Italy, if you can give a general overlook of this project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start with the second, and then I will ask Claudio Machetti or Luigi Ferraris to dwell on the profile of the maturities.  Nuclear, to remind the audience, we are back to nuclear engineering capabilities and generation for good, since some years now.  We are in the nuclear business in Slovak Republic with the VVR-400 technology and we are expanding our plant out there right now with the investments that I presented to you in Mochovce. We're obviously nuclearists in Spain and Rafael Miranda and Pepe Borgus are sitting in this room will &#x2013; can entertain you on the nuclear activities in Spain with the American U.S. and gas technologies.</p>
          <p>We have nuclear in France because we are now, together with EDF, we're in a minorities position, building.  But they are 68 engineers of ours building together with the French engineers in Flamanville, the EPR projects of 1,600 megawatts capacity.  And we now are telling you we want to go beyond that, moving into the second EPR projects in France, which is probably in the channel cost line, with the same EPR technology that we are implementing in Flamanville.</p>
          <p>To the extent that we are become &#x2013; or we are reborn as a nuclear generator, we think we can take advantage of the possible evolution of the legislation that is being pursued by our current government here in Italy, and to promote nuclear initiatives in this country.  We have agreed with a memorandum that's been signed a few weeks ago, during the bilateral meeting between the two presidents of France and Italy, to start looking into a partnership with EDF opened to rest of the world, other operators and energy intense operators, to participate into the development of this capacity.  This is a long-term project.  We have ideas to promote at least four new units using EPR technology.  This is not an exclusive assumption, we can also look into different technology if needs be.</p>
          <p>There is plan that if the government is pursuing to promote nuclear up to 25% of the full load generation capacity over the years. And if you project our demand in the Italian market in the next few years, you will have to reach a level of about 400 terawatt hours of consumption in the years 2015 and onwards.  And therefore, 25% of this will be almost eight new units.  We are, at the moment, speaking about four units with the EPR technology.  But all of this only if and when parliament in Italy will approve a new law that will allow us to do this.  Today, this is not yet the case.</p>
          <p>There is piece of legislation being discussed in parliament right now, heavily sponsored by the government, which we do expect that will be approved sometime in the &#x2013; in spring time.  And if this happens of course, we can effectively deploy all of our engineering capabilities, our partnership with the EDF to promote nuclear in our country.  What we are saying in our plan is that towards the end of our plan, around 2012, 2013, if these things happens, we will be spending little money initially.  Then obviously in the next plans, you will see more of that to promote nuclear activities.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will hand over to Claudio, but before, let me remind you that on chart Number 27, the annexes, you have the maturity profile of our debt.  But if &#x2013; Claudio, can you address the answer please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I want to say that the consequence of the right issue, and the loans of &#x20AC;8 billion to finance the acquisition of the 25% of Endesa, will be to increase the average maturity from five to 5.5 years and, thanks to the decline in interest rates, to reduce the average cost of capital &#x2013; the average cost of debt to around 5% from 5.5%.  Going to the maturities in 2010, the total number is approximately &#x20AC;16,000 million, of which 5,000 are represented by a facility to be renewed.  In any case, we are in good position to repay everything, thanks to the right issue disposal and operating cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Philippe Ourpatian from Natixis Securities, just one question about your ratings.  You mentioned that you are strongly committed to maintain your ratings.  I just want to have some explanation about &#x2013; have you clearly present your plan to the rating agencies, the current plan you present to us this morning.  And have they confirmed their commitment to maintain the ratings you have, including all the disposal on the short-term basis.  Means you mentioned disposal for '09 and '10, but if there is any delay looking at the economic condition what's going to happen on your rating? And second question about the bond markets, I just want to confirm that Endesa will use its own name in order to issue some bonds on the Spanish or International market? Or are you going to centralize those emission under the brand name of Enel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with the last question, the answer is very easy.  Endesa is a publicly listed company, and the Madrid Stock Exchange has its own jurisdiction, its own board, its own prerogatives.  And all the integration we're speaking here is more functional than juridical.  Therefore, if that instrument issued under name of Endesa it will be obviously renegotiated under the name Endesa.  The other question is related to the rating.  Of course we are dealing with the rating agencies on a daily basis.  It's like I have &#x2013; I don't want to say a joke for the sake of doing it, but I spend more time with them than with my wife.  So I have to rely on your ability to understand that we are not presenting you a case without having the benefit of some feedback from these guys.  And the feedback that I'm giving you is that we can maintain our A-minus rating and A2 ratings.  Okay.  Flexibility is built in our plan.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next, down there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Roberto Latita from Equita.  A very quick question from me on the ancillary service contribution that you are expecting in '013, in light of the possible revision of the mechanisms.  So if you can highlight the change from the '08 contribution versus the '013 contribution in your margins? And another question, so when you talk about the other residual disposal, are you talking about minority stakes disposals in order for you to still fully consolidate the EBITDA? Or are you going to fully sell those assets in the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me dwell on this last question.  I used the word that I carefully drafted, peripheral assets, which are not fitting with our strategic model.  I mean you've seen that we've become a large company, haven't we.  We have 95 gigawatts, 60 million customers, 22 countries and many different assets under this huge portfolio of business opportunities.  And in doing this, sitting on my chair, you will see that there are areas where you could do without it, whether it's a generation, it's a distribution, it's whatever, to the extent that it's not fitting with the rest of the business that we're building.  I would not say more than this, because again, I will not give you any hint on which assets we're dealing with because we are already discussing about potential disposal.  And therefore, whatever I'm say on top of this will be damaging our negotiations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have to answer our second question, yes.  When it comes to the ancillary services, or, as you probably heard during my presentation, we have already reduced our margin during 2008 versus 2007 of &#x20AC;50 million.  And we are assuming in our plan to have a further reduction, certainly, I would say, in the region of 300 million euro by 2013.  So therefore we should expect from that business a margin which could be in the region in that year of 400, 500 million euro.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, excuse me again.  Alberto Gandolfi, UBS.  I have two questions.  The first one is very detailed, so very quick.  The second one, I apologize in advance for.  The first one is about &#x2013; can you please elaborate just the cost of debt, financial expenses in terms of interest percentage you're assuming in 2013.  Can you &#x2013; you talked about spark spreads in Italy, but can you also talked about Spain? And what are you assuming, even generic Latam currencies, in the plan? Thank you.  And the second one, I assume that with these assumptions that you're talking in the plan, and given the time you spend with rating agencies, that we should not see a write-down in Endesa, if your plan proves to be right in completing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not.  We're not contemplating any write-down of Endesa.  As a matter of fact, we do run impairment tests every month, and they all confirmed that we have made the right acquisition at the right price.  And it's still holding quite nicely, that benchmark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start from the average cost of debt that we have assumed in our plan.  It is in the region of 5.5% on average.  So, I think, we can consider it probably a little bit pessimistic, if you look at the last decision of the Central Bank, but that's the averages we have in our business plan.  Then I think there was a question about the spark spread in Spain.  I don't know if we want to have our friends from Spain to...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, right now, the spread of coal of course is more competitive than gas in Spain.  But we see this over the years, over the plan, because of a relative movement of the price of coal.  And because of an increase which we see as we have seen in the beginning, the increase in the price of CO2.  We see two spreads to become very similar in the second and towards the end part of the plan.  I don't know, Claudio if you want to add something?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I agree absolutely with you.  That's the first thing.  The second thing is that, as we said in our conference call for final results of 2008, what we are expecting is something higher than 10 euros per megawatt hour in this very, very packed environment.</p>

          <p>Hello.  Anna Maria calling from Credit Suisse, again.  Can you just give us a sense in what are your CO2 assumptions for 2013, given that we are moving towards full allocation of full auctioning of the permits? So what are your assumptions? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're right, of course we are capturing in our models and in our business plan the full cost of paying for all the allocations.  For all the allowances from 2013 onwards, we see the markets at present conditions in a position at European market level, in a position to meet the 20% reduction, bearing in mind a price of CO2 in the range from 20 to 30 euros per ton and this is what we envisage in our plan, as most of the analysts now do.  And we also believe that the flexibility that will be allowed in terms of utilization of the surge mechanism will be lower than the one we have in this second period.  As you know we have balanced position, we have shortage as you can see in an excess in the range of 30 million tons in the second phase.  We believe in the third phase our fleet, our technological mix of generation would be such to provide us with very good hedging in terms of short position towards the long position on sales.  So, we have a good hedging on the overall fleet in Italy and throughout the fleet in Europe.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.  Roberto Latita again, from Equita.  On the debt impact of the capital expenditure reduction, I see that there is a lot of reduction in the maintenance expense for the capital expenditure.  So I am wondering, how is that the maintenance CapEx goes from 4 billion to 2 billion.  So it's almost halved.  Can you just a little bit elaborate on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I mentioned during the presentation that we're not changing the overall package of projects that we developed.  And we are taking into account two things.  First of all, a general reduction on unitary costs of coupling and transformers and whatever, because of the current economic climate that we living, which we take advantage of in this case.  And the second is that we are re-profiling, because of our efficiency gains that we have obtained through the prior year's investments, re-profiling our CapEx maintenance.  We're not forgiving any single intervention that would be requested to stay on business.  But we definitely are profiling it based on ad hoc investments necessity and combination of these two things get to a lower amount.  But even in the prior year's plan, you would have seen an amount going down.  And therefore it's no surprise that there is a sort of efficiency experience curve building up that which will lower the total amount of investment.  All right?</p>

But since we are talking about a huge amount of money, I think we have to prepare very well the dossier and the paper and discuss with the local authorities the application of this possibility.  Anyway, the option is still open and I'll be more specific once the situation, we'll be definitely addressing.</p>
