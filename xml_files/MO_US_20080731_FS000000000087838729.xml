          <p>Good day and welcome to Altria Client Services Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Cliff Fleet, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining our call.  This morning we will discuss Altria's second quarter business results. Our remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct you to the Safe Harbor Statement at the end of our earnings release for review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. As a result of the spinoff of Philip Morris International earlier this year, our reported results reflect PMI as a discontinued operation for the second quarter of 2007 and revenues and operating companies income for PMI are, therefore, excluded from Altria's continuing results. For a detailed review of Altria's second quarter business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, altria.com. Please note that in this morning's call, we will only be discussing the second quarter business results and we will not be discussing the status of litigation. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Cliff. Good morning. As you have seen from our press release, Altria reported very good business results in the second quarter. Altria delivered strong earnings per share growth with solid operating companies income performance from PM U.S.A and John Middleton. Altria reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.45.</p>
          <p>Excluding special items, Altria delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth from continuing operations up 12.2% to $0.46, primarily driven by higher operating companies income and lower general, corporate, and interest expense. For the first half of 2008, Altria's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 10.8% to $0.82.</p>
          <p>Altria is reaffirming that its full year 2008 guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $1.63 to $1.67. This represents an earning-per-share growth rate of 9 to 11% from an adjusted base of $1.50 per share in 2007. While our first-half results were at the high end of our earnings guidance range, we are taking a measured approach to the second half of 2008, as two factors could potentially impact our ability to exceed our earnings-per-share guidance. The factors include higher than expected inflation, which impacts PM U.S.A's resolution payments and input costs, as well as higher than expected cigarette industry volume declines. Even with these two factors, we remain confident that Altria will meet its financial objectives based on the strength of our businesses and a history of delivering business results in challenging external environments.</p>
          <p>This quarter, Altria benefited from accelerated cost savings generated by its previously announced corporate restructuring. Corporate expenses declined $43 million in the second quarter to $73 million, which should be the approximate run rate for the rest of the year. Altria expects to realize $250 million in annual savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the corporate restructuring.</p>
          <p>Altria also returned a substantial amount of cash to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.  Altria commenced its stock buyback program and repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of its stock. We repurchased 53.5 million shares during the quarter at an average price per share of $21.81.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Altria declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per common share paid to stockholders of record as of June 13, 2008. This equates to approximately $600 million in dividend payments. Combined, the stock buyback and dividends totaled approximately $1.8 billion. This represents over 4% of Altria's June 30 market capitalization.</p>
          <p>Now, let's discuss PM U.S.A's second-quarter results. PM U.S.A's second-quarter revenues, net of excise taxes increased 3.8% to approximately $4.1 billion. Excluding the $107 million in revenues from contract volume manufactured for PMI, PM U.S.A's revenues net of excise taxes increased 1%.</p>
          <p>PM U.S.A's operating companies' income increased 33.2% to approximately $1.3 billion due to lower pre-tax charges related to the Cabarrus facility closure, as well as lower wholesale promotional allowance rates. The positive impact of these factors on PM U.S.A's operating companies' income was partially offset by lower volume, increased resolution expenses, and costs related to the reduction of contract volume manufactured for PMI. Adjusted for items related to the Cabarrus facility closure, PM U.S.A's second-quarter 2008 operating companies' income increased by 3.8% to approximately $1.4 billion. PM U.S.A's adjusted OCI margins increased 90 basis points to 34.7% versus the year-earlier period. Margin improvements were driven by lower promotional spending and SG&amp;A cost reductions.</p>
          <p>PM U.S.A's domestic cigarette shipment volume of 43.6 billion units was 4.5% lower than the prior-year period but was estimated to be down approximately 3.5% when adjusted for changes in trade inventories.</p>
          <p>PM U.S.A's premium volume mix increased 50 basis points to 92.9% versus the year earlier period. In the second quarter, PM U.S.A estimates that total cigarette industry volume declined by approximately 4%. For the first half of 2008, PM U.S.A's domestic cigarette volume of 83.7 billion units was 2.9% lower than the prior year period, but was estimated to be down approximately 3.5% when adjusted for changes in trade inventories.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2008, PM U.S.A now projects a total cigarette industry volume decline of approximating three to 3.5%. PM U.S.A is also revising its estimated long term cigarette industry decline rate to a range of three to 3.5%. These revised industry decline rate estimates reflect PM U.S.A's current assessment of business conditions, which include economic conditions, cigarette excise tax activity, adult consumer activity across multiple tobacco categories, and trade inventory changes.</p>
          <p>Retailers appear to be carrying lower levels of cigarette inventories, which may be due to increased carrying costs for inventoried items, such as fuel and cigarettes. With over 400,000 stores selling cigarettes, this trade inventory reduction and its impact on industry volume estimates is difficult to measure precisely. Industry volume estimates are very sensitive to these trade inventory movements.</p>
          <p>The average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the second quarter was approximately $1.10 per pack, which is in line with PM U.S.A's 2008 forecast. To date in 2008, five states have increased their cigarette excise taxes with an average increase per state of $0.89 per pack.</p>
          <p>In a highly competitive environment, PM U.S.A's retail share grew a half a share point to 51% in the second quarter, driven by Marlboro. Marlboro increased its retail share by 8/10 of a share point to 41.8% as the brand continued to benefit from investment spending that PM U.S.A made earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Price snaps between Marlboro and the lowest effective priced cigarettes remained relatively stable at 43% in the second quarter. Marlboro's strong retail share gains were partially offset by share losses for Virginia Slims, while Basic and Parliament's retail shares were essentially unchanged versus the prior year period.</p>
          <p>The discount category remained relatively stable. Its second quarter retail share was unchanged versus the prior year period. PM U.S.A continues to invest in the development of adjacent smokeless products and test markets, both Marlboro Snus and Marlboro MST. PM U.S.A is pleased with these learnings and is incorporating them into future plans.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly update you on PM U.S.A's cost reduction initiatives. PM U.S.A has delivered approximately $25 million to date against the $300 million in additional SG&amp;A reductions announced in March of this year. In the past 18 months, PM U.S.A has delivered a total of $325 million in SG&amp;A cost savings and the company remains committed to achieving the additional $275 million by 2011.</p>
          <p>PM U.S.A's manufacturing consolidation plan is on schedule and within budget, and the company plans to close the Cabarrus manufacturing facility by year-end 2010. PM U.S.A continues to transition its infrastructure to deal with the effects of the removal of the contract cigarette volume manufactured for PMI.</p>
          <p>PM U.S.A expects this volume removal to be completed by the end of October 2008. This transition negatively impacted costs by about $30 million in the second quarter and approximately $50 million in the first half of 2008. PM U.S.A expects total 2008 costs of about $100 million and the company continues to seek ways to reduce this impact. Overall, PM U.S.A had solid income performance. Their cost reduction efforts are on track and Marlboro had strong retail share gains in this very competitive quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to John Middleton's results for the second quarter. John Middleton had strong business results. The company delivered $50 million in operating companies income and grew its total cigar shipment volume by 11% to 355 million units in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>John Middleton is capitalizing on PM U.S.A's sales and distribution infrastructure and expertise to help grow Black &amp; Mild. At the end of the first quarter of 2008 John Middleton contracted to use PM U.S.A's sales force to present Middleton's brands at retail.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, John Middleton saw the initial benefits from this representation, as Black &amp; Mild's retail product availability and visibility increased. This contributed to Black &amp; Mild's retail share and volume gains. Black &amp; Mild increased its share of the growing machine-made large cigar segment by 2.9 share points to 27%. John Middleton will continue to focus on increasing product availability and visibility of its brands at retail as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>Turning to our financial services business, Philip Morris Capital Corp. reported $30 million in operating companies income in the second quarter, reflecting lower asset management gains and lower lease revenues versus the year earlier period. PMCC's results will vary over time as investments mature or are sold.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are very pleased with Altria's strong second quarter performance. To sum up, PM U.S.A delivered solid income growth and improved its adjusted operating margins. Marlboro achieved record retail share while lowering its quarterly promotional spending. John Middleton delivered strong income, volume, and retail share performance as Black &amp; Mild benefited from PM U.S.A's sales and distribution infrastructure. Our company's cost management programs contributed to Altria's strong financial performance. Altria's corporate restructuring program delivered significant cost savings and PM U.S.A reduced its SG&amp;A spending. These two programs combined contributed almost $65 million in savings for the quarter. Altria commenced its share repurchase program and purchased shares for approximately $1.2 billion. And finally, Altria reaffirmed its adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year, reflecting our confidence in the strength of our businesses.</p>
          <p>I'm now happy to take your questions. While the operator compiles the calls, I want to cover a few housekeeping numbers. In the second quarter, Marlboro's net pack price in convenience stores was $4.31, and the lowest effective price brand was $3 per pack. CapEx was $40 million. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $50 million. Our second quarter MSA and quota buyout approvals were approximately $1.4 billion or $0.65 per pack. Of the $0.65, MSA is $0.60 per pack and a quota buyout is about a nickel per pack.</p>
          <p>Our cash balance as shown in Schedule 8 declined because PM U.S.A made its MSA payment in the beginning of the second quarter. This payment totaled $4.1 billion. And finally, our second quarter tax rate was 36.8% and we expect a full year tax rate of 37%. Operator, do we have any questions?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is it coming from Nik Modi with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nik.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick questions. Just on the FDA bill given to pass the House, just curious on your thoughts on the outcome. And then on the promotional environment, you seem to have gotten a materially better net revenue per pack realization in the second quarter. But you only had part of a quarter with a price increase. So I'm just wondering if we're to expect that realization to improve in the second half of the year. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for your question, Nik. On your first question, as you know, Philip Morris U.S.A has been a supporter of tough but reasonable federal regulation of tobacco products by the FDA. And we think yesterday's vote by the House represents good progress. And we remain hopeful that that bill can continue to receive attention during the rest of the session. But given the calendar and the many other issues pending before Congress, we just do not know the outcome at this point.</p>
          <p>With regards to promotional activity in the second quarter, when we look at our own promotional activity, specifically &#x2013; and I'll address all of our brands, but specifically Marlboro &#x2013; our promotional activity was less versus it was in the first quarter of 2008. It was actually below what we spent in the second quarter of 2007. And we can't say that across the board for all brands in the industry. It still remained a pretty hotly competitive environment with some major brands promoting at levels equal to or exceeding levels in the first quarter of last year &#x2013; excuse me; first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>But as we go look out into the future, we're looking at our business. And I come back to -- we look at our business around the value equation. So it's the positioning of the brand, the product, the promotion and price is but one element, okay, of all of those, okay, of all of those elements working together. And in the first quarter we saw some opportunity. We went after that opportunity. In the second quarter, you saw the benefit because we dropped -- we were able to drop our promotional levels both on promoted units and price off and saw the benefit of that investment spend in the first quarter. And our spending will be going into third and fourth quarter. I won't go into it for competitive reasons, but we will continue to read the marketplace. But what I can say is that despite lower promotional spending, Marlboro was able to grow share up eight-tenths of a share point. Thanks for the question.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question is it coming from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks; good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Judy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on the FDA question; and my question really relates to some of the menthol provisions that were added to the original version. I just wanted to get your thoughts on how significant those provisions are in your view, is my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a lot of talk early on about a menthol ban. Neither the bill that passed the House last night nor the parallel Senate bill contains such a provision. So there's no reason for me to speculate on that. And you're asking about specifics of this legislation. You know, we are engaged in that process. We have good people on the Hill working on that process, and you can see by reading the bill what the specifics are. But I would prefer to have that engagement with members of Congress, and not discuss that in detail on this call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Dave, just looking at your industry volume decline outlook longer term now down 3 to 3.5%, couple of questions related to that. One is whether that changes your mid-single-digit profit growth outlook long term. And then secondly, whether this sort of changes the way you look at the adjacent categories and perhaps expedite or increase your urgency to become a bigger participant in those adjacent categories where growth seems to be going, as well as looking at some of the cost savings opportunity more aggressively to perhaps offset a bigger volume decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we use the second quarter as a proxy and look at our assumptions for the second quarter, second quarter the industry volume was down slightly more than we expected. But we delivered EPS growth on a six-month basis up 10.8%. So when we look out into the future, we still haven't backed off our total shareholder return of 12% or better.</p>
          <p>With regards to adjacent spaces, next to cigarettes, that's one of the levers that we talked about in our roadshow. And you saw it with us getting into the cigar business with John Middleton and had good results this quarter. And you see it with our test markets, both on Snus and moist snuff. And I go back to the mission of Altria, okay? Part of our mission is to make sure that we're financially disciplined, make sure that we're financially disciplined. And right now, when we look at where we are and the learnings that we're getting, we feel quite comfortable that we can hit the targets that I've given today and continue on a path to take those learnings and then when we think we have it right, okay, to take further actions. But you're right; we are interested in those adjacent spaces. That's why we have activity there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then my final question, Dave, just in terms of your full-year guidance for this year. You know, in the last conference call, you talked about the growth being more weighed towards the second half of the year and clearly the Q2 actually, I think, came in better than expected. So my first question is what drove the Q2 results to come in better than what you had anticipated? And then secondly, if you could elaborate a little bit more on the inflation outlook vis-&#xE0;-vis the MSA accruals as well as some of the other cost increases that you're looking at that could potentially be more of a headwind in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When we look at the second quarter, we were actually pleased to get more cost reductions, both at the corporate level and in our G&amp;A functions. The process that we've put in place &#x2013; we've had it for a number of years &#x2013; that we have a well-thought-out process on how we go about looking to take out infrastructure that can give us cost reductions but not do anything to impact the future of the business. So in the second quarter, we were able to accelerate that.</p>
          <p>Now when we look out into the third and fourth quarters, the number-one potential impact could be inflation. Yes, we've seen fuel prices come down somewhat over the last two weeks, but inflation is still running at a level that is higher than we have seen for quite some time. And the way the inflation works in the MSA, it's basically what the index, the CPI index, is on December of 2009. So it's not the average -- excuse me; December 2008. So it's not the average year inflation, it's December 2008 over the index December 2007. And over the past years, that number has fluctuated depending on what happens during the course of the year. We actually took our pool up in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And we're monitoring the overall inflation rate as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>The other place that really the petroleum costs hit was in the area of leaf. And because it hits, it impacts fertilizer costs that the farmers use to grow our product and diesel fuel. So we actually, back in the second quarter, built in inflation adjustments and also adjustments for a propane crisis for our farmers and that should be hitting us in the second half of the year. But typically when we look at our overall materials costs, that's the cost of doing business. But for those reasons, I feel quite comfortable maintaining our guidance at 9 to 11%. But not taking up at this time.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions for you, Dave. Can you comment on what your underlying margins at PM U.S.A would have been or how much they were impacted by the contract volumes this quarter or the lack of the contract volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, two things, okay. If we look at the costs that are associated with the contract volume, it is, we're reducing our overall volume that impacted costs approximately $30 million, okay, $30 million in the second quarter because we can't pull costs out quick enough because we have to shut down facilities. Okay. And that's the -- and we said, hey, expect approximately $100 million for the total year of 2008. Now the asset impairment charge in the second quarter was at $35 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, that's helpful. The operating number, the 30 million is what I was looking for. That's great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question on your outlook of the volumes being down 3 to 3.5% for the industry and you commented on changes at retailer inventories. Certainly that makes sense for this year or for the next few months as retailers reduce their inventories, but I suspect they cycle that at some point. So beyond '08 or part of '09, is your outlook more about the excise tax environment and the cross category behavior?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way we kind of predict what will happen or make estimates of what will happen in the future is basically what has happened over the last three to four or five years. But yes, I would say that if the economy continues to go down, there will be upward pressure on the states to raise excise taxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Um-hmm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's reflected, it's reflected in our thinking. But also when states raise excise taxes by sharp amounts, and this year, even though we're on track with the average state excise tax position, it was made up a little bit differently. Five states took up excise taxes on average of $0.89 per pack. And what we saw happen is -- now, they're very small categories, but in a number of states increase in other categories, high performance, such as roll-your-own in small cigars because they have tax base that is vastly different than that of cigarettes. Okay. So it really brings up another question about the overall tax policy among the categories. But they're tiny. Okay. They're tiny categories. For instance, roll-your-own probably, well based on tax records, through the first four months is about 4 billion units; small cigars, approximately 2 billion units. But they were growing at rates of about 18% off a very small base. So we saw that taking place in a couple of states where we saw these large increases. So that's also has come into our thinking as we look down the road.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my last question, Dave, with represent to the overall pricing environment and your comments were clear about that. But can you comment, if at all, there were pockets of extra promotional activity, for example, maybe in menthol in certain regions or geographies across the U.S. where you saw heightened activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We basically saw when we look at the total U.S. &#x2013; and I go back to remarks that we made back on the road show about how Marlboro has a national platform, but then we do have tools at our disposal to go in where we see pockets of competitive activity. Our competitors have a different brand development. We have one that's strong on the west coast, one that's strong on the east coast. And we saw with their major brands, competitive activity not changing a lot from what we saw in the first quarter. Now on some of the lesser brands, yes, less promotional activity. But of the major brands, no.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next we is it coming David Adelman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few things I wanted to ask Dave. First, your targets for consumption decline in the U.S. cigarette category this year entail a fairly material improvement from the first half pace. And I'm just curious, why do you think that would occur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that when we go back and look at consumption last year, we saw a rather steep decline in the first quarter. It moderated in the second and third quarter. And then the decline got steeper in the fourth quarter. It moderated some in the first quarter of this year, was relatively the same in the second quarter or moderated a little bit. And as we look out over the third and fourth quarter, at this point we don't believe that the fourth quarter will have the same sort of decline that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the numbers here in the release, the 4% number, that's a consumption number that you're speaking to, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a consumption number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's based on our read of the shipments versus the overall change in inventories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both at wholesale and retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I secondly, Dave, I'm curious about your reaction to the observation, particularly given some increased pace of movement within tobacco, but outside of the cigarette category, that you're not moving more aggressively with represent to moist smokeless tobacco, in particular, and perhaps Snus. The test market, I think, in Atlanta in moist smokeless started last October; it's almost a year ago. It really, it hasn't expanded materially. And I just wonder the outside perception is that there's a lack of urgency on those types of efforts because you're not moving it would appear with great speed. So I'm just curious about your reaction to that observation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And I would not categorize it as a lack of urgency. I would characterize it as we want to make sure that we do this in a financially disciplined way. And when I say financially disciplined, that we go out, okay. We have tested all elements of the overall value equation, okay, behind both Snus and moist snuff. And when we got it completely right, then we will incorporate that into our plans. And right now, right now, both of those initiatives are investment spin for us. And our goal was to take it from investment spin to being -- making a profit. But right now, we are in these test markets, or, I call them, learning laboratories to make sure we get it right. And that's what <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does the recent accelerated down trading in moist smokeless make that category any less attractive to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. There's been a reacceleration in the down trading, consumer down trading, to price value products within moist smokeless tobacco. And I'm just curious whether that dynamic makes the category, or, your perception of the opportunity, any less attractive than you might have thought six months or a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it does not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And two other things I want to ask, Dave. One on the FDA, how do you conceptualize two particular risks? One is a follow up to Judy's questions the risk with these revised provision to your menthol franchise long term. And secondly, the risk, if a real anti-tobacco zealot gets the role of running the FDA's tobacco effort under this legislation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said with Judy, okay, you're getting into specifics. This is, the first step is get the legislation passed. And then once the legislation is passed, to actually go through; go through the rule making from the regulatory body. And we support, okay, we support this regulation. You know, for all of the reasons we have quoted over the past seven years. And yes, there's risk any time, okay, any time, the business or the external environment kind of changes. But we've built an organization and infrastructure up over the years that has enabled us to continue to be successful, despite the changing business conditions that might present, that might be presented to us in the future. And this is but one of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last question, Dave on the capital corporation. There have been some adverse legal rulings on the SILO LILO structures. And I realize that your leases are somewhat different than those. But can you frame for us what the -- if all of those decisions ultimately were adverse to you, what your maximum tax liability associated with that would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question. And no, I won't frame what it will be in total. Because right now, as we look at this, the -- we believe our facts are different than the facts of these other cases. As you know, we actually went and paid approximately $150 million in taxes on -- I think it was the time period 96 through 99. And right now, we have a summary judgment motion. It's fully briefed. We're waiting for the judge either to set oral argument or rule in that motion. Predictions are that that's some time by the fall, but, basically, there's no deadline. But if we win, the case is over. If we lose, the judge will set a trial date, likely in early to mid 2009. We believe in our position, we'll defend it. So I won't speculate on how the other three cases impact us because the fact patterns are different. But we think that our accounting treatment that we have in our financial statements are reflective of our performance there or future performance there.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ann Gurkin with Davenport. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As we look to the second half and we see a heightened economic challenging environment for the smokers, is it fair to assume that there's an increasing likelihood that the industry becomes more promotional in the cigarette space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's always a risk. Typically, what we have seen in past economic downturns, a number of things take place. First, you see consumer confidence go down. And we've seen that. There was a slight pick up this past month. But, typically with, if you see consumer confidence below an index of 100, and you typically, we have seen in the past, potential down trading to discount products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not seen that this time. Because, typically, when you see the CPI, excuse me, the consumer confidence go down, you see a corresponding large step up in unemployment. Unemployment has inched up. But it's still not at levels that we have seen in past economic downturns. And you know, the other factor that comes into play is the overall relationship between the top and the bottom. And currently that's something we monitor every week. And through the second quarter, the gap between Marlboro and the lowest effective priced product is about 43%, which we continue to see as a good spot for Marlboro. So, but once again, we will remain a competitor in the marketplace depending on actions that take place there. However, the second quarter, we were able to pull back on promotions and still have solid share growth behind Marlboro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Along the same discussion, I guess there's some mixed data on whether we're seeing acceleration in consumer down trading in cigarettes, and I would just be interested in your comments on kind of that notion right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we actually looked at the lowest category &#x2013; deep discount &#x2013; in the cigarette market, what we saw was a slight increase in deep discount from a year ago. It went up two-tenths of a share point, from 11.3 to 11.5. But it actually came down 3/10 of a share point from the first quarter of 2008. So we see some trading going in and out of the lowest, but if you look at it over the last 24 months, you'll see periods where it goes up two-tenths, down two-tenths, up two-tenths, down two-tenths and overall, the overall discount category is unchanged. So it seems to be some in switching within that category, but no concerted movement up that we can see at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That helps. And then if I could just ask a couple of questions on adjacent products. In Atlanta, the Marlboro moist smokeless products, I understand you've instructed retailers to give a tin to consumers who purchase any smokeless product. Can you explain to me kind of that strategy, what you're trying to achieve from that change in strategy in Atlanta?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really not a change in strategy. What you're talking about are tactics that we and other consumer goods product manufacturers employ when they're trying to get trial of a product. So that's one promotional execution. We have had many others in that marketplace, and that gets to this whole concept of what we really are using the test markets that we have, not only in Atlanta, but in Dallas and Indy as learning laboratories that will inform our future plans on how we go about entering those categories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then with respect to these test markets or learning labs, do you feel like the pace of adjustment to market findings is fast enough to get accurate reads on how either Snus or Marlboro moist smokeless is performing in these test markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good morning, David and Cliff.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Good morning Filippe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A few questions here for us as well. Let me first start with the FDA. I know you're not going to comment too much on it, but let me just at least try it on one side. If we read the bill correctly last night, we kind of came away with the impression that right now, the committee who has to do the research on menthol that it was not given any indication what the remedies would have to be if it comes to certain conclusion. So that basically for us means that there's absolutely no instruction here that the only thing that could do in a worst case scenario to be the bad menthol. That's the way we should read it. What could you see, David, today as some of the potential remedies in the scenario that they would come to the conclusion that menthol might make it more difficult to quit or make it easier for people to start smoking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Filippe, as I said earlier, currently that bill nor the Senate bill contains any sort of, any such provision of completely abandoning menthol. And as I said earlier, I'm not going to get into specifics. I don't think this is the proper forum for that. But thank you for that question anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me move on then to some other business questions. And thanks very much for the frank outlook long term in terms of industry trends. And I think I may have asked this on the last call already. But does that basically mean that currently the way you're thinking about what's going on in terms of the economy, excise taxes, etcetera, etcetera, that we might be seeing a potential change in the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes? I mean, it's one thing for the industry to raise pricing 5% per annum all other things being equal. But given that the consumer is now being faced with inflation in virtually every single item that she or he purchases, that maybe there will be more elasticity here going forward? Is that basically what led you to your revision for the long term outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but it was  -- when you talk about elasticity to [audio skip] other non-tobacco products, that's not it. We're examining the elasticity that exists between cigarettes, okay. Over the years, it's been pretty solid, about 0.3, but the question that we're asking ourselves now is the cross-price elasticity between cigarettes and other tobacco categories. And like I commented earlier about in some states, this year where we saw $1 per pack increase in state excise taxes, typically in the past what you would see is a pretty sharp decline based on that 0.3 elasticity. But what you would see is if it was greater, that it might go to cigarettes sold in through different channels like contraband or over the Internet or even increases in counterfeit. And today, okay, today we're starting to see on -- I mentioned too small cigars and the roll-your-own, even though they're tiny, slight increases there. So we're looking at that cost elasticity, but you know, even with that increased decline rate, we remain confident in achieving our goals. But you're right. We're looking right now at cross-price elasticity. Do I have a number that I can quote? Not at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. David, then the other question. As you know, there is an attempt in the state of California to basically ban drugstores from selling tobacco products. Any initial read on that in terms of what if that were to be enacted, whether that could be followed by other states as well? And if this could potentially, in the worst-case scenario, also spill over to the C-store channels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point, I do not know the status of the vote on that bill in San Francisco. If you look at the U.S. marketplace, though, there are approximately 400,000, okay, 400,000 outlets that sell cigarettes. And the percent of cigarette volume in drug stores is a small number compared to the total overall industry. And at this point, first we'll have to see what happens in San Francisco, and I can't speculate whether it would be any spillover into the other states. But with the number of outlets selling cigarette products, I really don't see that much in an overall impact to the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my final question, kind of more a broader industry strategic-type question. There was a report out this morning demonstrating that in Scotland that somebody had conducted a study saying that in areas or in public areas where smoking was no longer permitted, there were double-digit decreases in the number of illnesses. And right now, if you look at the U.S., the smoking bans are more enacted on a local basis. How do you look at if there were to be an attempt to enact smoking bans on statewide levels, whether that would at all accelerate the existing consumption declines that you're seeing, and could this ultimately lead to what we would call kind of like the final round of consolidation within the tobacco space as companies will look at either ways to enter categories that are still growing good &#x2013; you referred yourself to smokeless, roll-your-own, and cigars &#x2013; or basically looking for other ways to leverage the cost infrastructure over a larger base of units? Thanks, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a long question. Okay. Let me try to put it in a few parts. First, the question about	 in the U.S., federal versus local versus state and smoking restrictions. I don't have the number in my head, but there are quite a few states in the U.S. with various forms of smoking bans. And I think the first question was if it got broader, what's the potential impact on the overall consumption or volume. And we've done a number of studies looking at various impacts of smoking bans on consumption. And it's tough to get an accurate read on that because the question, does the ban take place because incidence and/or consumption has changed over time that led to the ban, or did the ban cause it. And quite frankly, we've looked at quite a few of these and we can't draw a conclusion on that. As far as the consolidation in the tobacco industry, consolidation has been with us for years. And as I look out, I would say that it would continue to be with us. And that's nothing new, that's been with us for decades. But thank you for the question.</p>
