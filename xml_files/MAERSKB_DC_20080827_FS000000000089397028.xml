          <p>Welcome to this teleconference, where we will discuss the Half Year Results for 2008, and which we released a couple of hours ago. My name is Nils Andersen, and I am the Group CEO of the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group, and with me today is, as usual, our CFO, S&#xF8;ren Thorup S&#xF8;rensen.</p>
          <p>We'll take you through the presentation, and then there will be time for Q&amp;A's later. For those of you who haven't noticed, the Interim Report and this presentation, is available on our home page, maersk.com. But before we really go into it, please read the waiver on slide two.</p>
          <p>So, while you read, just let me start by saying, that we're pleased with the total result for the Group, and we have therefore, increased our outlook for the full year 2008. We do now expect the net profit for the Group to be in the order of 4 to $4.6 billion, against what we announced last time, which was an expected net profit between 3.6 and $4 billion, the result for comparison, the result from 2007, was a result of 3.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Assuming you have read the waiver, let's turn to page three. It's the same structure as last time, we start by looking at the Group results, and then we dig into the segments, and S&#xF8;ren and I will split that between us, and then we'll get to you a main update on where we feel we are on our main focus areas for 2008, before we go into the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>But, just short of &#x2013; the highlights for the first half 2008, as I started by saying, we are very pleased with the results, and it's &#x2013; the increase from 1.559 to 2.456 is driven mainly, it's a small billion progress, it's driven mainly by a significant increased result for the oil and gas activities. This is of course, primarily driven by the increasing prices, but also our share of oil production was above last year.</p>
          <p>Also worth noting, a slightly improved result for the container activities, the container activities are still loss making, if you take the gains on sales of vessels out, but given the very difficult market and the slowing down of global trade, we think this is actually quite satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Our other businesses have, in general, performed very well; needless to say, in particular, the off-shore related businesses have experienced very strong markets driven by the higher oil prices and the resulting higher activities in the exploration area. We also have a little more than $100 million more in gain on sale of vessels and here included is $200 million which we earned from transaction with H&#xF6;egh Autoliners at the beginning of the year where we sold our car carrier activities and received a 37.5% stake in H&#xF6;egh Autoliners.</p>
          <p>But now S&#xF8;ren will guide you through the key figures for the first half in more details. Please turn to the next page.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And as mentioned in our previous presentations, the reporting and the commenting on the numbers in U.S. dollar is most relevant since this is the functional currency of approximately 70% of our business activities. But for your easy reference, we have included the results in Danish kroner in the appendix to the presentation.</p>
          <p>We start looking at the revenue. It increased to $30.4 billion and the increase is mainly due to significantly higher oil prices and the increase in the Group share of oil and gas production as well as higher freight rates and volumes in the container activities. EBITDA increased by 71% to $8.2 billion driven by the higher oil price and the higher share of oil production. Looking at sales gains that went up to $735 million, the gains, as Nils said, include the gain on sale of the car carrier activities of $206 million but also the sale of eight container vessels and one very larger crude carrier. The line tax increased more than $4 billion from $1.8 billion a year ago and the increase is mainly driven by the stronger earnings from our oil and gas activities which are highly taxed compared to the other activities, and on the bottom line, net profit increased to 2.5 billion, up from 1.6 billion last year.</p>
          <p>Please turn to next page. On this page, you see that our operational cash flow increased 49% to $4.6 billion primarily affected by significant improvement of the operating cash flow in the oil and gas activities. But you should note that as in previous years that certain oil taxes are mainly paid in the second half of the year and therefore impacting the allocation of operating cash flow between first and second half.</p>
          <p>In the first half, we experienced a negative development in working capital of more than $0.5 billion mainly driven by the higher oil prices which are impacting the receivables and the bunker stock onboard the vessels. Our investment cash flow decreased slightly by 6% to $4.1 billion.</p>
          <p>If we look at our equity ratio; it remained stable around 44%.</p>
          <p>Now, we'll go into each of the business areas and Nils will start with the development in the container business. So, please turn to page seven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on page seven, you see the figures for our container business and the related activities which include Maersk Line, Safmarine, Maersk Logistics and Damco as well as our Container Inland Services like trucking, inland depots and so on. But APM Terminals are no longer included and we'll come to APM Terminals later.</p>
          <p>We have <mark type="audio gap" /> (06: 33) EBITDA increased 17% to 897 million and the average price for bunkers consumed on our vessels increased by 63%, which was actually the main driver, obviously, the main driver for the 14% increase in our total unit cost.</p>
          <p>We are happy to say that we implemented our new Maersk Line organization; we reduced the organization by more than 3,000 positions, as you will recall, many of you, eliminating the regions and delegating more authority out into the countries and to the central key account sales organizations.</p>
          <p>And we did expend a quite significant sum of money for the reductions in the first half of 2008 being $172 million. Sales gains were significantly up compared to last year we sold eight vessels in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>EBIT increased to 380 million and that was mainly a result of the sales gain, but when we take eliminate sales gains and also eliminate the one-off payments for the reorganization then we have an underlying improvement in the basic businesses, so to speak, on the EBIT level of approximately $190 million which as I said at the beginning given the difficult market situation we actually find is quite acceptable result.</p>
          <p>The net profit increased to a positive result of $33 million compared to a loss last year in the same period of $290 million. And as many of you will have seen, we did place pretty large orders in June and July this year in total for 38 vessels which will be delivered between 2010 and 2012.</p>
          <p>These are large but specialized vessels aimed at the REFA business from South America and we expect to be an increasing Africa trade. But please turn to slide eight where I'll go a little more into the details.</p>
          <p>If we take a closer look at how volumes developed in the first half of 2008, then Maersk Line transported in total 3.1 million FFEs which is an increase of 4% compared to the first half of 2007. Situation and also the volume development, we actually had a drop of volume of 2% in the second quarter. The Transpacific trades were down 7% &#x2013; pardon?</p>
          <p>[Audio problems discussion]</p>
          <p>Do we have sound again?</p>
          <p>So I'll pick up at the beginning of page eight for those of you who dropped out and start by taking a closer look at the development in the first half of 2008. Our total volume for Maersk Line, excluding Safmarine, was 3.1 million FFE which is an increase of 4% compared to the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>The Asia to Europe trade, which is our largest lane, was up by 1%, but we did have a drop in volumes of 2% in the second quarter. You could say in the other direction we had the Transpacific trade which was down by 7% in the first half, but that was mainly impacted by closure of a number of inland destination in 2007 and we actually saw an increase of 5% in the second quarter. The Africa and Latin America trades were up by 18 and 5% respectively. Safmarine transported approximately 360,000 FFEs and that represents an increase of 22%.</p>
          <p>As we said earlier, the result for the Container Business was significantly affected by the high bunker costs in the first half, where the average bunker cost went up by 63% leading to additional expense of approximately $1.1 billion. We're not hedging a bunker cost at a business unit level as we consider the Group to be relatively well hedged or very well hedged again changes in oil prices. So that means that the full effect of the higher bunker cost will come through in the Maersk Line figures here and then it's of course a major hit.</p>
          <p>We do have &#x2013; had an increased collection of fuel surcharges and that combined with reduction of fuel consumption has meant that we have been able to neutralize quite a bit of the increase in the cost. With the continued economic slowdown in the U.S. and Western Europe and the continued high bunker prices and on top of that having significant new tonnage entering the market, we see the second half to be highly challenging for the Container Business.</p>
          <p>And to summarize you can say that we're happy with the first half, but then, but we are very conservative in our expectations for the second half. We're not &#x2013; we don't see any reason for real optimism.</p>
          <p>But S&#xF8;ren will now take you through APM Terminal. So please turn to page 9.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>You can see here revenue increased to $1.5 billion and the volumes were up by 9% compared to general market growth up 8%. If we exclude the portfolio in North America, the volumes increased by 13%. When you look at the revenue, you should note that general tariff increases also contributed positively. If we look at the share of volume with non-Maersk Line customers that actually went up to 38% compared to 33% for the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA margin increased to 21% compared to 18% in the first half of 2007, and was positively affected by the increased volumes and tariffs but also helped by exchange rate development. Although increasing the margins are still negatively impacted by startup costs of new terminals. Sales gains went up to $62 million and that's impacted by sale of our 20% share of Port Qasim in Pakistan. So, after all of this, net profit increased to $185 million.</p>
          <p>So, please turn to page 10. In this segment tankers, offshore and other shipping; it includes our activities in Maersk Tankers, Maersk Drilling, Maersk FPSO, Maersk Supply Services, Svitzer, Norfolkline and our car carrier activities through H&#xF6;egh Autoliners.</p>
          <p>Detailed financial information for the main businesses in this segment is attached in the appendices. If we look at the revenue on nine, then that increased by 29% to $2.5 billion driven by the continuous strong demand for rigs and supply vessels but also by the strong market for crude carriers in the second quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>EBITDA increased by 25%, slightly less than revenue mainly due to lower EBITDA margin in Maersk Tankers. Sales gains of  354 million was below first half of 2007, but positively affected by the sale of the car carrier activities to H&#xF6;egh Autoliners and looking at the comparatives it should be noted that during the first half of 2007, we sold three of Maersk Contractors' E-rigs with significant gains.</p>
          <p>Due to the very high activity level in the offshore industry and the pressure on suppliers in the whole offshore market that we need to note that there might be some delay in delivery of our new buildings that is especially in regards to our semi-submersible rigs and also to our supply business.</p>
          <p>If you turn on to next page and maybe as you have seen earlier today we have announced a conditional offer of SEK 57 per share for the Swedish product tanker company Brostr&#xF6;m AB which is equaling a total purchase price of SEK 3.6 billion worth the current U.S. dollar rate $560 million.</p>
          <p>And on the slide we have put up some of the pro forma numbers that's been disclosed in the press release and as you can see on a pro forma basis the combined fleet will have 241 operated vessels, and a pro forma revenue based on 2007 numbers of more than $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>The holders of class A shares in Brostr&#xF6;m who represent 56% of the boats have confirmed acceptance of the offer. The transaction is still subject to approval by competition authorities.</p>
          <p>And in our view, the combination of Maersk Tankers and Brostr&#xF6;m will create a scale, which will offer superior worldwide service to our customers and it will enhance our market position and create the world's leading product tanker company.</p>
          <p>We do not expect the transaction to have any significant impact on our 2008 results.</p>
          <p>Please turn on to page 12 where Nils will go through the oil and gas business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So looking at the figures of the oil business, they're of course very positive, we had an increase in revenue of 91% to 7.3 billion driven by higher average oil prices; the average Brent price was 73% above that on the same period in last year and 15% share of A.P. Moller-Maersk share of oil and gas production, due to the increased oil production in Qatar and higher customer take of gas from Danish fields partly offset by lower oil production in Denmark, Great Britain and Algeria where the fields are maturing.</p>
          <p>Exploration cost increased significantly, it's up by more than 100% to little more than 300 million and this is reflecting the increased exploration activities that is ongoing in the U.K. and Denmark and the U.S, in the U.S. it's the Gulf of Mexico, and we had nine exploration wells drilled in the first half of '08 compared to five in the first half of '07, so a significantly higher activity level and needless to say also the prices of drilling have not gone down, so it's quite an expensive environment for operating.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA increased with 91% as well to $6.2 billion and depreciation was slightly below the first half last year; this is mainly due to lower production in the U.K. as we have a very high depreciation per barrel in the U.K. following the acquisition of Kerr-McGee.</p>
          <p>EBIT went up by 134% to 5.2 billion, tax increased to 3.9 billion and that left a net result of 1.3 billion, which is approximately 120% above last year. And the Qatar Field Development Plan is on track, and this is quite remarkable given the amount of delays we see in the oil sector at the moment.</p>
          <p>If we look at the production from the various areas we operate in and we can start by, with Qatar which is now our largest activity where our share was 33 million barrels which was an increase of 12 million barrels over last year.</p>
          <p>The higher production &#x2013; our higher share of the production is a result of the very high investment level, but also reflect the progress of the field development plan.</p>
          <p>And in Denmark, our share of oil was down approximately 10% compared to the same period last year at 17.5 million barrels as I said before reflecting normal decline from the maturing field. Also in Denmark, the gas sales were up 30% which is triggered by higher demand from our customer in Denmark.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., our share production was down from 9.5 to 7.6 negatively impacted by the Janice field that was closed from the beginning of the year until the start of &#x2013; until actually the late May. And also some pretty complicated weather conditions which slowed down production somewhere.</p>
          <p>With the restart of the Janice field and the preparation from the Affleck field we expect actually to start the Affleck field production in 2009. So, in Algeria, our production was stable during the year and that's about that on production. But when you look at the oil prices, of course it's been a very-very high oil price level compared to last year, and this has helped us quite a bit.</p>
          <p>S&#xF8;ren will go through now the retail activities, so if you turn to page 14 you'll find the data there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know the retail business consists of Bilka, F&#xF8;tex, and Salling and the discount chain Netto. If you look at the revenue line it was slightly above first half of 2007 at DKK28 billion and it should be highlighted then on this page we use Danish kroner. The revenue was positively impacted by opening of 30 new stores, but negatively impacted by the weak economic development in Denmark and the weakening of the sterling exchange rate. Operating profit was pretty much in line with what we saw last year. If we look at the net profit it decreased by 21% to 785 million that was negatively impacted by value adjustment of our Securities portfolio due to the increasing interest rates and decreasing share prices.</p>
          <p>The operating cash flow remained nearly unchanged and the investment cash flow increased by DKK1 billion, reflecting investments in a new central warehouse in Denmark and the 30 new stores.</p>
          <p>So, please turn to slide 15 where you can see the results for the segment shipyards, other industrial companies and our interest in Danske Bank. We had a net result decreased by 5% to DKK1.1 billion. The share resulted in associated companies related to A. P. Moller-Maersk share of result in Danske Bank which amounted to around DKK1.2 billion for the first half of 2008 against DKK1.5 billion in the same period last year. If we look at the Shipyard Group, we realized negative operating result partly due to lower productivity increases than anticipated. So, although the result is still negative, the operating result improved compared to the first half of 2007. All in all that was actually going through all our business areas and if you'll please turn to slide 16, we will go through the expectations for the year.</p>
          <p>As Nils pointed out earlier on and with the continued slowdown in growth in the global container shipping markets and combined with the significant addition of new tonnage and the continuous higher bunker cost, the general outlook for the container activities for the second half of the year is highly challenging.</p>
          <p>For the oil and gas activities, our share of production of oil and gas is now expected to be in the order of 5 to 10% above 2007 and in this segment we expect the higher cost level to continue in part due to the continued increase in our exploration activities. So, after this we expect the total revenue for the group to be in the order of $65 billion and based on the current level for oil prices the net profit for the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group is expected to be in the order of 4 to $4.6 billion compared to an expectation of 3.6 to $4 billion as previously announced.</p>
          <p>The increase in the outlook for the full year is mainly caused by a combination of the net positive effect of on average higher oil prices and now the expected higher oil production. But also higher than expected gains from sale of ships, rigs, et cetera, however, we still expect the total sale gains to be below 2007.</p>
          <p>And it should be noted that the previously announced possible sale of non-strategic assets is no longer expected to materialize in 2008. Even though we are eight month into the year, it should be highlighted that the outlook for 2008 is still subject to significant uncertainty, not least due to the development in the global economy and particular uncertainties of course related to the container rates, the volumes in the Container business, oil prices and the U.S. dollar exchange rate.</p>
          <p>And on the next slide, we have tried to highlight some of the oil price uncertainties we have and as Nils said earlier on, on a very general note the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group is inherently hedged against fluctuation in the oil price due to a reasonable balance between the income from oil production activities and the bunker and fuel costs in the shipping activities.</p>
          <p>So therefore the major oil price risk for the Group relates to the difference between the crude prices and the bunker price, also called crack. If we just look at the first half of the year, the net result was positively affected by increasing oil prices due to a wider crack higher than expected share of oil production, lower than expected consumption of bunker in the container activities, and an actual higher rate of recovery from Maersk Line's and Safmarine's customers of the increased fuel costs.</p>
          <p>It should also be noted that since the end of June, the oil price has dropped significantly and the crack has narrowed. So therefore the way we look at it today with the present oil prices and assuming an unchanged crack, the short-term effect of increased oil prices for the Group before effect of oil price hedges is estimated to be moderately positive. However, even thought it's like that a Group level, changing oil prices will have a significant effect on results of individual business units. That's sort of concluded the expectation section of the presentation. Now Nils will take us through the focus areas and the status thereon. So please turn to slide 18.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to summarize what S&#xF8;ren has said and I've said during the presentation, we are pleased with the first half. We're also relatively confident of our forecast for the full year, going forward and if we look at the total business. But it is very important to know or to notice that individual business units can be strongly affected by changes in the oil price. But we are on a Group level reasonably hedged so as a Group, we feel relatively comfortable with the figures we're releasing for the expected full year results.</p>
          <p>But looking at our five priority areas for 2008, let me start by Maersk Line profitability. As I said before, we're quite pleased with the results of the first half, doesn't mean that we don't think there is a lot to do to improve further, we realize that it's not acceptable not to make a profit even in difficult years and but we'll continue to work on that and we feel comfortable that Maersk Line over the coming two to three years will deliver significant progress.</p>
          <p>We are, however, concerned about the results for the second half of the year. We see very difficult trading environment and we see a global economy, which is not encouraging. So, we're not optimistic for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>If we look at the second point, which is the continued expansion of our terminal activities, also here we are pleased, even very pleased with the progress being made, nice growth in turnover and volume and also nice acceptable development in the bottom-line, it means that we're pleased with that.</p>
          <p>On the third point, the successful start of operations on new rigs and vessels in the offshore activities, we do see progress; we are putting more rigs at work. We have this year taken delivery of two rigs and one FPSO in first half. And they have all &#x2013; with some delay started operation on the longer-term contracts.</p>
          <p>We're planning to put additional, two jack-up rigs and one semi-submersibles into operation during the remaining part of 2008, but due to the very high level of activity in the offshore and the pressure of suppliers that this has resulted in, we cannot exclude that we would have some delivery delays, which is of course not acceptable, but in the present circumstances unfortunately not to avoid. On top of the rigs and semi-submersibles also our supply vessels are getting into the market with delays and this means that we will have less positive effect this year than we had hoped for. If we look the Field Development Plan in Qatar, it's on time and production is increasing as planned. So, given the difficult construction circumstances at the moment, we think this is positive. And the last point, which is safety and environment, it's also very important we are working with this very intensely and we feel we are making a &#x2013; we're creating a base for the future so that we can continue to progress on this.</p>
          <p>And this concludes our short presentation. Thank you very much for listening and now we will hand over to the operator so we can take some questions and hopefully give you some good answers. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. While we're waiting for the first question, let me remind you that the conference together with the presentation will be available on maersk.com. The first question comes from Lars Heindorff from ABG Sundal Collier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, guys. A couple of questions, firstly related to Maersk Line and your ability to recover your bunker costs, could you please elaborate a little bit on how that has developed during the course of the year and particularly going into the end of the second quarter where you have seed rates coming off on Asia, Europe quite significantly. And if that has cost your ability basically to go out to the cork sands and ask for bunker recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you for the question. It's &#x2013; the answer is not easy. We have  implemented bunker adjustment factor, which was percentage wise above what we've seen before. That was also absolutely necessary because the movements in bunkers are so great now that unless you get a very large proportion then you will end up in serious trouble. And but of course, when you go through the year and you start to see declining rates, it becomes a little bit academic to discuss whether it's less of a bunker adjustment or more of a rate decline, you see. So I can only say that our customers in general have accepted the increased bunker adjustment factor. But we are seeing a lot of pressure on rates especially in the latter part of the second quarter and going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and with respect to the second question especially toward the contract structure, I understand that you have biggest carrier and you have a huge number of big volumes, some of the major shippers. These contracts, which are normally sort of longer term do they have &#x2013; have they given you any sort of protection rate wise going into the June in the first half, which will sort &#x2013; which means that you have a sort of delayed impact going into the second half?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes. I think that goes for all carriers that at the moment the spot rates are below our contract rates and that's of course, a challenge when we look into the future. It's not unusual. Last year it was the other way around. The contract rates were below the market rates. But that's something that is not giving cause for optimism for next contract round.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the third question and the last also, as it relates to the oil and gas business, I don't know if you could give us any numbers on your share of production in both Algeria and in Qatar. I know in Qatar for 2007, I think it was 46% and I think you stated at some point during your presentation that that has increased during the first half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, without going into too much detail on how the sharing is done, I think it's important to understand that in Qatar as we also have disclosed previously is our share of the oil production is closely linked to the investment level and therefore in periods with significant investments we also see increase in our share of the production. The Production Sharing Agreement in Qatar is relatively complex and also confidential. So those are the main elements impacting our share of the oil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, gentleman. Three questions if I may. The first one, is the Group happy currently with the fleet utilization in the container shipping business or do you think you need to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat that please, we couldn't hear you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Is the group currently happy with the fleet utilization in the container shipping business or do you see that you have to take some additional steps given the weak volumes globally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second one would be, I saw the acquisition this morning of the Brostr&#xF6;m &#x2013; the proposed acquisition of the Brostr&#xF6;m business. Clearly, gasoline consumption, et cetera, are somewhat under pressure from high oil prices, which might affect some of the product flows. Could you elaborate slightly on the timing of the acquisition given that product rates might be slightly pulled down in the next 12 months?</p>
          <p>And the third question is do you expect any impact from the abolishment of the EU conference system starting October?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the fleet utilization what we did actually announce in connection with our streamLINE project or strategy was of course to increase the utilization significantly to where we were last year. We were not been successful in this in spite of lot of efforts but simply because the market has grown much less than we expected. So we are still at the same level as last year.</p>
          <p>And the acquisition of Brostr&#xF6;m, we know of course that the tanker market is very volatile and if gasoline consumption drops around the world then there will be less cargo to sail, which is bad news short-term. But we are in this for a very long-term and we think it's a good deal for us. And we think we'd be able give a better customer service over time which will long-term benefit, you can say reduce the volatility of our business.</p>
          <p>As to the timing of the transaction, it's too early to say. We've just published it this morning. And we now need to engage in a discussion with the competition authorities before we can complete and it really depends on them. I mean we have the commitment from the A share holders. So as soon as we have the approval, the deal will be done relatively quickly. And your third question was...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>In respect to the conference system...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't expect any consequences for that. And I think everybody working with conferences or without conferences has been very aware of competition issues over the last year. So for practical purposes I can't imagine that that will make any difference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. Andersen, very simple question, I see that Maersk Line is growing slower than the overall market. I think the figure you gave us, 7% for the overall market, 4% for Maersk Line's growth. Are you concerned that you are losing market share because over the last few years you've shrunk fairly significantly compared with your rivals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously long term we don't want to lose market share. On the other hand I think we are &#x2013; given the present market conditions, we are quite pleased that we don't have the largest order book in the industry coming on stream for the next couple of years. And that means that we will have to accept some loss of market share. We want to make it as little as possible but we want to reach that objective through a better utilization rate. But of course, over time we want to grow and grow at least with the market but it's not a short-term priority.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Finn Petersen from Moody's is now on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon. One question concerning the oil production; it seems like you were mentioning that you have &#x2013; the reason for the upgrade are among others higher oil production. I'm just &#x2013; and at the same time you are saying that the development in Qatar is going according to plan. What have changed since the Q1 statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the oil production, we earlier in the year said that we expected to be at the level of last year. And since then our take, for instance, in Qatar is very dependent on sort of the timing of our investments. And I think with the volumes we have there it doesn't take too much of a timing difference in the timing of investments to get either higher or lower share. So that is actually updated information for that. But also more clarity on the development in the U.K. after Janice becoming on stream during May and getting full of speed here over the summer. So those are the two main areas that are impacting this slightly higher expected oil price production compared to what we said earlier on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just an additional question, does that mean in Qatar that what you're ahead of the original plan there now is something that would be less next year in expenses? If you understand the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We understand the question and you can't put it that simple, but of course there is an investment recovery element in our Production Sharing Agreement. So that means some of what we did extra in this year will get less some time in the future; so in that sense that's correct. In terms of, however, the increase of the result in the oil business, of course, the main effect here is the oil price and not small adjustments in volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just one thing &#x2013; ask a question on the oil price. You're saying that you're slightly positive affected on an increase in the oil price. The development in the crack has been quite disfavorable for you since this summer and actually worst at the beginning of the year. That doesn't affect your position at all as far as I understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It definitely affects our position and we have also included that in our forecast for the rest of the year. A fall in the crack is just very unfortunate for the Group. So that's described very well in our Annual Report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a combination of the expected bunker consumption rest of year compared to previously but also the expected production rest of year compared to previously. So it's actually a relatively complicated calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Just first of all, a confirm question, did you say volumes were expected to be up 5 to 10% in the oil division this year versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, thank you. Second question, how much was the realized freight rate up those 12% but excluding Bunker Adjustment Factor, just picking up on Lars' previous questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't give you that figure because we can't really separate it but, excluding Bunker Adjustment Factor, the freight rates were not up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our best judgment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, fair enough, understood. But just once again picking out on Lars' previous questions, would it be fair to assume that you're Bunker Adjustment collection by now is reaching some 70, 75% heading to 80%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would be hesitant to answer that question because we really don't think that we can separate once you get &#x2013; one thing is when you &#x2013; just after you negotiate the price increases and the contracts, it's usually pretty clear what causes the increase but once you get through the year end and the market rates go down and so on it becomes a very blurred picture. So we don't really want to give any specific picture of it simply because it's making something too exact to compare to the real world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Then regarding Christmas surcharges especially on Asia, Europe, have you given up implementing such charges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not given up on it. We'll follow the market and if the market allows for price increases then we'll make price increases; if it doesn't then we will compete with the rest out there. So that's depending on what the market does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has there been any implementation of Christmas surcharges so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't answer that, but of course we are talking to the customers about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Two more questions, I'm afraid. One regarding slow steaming, to what extent has slow steaming been implemented, i.e., is there some kind of say a one-off thing to be had here? I guess there is a certain minimum design speed for most vessels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can definitely reduce speed further but we have slow steaming the absolute majority of our container vessels now. So, it's a matter of degree and we also do want to arrive between the continents with certain frequency. So, that, I guess that's a limit. But, the engines if you adjust them well and run them well it can surely go slower than what they are doing now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But, you don' t see any further reduction as compared to those you've already had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough, then getting to a little bit of accounting, I am afraid on the bottom of page five in your first half review it says that you have some unrealized negative value adjustments in oil price hedges of some almost $1.4 billion and looking at page 23 on your recognized income and expense and total changes in equity, you have a change in fair value of hedge contract of 6.3 billion Danish, I guess that relates to those oil price hedges on page five. Is that usually taken fully over the equity and not over the P&amp;L because what I' m trying to get out is of course that you have a P&amp;L of 12 billion in the first half, but you have a negative equity including minority development of 700 million Danish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Under IFRS rules when you have hedging of future income streams like oil production the element of the hedging that is related to the future, the market value adjusting of that goes into your equity until the point in time where you realize the production and you realize your hedges then it go into the P&amp;L at the same time, sort of a matching principle. So, then that is the background for it. So you can say that what is impacting equity, are the hedges that are related to the future oil production, where we talk all hedges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, fair enough. And those 6.3 billion Danish mainly relates to those 1.4 billion U.S. mentioned on page five I guess then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also have other hedges, we have interest rate hedges and the FX hedges and then you have tax impact. So, it' s not like one-to-one relationship, but we just felt it was right to point out because the magnitude of these oil price hedges to point it out specifically in the report.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen, Mike Wackett with Containerisation International. Your comments in regard to highly challenging second half year and I think the fact that you are not overly optimistic about that second half, is that anything to do with your July figures to date or are you sort of just factoring in the expected drop of cargo balancing that with of course your &#x2013; the bonus of the lower bunker prices and maybe the high dollar. What really is the &#x2013; is your real feeling for the second half year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is that we of course will not comment on July figures now, we are talking about the first half; but we've taken a close look at all the factors you mentioned and a few more and that gives us, let' s say, reason for caution.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. A question regarding Maersk Oil &amp; Gas, can you give us any color when it comes to CapEx and number of wells, when it comes to your exploration efforts, offshore Brazil, Angola and in Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Kazakhstan please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think when we look at Brazil we have interest in about five offshore blocks and we are planning to drill that in 2009 and the following years. And, I think we are talking about as I remember 4 to 5 wells. When, we look at Angola, we are looking at about 3 to 4 wells and then we have our different activities in the Gulf of Mexico. And in Kazakhstan in the Dunga Field, we are working with appraisal drilling to sort of gauge the development potential of the Dunga Field. So, those are the activities sort of high on the radar screen as we speak.</p>

          <p>Thank you, very much. Couple of questions, I will take it one by one. Coming back to your hedging, on the $1.4 billion, could you comment on when do you expect this to enter the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>I'd hope for something more specifically maybe? Would it be two or three years or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but I think we have disclosed in the annual report last year our hedging policy and we have not disclosed the hedging periods. So, I don't think the conference call is the right place to disclose that &#x2013; which relate to future oil production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of how these hedging losses they are entering P&amp;L will it both enter on a oil and gas division level and under the non-allocated items or would it only be under non-allocated items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Once &#x2013; as is pointed out in the annual report, the oil hedge contracts that are directly related to the oil production, and the oil and gas activities goes into that segment. More general oil price hedges that are not allocated to segments or are general related to the Group's oil price exposure are taken in this segment unallocated and that's unchanged from previously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to clarify, those 1.4, they &#x2013; are they related to the non-allocated items? Or is that impossible to say something about that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that the majority of those are related to the oil and gas activities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. The last question, in the interest of the tax rate, you in the oil division you have the 74% rate versus 73% last year. Should we expect that level to sustain throughout the year and then thus record a higher tax rate for oil and gas versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate in the oil and gas division is highly dependent on the production and allocation between the different tax regimes and therefore giving any guidance on the expected tax percentages would be quite dangerous and we wouldn't do that unless we put it into our Interim Report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That was the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Steven Brooker from Enskilda Securities is now in line with the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello gentlemen and congratulation on a very strong result. One clarifying question, I think that Mr. Smedegaard talked &#x2013; told us that Transpacific volumes were up 5% in the second quarter, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct and thanks for the congratulations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But I have one question regarding that, do &#x2013; you didn't think because you saw the volume on Asia Europe was only 1%, can you reallocate some of the tonnage back to the U.S. trade lanes? I think that the export legacy is relatively strong out the U.S. Government.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually even though the export is still relatively strong and that's correct, it's still &#x2013; the import is still larger. So it's not a balance trade yet. But on &#x2013; in principle you could consider doing more on the Atlantic, but it's not that the business is terrific there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one clarifying question regarding an A.P. Moller Terminals. We have for some years heard management talking about this startup costs &#x2013; the result is negatively affected by startup cost, and do we have a ballpark number in what the amount has been in 2008 and 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have decided not give it out but the way it works is that new terminals or terminals under construction usually loss making until they've been operating for a certain period, and we have a point where we move, you can say what we say it's no longer up start and we move it into operating terminal so to speak. And it's proactive, the more terminals you have in the up start phase, the more negative impact you have. That's simply a fact. But we have a good progress in the bottom-line terminals and we're quite pleased with the general development there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question regarding streamline and all these restructuring which has gone on, I think that you still have a very high client satisfaction level. How has it been perceived in the Maersk Line Organization that you have reduced staff by 15%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think a lot of people are disappointed. We're not particularly happy that we have to reduce the number of employees and of course people who've been here for many years are disappointed about that. On the other hand, I also &#x2013; I'm convinced and I've heard for many that they also appreciate the necessity and at the end of the day nobody likes to work in a company on a business unit that's not making any profit. So, I would say it's a mixed picture but we do of course have disappointed employees and some of them will also stay in the company, after we've gone through this downsizing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final one, you've transferred, according to my knowledge, you've transferred the responsibility of the Logistics to Damco. How has that been perceived by customers, are the system functional, are systems working satisfactory also on the Logistic side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually we have Maersk Logistics and we have Damco which are two separate organizations both part, you can say, of the logistic cluster. And in general the reason why we did this transfer was actually to simplify things, so that the logistics people would be less involved in the container shipping vice-versa, and they would have a clear customer supplier relationship. And I think it's fair to say that it's working with good growth and I've not heard of any deterioration in the customer satisfaction either with Damco nor with Maersk Logistics. So, I would say it's been definitely been working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one final question. When you sold Maersk Air to Sterling, is there some kind of clause that if Sterling goes into bankruptcy that you will have to take back the aircraft?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not to my knowledge. No, there is not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we just have time for one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan Togo from Handelsbanken is now online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Regarding containers I would like to know if you can elaborate a bit on your expectation for 2008 and how key drivers sort of say have developed since your initial guidance, if you can explain a bit on volumes on rates and of course also on bunkers and what the net effect of this have been? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little bit hard to give you an exact data or answer to that, but we've seen a gradual fall in rates and we've seen significant increases in bunker prices. So, so if you look at it Maersk Line isolated, I would say Maersk Line has been quite negatively affected by the last six month's development. A part of that negative effect has of course been compensated by the fact that that work is doing better in Maersk Line there, the processes work better, we've cut some costs and for the Group as total, of course the effect of the higher oil prices have improved the results in Maersk Oil. So, it's very hard to be very detailed about that but there is no doubt that the job, that improving the results of Maersk Line have not become easier during the last six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The way I see it, bunkers has developed more negative rates, has that out been strong however, but are now under pressure and volumes is more or less as expected. Is that the way you could sum it up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would sum it up that on the two first points you're right, but I have to say that we are and I think the rest of the container business is where we are disappointed on the volume developments in particular between Asia and Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. One question if I may also, into the Qatar, you have previously announced what the gross production was down there. Could you give us a figure for that in the first half that is before your take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose that on a half annual basis. What we disclose is our share of the production before tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you all know what the production target is, the 525,000 barrels per day when the productivity is done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that concludes our Q&amp;A session. I hope most of you got your answers &#x2013; your questions answered and if not, of course we're still open for business over the coming days, so please feel free to call and ask more questions.</p>
