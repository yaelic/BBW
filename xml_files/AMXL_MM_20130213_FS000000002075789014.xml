          <p>Welcome to the Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call and Webcast. Joining us this morning is Daniel Hajj, Chief Executive Officer; Carlos Garc&#xED;a Moreno, Chief Financial Officer; Oscar Von Hauske, Chief Operating Officer; and Carlos Robles, Chief Financial Officer of Telmex.</p>
          <p>My name is Jeanetta and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Daniel Hajj, Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I will be taking the call from the beginning with Carlos Garc&#xED;a Moreno. Thank you all for participating in the call. We ended the year with 325.7 million accesses lines, that's about 8.7% more than a year before. Our fixed-line accesses increased 10.8% year-on-year on the back of PayTV and fixed broadband acceses, while our wireless subscriber base rose 8.2%.</p>
          <p>We added 5.6 million wireless subscribers in the fourth quarter, after one-off disconnections of 1.5 million clients, taking our net adds for the year to 19.8 million, which is 18% more than in the prior year. Of the quarter's net gains, 1.8 million came from Brazil, because we got approximately half of the net additions of the market, 1.2 million from Mexico, and this is after disconnecting in Mexico 1 million, so after disconnecting 1 million, we got 1.2 million net. So total in the market that we obtained was 2.2 million. 753,000 from the U.S. and 409,000 from Colombia, with net additions more than doubling in Chile and the Caribbean. Our postpaid base increased by 1.4 million clients in the fourth quarter. We added 1.3 million RGUs in the quarter, bringing to 6.3 million the net RGUs adds for the year.</p>
          <p>Whereas financial volatility became more subdued in the fourth quarter as the uncertainty around the euro continued to subside, economic activity faced significant headwinds throughout the world with the recessionary situation in much of Europe appearing set to continue throughout 2013 and with the U.S. economy slowing down sharply. Some Latin American countries resented these trends.</p>
          <p>Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil revenues reached 198 billion pesos in the quarter and 775 billion pesos in the full year. They were down 1.1% from the year-earlier quarter in Mexican peso terms on account of the depreciation of various currencies versus the Mexican peso, particularly the dollar and the Brazilian real. Mobile data revenues continued to gain share of revenues and have come to represent one third of wireless revenues and 18% of total revenues.</p>
          <p>At constant exchange rates, service revenues were up 5.2% year-on-year and total revenues 5.8% compared to 6.1% and 6.5% in the third quarter. Service revenue growth improved from the prior quarter in all major regions except Mexico.</p>
          <p>As regards our main business lines, mobile data and PayTV were the drivers of revenue growth, with 33.3% and 20.2%, respectively, while fixed-line voice posted a 7.2% revenue decline continuing the trend seen over the last several quarters.</p>
          <p>Mobile voice revenues were down 1.7%, partly on account of the marked economic slowdown observed in several countries in the region, particularly in Mexico that took place hand in hand with that of the U.S.</p>
          <p>The quarter's EBITDA totaled 61.5 billion pesos and that of the full year 260.7 billion pesos, with the quarter's margin declining to 31% from 33.5% a year before.</p>
          <p>The reduction of the margin partly arises from the growth of PayTV and TracFone, that are lower margin business, but also reflects the continued migration to smartphones that has entailed somewhat larger subsidies and of course the OpEx effect of having a large investment planning in place.</p>
          <p>The reduction of the consolidated EBITDA margin both in Mexico and Brazil, and there were even in the U.S., where it came down 4.6 points, and in Ecuador 3.2 points. Since these countries together account for three-quarters of our revenues, Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador and the U.S., the lower EBITDA margin was the main factor driving the fall of the consolidated margin.</p>
          <p>The rise in sales of smartphones and accelerated subscriber growth were the factors in the U.S. and Ecuador, where they account fully for the margin reduction. It is important basically to put in perspective that growth in the U.S. has been very, very fast. And in the U.S. the data services, it's a relatively new part of the business, but it's already doubled its data revenues year-on-year, and we are gaining a lot of share such that data is now accounting for approximately one-third of smartphones own service revenues. And this is in only one year. So, this is a new part of the business. Smartphone sales are becoming hugely important to continue to drive this data revenue growth.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, our wireless EBITDA margin was similar to that of the prior year. It came up less than 1% and the difference is fully explained by subscriber acquisition costs. But in wireline, we experienced a 6.5 points reduction, most of it's spread out throughout the year, due to Telmex's passing on to its clients the full benefits of the reduction in their connection rates, traditional benefits in existing plans, to an increase in the provision for pension funds and to greater network maintenance costs. In Brazil, half of the margin reduction is explained by the increasing content costs. We registered a comprehensive financing charge of 10.5 billion pesos, that included a foreign exchange loss of 4.8 billion pesos, mostly resulting from the appreciation of the euro vis-&#xE0;-vis other currencies.</p>
          <p>Our investments in Europe are carried at cost and are thus considered non-monetary assets. Whereas there is no mismatch in the currency position, assets in Europe are funded with euro-denominated obligations, a cost nonetheless results when the euro appreciates given the non-monetary nature of the said assets and the monetary nature of the liabilities.</p>
          <p>For the full-year financing charges, 19.5 billion pesos, were 35% lower than those observed in 2011, reflecting a swing in the foreign exchange position to a net gain of 7.4 billion pesos. A net profit of 15.6 billion pesos was obtained in the fourth quarter and was equivalent to 20 peso cents per share or 30 dollar cents per ADR. It brought the net income for the year to 92.1 billion pesos, a figure that surpassed by 11% that of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our net debt ended the year at 372 billion pesos, up from 332 billion pesos at the close of 2011. Our net borrowings helped fund the acquisition of ownership interests in various entities, including KPN and Telekom Austria, totaled 84.9 billion pesos. Our cash flow from operations allowed us to pay for capital expenditures of 131 billion pesos and to effect distributions to shareholders in the amount of 32.5 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>Well, with that, I would like to open the floor for questions, and pass it back to the operator. Thank you all.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Alex Garcia with Citibank. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Carlos. Good morning, all. Carlos, could you share with us when do you expect margins to stabilize from these investments in the network and the expansion of smartphone base? I'm sure that you guys believe that all these efforts will be fruitful in the future. But is there a time where things may change the trend? This will be my first question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex. I'd say that we have now three different factors that you have to consider. One of them is the smartphone migration is in part of the initial phase, smartphone migration is going to continue for a long time. And the question here is, how we're going to be dealing with subsidies.</p>
          <p>As you see today, data services are the big driver of revenue growth for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. And we have the costs that have been in terms of subsidies have been relatively minimal, because today data revenue growth has been driven only by that small fraction of the postpaid that already have a smartphone.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an idea of reference, today not much more than 50%, 59% or so of postpaid have a smartphone. That's where we are today. So, that's for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil as a whole, and this would be weighted by the population of the &#x2013; by the subscriber base in different countries.</p>
          <p>So, what we have today is roughly 50%, 55%, 59% of postpaid clients today have already a smartphone. So we have to continue to migrate the other postpaid clients. And at some point, we really are going to get to prepaid. But, in prepaid today, we're not providing any subsidy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, to add something of what Carlos is saying, in terms of the subsidies, it's very difficult to say where they are going to be, because all these subsidies are going to depend on how competitive is the market. So, it's going to depend a lot on the competitiveness of each market than which is going to be the subsidy on those smartphones. So, market has more competitiveness and other markets have less competitiveness and that depends on the subsidy.</p>
          <p>Other thing that it's very important is on the advertised &#x2013; the networks that we're pulling. We are investing a lot and I think all those investments are going to end giving us good profitability in the future.</p>
          <p>And as Carlos was saying, the data has been &#x2013; data &#x2013; wireless data has been very important one of our big drivers and we need to still invest in all these type of infrastructure. And the third one, very important is that all &#x2013; overall, what's Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. the structure of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil.</p>
          <p>We are reducing a little bit of our revenues on the voice. Voice has a big margin and there we're growing a lot our revenues in TV, in value-added services, in data. And at this stage, they have a less margin that what we have on voice and I think as we were going to grow this type of services, I think EBITDA can control a little bit. So I think those are the main three drivers for EBITDA are the networks, are the structure of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil and the subsidies.</p>
          <p>Other thing on the structure on Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is TracFone. TracFone even that we have a quarter that doesn't look very good in terms of EBITDA, the year as Carlos was saying was better &#x2013; the EBITDA was better on last year. So, accumulated EBITDA was I think around 10% and these type of companies are more or less what we think we can have on margins.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Now very clear. And a second question, if possible, the topic that has been, I mean circulating a lot is, has AMX decided what it plans to do with KPN capital increase in Europe? Is there anything you could share with us? A timetable? Whatever you could share with us will be welcomed? And thank you for the answers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you point out, this is something that has been put on the table recently by the company that is intending to go ahead with important recapitalization effort. At present, starting what really the companies have said, in terms of its imbursement and so on. And we will be coming out with a public statement in terms of how we view the position, we haven't yet to the final solution, but we can tell you that we are going to have something at the latest &#x2013; by the beginning of next week.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Dan Kwiatkowski with UBS. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I've got two questions. One is on your &#x2013; what you expect to spend on CapEx in 2013. And more fully, what you expect to do with your free cash flow aside from the KPN issue, whether you'll reduce debt, whether you'll distribute more to shareholders than you did in 2012? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of CapEx I think we're going to invest more or like what we invested last year. It's going to be around $10 billion. It's our budget. It could be a little bit more, a little bit less. But it's more or less what we are thinking to invest.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the free cash flow, as Carlos is saying, on the KPN issue, we are going to decide what we're going to do. We're still starting what we're going to do in our position. We're going to give our position in a few days. So, that's more or less.</p>
          <p>The rest in the free cash flow, well, we're going to use it as a share buybacks and dividends that the way we were using last year and the years before, depending on the cash flow, depending on the &#x2013; our position. Acquisition that maybe we can do this year. So, it's going to depend a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see any acquisitions on the &#x2013; any potential acquisitions on the horizon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We haven't got any possible acquisition at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question is on Brazilian mobile, over the last two to three years, you've consistently lost share of revenues in the mobile business and obviously that's impacted your margins as well. Can you give us a sense of what the operating plan is for Brazilian mobile in particular and where you see margins leveling at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me explain to you, how I see Brazil, and what we're doing in Brazil. It was not for the last three years maybe for the last two years we have been decreasing a little bit our EBITDA and some a little bit our market share. What was happening? We decide on the &#x2013; the market was very, very competitive; it's a very competitive market. And at the beginning of last year and a year before, we don't want to get in a very tough competition.</p>
          <p>What we decide on August that we are going to reduce our prices, that we're going to be much more competitive in the mobile side and it's what we do on August. What's happened on August, we can see that net adds are growing, that postpaid net adds also starting to grow both that keeps us a little bit on our base, okay? We give much better prices to all our base and that means that we have a reduction on revenue. So, it's more or less what has happening at the last year, so at the beginning, we decide not to reduce, not to be so competitive what we decide in August to do and to be competitive.</p>
          <p>Our revenue per minute reduced 28% last year. So, we think we are at this stage competitive. I feel that our gross adds are starting to come. We are gaining market share in prepaid and we're starting to grow much better in postpaid. So, I think, we can see much better year 2013 in Brazil in terms of &#x2013; in the mobile side.</p>
          <p>And well, I don't know, how's going to be the competition this year, but at this stage, we feel much more comfortable with the operations, still a lot to do. But I feel that we're making the right decisions in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, hi this is actually Sean Glickenhaus. Speaking of a lot to do in Brazil, could you provide an update on what Anatel's thoughts are on mobile network quality? We keep reading a lot of differing viewpoints on that. And furthermore, perhaps an update on the integration between fixed and mobile. I know it's been in the works for a long time, but my understanding was that it had taken longer than expected. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in &#x2013; what worries a lot on the last &#x2013; fourth quarter of last year on Anatel was the quality of the networks. As I say, the growth on minutes and the competitiveness of the market makes that a lot and some of the networks get congested. And worries that a lot to Anatel, so Anatel decides to review that. I think I can talk about for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil and Claro I think we are making good improvements on quality and I think that even with that amount of news that are coming more, we feel that we have a much better network than what we had last year. And I think Anatel is going to be really looking at the quality of the network. We are not going to let everybody do what they want to do. If they are going to do &#x2013; give bad quality to their subscribers. So, I think it's where Anatel is and I think it's reasonable that they be very careful on their quality and service for the customers.</p>
          <p>On the fixed and mobile, I think you are starting to see some promotions between fixed and mobile. We are doing some promotions between NET, Embratel and Claro, and &#x2013; but still you need to do a lot on fixed IT, it's very important to have in very good state all your IT systems, but we are working to do all those kinds of promotions, starting to see those promotions still.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, Carlos, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. I've got a question on the &#x2013; I think the strategy for increasing smartphone penetration makes a lot of sense, the benefit of wireless data at some point, but we've been seeing margins for different reasons from partially from PayTV, partially from TracFone, so businesses are growing faster with lower margins &#x2013; contributing to drag down the consolidated margin for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil.</p>
          <p>So I was wondering if, Carlos or Daniel, if you could share with us some key metrics you would look at to how long you &#x2013; not just how long but how deep you want this to take this strategy into, how low the margins can go, what kind of payback you're looking for on those smartphone subsidies, you know what kind of key metrics are you looking at to balance the right profitability with looking at the long term strategy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take a first crack at it. I think we were talking a little while ago about the key factors that are going on in margins. Part of it has been the smartphone migration, which is postpaid, part of it is the &#x2013; what we have said is the spillover effect onto OpEx, of the EBITDA, CapEx plan that we have currently in place. Part of it is &#x2013; are the consolidated &#x2013; are the consolidated Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, obviously there is certain business lines that have structurally lower margins and that means that the equated margins from Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil consolidated margins should be trending down as the other businesses get seasonal.</p>
          <p>But if you look at how much we have had in revenues, in additional revenues coming from data services, say over the last year, couple of years, compared to the actual subsidies that have been provided on devices, those subsidies are really minimal and are really not meaningful.</p>
          <p>And as Daniel was pointing out, these subsidies in the end &#x2013; down the road, will be a function partly of the competitive situation in different markets, partly a function of the competitive situation in the market for smartphones itself. And if you think of it, the prices of smartphones have already fallen significantly over the last couple of years and they are likely going to continue to fall significantly over the next several years.</p>
          <p>So, we don't believe that you can extrapolate from the margins that were paid two years ago to the one that are going to be paid two years down the road or next year on a &#x2013; from a unit perspective.</p>
          <p>So you are going to have a lot of people migrating, but what we are seeing this &#x2013; the expansion of data those &#x2013; and you can run the numbers yourself, but we can &#x2013; we'll be glad to help you in that exercise, if you want. The amount of additional revenues made possible by both our investments on the one hand, but clearly the services that we have channeled are yet in our model.</p>
          <p>So, we think that the &#x2013; that is &#x2013; and we have said it for a long time, that is the medium and long term story of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. We believe in wireless data. We went to the extreme of going to very transformational transactions by buying fixed line assets in Mexico and South America. We believe that having this fixed-line platform was of the essence for us to provide good mobile data down the road &#x2013; broadband data and we think that's the future of this business.</p>
          <p>And it &#x2013; what little effect this has had so far in terms of migration of a few customers, where we only have half of our reported base, which means roughly &#x2013; probably not more than 7% or so of the total clients of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil today using a smartphone, only with that we have been able to drive a very significant growth in revenues. So, this is the story, Maur&#xED;cio and we can share with you our numbers. But basically, we think we really think it's very clear, the investment case for this.</p>

          <p>And another point that I want to add, Maur&#xED;cio, also is that in some countries where it &#x2013; having some slowdown in the economy, so that's also is not going to be forever. Let see we have been seeing that some part of our revenues are reducing and they are going to come when things get better. So, we cannot stop doing our strategy on data &#x2013; mobile data, TV. Because all of these products at the end of the day are going to have very good margins and we're going to have a very good customers, if we got that on time and in the right moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in this regard, I think it's important to note two things. In Brazil, obviously, there was a very sharp slowdown in the economy, I believe in the first half of last year. We can see that on the &#x2013; both on the fixed line side and on the mobile side revenues have improved, okay? And in fixed line, the bottom was in the second quarter and now year-on-year, we have positive revenue growth on the fixed line platform, on voice &#x2013; on voice, I'm talking about voice. And on mobile, I think we &#x2013; the bottom was a quarter later, it was in the third quarter, and we can see clear evidence of things trending up.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, however, as Daniel pointed out, we are facing an unexpected slowdown of the economy. It's as unexpected now in Mexico as it was then in Brazil, a few quarters ago. These have been now become a bit more evident by &#x2013; we caught up in the U.S. As you know, GDP in this last quarter in the U.S. actually declined and that had to do with the contraction of military spending and some corrections of inventory. But, that had an impact in Mexico.</p>
          <p>And if you look at what has been happening in Mexico, the government &#x2013; the bank &#x2013; the Central Bank has actually been more bullish. They have been accelerating the reduction of interest rates and they are basically trying to manage this downturn in the U.S. But it was evident from &#x2013; at least to them &#x2013; to the authorities that follow the economy more closely, that the economy was already experiencing a downturn in the &#x2013; towards the end of last year and that is probably something that in the short term has an impact on margins.</p>
          <p>And this type of strategy just to &#x2013; only to finish that &#x2013; this type of strategy that we are taking -Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is taking when this slow down on economy hit us a little bit more than all the other ones, but when things are better, I think help you more when things &#x2013; that any &#x2013; all the other companies. So, we decide to do that and I think it's the right decision, Mr. Maur&#xED;cio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. I have two questions. The first question is regarding asymmetric regulations and in particular in Colombia, where you've seen the leveling of the off-net and on-net cost. Can you explain to us a little bit what impact that's had on your business? And how you've dealt with that commercially?</p>
          <p>And then the second question that I have is regarding the acquisition made in Mexico of the CIE asset and this is the media and advertising business. If you could explain how that fits into the overall strategy of the company? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in Colombia, the asymmetric regulation was &#x2013; it came to &#x2013; we are not agreed on that because we think that we are not making anything in the market that allow us to do asymmetric regulation. But well at the end of the day, the regulator decides to do it. I think, came in two things.</p>
          <p>First, that we have to pay for two years more interconnection to our competitors than what they pay us. Okay? So, that's the first thing that they came, so for two years, we're going to pay more interconnection than what they are going to pay us. They decide to reduce it and &#x2013; for us and not for them, so we paid them more than what they pay us for two years.</p>
          <p>The second is that we are not allowed to differentiate on-net, off-net calls, the price on on-net, off-net calls. I'm sorry, the first &#x2013; I forgot to tell you the first &#x2013; in the first asymmetric thing, that is the interconnection, they said that the competition has to pass it to the market that they shouldn't stay with that amount of money. So, they have to pass it through the market or make some investments in the rural area. So, it's what the regulation said.</p>
          <p>And the second is that we are not allowed to do off-net, on-net calls at a different price. It's more or less what is the asymmetric regulation in Colombia and we are deciding which are going to be our plan and how we're going to deal with that, but it's more or less what we have there. So, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question &#x2013; other thing important is that the MTRs in Colombia are the lowest in Latin America. So, Mexico and Colombia are one of the lowest interconnection rates in Latin America. So, it's only something that you should know.</p>
          <p>And on what we do with the companies that we buy from CIE, I think fits a lot on the strategy on Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, because this company has a lot of assets where you can have &#x2013; advertise your products. And in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, we have a lot of assets that we need to go out and sell in the market. We have TV channels in Colombia; well we have a lot of assets there. And this company, I think is going to help us to organize and sell all our assets that we have in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. So, I think that's more or less the strategy that we have there.</p>
          <p>We have it &#x2013; this company have a very good structure and advertising in Mexico and we want to do all these type of advertising also in all Latin America. So, that's why &#x2013; that's the reason why we can sell a lot of advertising in mobile, we can sell in channels of TV, we can sell a lot of things and this company and these people is going to help us to do that. So, that's really the reason and the strategy on buying that company.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Daniel and Carlos. Let me ask you something, would you basically be willing to significantly increase the amount of handset subsidies as a measure to increase penetration of the smartphones in order to increase data consumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what &#x2013; the question here is, how it will &#x2013; of course, we don't want to put any subsidies on the smartphones, but as I told you the subsidies, they are going to be really related to the competition in the market. So, if we can subsidize less, of course, we are going to do it and we're working a lot on that and we have &#x2013; in some places, we have a much better quality of network, we have more coverage, so that will allow us to decide what's going to be our subsidy, but we really are being &#x2013; but, on the other side, as we just talked, we think that moving to smartphones and bring more revenue, some data and everything, it's very important.</p>
          <p>So, we're dealing in where and how we can subsidize less, price of the smartphones are coming down fast, so maybe the subsidy is coming less and less every day. But in the other side, what we cannot stop is to bring customers and good customers to use all our data platforms, so that's where we are dealing and that's our job that we need to do day-by-day and country-by-country, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But basically, correct me if I am wrong, but according to my numbers, the amount of subsidies increased approximately 15% compared to the amount of subsidies to the amount that you used to subsidize in the past six to eight quarters. Is this the new &#x2013; the new amount of subsidy that we should be seeing going forward? Is it what we are seeing according to competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember that it's Christmas and in Christmas seasonality, so people decide to buy more handsets and to change more handsets. Other things that are important are new handsets that are coming in the market, so new handsets also decide and make people change and the pricing and the subsidies, so there is a lot. So, as you &#x2013; the question is, are you &#x2013; we're willing to have these type of subsidies? No, we are not willing to have, but the decision is that we are willing to move our subscribers to smartphones and to use more data. That's where we are and we are going to do it at the best way for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, trying to subsidize the less, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one thing that is keenly, if you look at the numbers for Mexico, since data porting &#x2013; since number portability was implemented, and this is 5.5 years ago, Telcel has gained two million clients. Of these two million clients, over 5 years &#x2013; 5.5 years, roughly 900,000 came last year and they are all coming basically because of our ability to provide good coverage and very good data services.</p>
          <p>And not only in Mexico, you could see I think all overall. I cannot tell you in all the countries, I don't have the numbers here, but almost in every country we have been gaining market share in number portability. In almost &#x2013; they are telling me here, in all the countries we are gaining in number portability. That means only one thing, that we have the best networks, that we have the best coverage and we have the best services. And also having a very good offer, no? So, that's really what is happening when you do good investments and good networks, no?</p>

But &#x2013; and in terms of the overall slowdown we saw in the revenue growth at Telcel, how much perhaps is coming from macro and how much is incremental competitive pressure in the Mexican market?

        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer you this question. I don't think we saw any difference in the fourth quarter than what we have been seeing all the year. I think we have a very competitive market in Mexico. We have been competing very strong and we don't see any difference. I think &#x2013; and Carlos explained that, I think we are seeing a slowdown on the economy. We are seeing slowdowns in the revenues, in the mobile voice revenues. And we have the numbers on January and still we think that the slowing down is coming, so we're still thinking and still seeing some reductions there. So, I think it's &#x2013; nothing change on the dynamics in the competition. What I think what is changing is the economic situation in Mexico.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

And to the prospect of asymmetric regulation there, have you got any outlook you can provide us with, please? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really don't know. There's still a lot of people talking about a lot of things. There is going to be a new telecommunications law. We don't know a lot on what is coming. And I hope that all these new law on telecommunications and all the things that regulators do would make and will create more investments and to grow the telecommunication businesses. I think it's what we really need in Mexico and what we really need is to have more investments and Mexico needs to have much more investments than what they have today.</p>
          <p>So, I hope that all these decisions that they are going to take will be close related to this, to make more investments and to develop more the telecommunication sector. Still, specifically I don't have anything on that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I would just like to follow-up on a few things. First, where is your margin stabilizing in Mexico? You mentioned there was some special events for this quarter, so where do you see them normalizing for the rest of the year? And what percentage do you expect data to represent by the end of the following year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't talk about specific margins, Andr&#xE9;s. So I think gross margin would be partly a function of good economy would be. But we're not seeing any extraordinary things. Certainly, one of the things that was a drag last year was the transfer of revenues from the redundancy from &#x2013; connection rates by Telmex to its clients. That was part of that was affecting Telmex all of last year, that's not going to be any furthermore.</p>
          <p>I think we have had an increase in OpEx at Telmex that has to do with the investment plan. A lot of that has to with converting copper lines into fiber optic lines, and that's clearly our focus. And that was an important new element last year. I think it is going to continue more even this year. So, there may be slightly negative impact. So, I think we're not really looking at any major structural things, even in handset subsidies. It's basically going to be the economy. So far I can tell you that the first few days of this year, the Mexican economy has seemed to be quick, at least to us. Hello?</p>

          <p>Hi, Carlos. So, I have two questions. One relates to data and CapEx. With the ongoing investments on data, do you think that it is possible to have CapEx as a percentage of revenue going down going forward, or do you think it will reach a level that should be more or less sustainable going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The CapEx to sales peaked in 2011, it's coming down and will continue to come down. It should be probably &#x2013; it will be around 15%, 14% of revenue and it should continue to trend lower, Andre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the &#x2013; sorry, and the second question is that with regards to the Mexican proposed change or what is about to change, I just have very well the idea that Mexico should have more investments. But what we have heard so far in the news maybe coming from COFECO, that the regulators want more competition. Do you think it's &#x2013; is there space to have more competition and have more investment at the same time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course, depending what you mean about more competition. We have enough competitors in Mexico. If there's other ones who is coming, I don't think it's bad. But what we need is that the competition makes the investments, okay. Because what they want is that you have more competition, but they use your networks. It's what they want on the Telmex side.</p>
          <p>So what we really want is really more competition, more competition not only on the market, more competition on investments, on networks, on coverage, on everything. So it's what we really I think would be good in Mexico. Not more competition where nobody invest and you have to give your network at some price and then you don't gain anything.</p>
          <p>So, the only thing that you gain is you move some customers to other networks, but you don't do nothing. No, it's not the investment. What this sector needs in Mexico and in all the world, it's investment. Look how much does Brazil have in investment, and look how much does Mexico have in investments. Brazil is really having big investments of all the companies there and Mexico not a lot of investments for the other companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in this sense, Andre, I mean, we have discussed this in the past, you see the changes in Europe or the European Union, the European Commission. They are very important because precisely what they have come to realize is that if you want to get to your objective in terms of your goals in terms of broadband coverage and broadband speed and so on, that requires investment and that you need to support the system and environment. That is conducive to this investment taking place.</p>
          <p>That's a big change in Europe that took place, I think in July or August of last year. It's hugely important, because it basically goes to show that regulators even in Europe have become now aware of the importance of investment to be able to put in place infrastructure by the company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. Speaking of investment, several of the operators in Latin America have started selling their towers, Telef&#xF3;nica and Nextel has discussions, Millicom. What do you think about selling your towers and is it different in Mexico versus some of your other markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are &#x2013; our strategy is not selling the towers. I think to sell the towers is to get expensive loan, because at the end of the day you sell and then they rent it to you. So in the &#x2013; I think companies are selling the towers because they need money for investments. Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is not in that way, so I don't think that if you saw as a good investment &#x2013; you are not seeing a good investment on selling the towers. It's moving from, they give you money but then you pay a rent on that, and it doesn't make any sense for us.</p>

Those are the &#x2013; that's a very strong thing that we have in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, so we do not entertain. To the extent that we do have access to market and to the extent that we do not have anything that we would not want to show to the extent of our leverage, to that extent, we would not even consider it.</p>

          <p>Sure, a company as strong as you doesn't need to. What about co-locating on other towers as you try and increase your broadband, increase your footprint? Does it make sense to rent space instead of building new towers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. We are open to co-locate and we are co-locating in a lot of towers, so it's not new, we have been doing that for a long time. So, we have our own towers, but in the other side where it's difficult or it doesn't make sense for us to or very expensive, then we co-locate or with other ones or with companies that do that. So of course we are open to do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. And the second question is in the United States, T-Mobile USA has been talking a lot about changing the subsidy model to either, call it installment or renting the phone to reduce the amount of upfront costs, particularly for postpaid customers. What are your thoughts about that model, first in the U.S. and does it make sense to consider it in your markets in Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we need to be open to see all new ways to keep eye on the smartphone and try to subsidize less to our customers. So I don't know exactly the model of T-Mobile, but in some places, we're trying to do those things instead of subsidy, we subsidize but then they pay on installment. So, there's a lot of study that we are doing there.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>So, watching it for now, but maybe react to it in the future?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, of course, of course.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we have time for one more question. And your last question comes from the line of Diego Arag&#xE3;o with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, all. So, my first question is regarding Brazil. Your margins fell to new lows and you've been saying that margins are being hitted by the group of PayTV and of the network investments, but what we want to know is, are you prepared to put like, are you sticking the ground and tell us when you think we should expect margins may start expanding on a year-on-year base in Brazil? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not saying only that the PayTV and the networks are there, what I explain also is that we decide to take &#x2013; we'll take a decision on August that we're going to reduce the prices to be more competitive in Brazil. And that help us on reducing the churn and being more on track on our net adds there in the fourth quarter. You could see that in fourth quarter, we grow on postpaid, we grow on prepaid and it's where we are. So, PayTV represents 24% of our revenues in Brazil and to-date &#x2013; last year &#x2013; the year before represents 20%, so PayTV is growing. We have a less margin.</p>
          <p>The other thing also is the smartphones, the smartphones also are doing that, but I'm still feeling comfortable on our strategy in Brazil, I have been saying that and I think we are on the right direction. It's not going to move from one side to the other one in one month, but I think we are on track. We are growing. We have very good postpaid customers. We are growing in prepaid and that's going to give us a better revenue in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And you still don't mind &#x2013; a second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember other thing &#x2013; and remember one more thing, it's &#x2013; interconnection rates every year are coming down. So also, are hitting us also the interconnection rates. So, well, you need to do that, but in our view, I think the fourth quarter you could see much more better customers in Claro Brasil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in PayTV, we're gaining a lot on &#x2013; we're gaining maybe 50% of the apps in the markets, so we're doing very well. And in Embratel, well in Embratel the long distance are reducing a lot, the long distance are moving to local &#x2013; moving to local voice. But all the corporate customers were growing very good and we're doing, we are netting in NET and in Embratel, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And just a second question, regarding the follow-up actually on the CapEx, specifically for Brazil and Mexico, should we expect CapEx increase on those countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I think it's going to be more or less what we have last year, I don't see a big difference in any country that we're investing more in some and less in the other one. So, I think the 10 billion peso is going to be more or less divided in, like last year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
