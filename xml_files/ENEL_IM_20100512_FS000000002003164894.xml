        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Luca Torchia speaking, thanks for conveying this conference call on First Quarter 2010 Results Annual. Here with me, we have Mr. Luigi Ferraris, the CFO. We will have a brief presentation and then we'll open the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Thanks again and let me hand over to Luigi Ferraris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luca, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. First, I will start from chart number one, number two of your package. Well, first I would like to start by doing a quick analysis of the general macroeconomic trends of the areas in which we operate. In March, we indicated the new average demand growth assumption for the next five years and we expected a gradual recovery from the minimal level recorded in 2009.</p>
          <p>For the time being, this recovery trend is strongly confirmed by the demand growth registered in the first quarter of 2010 in Italy, Spain, and Russia among others. Let me underline that the only region affected by a decline in demand versus last year has been Chile. This is largely due to the recent earthquake, which resulted in demand reduction of 10% in March, leaving the first quarter demand evolution with a decline of 2.6%. Our expectation for the following months have been positively confirmed by the month of April, which registered growth of about 1%.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you a snapshot of some financial highlights on chart number three. Group EBITDA increased by more than 16%, driven mainly by the full consolidation and good performance of Endesa as well as the Russian operations. Group net income amounted to &#x20AC;1.1 billion, or about 12% higher than last year excluding the extraordinary impact of Acciona put option reversal of &#x20AC;970 million recorded in the first quarter 2009. Net debt has increased by &#x20AC;1.1 billion to 51.9. I will provide more details on this later on in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to chart number four. EBIT increased by about 14% due to higher EBITDA partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization for changes in the consolidation of Endesa. Our net financial charges amounted to &#x20AC;937 million. This is the net effect of:</p>
          <p>First, an increase of &#x20AC;68 million on interest charges mainly due to the full consolidation of Endesa. In this regard, let me tell you that the current average cost of debt is 5%, in line with full year 2009.</p>
          <p>Second, a decrease of &#x20AC;970 million in financial income due to Acciona's put option.</p>
          <p>Third, an increase of &#x20AC;177 million in other interest charges mainly due to a one-off for regularization of the accrual of financial revenues from previous years related to the Spanish tariff deficit.</p>
          <p>Excluding the positive contribution of the evaluation of Acciona put option, on a like-for-like basis, the group's tax rate increased from 38 in full year 2009 to 39.6 at the end of the first quarter. Nevertheless, we expect an annualized normalized tax rate ranging from 32% to 33% for the entire 2010.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at our EBITDA composition starting with chart number five. Our portfolio benefits from a unique mix of assets and technologies and a good balance between unregulated and regulated activities. As far as unregulated activities are concerned, Enel can rely on technological and geographical diversification focused on minimizing the group's risk profile, a well balanced fuel mix with nuclear at about 14%, hydro and other renewables at 31%, coal at 26% and the balance mainly consisting of CCGT [combined-cycle gas turbine], oil and gas open cycles.</p>
          <p>Today, we can rely on electricity production that is 45% CO2-free. All of this coupled with our ongoing hedging strategy in sourcing and supplying and our continuing investment program in clean development mechanisms allow us to expect solid cash flow for the coming years.</p>
          <p>Let me give you an update on our hedging strategy in particular on forward electricity sales. Let's move to chart number six. As far as Italy is concerned, we have hedged 100% of our 2010 production and 44% of 2011 production at an average base load price equal to &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour for 2010 and about 73 for 2011. Let me also remind you that at this stage last year, we had hedged 47% of 2010 forward production.</p>
          <p>As far as Spain is concerned, we are 100% hedged for 2010 and 40 to 45% for 2011 at an average base load price of 50 to &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour for 2010 and higher than the Spanish forward curve for 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me also remind you that at this stage last year, we had hedged 30% of 2010 forward production. In Latin America, we are 70, 75% hedged for 2010 and about 70% for 2011. Finally, in Slovakia, 2010 production is fully hedged and we are already 61% hedged for 2011 at an average base load price of about &#x20AC;53 per megawatt hour for 2010 and 55 for 2011.</p>
          <p>All of this will add to explain our EBITDA evolution of chart number seven, which gives an overview of all our operations. Now, I will go through the EBITDA of each of our division in detail starting with generation and energy management Italy on chart number eight. The generation margin increased by &#x20AC;39 million, mainly due to a more favorable thermal mix with a 17% reduction in the average fuel cost. This has been more than offset by the decrease of &#x20AC;184 million in trading margin due to a favorable gas sourcing which positively affected first quarter 2009. A reduction of &#x20AC;34 million in ancillary services and a negative impact of &#x20AC;79 million due to the change in fair value of commodities.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a look at the fuel cost evolution on chart number nine. Net of ancillary services, the unitary margin in the domestic thermal generation increased to &#x20AC;26 per megawatt hour in first quarter 2010 from 22 in 2009, mainly due to higher commodity hedging activities and the start of the clean coal second unit in Torre Nord.</p>
          <p>The overall generation unit energy margin net of ancillary services if &#x20AC;44.7 per megawatt hour versus 42.5 in the first quarter 2009, mainly due to more favorable fuel sourcing condition, only partially offset by lower hydro production.</p>
          <p>Let's move onto the EBITDA evolution analysis of the market division on chart number ten. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;157 million versus &#x20AC;116 million of first quarter 2009. This is the cumulative effect of the following. First, the increase of &#x20AC;21 million in the contribution of free market, mainly thanks to cost reduction and a positive change in fair value with electricity and gas margins substantially stable. Second, the increase in the electricity regulated markets mainly due to a positive price component effects on the tariff.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 11 on domestic infrastructure and network division, EBITDA amounted to &#x20AC;921 million or an increase of about 3% versus last year. This is the net effect of the following. First, the improvement of &#x20AC;65 million in the energy margin, mainly thanks to the positive price components on the tariff and higher volumes distributed. Second, minus &#x20AC;4 million due to lower connection fees, and third, minus &#x20AC;35 million mainly due to the perimeter effect after the disposal of the high voltage grid to Terna recorded in 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 12 on international operations, EBITDA was substantially in line with first quarter 2009 at &#x20AC;377 million. This is the net effect of the following. In the Centrel region, Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne contributed &#x20AC;40 million less mainly due to a price effect evolution and specifically, first quarter 2010 EBITDA of this company was about &#x20AC;200 million. Romania and Bulgaria performed very well with an increase of &#x20AC;17 million during the quarter. In particular, I would like to highlight that Bulgaria recorded an EBITDA of &#x20AC;34 million or 48% up versus first quarter 2009, mainly due to higher volumes also because of better availability.</p>
          <p>France experienced a negative impact of &#x20AC;19 million due to lower prices, which were partially offset by higher volumes. Russia made an increased contribution of &#x20AC;38 million, mainly thanks to the performance of OGK-5 up &#x20AC;23 million and RusEnergoSbyt, our supply company up &#x20AC;11 million.</p>
          <p>Before moving on, let's take a quick look at the Russian activities on chart number 13. OGK-5 reported first quarter 2010 EBITDA at &#x20AC;78 million or about 35% increase versus last year on a like-for-like basis. This is the result of the following, an increase of about 15% in total production, the availability ratio of our plant, higher power sales, and efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Russia recorded a strong 31% increase in unitary price mainly driven by the day ahead market together with the slower growth of unitary cost on gas and coal. To conclude about Russia, I would like to highlight that we are planning to hold an Investor Day in this country between June and July. We will disclose further details on this in due course in the coming days.</p>
          <p>Let's focus on Endesa results on slide number 14. First, let me remind you the numbers we report in this slide are the result of the application of Enel Group's accounting principle, which might differ from the Endesa principle due to difference in local standards.</p>
          <p>In Iberia, the generation sales business recorded an increase of about &#x20AC;200 million. The ongoing declining trend in pool prices this year has been partially offset by the hedging strategy with customer, which supported unitary revenues at about &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour. On the positive side, Endesa has benefited from a reduction in fuel costs, the removal of CO2 claw back, a competitive energy purchase cost, as well as higher volume sold in the free market.</p>
          <p>Renewables recorded a negative impact of about &#x20AC;41 million due to the change in the perimeter of the assets sold to Acciona last year. The distribution business recorded an increase of &#x20AC;116 million mainly due to the implementation of the new international accounting principle relating to the new connection fees.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, the generation business experienced a unitary margin decrease in Chile mainly due to the recent earthquake together with the impact of lower volumes in Colombia due to lack of rainfall.</p>
          <p>These effects were partially offset by higher unitary margin in Brazil. Taking into account all of these effects, EBITDA for the generation business decreased by about 19% versus last year. In the distribution business, the unitary margin increase in Brazil coupled with the positive impact from currency exchange have increased EBITDA for the distribution business by 29% versus last year.</p>
          <p>And now, let's review Enel Green Power on chart number 15. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;326 million, representing an 11% increase versus last year. Taking into account the one-off effect of a tax partnership in North America for an amount of &#x20AC;31 million recorded only in 2009 in Enel's consolidated group numbers, EBITDA is substantially in line with last year. This is mainly due to the following, a decline of &#x20AC;12 million in Italy mainly driven by lower generation prices <mark type="audio gap" /> France thanks to higher volumes.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt evolution is concerned, you see on chart number 16 that net of discontinued operation, overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;51.9 billion. The &#x20AC;1.1 billion increase is the result of a negative foreign exchange difference of more than &#x20AC;800 million due to quarter end translation effects, dividend payments to Endesa minorities for &#x20AC;267 million and extraordinary items of &#x20AC;23 million.</p>
          <p>The increase in net debt has been partially offset by a positive net operating cash flow equal to &#x20AC;36 million recorded despite a negative evolution of the working capital for &#x20AC;1.5 billion. This negative evolution was mainly due to seasonal effects, which recur every first and third quarter each year, mainly because of our billing profile.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by assessing that the good operating performance recorded in the period, as well as the expected improvements of the operating cash flow together with the finalization of our asset disposal program will support the robustness of our 2010 targets.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now let's open the Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Luigi. I will remind you that we will be collecting questions from both people who are now connected on the phone and people who logged in on the website. There are people already lining up, the first one being Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. So Alberto, you can ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Luca. Good afternoon. It's Alberto Gandolfi in UBS. I'll try to keep it brief because I have three main areas I wanted to focus on. First of all, on the Italian business, you gave us the top line, the power price achieved. Can you also give us, if you don't mind, spark and dark spreads for '10 and '11? And speaking to Italy, in your 44% of forward hedging, do you include any sales to the single buyer, and is the margin here fully locked in, contracted, or you're making any assumption on the forward price?</p>
          <p>Then secondly, moving to Endesa, I'm sorry but I still don't quite understand on slide 14 the 120 million difference at EBITDA level. If you can explain a bit more where it comes from exactly in Spain? And on Endesa longer term, have you changed your view compared to your industrial plan about any re-gearing potential via dividends or perhaps a possible long-term integration of the asset?</p>
          <p>And very last question; on strategy, we have seen a bit, basically an increase in the nuclear debate and your industrial plan did not include any nuclear CapEx. So can you maybe give us some rough figures of what you think 2013 and '14 investments from nuclear could look like? Thanks a lot and apologies for the lengthy questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Alberto. Thank you. I will start from your first question about the expected spark spread and dark spread in 2010 and 2011 full year. You're right, I gave you a guidance about the full price. With regards to the clean spark spread, if we refer ourselves to the expectation on the market, therefore using the spot price both on the sales side and on the sourcing side, while we are in terms of clean spark spread in the region of &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour both in 2010 and in 2011. Of course, when it comes to Enel you have to consider two effects. The first one is the more competitive portfolio of gas content that we have, and second, our forward sales strategy both in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>Therefore, if you factor in the numbers these positive effects when it comes to our house in 2010, we can assume to have a clean spark spread in the region of 18 to &#x20AC;20 per megawatt hour. And when it comes to 2011, we are much more around &#x20AC;15 per megawatt hour plus. Moving to the dark spreads, the story is substantially the same. Therefore, I will give you what we expect in our house when it comes to full year 2010. We are in the region of &#x20AC;35 per megawatt hour and the same could be said when it comes to 2011. We see positive signs if we look at the forward curve. So, therefore, we think also in the future, there is margin to see positive evolution also on the market, not only in our house because of our strategy.</p>
          <p>The other parts of your first question regarding the single buyer, well, the answer is that basically as of today the single buyer has not yet bought anything with regards to 2011. Therefore, we do not have any sales to the single buyer in our backlog with regards to 2011. As you know, the single buyer is a good buyer because he's buying the electricity for the benefit of the residential segment and therefore when he will start buying, we'll see our forward sales price probably a little bit improving.</p>
          <p>Going to the second question, the difference that you have seen comparing the results reported by Endesa yesterday and what we have reported today is mainly linked to the treatment of this international accounting principle or better interpretation of the principle, which regards the connection fees. The impact is in the region of &#x20AC;115 million in the first quarter. We have recorded this in the group level because locally, at the Endesa level, the local Sienna Mahoova, the Securities Exchange Commission has not yet given the green light to this FILA interpretation. Therefore, Endesa when reporting the results to the market has not included this benefit towards Enel as recorded is &#x20AC;115 improvement.</p>
          <p>Last question, strategy about nuclear and what do we have in terms of in CapEx in our business plan? Well, as we said many times, we have included just let's say the starting up cost, all the investment to study and to develop the analysis of this type of business. So, we have just 300, &#x20AC;400 million of expected investment in &#x2013; sorry, &#x20AC;500 million in terms of, let's say, development, and 300 in terms of pure research. So altogether &#x20AC;800 million in the last two years. We expect to give the final approval to the investment by 2013 or something like that and we expect the first kilowatt-hour coming into operation, of course, beyond 2014. It normally takes five years to the reach the point.</p>
          <p>I was missing one question with regard to the Endesa re-gearing. Well, at the Enel level, we will look at not only the Endesa but also at Spain as a country. Therefore, we consider the debt at the Endesa level and the debt that we have at the subordinate level in Spain. So, we consider for the time being the level that Endesa has to couple with the level of debt that we have at the subordinate level in line with our expectation and we do not foresee any major changes for the next &#x2013; for the short and medium term periods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Antonella Bianchessi, Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I just would like to come back to your generation in Italy. And if you can give us a little bit of visibility on the cost of gas going forward for Enel? You've got &#x20AC;0.317 per cubic meter, so this is the &#x2013; also including the hedges in place, when they will fade away and which is going to be the distraction the medium term.</p>
          <p>The second question is, again, on the Endesa different accountancy, first of all if you can quantify the impact on a full-year basis. And secondly, if you expect Endesa directly to basically take into consideration this effect by the end of the year. Always on this point, if this change in accountancy comes on top of your guidance or if it is included, and finally if you can kindly repeat &#x2013; give me, well, some explanation on the 'other' element of your net financial charges, if you can just repeat what is exactly about and this element, the 284 million. Sorry for that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Antonella, we start from the last part, the last point of your questions, were what does the net financial 'other' includes, the financial charges in the voice 'other' includes. Well, they include an adjustment of interest recorded in the past on the tariff deficit at the Endesa level for something in the region of &#x20AC;80 million. And also, they include the devaluation in the fair value of some derivatives, which of course, have been not definitely effective as to be charged into the profit and loss.</p>
          <p>Therefore, when it comes to the pure cost of our debt and therefore net financial charges, you have to look at the amount that I mentioned, which is highlighted in the presentation, which is reporting the &#x20AC;653 million with the 100% consolidation of Endesa with a cost of debt of 5%.</p>
          <p>Now, there was another question regarding the cost of gas, the first point of cost of gas. Well, the &#x20AC;0.31 that you see reported in the chart, basically includes also the effect of the hedging. And what we expect for the future, we do not expect any major changes. We expect to remain substantially stable. You know that we have some concepts, which are very positive in particular and the scenario when you have an increase in the expectation of the brand price and in the expectation of the gas, or the cost of the gas.</p>
          <p>Then the guidance regarding the impact of the application of the new accounting principle regarding the connection fees, well, we expect on the full-year to have a contribution, say, of &#x20AC;400 million, 350, &#x20AC;400 million. That was not considered in our targets, because the application has been, let's say, finally introduced during the beginning of this year or late as last year. So, clearly could go on top of what we have already assessed as the target.</p>
          <p>I think I answered all the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Javier Suarez, Unicredit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for the presentation. Three questions if I may. The first one is on the balance sheet structure of the company. The CFO has indicated that the cost of this should be at around 5% due to the first quarter, and that this was in line with the cost of debt that we have seen for the year 2009. Could you give a guidance for your expectation for the cost of debt for the whole year 2010? That would be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the performance of the Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne and the Russian activity. We have seen a lower contribution from Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne. Can you elaborate a bit on the reason for that? Is that due to lower production or lower margins, which is the reason for this lower- or this lower contribution from Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne? And also, we have seen a better contribution from the Russian activity and you had mentioned during your presentation that one of the reasons has been the efficiency improvement at your Russian operation. The question is could you quantify the level of this efficiency gain in the Russian activity?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on the CapEx. During the detailed presentation that you held in London in March this year, basically, one of the points was a significant reduction in the CapEx of something like &#x20AC;3 billion in the period 2010-2014. This first quarter we have seen a level of CapEx that has been roughly in line with the last year CapEx. So the question is when we should expect this reduction or compression in the CapEx to happen during the life of your 2010-2014 business plan? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Javier. I will start from the &#x2013; your first question. Well, at the end of the first quarter, we reported a 5% cost of debt, which we expect to remain substantially the same during the course of the entire 2010. Let me remind you that 80% of our total net debt is hedged in terms of rate of interest, hedged, and therefore, we do not expect any major changes.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your second question, Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne, well, Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne basically showed a reduction in EBITDA of &#x20AC;40 million. By the way forecasted and expected by us, because as you know, Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne has been 100% fully hedged when it come to the forward sales of last year. The reason for that is basically driven by the price, by the electricity prices.</p>
          <p>If we look at the electricity prices first quarter 2010 versus first quarter 2009, we have an impact of something very close to &#x20AC;50 million. We moved from &#x20AC;58 per megawatt hour on average in the first quarter 2009 down to 48 with an impact of &#x20AC;49 million. The net impact has not been 49 but 40 because of course in the meantime Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne has worked in order to improve the efficiency and availability of the power plants.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Russia, well, in Russia, we had two effect in terms of, let's say, in broader terms, efficiency improvements. The first regards the improvement of the availability ratio of our brands. We are now running at 80% when it comes to the core of our brands and an increase of 1.5 terawatt hours in terms of production and efficiency, 4% reduction with regards to the total cost basis. And then as you have seen in the charts, we also recorded an improvement in the unitary price according to the government program to have an increase in the old sale price in order to have the complete liberalization by 2011, '12, and to reach the famous netback by 2013. So we are quite happy with Russia. We are running according to schedule and the results I think are there to demonstrate.</p>
          <p>Finally, with regards to CapEx, well, you might recall that in our presentation we had assumed in our 2010 budget or first year of business plan, &#x20AC;7 billion of total CapEx. We substantially confirmed this &#x20AC;7 billion probably will be something slightly less, but this &#x20AC;7 billion is exactly in line with our CapEx program. The reason why we have not further reduced the 2010 as we explained one month ago &#x2013; an half ago in London is because there are a queue of investments already decided in the past. I'm referring to the finalization of the clean coal power plants here close to Rome. I'm referring to the finalization of the nuclear power plants in Slovakia, Malta 3 and 4 plus some other queue of projects already started in the last year. So we confirmed the &#x20AC;7 billion and we also confirmed the reduction in coming years. And I think I have answered to all your questions.</p>

          <p>There is a question coming from the Web site, in particular from Luis Amusategui with Cygnus Asset Management.  He is asking update on our asset disposal program with a particular focus on the potential IPO of Enel Green Power?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, we are I would say proceeding in all the key transaction we are committed to. Let me just refresh where we are. When it comes to the expected disposal in Spain, I think already yesterday the CEO of Brintana-Ready reported status, high-voltage grid in Spain is expected to be closed by June, July. We are in final negotiation with Red El&#xE9;ctrica. We expect to finalize also the disposal of the gas distribution business in Spain during the course of this year.</p>
          <p>We have started a tender to sell our Bulgarian assets. And we have just sent a letter to the bankers, the invitation letter to participate to a beauty contest for the IPO process of Enel Green Power, which is expected take place in the end of September, beginning October. Plus there are some other, let's say, minor or peripheral disposal, which are underway, which basically complement these transaction in order to reach the &#x20AC;7 billion target.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everybody. Just a question about your expectation on the margins in the power generation. You said that your spark spread, the clean spark spread 2010 on forward sales is around &#x20AC;20, next year you have &#x20AC;15. Well, on the market now, the margins are around &#x20AC;10. So are you expecting that in the market that, well, usually the margins are lower than yours, the pressure will continue to date over capacity or not? Or the forward sales improving for the market and you expect 2011 a better market?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the indebtedness. I was surprised to see such an increase of working capital in the first quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the trend of working capital in the, for the coming quarters and if you have guidance of net debt at the end of the year excluding the disposal? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start from your first question. What do we expect in terms of market evolution when it comes to the spark spreads and dark spreads. I would say spark spread because dark spread is more an Enel issue since we are the most important or the biggest player, operator. Well, we expect an improvement when it comes to the market condition. In particular, I would say in 2011 and for the last part of 2010, because what we see today in the market is substantially the following. We see a recovery of the electricity demand. By the way, even the month of April has shown an increase in Italy of something very close to 2% plus, which is better than what we expected in our plan.</p>
          <p>Second, we see the price of the commodities again increasing. If you look at the brand level, we are running something in the region of $80 per barrel or even more if we look at the forward curve. So there are all the condition, if the electricity demand again continues with this trend to have an increase of the spark spread back to say &#x20AC;15 per megawatt-hour like we saw one year and a half ago.</p>
          <p>So if electricity demand evolution continues like it is doing these days, that's probably the number we should see in the future.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the net debt, and in particular the working capital, well, let me be more specific about this. If you have the possibility to look at my presentation of last year, you've probably heard the same things that I said today. So every first quarter is penalized by our billing profile. So there is a seasonality effect in particular in the first quarter, which every year takes place and shows an increase in the working capital. Last year, it was standing in the region of 1.2, &#x20AC;1.3 billion, this year is 1.5 versus last year.</p>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; everything is physiological. We expect this &#x20AC;1.5 billion working capital increase to be absorbed in the second quarter, and by the way, that's what's happening. If I look at the month of April, I have seen a generation of operating cash flow. And so, I'm confident that by the end of the year, we will have a positive contribution of operating cash flow to our net debt reduction of something in between &#x20AC;0.5 billion to &#x20AC;1 billion. That's what we are targeting perfectly in line with what we said to the market one month and a half ago in London.</p>
          <p>All the rest is represented by the disposal, which will allow us to reach the &#x20AC;45 billion net debt level at the end of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow-up on year-over-year on the market. So if I understood correctly, despite the increase of capacity on the market, do you expect that with a recovery of demand as well as of commodities, the price spread in 2011 could return at the previous crisis level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, very close &#x20AC;15 is not in line with what we saw before the crisis. It was a little bit higher. It was in the region of &#x20AC;20 if I'm not wrong. What I'm saying here is that is if electricity demand continues to grow at the rate we see or we have seen in these first four months, then we should assume that the &#x20AC;15 per megawatt-hour in 2011 could be reachable by the market I'm saying, of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Most of the questions have been answered, but I'd like if possible to get a bit more clarity about these grid connection fees in Endesa because you mentioned that they could contribute 350 to &#x20AC;400 million of incremental EBITDA in full year, if I understood correctly? Would you mind to elaborate a little bit of what is changing versus the past in the accounting of these grid connection fees, whether it's just an item that is moving from a different line in the P&amp;L or it was something that was charged previously and added to the balance sheet? And second question and connected to this is, if this is an incremental EBITDA versus your previous guidance and there is no other offsetting factor elsewhere in the P&amp;L, would that mean also that you would be guiding to a higher net income versus your previous guidance of 4 billion for 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me explain a little bit what is this change in this connection fees. Well, up to the end of last year, we recorded this fee received from the customer in direct deduction of the investment of the CapEx that we had to spend for the benefit of the customer itself. Postponing the impact in the coming, say, 10, 15 years depending on the amortization rates of the single CapEx to which they are referred.</p>
          <p>So in terms of pure accountancy, you will see a gross up of the invested capital because of this rather than seeing a reduction as we did at the very beginning. And this difference will be applied definitely to the profit and loss. So you will see an increase in revenues in the region of &#x20AC;400 million, let's say &#x20AC;315 million, which means that this &#x20AC;315 million is not going to improve the cash because it's a pure accountancy matter, because the cash was &#x2013; is basically the same. You cash in this fee in the very moment you sign the contract with a customer and then rather than splitting for the residual life of the investment you do, you take the benefit immediately to the profit and loss. That's what basically is happening.</p>
          <p>We have adopted this interpretation at the group &#x2013; at the Enel group level. We are waiting for the interpretation of the local security exchange commission, the CNMA Mihooveh. And once there will be the approval by them, you will see these effecting at the Endesa level as well. By the way, it's the IFRIC 18, which is the interpretation or the document regarding the interpretation of the accounting principle.</p>
          <p>Therefore, this is going to increase our expected EBITDA and since it's going to impact the expected net ordinary income, we should assume that that part would be considered anyway ordinary. Moving to, I think I gave also the guidance about the full year. So I answered all the question.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of questions. I would like to go back to your fuel costs on slide nine. If you can give us an indication of your <mark type="inaudible" /> evolution of the coal price compared to the &#x20AC;85 per ton, if you spend something in line with current forward curve. So if you can remind your policy for procurement and hedging for the coal.</p>
          <p>And second question is related to the update you gave on your expectation in terms of demand increase, particularly in Italy, just a clarification if this is just due on, let's say, fine tuning on 2010 from the increase we saw in the first four months or the year. Or you have also revised upward your expectation in the medium term. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start for your second question. We have not revised our assumption and therefore we have not revised our target because of the change in the electricity demand in the first quarter. So this is something that we see as a positive sign, which is enhancing our, let's say, assumption in the business plan. And if it continues, clearly is going to influence in particular not 2010, but I would say 2011 because it's building the higher demand for the coming year. And that I think is very important for the benefit of what we said before regarding the spark spread evolution in the Italian market.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the fuel cost, well, our policy is to be fully hedged. Therefore, what we report here in terms of coal prices with regards to 2011, we do not expect any changes, substantially in line. Clearly, we see in the market an increase in the coal price and that of course is going to impact, in particular, 2011. But it is also partially reflected in the final price to the customer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, again. Apologies again to go back on <mark type="inaudible" /> connection fees, it's quite interesting given that we're not considering &#x2013; we understand EBITDA. It's cash EBITDA but we should have said the CapEx. So not change in the value of the company, but what &#x2013; I would like to understand is, can you tell us what is the impact on the net income that you reported? So for instance, do we just need to tax this 115 million or is there any D&amp;A, any other costs associated with it? So what's the net income contribution effectively? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me recap a little bit. In the first quarter, we have reported at the Endesa level &#x20AC;115 million, say &#x20AC;115 million positive as a contribution to the operating results. Now, since this is a, let's say, a consolidation adjustment because Endesa itself did not report this profit, this moment in its books, and therefore if it has not been reported locally, there is no tax impact up to the moment of course in which there is a final decision at the local level. We do not expect tax implication on that. Having said that &#x2013; this cash tax implication. For the time being we have, any way, included this &#x20AC;100 million into the, let's say, calculation of the average tax rate of the first quarter. So the impact of this &#x20AC;115 million say at the net income level is in the region of &#x20AC;78 million. So the taxes are in line with normalized tax rates.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a brief follow-up on this situation of a change in accountancy. So you will have also to record CapEx related to this connection and is this included in the 7 billion target, or this will be on top, or how we should treat the CapEx? And the other question is on 2012. So if you are already selling forward something in 2012 or if you start to see any type of visibility on the forward market in Italy but was about for 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me again be more specific about this change in the accountancy. &#x20AC;7 billion are confirmed and they already included the impact of the CapEx associated to these connection fees. So there are no changes in the CapEx. The only change that you see is that these connection fees are now reported to the profit and loss as revenues rather than deferred income as it was in the past.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the 2012 guidance, well, there are of course &#x2013; we already of course started to sell forward sales, as you know. We sell forward on a 24-month rolling basis. They are &#x2013; the final customer are residential, small office. So they are the usual customers. What we see as a price sign, which I think is important, well, is better than &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour. Now, if you look at the forward curve in Italy today, if I'm not wrong 2012 is showing 76, &#x20AC;77 per megawatt hour, and the forward sales that we are doing are in line or even better than this level of price.</p>
          <p>In terms of quantity, we are building our backlog. We are higher than 10%. So between 10% and say 15%. We are continuing to build our 2012 backlog, and as I said before, we expect to be at this level and better price than originally planned for.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, and just a very quick follow-up question again on the change in accounting if I may. Just to confirm that if this change is also recognized at the local level then it will have a cash impact. Am I correct to calculate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at a consolidated level we have accrued the tax referred to this revenue and this profit. Locally, we have to see what will be the final adoption in terms of accounting principle and therefore in terms of tax impact if they will be part of the tax rate of the year or not. This is something that will be finalized pretty soon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The payment by the customer is done the first time, so immediately. There is no deferred payment. The reason why the interpretation is pushing in order to charge this profit and loss is because the payment is done at once, at the very beginning and therefore that's the way it works.

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just one quick question to go back on the asset disposal. Can you just confirm to us that with the asset disposal to Red Electrica from Endesa it's all about the negotiation between your parties and there's no authorization needed or at the moment in order for this, say, to go on. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, basically if the two parties reach an agreement the deal can be done. There might be some, which we do not expect by the way, adjustment about the perimeter. But if the two party reach an agreement, ideally it can be considered done because as you know the local laws say that if you do not reach an agreement by the end of June, beginning of July then you need to go for an arbitrage. So we expect that if the two parties reach an agreement the deal would be benefit.</p>

          <p>We have a question coming from the website, basically from Natalie Burke at Allstate Investments. Would you expand a little bit more on liquidity? Do you have any plans to issue that in 2010? How many months of liquidity do you believe you have with your credit facilities and cash on hand? And finally, any views on the recent spread widening of your corporate bonds given the Greek debt crisis and does this change your timeline for issuing debt?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all let me tell you that we do not need to issue other bonds during the course of this year. The first important maturity are expecting to take place in 2012 and today we have a coverage of our next maturities in the region of 18 months plus if we consider also the Endesa credit line available.</p>
          <p>Of course, what we have seen in the market in these days has affected also the corporate and therefore we have seen increasing in the spreads, in particular in the CDS. But since we, as I said, we do not have any specific need for the time being and we are quite relaxed and, I mean, we do not have any need to improve our liquidity, which I think now is in very good shape.</p>
