        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone and welcome to the presentation of Telenor's Third Quarter Results and also to the presentation of the Unitech deal in India that we announced this morning. My name is Scott Engebrigtsen, and I have the pleasure of guiding you through this morning's presentations.</p>
          <p>We hope that everyone has the material, that we have made available, that is our two press releases this morning, the quarterly reports, and a copy of the presentation to be used here in a minute. And all this can also be found at our website at telenor.com.</p>
          <p>You can also watch these presentations live, or in recording on either the Internet, or on a mobile phone. And you may also send in your written questions during this transmission. And for instructions, please see our website.</p>
          <p>There will be, as usual a Q&amp;A session, directly after the presentations here. We will do this after both presentations have been conducted today and the Q&amp;A session will then cover both the Unitech deal and the quarterly results.</p>
          <p>And as usual we will start with the questions from the audience present. Then turnover to the ones participating on the phone, and finally the possibility to do individual interviews.</p>
          <p>Our CEO, Jon Fredrik Baksaas will first present the Unitech deal and then our third quarter results will be presented by Baksaas and our CFO, Trond Westlie.</p>
          <p>And that's all for me. I leave the floor to you, Baksaas</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning everyone. I can see from the audience in the room that there might be some things that have taken the numbers down from previous presentations, maybe it's the snowy weather in Oslo this morning.</p>
          <p>Well, I'm going to present to you our step up of our activities in the emerging markets, namely the Telenor entry into India. First the disclaimer, then the deal that with this morning have distributed is presented is a 60% stake in Unitech Wireless. We will here inject $1,070 million into new equity in Unitech Wireless and this will be done in multiple tranches in order to reach a 60% stake.</p>
          <p>This corresponds to an enterprise value of $1.1 billion, the way we have done our base calculations. This assumes also then debt in Unitech Wireless of 400 million.</p>
          <p>The Telenor entry into the Unitech gives us some strategic, operational control from day one. We will -- there will be seven seats at the Board of which Telenor will announce four and Unitech will announce three. And we do expect the closing to take place later this year.</p>
          <p>Unitech Wireless, what is that? This is the company that was founded in 2007 by the second largest real estate group in India. It's a Greenfield mobile operator with the pan-Indian license, and for the time being having spectrum in 30 circles. And so that India is divided into circles. There is two ways of getting into spectrum and licenses in India. There is a license process and then there is a spectrum process. There are spectrum to be received we anticipate in nine circles and that is expected to happen in the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>There is a team of close to 250 people in place in the Unitech. People coming from -- Unitech Wireless sorry. Business people coming from industry players in India both from the IT side and from the mobile side. These are executives with significant telecom operating expenses -- experiences, probably also expenses for that matter. But experiences, when it comes to roll-out, because some of these are coming from the existing operators.</p>
          <p>This is another step-up all our activities in a growing market environment and it does add new volumes to Telenor in the years to come. It is a very strong fit with what we have communicated before as our strategic agenda mainly that of expansion into countries that have future growth to offer. This is a unique opportunity despite the fact there are plenty operators present in India already. There are huge numbers of people that will get connectivity in the years to come in India. I will show you that later.</p>
          <p>And will of course leverage all we have of experiences from the rest of our operations. This is in the midst of what we have been doing in Telenor for the last 10 to 12 years. It's in the midst of what we have been successful doing in other markets. And it fills in a new footprint basically to the existing business model of Telenor. And we believe it's an attractive business case longer-term.</p>
          <p>Building on the industrial rationale of Telenor, in the 90s we started to move Telenor into international mobile operations. We did, as you know early on, Hungary as the first one, we did Russia, we did Ukraine and we did a number of others. At that point in time the subscriber growth was sort of the initial steps of this industry. Rollout network, get customer base.</p>
          <p>Some years later, 2004, some of these operations move up the growth curve. And they do show revenue generation, but still in both the settings many of our operations have been highly in need of cash when it comes to doing the network rollout and building the network effect among the new user groups.</p>
          <p>In 2008, many of our operations have moved into the cash flow generation phase of their operations. And seeing Telenor Bangladesh being primarily revenue generating for the time being, but we -- and for the time being we only see Pakistan being sort of on the subscriber growth level, requiring cash flow in order to further build its position in the market.</p>
          <p>India will compliment this. India will come in and fill in what we basically have been doing along the s-curve development of building customer base and network in these countries in a new way. And of course it's not a country, it's a continent.  Because of the sheer size of India and the fact that India also is one of those areas in the world where the economic growth is perceived to be the strongest in the years to come.</p>
          <p>If I look at the figures that Telenor have produced over the years, here comparing 2007 up against 1998, where it was my starting point in my previous slide. There is a phenomenal growth in the number of subscribers, having reached 143 at the end of 2007, now 159 million as we reported in third quarter this year.</p>
          <p>And revenues, building accordingly from around 30 billion to 105 and of course the operational cash flow moving from a pretty insignificant figure in 1998 to a very significant figure towards 2007.</p>
          <p>So this has created another Telenor over the years. And there has been value creation along this curve. Difficult to say though in these times when there are sort of a very rainy weather over the stock markets for the time being, but still the longer term perspective of this, we are in strong belief of that.</p>
          <p>If we look back to the capital markets say in 2007, we have this slide as part of our presentations. We were seeking growth opportunities in Telenor to move from where we were on our own existing operations in that presentation.</p>
          <p>Populations of significance, looking for regional clusters where we can leverage regional presence, reasonable -- we could wish a very reasonable predictable regulatory environment. The cultural fit is it so that our business culture can fit with others and the quality of the business case. These were our criteria when we went through them in 2007. And we have consistently sticked to the -- that strategic agenda on how we have been looking for opportunities over the years. We believe that India falls in this description very neatly.</p>
          <p>Here are some facts, 1.2 billion people rising, there are 28 states, which is  redistributed into 22 circles from a telecom operating point view, each with population from 500,000 to 166 million, countries of size</p>
          <p>Hindu is the main religion. This is an English speaking extensively used in all other administrative and business communications. And there is a stability on the political side compared to many other countries that we are working in. And the politics have managed to take concessions in continuity from phase to phase.</p>
          <p>The legal situation in India is very much mature because the British legal system is implanted at the fundaments in the court systems. This is a large and a growing economy. And I won't be too long on this one. We can of course, discuss whether the economic growth will be 6 to 8%, 5 to 7, or 7 to 9.</p>
          <p>The true fact is that India has been one of those countries that has produced the highest real economic growth for many years. And we believe that India will continue to be among those countries producing economic growth above many other countries. This is where we are positioned in Telenor in this respect. We want to be part of that development. We want to contribute to that development and hopefully we will also be beneficiary on the long-term industrial possibility for Telenor in this project.</p>
          <p>The economic growth figures as I referred to, is taking a dip in these years. Question mark is what kind of a hit will the Indian economy get from the international crisis? And the economic growth forecast for 2009 have by Economist Intelligence Unit and others been taken down to 6.8%.</p>
          <p>My point being we are not so focusing whether it is 6.8 or 5.8. But we do believe that under most circumstances the Indian economy will be one of those economies that really are showing growth compared to many others and the sheer size of it is what we are looking for to participate in.</p>
          <p>Because the mobile penetration in India is low and recorded as we speak at the 26% and if you compare to the other Asian countries, it's quite obvious that India is going to climb that statistic significantly in the years to come. Pakistan, for example is here, it has with 54% and we have been in the midst of taking Pakistan from below 20% penetration to above 50% penetration and we have been successful in that rollout. And we have been able to have an impact in a competitive market, building market share having reached the number two position in that market over only four years of operation.</p>
          <p>So we do believe in our ability to replicate the experiences learned in a country like Pakistan also for our activities in India. And we are going to do this together with our partner who has the local knowledge, who has the, I should say, the cultural sensibilities that we need in order to make an impact and making visibility among all the other players.</p>
          <p>Fixed line penetration and broadband penetration is insignificant. This is a circular phenomenon. This will be part of future modern communications so forth in some way or another. But when we earmark on Indian project as of today, this is the voice model, voice SMS and easy internet access which will be the number one priority in the first years.</p>
          <p>Then at the later stage, we will have to discuss the broadband opportunity, also in this country, which will be as important further going along as it is in any other economy.</p>
          <p>The regulatory framework in India is very detailed. That is visible. And you can find your way through it. There are 22 telecoms circled. These are categorized in Metro circles A, B and C. Out of anticipation of GDP production in these areas. So there are different spectrum fee structures available for the different circles. There is a base spectrum allocation. And from there on you have to show customer base to get new spectrum.</p>
          <p>And the regulator is strongly encouraging into infrastructure sharing. And this is one of the key elements in our entry into Unitech Wireless. And I will comeback to that in the few seconds.</p>
          <p>The 3G has not yet been distributed, but it's anticipated that 3G will be distributed in the auction, like process next year. Our own ambition from the 3G is of course very important in all our other markets. But as for India, we do now have a spectrum for the 900 than and we are at the voice model in the first steps of this project.</p>
          <p>Who are then our competitors? India is perceived to be a very competitive marketplace. Yes, we know that, we have seen that ourselves through this phase since we started to look at India.</p>
          <p>There are three nationwide operators. There are two operators with CDMA, both of them expecting to take their customer bases for -- in the direction of GSM longer-term. We believe that our value proposition in this marketplace is the ability to differentiate our service offering. We have a distribution model in the other countries in Asia and in Europe, in Ukraine in particular which we will replicate and we do hope that this is sufficient in this market as it is in the other countries in Asia.</p>
          <p>And we do execute a network quality program in the same way as we've done in all other markets. We try to build a perception that the quality of network is the best with Telenor.</p>
          <p>Then we are back to the leveraging of the Telenor business model. Using the local drive when it comes to understanding the local marketplace. Remember, India is not one market, its several markets. And we have a lot of experience in how to balance the Group leverage, just the scale of economies when it comes to purchasing and concept building and product development, up against, local drive when it comes to distribution, sales and marketing.</p>
          <p>The confidence and the experience that we have in Telenor will of course be utilized in full, not solely relied on Telenor personnel of course. But try to escalate the capacity that we already have in Telenor into India, into the new continent for Telenor. And the concept when it comes to go to market will of course be part of this as will the governance and the principles of the Group how we operate. Not to mention the HSDPA kind of challenge that we were met with in Bangladesh previously this year.</p>
          <p>We will as I said, appoint four out of seven directors to the Board. We will also nominate the Managing Director, the CFO and the Chief Marketing Officer and where I said rest of the management will be appointed by the managing director in consultation with the Board of Directors. And it is our Head of HR Sigve Brekke who will head the project work on this entry into India in the first phases.</p>
          <p>We expect the service launch in mid 2009 and we have as part of this agreement a condition precedented on the fact that we will enter into a size and power-sharing contract with power vendors in India.</p>
          <p>The Indian continent already has the principle of power sharing in place with other operators. And Unitech Wireless has been negotiating the possibility of entering into such a power sharing model. This is a very significant move for us because it takes down the CapEx figures significantly when it comes to build the coverage as it increases speed of rollout.</p>
          <p>So it's a very key to how we approach and moving in the markets. It's a big different from what we're used to because we have normally build a lot of towers and done the site acquisition ourselves. In this case this job has been done.</p>
          <p>We do foresee a few billion CapEx with us from three years in the network roll out plan. We are looking for EBITDA breakeven in approximately three years from launch. Pretty much the same as was done in Pakistan. And the longer determinations here is to compete for an 8% market share and 30% EBITDA margin, and 20% operating cash flow in the longer-term perspective. And then we are talking 8 to 10 to 12 years ahead.</p>
          <p>We know what it takes to do a long-term project in Telenor. We've always been industrial in our approach building sustainable positions in the markets in which we move. This is another project in that direction. We are long-term in positioning Telenor. We have been served and this relates to this project as well.</p>
          <p>The funding question is, of course, very important in these days. How can this be done? We have come to the conclusion that we will do an equity injection Unitech Wireless and this will be in the short-term funded by existing facilities or commercial papers. Then we intend to secure additional long-term funding by raising approximately NOK12 billion through a rights issue early next year.</p>
          <p>In this sense, the Norwegian Government has stated this morning its willingness under certain conditions to put forward a parliamentary proposition to participate for its pro rata share of such a rights issue. This will then be the longer term foundation for how Telenor will approach the business opportunity in India. This will, of course, give us some impact in the figures both short-term and long-term.</p>
          <p>CapEx sustained sales ratios in 2009 and 2010 will, of course, grow high from low 20s to high 20s. The operating cash flow will be diluted in 2009 by 90% estimated and in 2010 by 40%, other things being equal. It's been very important for us to also be very clear on the fact that our existing dividend policy will remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>Concluding then, we do think India is a unique opportunity to take Telenor further into its development in the international mobile markets. We know India is a significant challenging marketplace. We do think we have the capabilities and the capacities in Telenor to handle this.</p>
          <p>It will give us a solid contribution to the growth for Telenor in the years to come and further strengthening the industrial development of the Group. In such a sense that we will maintain and build our scaled economy capabilities will assist other players in this industry.</p>
          <p>We will, of course, leverage whatever confidences that we do have. I'm very happy to recognize that many Managers in Telenor -- this morning basically, have offered their interest in messages to me and to Bj&#xF8;rn to participate in this. So there is a willingness among our managers to really participate in building Telenor into this next stage.</p>
          <p>And we believe that we can handle the business case and move it into an attractive development over the long-term prospectus on this project. There will --this not be sort of -- we need a figure to come through in fourth quarter 2008, but we solidly believe that this will contribute in the longer term industrial profile of Telenor in the years to come.</p>
          <p>That takes me through the Indian entry of Telenor. And I will then move over to the financial figures as of the third quarter 2008. And if I'm right here there is even a longer disclaimer entering the figures. Assuming everyone, you have read this one, I'll move to the figures. There is a stable performance in the Telenor third quarter 2008. I'm happy to report it.</p>
          <p>The growth in number of customers continues, 6 million this quarter. And again, it's the Asian countries that primarily contributes to the big fee receivers. But even in the Nordic countries, there are some customer additions to count in</p>
          <p>The organic growth figure of Telenor is now 4%, which is lower than what is was in the first and second quarter, which we had 6 to 7%. So we are also seeing effects of the new and more challenging economic climate in our markets.</p>
          <p>However, I do have to say that this quarter, believe it or not, is the best quarter that we ever have produced in Telenor, reaching NOK10.033 billion at an EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA level. Our previous figure for that was 9.5 billion last year.</p>
          <p>And third quarter 2006, which was considered the very, very, very best quarter ever in Telenor was 9.2 billion. So looking at the growth profile of Telenor, having positioned Telenor in the growth environment -- growth countries, we are producing financial growth in our figures also in this quarter.</p>
          <p>We do see though a more turbulent business environment in any of our operations, that's unavoidable. But we do believe that the telecom services is a kind of service, a kind of product, a kind of lead, which is a bit different from other consumer goods. We do maintain our 2008 guidance, which we did for second -- after second quarter reporting. We will maintain those figures and Trond will go through them in a little while.</p>
          <p>In this presentation, I will concentrate more in summary on the regional level. The retail growth in Norway for Telenor is 3% in Norway for mobile services. However, on a reported basis, it's going down 5%, because of the effect of the Tele2 wholesale agreement.</p>
          <p>This is the last quarter, where we have the effects of this in our figures and next quarter, we will have the benefits of having a similar contract with Network Norway. So fourth quarter will be the first quarter, where the Network Norway contract will have full effect for Telenor.</p>
          <p>I am happy to say that the customer base is growing and in particular on mobile broadband. We have added more than 40,000 new mobile broadband users in this period. No wonder you can say because it's a summer holiday and people are more mobile. And yes, that's right. On the other hand, we've seen a leveling out of our new ADSL number of customers in this quarter.</p>
          <p>In Sweden, we've done a restructuring in order to make a better balance between capacities and the competitive situation. There is the charge of NOK78 million attached to that in our reporting figures in this quarter.</p>
          <p>But you will also see that the Swedish operation is a bit more strong on customer acquisitions. As it has been able to add 50,000, all-in-all out of which 32,000 have been mobile broadband users in this quarter.</p>
          <p>In Denmark, we see results coming out from the acquisition of the Tele2 customer base, building and securing the EBITDA margin reasonably well. What's particularly strong, but not part of these figures in the Nordic areas for this quarter, is that the broadcast business area has grown revenue-wise by 15% in this quarter alone.</p>
          <p>So basically, the broadcast business area is doing very well, seeing growth in -- the main growth coming from Transmission Services and Encryptication Services from [Ukunos] .</p>
          <p>We also see a strong growth in internet users of the cable -- with cable this quarter from Canal Digital, which proves that the cable concept is very competitive in Norwegian marketplace for the time being time.</p>
          <p>Moving then to CEE, I have to say the previous number this year is in this area -- third quarter 2008 is a very, very strong quarter.</p>
          <p>In particular, in Kyivstar, we see figures of high quality. This is the third quarter that Kyivstar basically produced an EBITDA margin above 60%. And we do constantly get the question for how long can that last? We haven't promised you that for the whole year, but still we are at this level even in the third quarter. And Kyivstar maintained its market position, also very strongly. But both Serbia and Pannon is doing very well in their competitive markets, building good financial figures in their third quarter report, this year.</p>
          <p>In Asia though, we do see a more weak macroeconomic environment. However, I will say that if you look at Bangladesh, it seems like Bangladesh has been through very turbulent times and recovering to a certain extent. If you look at the Grameenphone figures, the way they are presented in this quarter. And I'm happy to say and to see that <mark type="inaudible" /> and their team has managed to balance their service offering up against competition maintaining market share both for customers and revenues, and being able to handle this competitive situation under difficult market conditions.</p>
          <p>We are now looking for an IPO to happen for Grameenphone probably at the end of the year. We believe this will create a stronger awareness of Grameenphone in the Bangladeshi economy and we are also very much looking forward to seeing the election taking place. Hopefully we will see a new economic environment term.</p>
          <p>DiGi and DTAC has delivered their figures earlier this week. DiGi reasonably stable. Some consequences of the economic crisis in Thailand.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at Pakistan, we had a -- the weakest development according to what we could expect. The third quarter in Pakistan has been basically a halt in both usage and new customers coming into the scene. And, of course, this relates back to the situation that the country is in. The accident and the Marriott event, of course, plays a role into this and foreign direct investments have taken a halt in the country. This morning unfortunately, we have the report that it was an earthquake in Quetta area which have had -- not as the same magnitude as the earthquakes some two years ago. However, the country is struggling on many fronts at the same time. We do hope that the new political direction will be set for Pakistan and that investments can start to prove true again. But we may now prepare ourselves that it takes some time.</p>
          <p>Though we see that the traffic volumes are picking up a bit in October maybe the economy at large in a way manage to balance off how they use their funds under this new situation.</p>
          <p>To conclude my presentation on third quarter this year, third quarter this year, we do believe that the telecom industry is a bit more resilient due to the economic difficulties that many countries are facing. We are not immune, but we do believe that we can balance both OpEx and also CapEx in reasonable terms, according to what we see of customer growth and volume growth in the marketplaces.</p>
          <p>So both CapEx and OpEx has to be put up in balance with market development in the general term. That's the way Telenor will execute in the periods to come. We are long-term in building a sustainable industrial position in the markets we are. We have shown that in all our markets and continue to do that. And to conclude again, we maintain also under the circumstances that Unitech will be part of Telenor from now on. We will maintain the divided policy unchanged.</p>
          <p>That concludes my presentation this morning here from <mark type="inaudible" /> and Trond Westlie will take us through the financial figures of third quarter 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I will go through the numbers for the year -- group numbers for the third quarter. I'll do this briefly. The number as Fredrik said, it's all time high revenue and EBITDA. We're coming up to level of NOK27 billion in revenue this was 27.6 billion, this quarter with 10 billion EBITDA including the Kyivstar numbers.</p>
          <p>As you see on the graph to the left, we're having an organic growth of 4%, which is in line with the overall expectations for the year to come around the 6% level for the year. As you see on the margin number, we are at 36% on the EBITDA, the same as the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Looking at the element of reporting an organic growth in Telenor, you see that on this slide, on the left you have the revenue, and to the right the EBITDA. You see that the reported growth of this quarter is 4% and the organic is 4.1.</p>
          <p>In addition, the EBITDA has a reported growth of 5.6, but the organic is 6.9. The dilemma in Telenor is that we are full of currencies and therefore the variety of those are very different. So if you look at the element of this, you'll see that it is a wide variety on numbers. With that current, you see that reported revenue growth of 7.5, but the organic growth is about 0.3 negative.</p>
          <p>In addition, we see that the reported EBITDA growth is 9.9, but the organic, is only 2.3 due to the fact of changes in currency. The same you can see of DTAC in Thailand. We have reported revenue growth of negative of 10.9, but the organic growth in Thailand is 2.4. Accordingly, the EBITDA has a negative 8.8, with a plus 5.6. We hope that in understanding the numbers of Telenor, we hope that this table would assist you in the planning the development of the underlying -- and our organic growth compared to what we actually report in Norwegian kroner.</p>
          <p>Moving to the CapEx levels, we see that the CapEx level actually reduces down to 14% relative to sales on the quarter. CapEx of 4 billion this quarter, from a high of 4.8, if we exclude the licenses paid in the second quarter of 2008 of 1.5.</p>
          <p>We see from the bridge, that coming from third quarter of 2007, we see the reduction is mainly in Asia as we have predicted that is coming down. Then it's a slight decrease in both Central Asia and Nordic with the slight increase in broadcast also as a result of the rollout of the terrestrial network for hiring.</p>
          <p>Going then to the operational cash flow, we see that we have a cash flow -- operating cash flow of NOK6 billion this quarter. And in addition, we see that the development of the organic growth in Asia, as well as in CEE. We see that the element of -- the bridge from the 4.2 in third quarter of '07 leaves the in Asia of 1.2. The Central Eastern Europe mostly because of efficiency of the CapEx spend relative to revenue more than the actual increase, so that the cash flow percentage in the Central Eastern Europe region is now coming up to the 30% level and may be a bit higher as a result of Q3 number being that high.</p>
          <p>Then to the numbers for -- the reported numbers for the quarter. We have revenue of NOK23.8 billion and EBITDA of 7.7 -- just short of the 7.7. There are some other items which is disclosed in our report, is basically scraping of an IT project delivered from IBM that we have to scrap. That we didn't like. It's about 100 million and then it's approximately in Sweden restructuring cost and some other additions about 100 million and then another write-down on the contract of Cinclus and small write-down on the DTT in Finland of approximately NOK22 million.</p>
          <p>All in all, there were charges of about 300 million, leaving us at 7,346 billion of EBITDA. We have an associates there that is basically comprising of VimpelCom and Kyivstar. Kyivstar is approximately 900 million out of that. And then the net financial of 1.2, that is just a slight decrease -- increase in our financial costs together with translation differences of some of our hedging positions that is not -- we're not able to do hedge accounting for on the balance sheet. And therefore we have a deduction there in the net financials of approximately just short of NOK400 million.</p>
          <p>That leaves us at a net income of two -- almost NOK3 billion with an earnings per share of 1 krona and 80 &#xF6;re. If we take the earnings per shares on ongoing business from last year it was 1 krona and 86 &#xF6;re.</p>
          <p>Going then to the net debt development. We started third quarter with the 41.6 billion in net debt. Then we had EBITDA of 7.4, interest paid, income taxes paid and CapEx and then we have some dividend received and some currency effects and accruals that goes opposite ways and thereby having a net effect on 7.8 and leaving us as that the net debt of 39.3 billion at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>We've got numerous questions about our funding position and debt position during the quarter. This is the maturity profile of Telenor as such. The blue on the bottom is the Group or the parent position that we have in our Group companies, on more than 90% and then the grey ones is one that is partly owned and separately financed outside the parent funding.</p>
          <p>So you see that -- the funding is that we have maturities of NOK2.5 billion during 2008, 7.2 in 2009 and just short of 1 billion in 2010. To cover those relative to the turbulent financial markets, we have committed credit lines or backed up facilities of just about NOK20 billion.</p>
          <p>So relative to how we actually foresee the turbulence in the credit market and the committed backed up facilities that we have already, we are very comfortable in our funding position going forward as such. Also relative to what we -- that Fredrik said that we anticipate our industry to be resilient even though we're definitely not immune to the economic development.</p>
          <p>We do think that the position we -- the committed lines, together with the position we have as an industry and as a company, we actually feel confident -- comfortable on our credit position. That also includes India, with position that we actually going to do a rights offering of NOK12 billion in the first quarter next year.</p>
          <p>Then my last line is to maintain the outlook for 2008, on reported revenue growth of around 3%. As a result of the development in the currency markets that is slightly changing upwards from where it was last quarter. And the EBIT margin is in the same range of about 31%. And CapEx to sales to be around 20% as a result of that we anticipate slightly higher CapEx in the fourth quarter than we've seen in the third.</p>
          <p>A slight addition to that is also that the organic estimates that we have said to be around growth in revenue growth of around 6%. We actually maintain that as well as Fredrik said. And -- but the element is as a result of the development and 4% growth in Q3. It might be on the low side on the 6% and not of the high side, but it's still definitely around the 6% level. So by that I conclude my part of the third quarter presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Martin Hoff from Arctic Securities. In light of Telenor's own market cap now of -- I don't know somewhere below 70 billion and if you take out the listed assets that you own of, the implied valuation of everything apart from the &#x2013; on the GNB side is around 25 billion now. With that in mind, could you say a little about what was your approach to valuation in terms of Unitech? Was it just valuation? How did you go about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the valuation method that we've actually done on Unitech is basically the same valuation as we do in every investment. We look at the fundamentals, in this case how we can develop value, and the we try to evaluate the levels that we see and it's also of course that it's a negotiation where the pricing level of that kind of asset will be as Greenfield operator. And we feel that having a value, a network value of 1.1 billion of that business contract in India is of fair and good value over long term relative to Telenor going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second question, just to follow up you said EBITDA breakeven three years from start up, so I guess that will be 2012. Did you say when it would then cash breakeven -- was that 2015 or somewhere in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably going to be plus/minus two years in addition relative to that number or that timeframe. So it's around three years on breakeven on the EBITDA level and you probably have to add on another two years plus or minus on that to get cash breakeven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My final question -- there has been very, very specific rumors about the Unitech aquisition. For four weeks we've heard prices have been fairly leaks --  maybe on the Indian side? Why haven't you been out and kind of confirmed that you were actually in talks with them to kind of equalize the information out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the reason why we haven't gone out and said anything is basically that we haven't been certain to actually complete the transaction until recently. Even though we have been searching the market not only with Unitech but also with other players in the Indian market. We have been discussing with several, but yes we agree and acknowledge that there have been rumors, but to us the probability hasn't been high enough. The only comment we actually made was that yes, we are in India and looking at it. And that we did say relative to the position and the probability of the deal that wasn't clear until basically yesterday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question over here please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Espen Torgersen, Carnegie. Obviously a lot of focus on India today. I'm kind of intrigued in many ways, but if we look back at your business case moving into Pakistan, I'm looking at how you evaluate the track record of that operation and you compare that to your assumptions going into India. Is it more or less the same or has there been any large deviations to your assumptions going into Pakistan? And obviously the last question would relate more to risks, what about the risk issues moving into India now versus the general assumptions back then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course this is a diversified picture and I'm not really sure whether comparisons between the two countries are that relevant to make because the risk factors on Pakistan are very much different from what they are on India. And the situation where Pakistan is in is of course a very much more challenging situation than -- to compare it with the Indian sort of engine at work. The industry development in India has developed a lot more faster and a lot stronger also in relationship to international relations than that of Pakistan.</p>
          <p>And when we do our calculations on evaluating the risk factors, we could argue that we underestimated in -- four to five years back, the situation that Pakistan presently finds itself in. On the other hand, we do strongly believe that the telecommunications will sustain through both prosperous times as well as more difficult times. So basically, telecoms will be in need under any circumstances. We have seen this in many markets before that the development of the business model under telecom basically takes a pause before it develops into a new layer. And we believe this will happen also in Pakistan after some while.</p>
          <p>To judge it by some few quarters is not relevant. If we then look at the risk factors in India, the competitive risk, the regulatory risk, the political risk, we do rate those quite differently from Pakistan at least under the present conditions. However, all markets are giving certain surprises, when it comes to regulatory things and political priorities might -- may change. Then we're back to the longer-term needs of the telecoms industry, as such being sustainable also over a period of time. This will of course impact CapEx as it will in Pakistan in these days, as I said when we try to link OpEx and CapEx along with market development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just add on to that. I do think that from a financial perspective, I think that the most important difference between the India case and the Pakistan case is the tower sharing possibility, which is substantial relative to capital allocation. And being, have the possibility to be a Pan-Indian player without putting that much CapEx in upfront relative to -- and not --and even a timing the logistics in the actual rollout phase. And it is a prerogative that we actually get that deal relative to be able to actually do or -- actually close this deal as a whole. And that is a fundamental difference relative to what we actually saw in Pakistan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow-up if I may? On the funding side, given the Parliamentary White Paper stating that the Norwegian Government will not drop below 54%, is it fair to say it's a formality, based on your, the comments you make in the report stating that they will attend based on certain....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the government perspectives there will of course be a number of formalities that has to be done through a parliamentary proposition. So I think that question should be directed to them as well. We see that as technical type of conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You have been talking a bit about it already. But you're guiding for an accumulated CapEx of $2 billion for the first three years. And whereas I believe, Vodafone has guided for 2 billion of CapEx each year going forward in the Indian market. You mentioned that the tower sharing agreements will contribute moderate CapEx. However, we should probably also assume that your competition is doing the CapEx as efficient as possible. Could you provide some more color on your moderate CapEx expectations for the Indian market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, how the others are applying their CapEx. That will be up to the others. But I do anticipate that figure also include a 3G initiative. When we're looking at our initial steps, we're using our frequencies for the 900 band for voice SMS. And then also EDGE -- giving Internet access on handhelds basically. And this is our initial step-up. We are anticipated that we will move in to a tower sharing agreement giving us access to a high number, very high number of towers, as well as also access to underlying backbone capacities, which means that, as I said the CapEx figure will be significantly lower.</p>
          <p>The OpEx will be slightly higher under such al rental agreement. However, the tower sharing principle, basically gives benefits to the party that has built the powers, the towers as well as to the power -- to the party connecting to the towers which is a fundamental new change to our business model, basically. So we installed our own equipment in the towers and of course, due to the front-end investments in the network. So we believe that we shall be able to build necessary coverage, the way we have thought of go-to-market with that figure that is in the estimates.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. There are some condition precedents, of course, and we're not expecting actually give those condition precedents finishing until now -- approximately four weeks maybe a bit later. But other than that it's signed deal. As long as the condition precedents are met, it's definitely a done deal. The most important element of that is not finalized in negotiations is the tower sharing agreement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the -- there won't be a full number seven plus four basically in all circles. And we have -- the presence of existing players strongly or weakly is very differentiated from circle-to-circle. So the number of players will be lower than sort of the forced maximum. However, how many there will be and how many there -- as impact, there will be in every circle is very, very difficult to say. We are putting trust in the fact that we have other model on how go-to-market, how to link upward distribution and how to differentiate our service offering up against the others. We are putting faith in that model gives our -- gives ourselves the differentiated factor building perception around the Telenor mobile service offering that will have an impact.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Maurice Patrick from JPMorgan. A couple of questions, the first one relates to your CapEx guidance in India. Clearly there are 3G spectrum auctions coming up and how much do you envisage that spectrum actually costing? The second question relates to funding of the rollout and you have talked about doing a rights issue in the first quarter, why would you not have looked to raise debt instead of that in order to not dilute your shareholders? And just finally with your shares on about 4, 5 times earnings, why do you think it creates more value for shareholders to go into India rather than using that same cash to buyback your own shares? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I got your first question right, you asked about 3G spectrum, didn't you? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for the 3G spectrum and the potential value of that, we have no speculations from our end on that question. We are concentrating on the 2G business model and I think I only say -- only said based upon the 900 band and it's the 800 band, of course. But still the 3G issue is not part of our common sales of the day. Meaning, that we are reluctant on sort of selling ourselves into an auction like procedure on the 3G as we stand today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming to the funding question, the element of -- looking at the rights issuance instead of raising debt, one element is of course the challenge of raising debt in this type of market. But another thing is that as a result of the Indian investment being so front loaded of negative cash flow, specifically in the first year, and getting access to all those base stations and rolling that out fairly quickly, that's going to pressure the operating cash flow. So much that we actually felt that it would be unwise to address such a financial risk going into 2009. Than that the ended up with the suggestion of doing a right issues because of the rating implications that might be considered as a result of the negative cash flow coming out of an Indian investment.</p>
          <p>Going to the capital allocation question about doing or allocating the -- to the investment of India compared to doing a buyback issue. It is of course a question of short-term financial returns relative to the long-term returns that we can see of an India case. The issue had been raised in the company and we have looked at the element of the long-term growth of Telenor and have evaluated the situation that the business case as such meets all the criteria for good economic growth as well as the industrial growth of Telenor. And thereby have come to the conclusion that the right thing to do now would be to continue the long-term growth of Telenor and not the immediate short term relative to how you can price it into the financial market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, a couple of questions please. Firstly, is there not a danger that competitors may use 3G as a differentiator if you don't pursue a 3G license? Secondly, just following on from the earlier question, you are on earnings yield of 22%. Can you just confirm that your long-term plans have of return on investment that's higher than that? And lastly, what hurdle rate cost of capital did you use when evaluating the Indian move? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 3G as a differentiator, yes. Of course that is a concern you could argue. However, the customer segments, the market segments in India in the first years at least will probably be not as inclined to meet such a differentiated service offering at any size. If we see how this has been done in the Scandinavian countries, it's only after quite some time that the 3G service offering has proved to really mean a differentiated for broader parts of the marketplace. We used it as a frequency, as a capacity enhancer more or less in the first years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to whether your written calculation is right or not, I cannot elaborate more than I did in the last question. that the element is that it has been evaluated whether the returns on the buyback relative to the long-term industrial development of Telenor considering the rates of return that we actually have as a benchmark and had as a benchmark for last at least four or five years or now.  And therefore, we have done the decision of allocating the resources to India.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As always, we are not stating what elements of weighted average cost of capital and capital allocate -- or capital requirement we are actually using. The only thing I can say is that we've done the same calculations. We've done the marketwise calculations on returns, put on our own evaluations on the returns of India as such, as a DCF model and together with the level of nominal internal rate of return that they have as a standard template relative to achieve more that. And both of them are met in this investment as in the other investments we've done previously, but we are not stating the level of returns that we put into the models.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three questions from my side please. First, in India on the network sharing -- the tower sharing agreement, I was wondering how you see -- how you can match the two sides of them? On the one hand network sharing and tower sharing is the key advantage compared for example to Pakistan. And on the other hand you say, but a quality differentiation, network quality is sort of the key -- one of the key value propositions, I mean, how does that not match? It would be my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, coming back to this cost of capital issue, maybe with the different angle, I understand you don't want to release details of how you calculate it. But my question would be, did the fact that the share price is trading where it is today, play any role in your evaluation of the Indian case, given that it is financed with share capital at current level? So, did that play any role at all in the whole calculation? And my third question if I may, what is the practical implications of the asset freeze by the Omsk Court on the VimpelCom shares? I understand you protest that, I fully understood, but what is the practical impact? Are there any issues with secured loans or anything of that sort I was just wondering? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Let me begin on the tower sharing principles, you are right in the fact that towers used by us not necessarily gives better quality initially compared to towers used by another. On the other hand, we do see that traffic volumes in certain areas are being hampered from all existing players because of lack of frequencies, basically to handle the traffic growth. More or less a little bit of the same that we experienced in Bangladesh where we are the market leader in Grameenphone in the Dhaka area, which now will be compensated by the fact that we will increase the frequencies in play in that country. So that is one area or one quality parameter that has to be taken into your consideration. Then we haven't said that we will not deploy any of our own towers but in volumes we have access to new towers, existing towers, which basically will give us an early rollout when it comes to coverage, which we have not seen before. And this is the key for how we want to start-up because it will take down the CapEx level significantly as well as increase the speed in rollout so that we can participate in market growth as early as possible in 2009.

          <p>Well, coming to whether the sort of -- to the capital allocation discussion again, whether buyback will play the role in evaluating the cost of capital. Of course, it played a role in the sense that it was evaluated during the process. And were considered over standard capital allocation is relative to returns for the company, as well as, for the shareholders and basically that was evaluated. But the element is that it didn't play anymore role that it was not decided, it was decided upon going into India. Coming to the rest of the VimpelCom shares, we don't see any immediate implications, there are of course when there are seizures or arrests in assets. Some our loan agreement had some vague language relative to whether or not what implication that might arise. We have evaluated that position and found out that this is not material at this stage and we have not seen that this will have any implication as of now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's James Sawtell from Goldman. I'll be quick on my questions, number one in India, what is the process to get the 2G spectrum for the residual nine circles. Is there any risk you've done towards that or was that just a formality? Secondly, are you absolutely committed to a 2G only strategy and therefore not look to bid in the auctions at all for 3G? Or might you keep an eye on what levels they're going for and revise plan accordingly, if that looks like there is value in 3G spectrum? And then on Pakistan your margins obviously dropped to 11%, I think it was in the third quarter. It doesn't feel like the turmoil in Pakistan is over. Can you give us any sense of where that leaves you for thinking about the run rate for margins in Pakistan for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for spectrum in the residual circles, I wouldn't go as far as saying its only formalities, but we do anticipate that the work that as been done by our partner in this respect will also earn us frequencies in the remaining circles. And if some do not happen there is a compensation mechanism in the documentation between ourselves. 2G only -- keep an eye on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just an add on to that -- in the 13 spectrums we have already, its covering approximately about 850 million people out of the 1.140 billion people there already. So the 13 circles already in hand actually covers 850 million people in India.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for 2G only versus have -- having an eye on 3G, of course, we will have an eye on 3G. And it's not expected that a 3G license process will have a national approach only. It will have a circle approach, which will mean that probably operators are becoming selective on how to approach the 3G Spectrum issue. As for Pakistan how -- what can we expect? For the time being, I think the environment in Pakistan is so that all kind of expansionary activities have come to a halt. FDI has being significantly reduced or even withdrawn. A lot of people participating in Pakistan business industry has become more mobile, running their things from abroad. This has to come through a period where things will normalize we hope. We do anticipate that the traffic pattern will increase and that there will be new customers to come in towards the end of this year, compared to what happened in third quarter. But to expect that it will be a sudden swing back on what we've seen, that is too strong. So we will reduce the speed and momentum in how we build the capacities in our organization in Pakistan, as probably will happen in -- among other the players as well.</p>

          <p>Quick follow-up while I'm still on the line. But in the event that you do pick-up some 3G Spectrum in some circles, does that change the sort of business plan that you outlined for India, i.e., could that add a bit more cap to CapEx might have changed EBITDA breakeven etcetera?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux, I'll try and be brief. Firstly, the 12 billion rights issue, will that cover the funding needs in the Unitech Wireless until it becomes cash flow breakeven? Or do you see yourself adding to -- adding debt in order to fund that rollout in India? Second question, has there been any new movement in your discussions with Alfa, any new signs they are maybe changing their position vis-&#xE0;-vis a resolution to your various distribution in Kyivstar and VimpelCom? And thirdly, your comments on mobile broadband intake in Norway being strong while DSL seems to be flattening off -- is that simply a function of the DSL market maturing or do you see some cannibalization or where we recall of mobile as well on fixed on behalf of mobile? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the 12 billion rights issue, no that we not cover the negative cash flow in Unitech until they're going to be cash flow breakeven. As we said during the first questions, we said that it's going to be $2 billion CapEx within the first three years. And we see that we are going &#x2013; we are not going to be cash neutral or cash balanced until at least two years after that. So it's the fact that no its not going to cover that but relative to the solidity of Telenor even though there is a challenge -- for the financing it's a challenge relative to the negative cash flow coming in from India at the beginning of the project. We feel that Telenor is solid enough to actually be able to handle that negative cash flow in the years to come from our ordinary course of operational free cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then to clarify, when you said movements on the Alfa relationship, what were you thinking about, were you thinking about talks in the direction of resolving the issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any new -- sort of any change in Alfa's position vis-&#xE0;-vis various market speculations and your general ongoing discussions, which you have been telling us you have had on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And there has been no talks principally with Alfa/Altimo people for quite some time on a negotiated solution. And there is no such element going on for the time being. However, during the weekend we made an suggestion to Mickail Fridman on our willingness to participate with resolving the Kyivstar issue by buying their stake for cash. And that was not of interest to him.</p>
          <p>As for the last question of yours the balance between mobile broadband and DSL, is the DSL market maturing in Norway? You might say so, if you'll remember back to the ISDN years, the ISDN population of customer reached slightly below 900,000, 872,000 -- I seem to remember. Whereas in the DSL market the flattening level for DSL for wholesales might be at the slightly lower or as slightly sorry slight higher level around 950 to a million or so. But then you have other technologies, of course, you have cable and you fiber coming in. So where these basically maturing levels are. All in all, is a bit difficult to say.</p>
          <p>Whether mobile broadband basically is cannibalizing DSL, I am not really sure for that as of yet. We could argue though that people are having mobile way of living. Basically, you could think that the Mobile Office is to their convenience. And therefore you don't need. And of course that relates to single persons or other audlts on the move. But when it comes to the family structures, I think we're solidly with the fixed connections from many, many years.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Hans <mark type="inaudible" /> from Oram . I wonder if you can explain what minority shareholders can say or not can say I have the right issues. And what type of majority is required to vote through the rights issue is just 50% or is it a qualified majority and what are that ways are you going to take in the use of minority shareholders ahead of this rights issue? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the milestone of the rights issues that basically the Board has to decide on the terms, but in addition to that we have a majority shareholders who is the government, who actually needs to have their approval in place. Their approval plan part is actually we have go through the parliament of Norway and therefore that is consider to take about -- approximately on two to two and half maybe three months. In parallel to that we're going to work on our -- on the rights issue and then the Board at the end of that phase is going make a decision on the terms and the perspective as such. And then we're going to call to our general assembly in sometimes mid or end of first quarter 2009. And probably going to complete that rights issue during 2009 as such.</p>
          <p>So the major reason for not going more aggressively towards the rights issue is of course that the our major shareholders, major shareholders actually need their authority to actually be a part of that, even though of course as you have seen they have made the conditions that it has to be of course done on marketable terms. That is basically the milestone as such, and therefore it's going to be ample time for us to actually discuss with all the shareholders relative to the process going forward with all the shareholders relative to the process going forward and also the elements that has to be contained in such an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it enough with the 50% acceptance, i.e., is it enough that the government accepts or do you need a qualified majority? Do you need other shareholders on the vote also?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically you need some other shareholders to say yes also, providing the people show up?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given another question -- given the Pakistan is still EBIT or operating profit negative and you've been there for four years or something like that, and it's quite some way to go before you have a decent return on the capital you invest today. Can you once again explain how this can be a better deal than buying back Telenor shares at four and four and a half times earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually as I said there is -- so many ways I can answer that question so I cannot give you more elaborations about the what kind of decisions and what kind elements that has gone into this because there aren't anymore. So the element is that the basically we cannot, relative to comparing it with the third quarter results of Pakistan, which is basically sort of a slight step back relative to the part that we actually see going forward. Our anticipation on Pakistan is still on a long-term level, that we're going come up to a much higher margin and a revenue base. So the element of comparing it to just third quarter Pakistan wouldn't be reasonable relative to the long-term play.</p>

How is your thinking here the impact of your acquisition in India on your opportunities when it comes to strike with Alfa regarding taking over Kyivstar and potentially make a deal around VimpelCom?

          <p>Yes hello. Coming back here to Pakistan where the current development doesn't look that encouraging. What will you do now short-term to lift the margins back towards the 20% level? And if I may follow at the Capital Markets Day you guided for market share above 25% and EBITDA margin in mid-30s by 2010 to 2011 in Pakistan. Do you believe that you will have to revise these figures on the back of this report? And finally, there is a clear slowdown in both Pakistan and Bangladesh and in both these countries there are six operators, have you seen that this slowdown in market growth could lead to consolidation?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it's too early to say that we will revise sort of the longer-term perspective on the Pakistan operation. However, we will be looking at the speed at which we add capacity costs in Pakistan, because of this development. And we will also of course take a look on the CapEx level going forward in light of at least short term, a different profile on the customer number as well as the traffic volumes. Whether these conditions will lead to consolidations, I do think that such conditions will raise that question up some notches not only by us, but also by others. So maybe yes, this will lead to discussions of that to happen in the near future.</p>

          <p>Hi, there, Jakob Bluestone from Merrill Lynch. Three pretty quick questions. Firstly, could you talk a little bit about what sort of mechanism you've put in place in case the relationship with Unitech deteriorate?. Obviously, you've had quite a few difficulties with some of your other partners in your other businesses. So are there any put or pull options or any specific divorce clauses you can clarify? Secondly, you've given guidance for $2 billion of CapEx for first three years and EBITDA breakeven within three years. And I am just wondering could you also guide us what will the cumulative operating losses be in the first three years? So how much EBIT losses will there be until you reach breakeven? And then finally can you just talk a little bit about on the rights issue, what happens if there is insufficient take-up, does the legislation being put forward, will that allow the government to take up more than its fair share? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start on the general side as to partner conflicts. When you embark on a partnership in the way that we've done with Unitech and crossing over the threshold together, as we've done this night, then challenges in partnership is probably not the highest element to discuss. But yes, there are conflict resolution mechanisms in the paperwork around this documentation as it is in any documentation. And so and Jon maybe you can elaborate on a little bit on that as well as the other part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do have the sort of the traditional mechanisms and we have also used our extensive experience in the last couple of years and actually putting them into play. So I do think that yes, we do have drags and tags sometimes and we have the necessary dilution mechanisms relative to funding requirements. But the basic and the major part of this is that we do have a firm majority at the Board with the necessary decisions by the powers at the Board level and we do have a firm definition of the managing director as well as the management. But I do think that the technical mechanisms, we are confident that we also are in place relative to a difference of opinion of strategic directions or any details as such. And I do think it also will be sufficient enough to actually run the company as the head shareholder with ample authorities, both in the general assembly as well as in the Board as well as the management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean just sorry to pressure you on this -- I mean given how important the conflicts have been at Kyivstar, VimpelCom and in other markets as well. I mean are these arbitration proceedings or what are they?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is no any sort of shotgun mechanisms or any options like that. But there are enough mechanisms for us to actually make sure that we can run the industrial strategic agenda and also control in event other owners coming are into the company as such, also having put elements of collateralization and anything else of the assets as such. So I do think it's not a stop for collateralization, but it is -- we have a view and say on that element. So I do think we're taking into consideration of -- who is going to sit in the driving seat in the -- both the operational and strategic questions as well as coming to policies on financial aspects. I do think that that is well covered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and the operating losses in the years one through three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a result of being a bit vague as well as on the distribution and all elements because that's comes down to the core strategy on how we're going to rollout and how quickly going to rollout. We -- at this point in time, we're not ready to do that. I do think that relative to the cash flow element, you probably will be able to calculate that as a result of the how much effect of operating cash flow dilution it will have? So in essence you have enough numbers to actually generally understand the size. But we wouldn't come out with an exact number on the cumulative deficit of EBITDA in the first three years at this point.</p>

          <p>As I said, when you have the CapEx and the dilution on the cash flow, you basically have the two elements prior to the EBITDA. So in that in essence you have the basic the numbers of the accumulated numbers to 2003.</p>

          <p>Hi. Soomit Datta at New Street. Just one question at this stage, please. In the context of India I guess, I am sorry to go back to India, but you're guiding in principle to a sort of CapEx like approach, but EBITDA margins, which are not too far off the existing in industrial plays like Bharti. I'm struggling to reconcile those two things, maybe you could help me understand little bit about the network showing the tower showing implications for your OpEx. Because I would have thought they would be higher than those longer-term margins implied. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The assumptions we have on the tower sharing is that element of, if you compare it with setting up your own ground based tower, it's actually going to reduce the CapEx in the area of 70 to 75%. On building or a tower put up on a building site, on a building, it's probably going to reduce it between 50 to 60%. So that is sort of the range and the element of the effect of the tower sharing relative to CapEx. When it comes to operational cost, it is actually fairly marginal increase in OpEx as a result of the tower sharing, because you are able to actually be much more efficient on all the other suppliers that you actually need to have in a base stations like that. So it's actually only going to add-on about 5 to 10% on the actual cost, the OpEx cost as such. So the element is that you reduced the CapEx substantially and the OpEx is just marginally increased.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so there are no sort of wholesale payments, which you make, which will pass through the P&amp;L to the operator with the towers then? Or are they up to about $0.05...</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Sorry to come back again on the question about the funding for the Indian venture. Just to be able to fully reconcile all the indications you've provided on the free cash flow operating, free cash dilution for the group in '09. If you can please provide your assumptions for CapEx to sales level on the core business of Telenor in 2009 that could be helpful, please, that's my first question. The second one is could you consider selling other assets to fund the expansion in growth. And finally, how much would be the penalty if in the voting process of shareholders? You don't get the two-thirds majority vote allowing you to go for India? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, coming to the CapEx. We basically now say that the CapEx to sales ratio coming into 2009 is going to be in the high 20s. Sales were at the start of phase that is based on, basically general understanding on where Telenor is actually having their revenue. And therefore, you will get a fairly accurate number on the CapEx going into 2009. We've also said that in 2010 it's going to be on the lower 20s. Meaning that is for going basically down the six to seven percentage points during that period of time. And I do think relative to the concerns assessment on 2009 and 2010 of Telenor that would give you the necessary numbers that you really need for CapEx spending going forward. And if you add that up with the 2 billion in dollars over the next three year, I do think that you're going to have a fairly accurate estimate, relative to how that funding is going roll out.</p>

          <p>So while Fredrik gets another battery, I'll go on to the voting power. As I said it's the attending at the General Assembly, that's going vote for the capital increase. The capital increase has a two-thirds majority. And in case the General Assembly do not approve the conditions as such, it has to go back to the Board and we have to revaluate the possibilities of finding the necessary funding to actually keep going in this on that term. The element is that we have not put in financing condition on this agreement as such, so we just have the solid situation and thereby basically coming back to the question that Fredrik started on that we need to find the funding as well as looking at the possibilities of selling assets.</p>

          <p>Last question, Malcolm, Arete Research. Go ahead please.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Three questions please, first of all, it's just on the dividend policy we should maintain, can I just confirm that the underlying operating profit that you'll  be measuring the dividend against will include the dilution from India for the next three years? So we assume that's the lower underlying profit, low dividend? And secondly just funding the Indian venture, can you just give outline the financial position of your partner in India and how &#x2013; I assume that the rollout will be funded on a proportional basis by the two partners, what's cash position there and how they will fund their investment? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to your assumptions on the dilution as a result on the negative EBITDA effects of India, yes, that is going to affect the underlying operating profit that we actually do the estimate between 40 to 60%. So that is correct that's going to be a diluting factor. Coming to the funding in India is of course based on that the capital injection that we are about to do. In addition to that, we assume some project financing as a result of the Indian banks possibility, as well as are assumed that that project financing will be possible to some extent. After that it is of course a pro-rata payment of capital injection from each partner and we have assumed that they will be able to put up their part of the next phase after the project financing in this.</p>
          <p>If in case that happens, won't happen we have the necessary mechanisms in place to actually be able to solve that issue either on our own or for any others that might assist us in doing that. So actually I feel comfortable that if in case they are not able or willing to actually come with necessary funds, we are able to actually find solutions either ourselves or together with others. That will make it possible for us to not have the pressure on the cash flow that we would not like to see if in case it happens.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then does that include a greater equity stake, are you allowed to take a bigger equity stake in the venture I guess no I mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is among the possibilities, but that's not the only one.</p>
