        <plist>
          <p>All right. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our Full-Year Results Presentation. I hope that you had something to eat. I apologize because I know it's a long day and you've had &#x2013; you've already done a number of company's results. But we have, once again, a large number of slides. So I hope that you're sitting comfortably. We'll take you through them slowly, between Nic and I. But it will take probably a better part of an hour.</p>
          <p>So, we are going to present first highlights of our results for 2011. We will then give you an update on our progress towards our 2013 objectives, that we call Growth and Cash, and talk about our performance in terms of future for our businesses, starting with Asia, then Jackson, then the U.K. and M&amp;G. And then I'll hand over to Nic who will cover the financials in more detail before coming back to talk about the outlook. We will then of course take your questions, if you still have any energy left.</p>
          <p>The executive team and a number of key people from our operations across the world are here today and we all look forward to a productive dialogue with you. So I'll begin with the headline numbers which you've seen now, picking out a few. For the first time, we have delivered IFRS profit of over &#xA3;2 billion. We have EEV operating profit of almost &#xA3;4 billion and EEV per share now stands at &#xA3;7.71.</p>
          <p>And we have remitted over &#xA3;1 billion &#x2013; &#xA3;1,105 million of net cash remittances from the businesses to a center, again a first in our history. And the full year dividend has been increased to 25.19 pence per share, which is a 5.6% increase following the 20% of these of last year. It's good to keep in mind that these results have been delivered in an environment that was not benign. We have seen in 2011 significant macroeconomic volatility.</p>
          <p>We have seen long-term interest rates falling to unprecedented levels, which as you know is a particular challenge for insurance companies and Nic will come back to that; and a turbulent year for equity markets. I mean, we said it's successful. It is a statistical quirk that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:29) finished I believe at the same level that it began at <mark type="ph" /> 12.57 (2:32), but between those two points, we saw a huge volatility, particularly in the third quarter. So these are good results in the challenging environment.</p>
          <p>There are two key milestones within the results and I would like to focus on now. One has to do with our IFRS profits and the other one with cash. So let's start with IFRS. For the first time in our company's history, our Asian business is the largest contributor to our IFRS profits. This is an important factor in the valuation you make of our business when you focus on price on admitted multiples and the objective we have of doubling the 2009 profit by 2014 is therefore of strategic importance to us.</p>
          <p>By this metric, our profits in Asia have almost tripled in the last three years; and in 2011 alone, our profits increased by 30%. This growth is the result of a number of actions. Since 2008, I have been very clear on our definition of success, putting more emphasis than previously on IFRS and cash and we've been talking to you about every time with IFRS and cash in the same breath. We also have taken a more strategic view of our earnings with the analysis of the source of earnings, breaking down into insurance profits, REIT profits, spread profits and fee profits and we've used that to drive our business.</p>
          <p>We have enhanced our disclosures in parallel and also ensured that incentives for management teams were consistent with this definition of success. I'd say our teams have risen to the challenge and delivered a clear step up in general as far as profitability of the business and taken a number of actions for that. Barry has driven the transformation of the product mix, we've increased in health and protection, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:16) but these are REIT earnings, higher quality earnings and relatively insulated from financial market movements and give us resilience.</p>
          <p>We have also had an increased focus on new business strain, we started disclosing building IFRS new business strain. We've managed it very proactively. We have driven a growth in policyholder liabilities and we have managed reinforced book very rigorously to deliver expected profits and cash. You add to that operational leverage and you get this type of curve. And all reductions have been implemented across the broad portfolio of our business so this improvement is broad based.</p>
          <p>And I can tell you in 2011, 10 of our 11 countries have seen their IF profits grow. For 9 of them this involves double-digit growth, for nine countries in Asia are double-digit growth in IFRS profit. And 8 countries in Asia had growth in excess of 30% which leads to this very strong performance. So at &#xA3;784 million in 2011, Asia represents more IFRS profit than our group did as a whole a few years ago. That is for us an important milestone with potentially positive implications on our valuation.</p>
          <p>The second important milestone is really cash, about cash. It's that each of our four businesses now contributes material cash remittances to the center. Historically, we have been seen as having one source of cash, the U.K., people who are root cognitive cash cow and one growth engine, Asia.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 results show that actually four of our businesses, all four of our businesses are now materially cash generative and I think that's really important. Asia, Jackson, and M&amp;G and also three of our businesses have significant growth potential in Asia, Jackson and M&amp;G. So on this side, you can see in blue, the cash remittances received from UK Life and those in red are from all the other businesses. In 2006, the blue bar is &#xA3;45 million.</p>
          <p>We got &#xA3;45 million out of the UK after actually making an infusion in the first half. And in the last three years, the UK has contributed more than &#xA3;900 million of cash. So you can compare &#xA3;900 million versus an infusion in 2006, it is a transformation. So these profits on cash has allowed to do very well elsewhere through JNL, Asia and M&amp;G here in red, &#xA3;800 million in 2011 of cash generation.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the total together, we &#x2013; in 2011, we have cash remittances above &#xA3;1 billion, up 18% in the year. And the other point I'd like to make here is that this growth has not been achieved &#x2013; sorry, this cash growth has not been achieved at the expense of business growth and that's a central point, because in our business you can always drive cash if you give up or if you trade-off between growth and cash. But that is why we have called the strategy growth and cash. It's not very imaginative, but it &#x2013; I think it describes very well what we have done. And I have a twist on it, because I say it's growth and cash but it's cash from everybody, as all my colleagues here know. So it's a very fair policy.</p>
          <p>So now, let's take a closer look at our progress towards the growth and cash objectives of 2013. They really for us, more than anything else, summarize what we manage to, what we drive the business to deliver and what we would like to be judged on, okay.</p>
          <p>So, at the end of 2011, we are exactly halfway for a four-year program. We said 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013. So what I'm trying to do here is to give you a half time update on our progress towards the six objectives. And this is when the problem of technological advances; what I feared has happened. And the machine decided to go back to page one. So if you'll bear with me, if you bear with me, I'm manually going to bring it back where it should be and we'll continue, and that was always &#x2013; this is always a risk. Okay. Well I have a backup plan.</p>
          <p>I have a backup plan. I told the person who gave me this this would happen. I was promised it wouldn't, but we can never fully trust what you're told, so here you go. Anyway, so after this high tech start, we're going back to a much lower tech solution, but safer. So, I want to give you a half time update and the update is really, I think is simple. At half time we're on target or ahead of schedule for every one of the six objectives.</p>
          <p>So starting with the three Asian ones, which are NBP, IFRS and cash, as you know. For the first two, IFRS and NBP which we put here, we have achieved 69% of the target for IFRS and 51% of the target for new business profit. For cash, we have delivered &#xA3;206 million in 2011 and we are about 2/3 of the way, of the target of 300 by 2013.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. and the U.K., we have respectively to deliver &#xA3;200 million and &#xA3;350 million. Jackson made a particularly large remittance in 2011 with &#xA3;322 million, which is technically ahead of the 2013 objective, but I'll come back to that later when I look at Jackson. And the U.K. has remitted &#xA3;297 million, and achieved 85% of its 2013 objective. On a group level, we're aiming for &#xA3;3.8 billion of net remittances cumulatively on the 2010, 2013, and at halfway, we are &#x2013; at half time we are 54% of the way, so we're kind of on track. And to put this number in perspective, in perspective cumulatively 2006, 2009 period, we generated &#xA3;2.5 billion, so &#xA3;3.8 billion as an ambition, this is a step change compared to what we were able to produce historically.</p>
          <p>So we did sound progress and our focus on capital allocation has played a key role in achieving these results. Since 2008, we've been talking about the more rigorous and unbiased approach to capital allocation across the businesses basing our decisions primarily on IRRs and payback periods. We have taken a number of actions which have significantly modified the shape and quantum of our investments in new business, if you look at the left side of this chart.</p>
          <p>We have reviewed in the U.K. our individual annuities pricing to optimize new business strain. We have closed our equity release business in the U.K. We have become much more selective about writing both business in the U.K. which introduces the real volatility in our numbers but we're happy to live with that.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we introduced a significantly higher IRR hurdle consistent with the IRRs we achieved organically in other businesses so we want the BPAs to complete the organic opportunities we have elsewhere to get capital. And we also insisted that both deals should be much less capital consumptive in absolute terms which is why you'll see that in some years we have great volumes and in others, not, because if they're not such deals we won't write the business. That's discipline.</p>
          <p>We have closed the plan new business. We have restructured successfully the business in Korea. We have reduced our gig volumes in the U.S. and in 2011 you'll see here we made further improvements to the VA and when combined with initiative to save cost, this has further reduced our new business strain which decreased from &#xA3;300 million to &#xA3;200 million, whilst writing more business. So all these has had a significant cumulative impact. The quantum of capital that we invest has been reduced, leading to increased capital efficiency, increased new business profit and increased cash generation. At the end of 2010, I believe and I think, unfortunately, I told many of you that we had reached the point of maximum capital efficiency. So in 2011, the teams worked very hard to prove me wrong and to drive further improvement. So we consumed &#xA3;241 million less than in 2008 and delivered &#xA3;946 million more of profit. It's this more of less <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:24) &#x2013; more for less.</p>
          <p>We are comfortable with the fate of these investments in new business. If you look inside we have a small &#xA3;553 million bar. For the first time, more than half our investment went into Asia and that's a transformation. And also, you can see that the capital consumption in the U.S. is decreasing at a time when margins are normalized.</p>
          <p>So I would now like take a few minutes to talk about the businesses in turn and I'll start with Asia. It is APE in Asia over 12 years. We have a track record of year-on-year growth in Asia. And our 2011 performance adds another year to the series. Over the last 20 years, we have expanded our business, and today, our operations in the region are vast. We serve more than 11 million customers who collectively hold over 16 million Prudential policies.</p>
          <p>We have well established operations in 11 countries in Asia, and in six of these markets, on the left here we are the number one player. The diversity of our operation in Asia is a source of great strength and that's what I also insist on in this slide, because it provides with the scale and resilience to continue to drive the business for profitable growth. The sheer scale of PCA means that inevitably there will be times when we must overcome local challenges. For instance, in 2009, we faced challenges in Korea. We restructured the business to focus on our proprietary agency distribution and today in Korea, we are the smaller but much more profitable business which is now profitable on an IFRS basis, with great new business profit.</p>
          <p>In 2010, you all know that there was a major regulatory reform in India, which had a negative impact on the market. We have been working hard with our partner to address the resulting business challenge and in the fourth quarter of 2011, our sales in India went up by 33% quarter-on-quarter marking the return of a business to a more healthy position.</p>
          <p>So with diversification in Asia allows us to continue to grow profitably at the regional level whatever transition we may face in specific markets at any point in time and that is a unique strength. So you can see from the numbers we are generating more new business profit than the other leading players in the region together with the highest margins as shown on the slide. So looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to continue to generate significant and rapidly growing new business profit at high margins.</p>
          <p>One reason for that confidence is that we are in the right markets. We are focused on the seven markets of Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. What we refer to often as our sweet spot and you'll hear that coming back a number of times today between Nic and myself and you can see here in blue that this focus has paid off very well for us.</p>
          <p>But I'd like to take a moment to talk about why the sweet spot and why we believe it is strategically meaningful by going over a few macro numbers with you. These seven countries have a cumulative GDP of $2 trillion. It's actually $2,027 billion. And I'll also say when we did realize this, we were all a bit surprised. We knew it was a large number, but it is really a large number. And a population of 530 million which would make it the third largest country in the world if it were country. And with GDP which is larger than Canada and close to France or the U.K. or Italy would make it a G7 country.</p>
          <p>So in simple terms, we are number one in the G7 countries, but it's a G7 country that has the interesting characteristic of growing strongly, unlike the other G7 countries. The GDP growth in 2010 in this set of countries was $361 billion. Put it in perspective, the GDP growth in the U.S. the same year was 250. These are IMS statistics, right. This is why we are doing well and this is why we're making so much money. We are the leading insurance company in a set of countries that is already large, attractive and fast growing, as illustrated by our rank that you can see here on the right-hand side.</p>
          <p>So taking one of those markets, which is really looms large here in the red, Indonesia. The country has a population of 238 million, the fourth most populous country in the world and is among the 20 largest economies in the world, with an average age that's an amazing number, of 28 years. So the population is young, set to continue growing to around 265 million in 2020, a net increase of almost 30 million people with an insurance penetration of 1%. So growth opportunity possibilities are vast. They're also vast in the nascent markets of Philippines and Vietnam, where similarly to Indonesia, we have strong positions. We're now number one in both Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong and Singapore on the other are very different markets to Indonesia or Vietnam. They do have relatively small populations but their citizens are very wealthy by industry standard and their positions as regional financial centers mean that they play a critical role in the region. The opportunities available to us in Hong Kong and Singapore are very significant.</p>
          <p>So presence in all of these attractive Asian markets alone is not a guarantee of success, many other companies operate in the same market. A great deal of our progress in the region is due to the fact that we have the right operating model. So if we start with our products, demand for savings and protection products in Asia is high, as personal worth levels throughout the region increase and many countries do not have a well developed social safety net. Asia's population of high net worth individuals, stated in the international definition, as people with investable assets over $1 million, is now more than 3.3 million. The equivalent number for Europe is 3.1 million and for the U.S. 3.4 million. So if recent growth rates are maintained, Asia's population of high net worth individuals will soon be the largest in the world.</p>
          <p>Wealth creation and asset accumulation across Asia, however, are not limited to the very rich. Throughout Asian society, the middle class population is growing and is increasingly able to save for long-term personal aspiration and family growth. We have a diverse product range that is well suited to meeting the demands of Asia's rising middle class. And our focus on health and protection insurance helps Asian governments meet their targets for improving the insurance coverage of the population.</p>
          <p>Health and protection premiums as a percentage of APE reached 30% in 2011, up 3 percentage points from 2010 and more than six times in absolute terms of sales five years ago. In addition, our emphasis on regular premium policies, with over 90% of our APE coming from regular premium, encourages the right behavior from our customers. Regular premiums incentivize them to save for the long term, helping them to smooth out the peaks and troughs of the market, while providing us with a resilient source of profitable growth that is less susceptible to market movements and single premium business.</p>
          <p>Finally, demand for all of these products, of course, could change. With a high degree of correlation to the economic cycle, in particular, interest rates and equity markets. The point here for us is that we have a full suite of products to meet our customers' demands regardless of where we are in the cycle. And this product suite is critical to our competitiveness.</p>
          <p>It's good to have the products. It's even better to sell them and we sell these products successfully because we have, we believe, the right people and the right partners. Many of you saw some of our agents in their entry lessons a few months ago in K.L., in Kuala Lumpur. Well, they are the heart of our business and our business model. We ended 2011 with 228,000 agents. Agency continues to be our largest channel. But Prudential agents differentiate themselves from the competition and are the most productive in the region in terms of new business profit per agent which has otherwise been the metric by which we drive the network.</p>
          <p>New agent recruitment activities have delivered continued growth in our total number of agents over the last 12 months and productivity trends remain favorable. Levels of activities have risen. Product being sold has become increasingly profitable. Average agency case sizes in the final quarter in Q4 2011, so were best month-on-month increases that we have seen all year. So that overall the performance of the agency force is strong.</p>
          <p>Moving on in blue, to our second major channel, banks, we are working with the right partners. In 2006, our sales through banks contributed just 1/4 of the sales through agency. In 2011, they contributed 46% of the agency sales &#x2013; of the level of sales of agency and they have more than tripled in five years.</p>
          <p>2011 was a record-breaking year for our relationship with Standard Charter which saw a 30% increase in sales year-on-year. And the relationship with UOB continues to flourish. In 2011, sales more than doubled compared to 2010, so we doubled in one year and the relationship continues to perform well ahead of the level we had initially planned for. The extension to Malaysia has made a strong start and with many initiatives planned this year, we are confident of further growth in 2012.</p>
          <p>So the momentum we have across Asia is clear and has generated the performance shown on this slide. On this slide, over four years quarter-by-quarter side-by-side analysis, I mean, it's interesting because you see that in red, which is 2011, we had a record performance in each quarter this year and this was again tough comparatives because 2010 was a very good year.</p>
          <p>We delivered a particularly strong fourth quarter. I know there was some speculation on that particularly strong fourth quarter with APE up 18%. And it's interesting if you look at the red bubbles, you see actually accelerating momentum for the year; 2%, 6%, 14%, 18%, quarter-on-quarter. So we believe we have an acceleration in Asia not a deceleration.</p>
          <p>In Q4 2011 was our first ever quarter of both &#xA3;500 million of APE, which is really a number which will take us longer to obtain. But that's only volume. We prefer NBP, which is really our main growth metric and the numbers are very pleasing. You see a 27% increase in NBP in Q4, which we have very little to add to that, good result. And we are also pleased to say that the momentum that we generated over the course of 2011 has allowed us to make a very positive start to 2012 as far as we know and as we said in our statement this morning.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So bringing all of this together and that we will be thinking of for Asia, summarizing on one slide on our three key metrics, new business profit, IFRS and cash, you can see that we've made really good progress on each of them and Nic will come back with more detail on some of that, but it's a picture we're reasonably happy with.</p>
          <p>So moving now to the U.S., I will &#x2013; this is a chart that Mike has used. See, I'm going &#x2013; I'm talking about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:30), Mike has used in Kuala Lumpur which was interesting to multi-sales, right, of VAs. And I have updated it because I know that you came to see what happened to the monthly sales in Q4 and Q3. If you remember that in May we said that we were taking action on pricing. We said this would go through in August. And you can see from September what has happened there as a combination of the actions we've taken but also of the S&amp;P, which was under pressure and quite volatile at the time.</p>
          <p>And we believe that the action we have taken was fully justified because it was reflecting what we believe is a new economic environment and a new interest rate environment. And our teams have been able to implement those actions without figuring any fire sales which is actually quite an achievement from our U.S. team.</p>
          <p>We have always been focused on IRRs and proactive on pricing and product features. And this has been particularly visible, we believe, for a market turmoil of the last three or four years. It is worth noting that our IRRs on VAs in 2011 were slightly higher than in 2010, and that's what we manage the business to.</p>
          <p>So as we move forward, we will continue to take a proactive approach, setting our prices and product features at conservative levels and our volume to reflect both a competitive environment, i.e., the behavior for our competitors which we have little control over, and the performance of U.S. equity markets.</p>
          <p>So on the next slide, I have just a summary of Jackson's performance over the last few years. On the left, you see the growth in assets that we have achieved as a result of our extension in VAs, which has led to growth in underlying profits. And this growth has been delivered in a counter-cyclical manner as we have spent it following a period of stock market turbulence that led to balance sheet problems for many of our peers.</p>
          <p>This growth has been, we believe, delivered at the right time in the economic cycle. To give you a number, at the end of 2011, 63% of Jackson's business was issued at level lower than the S&amp;P was at that time, and with the equity market rally that we have had since then, this situation has only improved further. We will not hesitate to be counter-cyclical again if and when returns went below our target rates of return.</p>
          <p>Throughout this period of financial market turbulence and macroeconomic uncertainty, Jackson has maintained a robust capital position with an RBC ratio consistently over 400%. Our hedging programs continue to perform effectively and policyholder behavior on VAs is tracking in line with our expectations and Nic will give you more color on both the RBC and the policyholder behavior later.</p>
          <p>So the significant growth that Jackson has achieved combined with its robust balance sheet and focus on value of our volume is now facilitating significantly higher net remittances to group. As I said earlier in my presentation, Jackson made a cash remittance of &#xA3;422 million in 2011. But if you look at this on an annualized basis over three years, they have remitted an average of &#xA3;150 million over 2009, 2010 and 2011. So we're on about 75% in my mind of the way to achieve the objective of &#xA3;200 million by 2013. So, the relevant number is really &#xA3;150 million versus &#xA3;200 million.</p>
          <p>So, moving now to the U.K. The achievements of the U.K. team in terms of cash and capital management, we've had over the last few years, have contributed significantly to our progress and I wanted to illustrate that in one chart, on the left. What you have there is in red new business strain and in blue new business profit. And that tells a really, really interesting story in the U.K. I've mentioned the repositioning of the annuity pricing. I've mentioned the attitude to bulk deals.</p>
          <p>And you can see what it has achieved is that, whilst we drastically reduced the new business strain, we have been able to produce about the same level of new business profit, which translates into very much improved returns on capital invested. And we believe that today we are generating the highest IRRs in the UK Life sector, thanks to this picture.</p>
          <p>So over the last few years, the U.K. has maintained a strong capital position. You can see the inherited estate here in red, that's &#xA3;6.1 billion, which is a backbone really of our strength in the U.K. and has delivered remittances equivalent to 85% of its cash objective for 2013 and it remains firmly on track to reach its target. And what I would say about the one-offs is that the <mark type="ph" /> over-huge (27:58) budget that the U.K. brings us is really a secure and safe source of cash and we never appreciate that more than in the downturn. And we saw in 2008 and 2009 the optionality provided to the group by the ownership of the U.K., it was huge, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:12).</p>
          <p>So moving now to M&amp;G. M&amp;G continued to perform very, very well in 2011, which was a challenging year for asset managers. Net flows in the U.K. were &#xA3;4.3 billion in UK Retail and they are industry leading. The nearest competitor in the number two generated &#xA3;1.8 billion net sales last year, so less than half M&amp;G's level. And we have been number one in UK Retail for the last 13 consecutive quarters and our market share of total UK Retail sales for 2011 was 22.8% on a net basis, putting us well ahead of the competition. Over the last four years, and you'll see that on the right there, 2008 to 2011, M&amp;G has risen from being the fifth largest player in the U.K., in the UK Retail market in terms of funds under management, to being the second largest, and our corresponding assets have almost tripled over this period to over &#xA3;35 billion, that means a strong performance.</p>
          <p>M&amp;G's strong track record of asset accumulation and investment performance is translating into very favorable returns for Prudential shareholders. These highlighted by this slide, which shows the evolution of M&amp;G IFRS operating profit over time. In 2011, M&amp;G reported record profits, up 22% to &#xA3;301 million, which reflected the continued growth in managed assets and improvement in the cost to income ratio that you can see in the bubbles at the bottom. And in 2011 M&amp;G contributed 15% of group profits and 19% of net cash remittances.</p>
          <p>And this is my final slide. I finish on the dividend. As you can see here, we were able to increase the dividend throughout the financial crisis. The blue line is the FTSE over the period. Last year, we raised the dividend higher by 20%, recognizing the significant improvement achieved in group cash flow. And in 2011, we have declared this morning a total dividend of 25.19 pence per share, returning to a prudent rate of dividend growth of around 5%.</p>
          <p>So before I pass on to Nic, I'd like to summarize my three key messages this afternoon for you. First, our Asian platform is now the largest contributor to IFRS profits. Second, that all of our businesses are now delivering material and sustainable amounts of cash to the group, it's my cash from everybody. And third, that we remain on track to achieve our 2013 Growth and Cash objectives. And with that, I will now pass it over to Nic.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Tidjane. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll stick on low-tech notes. Let's start with the financial headlines for 2011, which I've summarized on this slide and they are now too familiar themes of growth and cash. In 2011, we have built on our strong recent performance. And once again, all of our key growth indicators have moved forward positively. This is the third year in a row that we have reported record profits and these results have been achieved despite significant market headwinds in the second half of the year. In terms of cash, we have increased free surplus generation by 16% and net remittances to group by 18%. This is the most tangible evidence of the progress that we have made in executing our strategy which has delivered higher earnings and is now translating into more cash.</p>
          <p>Behind these 2011 headlines are some highly significant trends which I will highlight as I go through my presentation. These trends illustrate the ongoing improvements in the quality of our earnings and underline the confidence that we have in the progress &#x2013; underline the prospects that we have &#x2013; underline our confidence in the prospects of our business as we move forward into 2012.</p>
          <p>A feature of these results is that they have been delivered against a low interest rate backlog, traditionally a challenging environment for insurers. The resilience of both our results and capital metrics proves that we have successfully navigated the business in this environment. I will provide you with more color on how we have achieved this in my presentation but in summary on new business, we have been fanatical about optimizing the balance between value creation and capital consumption and have adhered strictly to our IRR hurdle rates.</p>
          <p>On IFRS, we have made further progress in diversifying our sources of earnings, and have continued to benefit from significant positive net flows. On free surplus and cash, the strong flow from our highly capital-generative business has outpaced the muted effects of the low interest rate environment, and the high level of our free surplus stock has allowed cash to move more freely.</p>
          <p>And finally on capital, our ongoing hedge effectiveness and our modest shareholder exposure to the Eurozone has ensured that our IGD, our U.K. with profit estate and Jackson's RBC ratio have remained strong.</p>
          <p>So let's start with new business profit, our primary measure of growth in life insurance. At a group level, we reported a 6% increase to &#xA3;2,151 million, equivalent to a margin of 58% in line with last year. We delivered this increase in spite of the lower levels of capital invested in new business, which means that our 2011 IRRs were the highest ever achieved.</p>
          <p>In Asia, new business profits increased by 19% to &#xA3;1,076 million and our margin advanced by five points to 65%. We continue to prioritize capital allocation to those products and geographies that offer the highest returns measured by reference to IRRs. We had a strong finish to the year with NBP increasing by 27% in the fourth quarter boosted by Health and Protection, which made up 34% of sales in the quarter. As a result, all seven of our operations in the Southeast Asian sweet spot delivered record new business profit in 2011.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., our NBP was up 7% to &#xA3;815 million, with variable annuities once again remaining our core focus. The 140 basis point drop in U.S. treasury yields created an 8 percentage point drag on the total margin. The U.S. team defended the product economics by taking pricing actions in late 2010 and again in mid-2011, which meant that the overall margin contraction was contained to just 1 percentage point.</p>
          <p>Therefore by remaining disciplined in our approach to balancing risk, value and capital, we have preserved direct finance IRRs, kept margins well above historic levels and increased our overall new business profit.</p>
          <p>Turning to the U.K., in 2011, there were fewer wholesale opportunities that met our strict financial criteria resulting in a lower level of wholesale activity in this area compared to 2010. At a retail level, new business profit declined by 10% to &#xA3;231 million. This was due to lower volumes of individual annuities in 2011 following changes to the minimum retirement age of the previous year.</p>
          <p>While this shift in business made cash translated into a lower retail margin of 32%, the IRR on the business that we back with shareholder capital is higher than before, above &#x2013; comfortably above 20% and remains in my view, best in class.</p>
          <p>Staying with new business profit, I want to take a moment to illustrate the underlying progress that we have made on this important growth metric. I do this by looking at the key drivers of the movement in NBP between the two periods. On the left in the gray column, you have the 2010 NBP translated at constant exchange rates, which as you will appreciate, was based on our view of future investment returns prevailing at that time.</p>
          <p>One year later, as a result of the drop in long-term yields, our expectation of future investment returns are lower and this has the effect of reducing the starting point for the year-on-year comparison by &#xA3;103 million shown in the light blue bar.</p>
          <p>Now in the next three blocks, you can see more clearly the underlying drivers of growth in new business profit, which were &#xA3;193 million from higher sales, &#xA3;64 million from favorable changes to country, product, and channel mix and &#xA3;77 million from pricing changes implemented to sustain returns above our hurdle rates which brings NBP to &#xA3;2,122 million excluding bulks in 2011. Not shown on the slide is the contribution to NBP from pure insurance products which in 2011 was &#xA3;666 million representing nearly a third of the total having grown by 25% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we have driven this metric forward strongly despite the market effects and have improved its quality with a higher content from pure insurance.</p>
          <p>Moving to IFRS earnings, our headline operating profit was up 7% to &#xA3;2,070 million. Our Life businesses reported a headline increase in operating profit of 2% despite the market headwinds in the second half of 2011 and the previously signed posted effect of the U.S. back charge. To provide you with a better appreciation of some of the key underlying trends, I analyze this performance by region and by source in the next few slides.</p>
          <p>Looking at the analysis by region, and starting with Asia shown in red, Life IFRS profit increased by 32% to &#xA3;704 million, Asia is now the largest contributor to the group's IFRS profit, and for the first time, all Asian Life operations have made a positive contribution to the results.</p>
          <p>Moving to the U.S., Jackson's headline IFRS operating profit was down by 17% but as you can see in the breakout box on the slide, this was entirely due to the anticipated accounting impact relating to deferred acquisition costs. We flagged at the half year that DAC amortization will be temporarily higher than normal in 2011 as we effectively repay the benefit accrued in 2008 from our use of the mean reversion methodology.</p>
          <p>For the full year, this repayment amounted to &#xA3;166 million and you can see that in the box. Furthermore, in line with our published sensitivities, we incurred an additional back charge of &#xA3;66 million as the actually equity returns lagged on mean reversion assumption. Stripping out these items, Jackson's underlying gross profit increased by 13% reflecting the strong separate account asset growth achieved during the year. In the U.K., the modest increase in Life operating profit to &#xA3;683 million disguises a stronger performance once the contribution from bulks is separated out as illustrated in the breakout box.</p>
          <p>Turning to the sources of IFRS earnings and starting with the overall shape on this next slide. We have continued to make progress in diversifying our earnings space and in improving its resilience. As you can see on this slide, you can see on this slide that insurance margin shown in red is now a greater proportion of the total and is increasing fast in absolute terms. It now accounts for 23% of earnings, contributing nearly &#xA3;750 million to the IFRS result. This is a high quality source of earnings as Tidjane has said as it is relatively immune to the investment market volatility.</p>
          <p>You can also see that fee business in the middle blue has increased by 26% driven by a focus on VAs in Jackson and on unit-linked in Asia. Spread income in the light blue has also increased overall, but now forms a smaller proportion of the total, which is a positive development as this is the most capital intensive source of earnings.</p>
          <p>As we move forward, we expect the proportion from fee income and insurance to increase further over time, securing a life insurance bolt-on in the U.S. which remains an objective would augment the insurance element of the earnings, further enhancing its diversity and resilience.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to take a brief look at the sources of earnings for each of our business and starting with Asia, you can see in the top left of the slide that the total Life income has increased by 19% to &#xA3;1,959 million. Expenses have also grown in the period but at a slower rate of 13%. As a result, we're seeing the strong influence of operational leverage within these results.</p>
          <p>Below towards the right of the slide, you can see that the technical and other margin is up 19% to &#xA3;1,676 million. And this source remains the key driver of our Asian income. It includes the profits that we make from our insurance business which increased by 22% to &#xA3;477 million reflecting the growth in the book and positive claims experienced.</p>
          <p>It also includes the margin that we made from premium deductions to cover costs which is higher at &#xA3;1,199 million in line with the growth in Asia's premium revenue. Moving to the U.S., I referenced earlier the underlying improvement in the performance of the business and you can see this on the top left in the slide. Jackson reported a 14% in Life income to &#xA3;1,725 million outpacing the 9% increase in expenses and like Asia, it is generating positive operational leverage. Spread income shown on the left has increased by 5% to &#xA3;730 million and is equivalent to a spread of 258 basis points higher than last year.</p>
          <p>By taking proactive action to reduce crediting rates across the book during 2011, we have mitigated the effects of lower interest rates. However, a continuation of the current level of interest rates would result in a gradual decline in spread income bringing this close to the 200 basis point mark over the next four years.</p>
          <p>Moving along to the right, you can see that fee income has increased by 34% to &#xA3;680 million. This increase is in line with the growth in Jackson's separate account balances, which in 2011 were boosted by &#xA3;7 billion of positive net flows.</p>
          <p>I have already commented on the DAC effect, so I will not repeat this on the slide. I can confirm that as we indicated in the &#x2013; at the November investor conference, we will be adopting the new U.S. DAC account renewals from next year and we will be restating this year's numbers to reflect the retrospective effects of this change. We have provided you with full disclosure of the before and after effects of this change in your packs. I would refer you to those pages. The impact on our group earnings and on our IFRS shareholder funds is in line with our previous guidance to the market, which I have summarized in the bottom right of this slide for ease of reference.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., our main source of income, our annuities &#x2013; our main sources are annuities and with-profits. Spread income on the left was broadly unchanged at &#xA3;247 million with higher profits on individual annuities offsetting the lower contribution from bulk. The income from with-profits, shown on the right, was lower at &#xA3;293 million principally reflecting the business maturity profile.</p>
          <p>Finally on IFRS profits, I want to share with you a slide, which illustrates the momentum that we have a group &#x2013; as a group on this metric. By taking total income less total expenses before the effective tax, the chart shows how our Life IFRS profits would look if we simply expensed all of our acquisition costs in the year in which they were incurred. In effect, this chart gives us an approximation on how our life insurance cash profits look since 2008.</p>
          <p>This analysis demonstrates the very strong pickup in Life income over the short period, shown in the light blue bar, increasing 1.6 times from &#xA3;2.9 billion to &#xA3;4.6 billion. This reflects two key drivers: one, the strongly positive Life loans we have achieved over this period; and two, our very deliberate focus on products and geographies with highly attractive profit signatures such as Health &amp; Protection in Asia.</p>
          <p>Total expenses, shown in the dark blue bars, have also increased, driven by acquisition cost but at a much lower rate. The net effect is a near doubling of cash profits over these three years, reflecting a combination of powerful economics, but also operational leverage. Asia's contribution and momentum shown in red may surprise some of you, as logically a fast-growing business needs to recycle cash profits to finance its rising acquisition costs.</p>
          <p>Factors such as our scale, our proprietary distribution, and our disciplined approach to product design have all contributed to this momentum that is depicted for Asia on this basis, and are all important underpins to Asia's ability to continue to deliver both growth and cash.</p>
          <p>Moving to our asset management and our other non-Life businesses, these have delivered an 18% in IFRS operating profit to &#xA3;501 million. M&amp;G is the main contributor to this total, reporting its higher set of profits up 22% to &#xA3;301 million. As Tidjane has already covered, this achievement reflects continued growth in the value of managed assets and ongoing improvements in the cost to income ratio.</p>
          <p>Other income and expenses shown in the bottom part of this slide were broadly unchanged. You can see in the breakout box the ongoing costs incurred to implement the requirements of Solvency II and we anticipate an equivalent level of spend in 2012.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the results on an embedded value basis. As you can see from the chart on the left, total Life profit is higher by 5% to &#xA3;4,043 million, equivalent to a return on opening of embedded value of 16%. The increase is again driven by Asia, up 22% to &#xA3;1,759 million which is now the largest contributor on this metric also for the first time. Our U.S. and U.K. businesses reported modest declines in EEV profits. This reflects our practice of using the lower 2010, 2011 economic assumptions to calculate the unwind on the opening embedded value. The 140 and 150 basis point drops in U.S. and U.K. yields have therefore depressed the in-force profitability of both businesses in 2011 relative to the previous year.</p>
          <p>This effect is more clearly illustrated in the top right-hand chart by looking at the part which is labeled unwind. The growth in our business which have ordinarily delivered a &#xA3;200 million increase, broadly a &#xA3;200 million increase in the unwind, but the market effects have negated this resulting in a broadly flat year-on-year trend.</p>
          <p>As was the case last year, we saw a continuation of net positive experience compared to our operating assumptions. You can see this in the breakout box on the right which shows &#xA3;347 million of experienced profits achieved in 2011. In addition, we have taken a &#xA3;103 million benefit from factoring a modest proportion of this positive experience into our underlying assumptions.</p>
          <p>This next slide analyzes the experience and assumption change profits by business. As you can see all three regions have delivered a net positive result in 2011. In Asia, our overall embedded value remains robust. The main negative in 2011 was the charge relating to persistency and partial withdrawals which amounted to &#xA3;130 million. In fact, &#xA3;118 million of this total related to Malaysia. With all other businesses reporting a very modest &#xA3;12 million negative which, for these businesses, represents a big improvement evidencing the significant progress made on customer retention initiatives. In Malaysia, the negative experience is in fact contained to a specific savings rider which offers customers the option to withdraw cash without disturbing the flows of the underlying host product.</p>
          <p>Over the last two years, we have experienced higher than anticipated withdrawals on this rider particularly from the group of customers sitting on high capital gains. We have now adjusted our partial withdrawal assumptions for this group to more closely reflect the actual experience. I should emphasize that whilst the withdrawals from this rider are higher than expected, the existence of this option has delivered better overall customer retention. By way of illustration, 99% of the policies that have a partial withdrawal continue to remain in force.</p>
          <p>Turning to the &#xA3;200 million positive for Asia, &#xA3;184 million of this reflects the continuation of favorable mortality and morbidity claims experienced particularly in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
          <p>Jackson's experience continues to reflect the positive spread effect of swap transactions entered into last year. It is also pleasing to see that this business has continued to generate other operating profits despite the tough 2011 macroeconomic backlog. The same is also true of the UK where the main benefit came from the impact of reductions in the UK corporation tax rate.</p>
          <p>Before I move on to capital, I would like to briefly summarize the movement in &#x2013; of items below operating profit for both IFRS and EEV. From an IFRS point of view, you see that the impact of the investment variances has been modest during 2011 at negative &#xA3;0.1 billion after tax.</p>
          <p>The ongoing effectiveness of our VA hedging program coupled with our close matching of annuity assets and liabilities from both a cash and a duration perspective meant that our 2011 earnings were relatively insensitive to the drop in interest rates. Therefore, our IFRS net profit for the year amounted to a positive &#xA3;1.5 billion, equivalent to 59 pence per share.</p>
          <p>As you can see further down the table, we've benefited from unrealized gains on Jackson's fixed income portfolio of &#xA3;0.3 billion after tax. And after deducting the cash dividend payments made in the year, our retained earnings amounted to &#xA3;1.1 billion increasing our IFRS equity by 14% to &#xA3;9.1 billion. From an EEV point of view, investment variances were negative &#xA3;0.8 billion after-tax. This is primarily the result of the flat to negative stock market returns in 2011 which meant that we did not achieve our equity returner function. EEV profit for the year was nevertheless a positive &#xA3;2.1 billion and after the dividend payment, our retained earnings on this space is &#x2013; was positive &#xA3;1.4 billion to finish the year, 8% higher at &#xA3;19.6 billion equivalent to 771 pence per share. The key message here is the resilience of our total earnings to market volatility which have seen our shareholders funds continue to move forward positively.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn to cash and capital. Let's start by taking a look at the evolution of free surplus which over the course of the year has increased from &#xA3;3.3 billion shown in the gray bar on the left to &#xA3;3.4 billion shown on the right. As you move from left to right, you can see the &#xA3;2,536 million which represents the underlying free surplus generated by our existing book of business with material contributions from all the businesses. We used &#xA3;553 million to write new business which is equivalent to a reinvestment rate of 22% below the 27% rate that we reported in 2010. This reduction reflects both the steps taken to improve capital consumption that Tidjane has already covered as well as a particularly favorable 2011 geography and product mix. Changes to this mix may cause the rate to increase as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Further along, you can see that market effects had a negative impact of &#xA3;531 million which was nevertheless comfortably covered by the operating free surplus generated in the year. Businesses remitted &#xA3;1,105 million which meant that pretty much all of the 2011 free surplus generated net of market effects was upstream to close the &#xA3;3.4 billion. The key messages here are one, that the business continues to be highly capital generative after financing growth and two, that the high stock of free surplus has meant that despite the adverse market impact, regulators have not restricted the flow of cash to group which at &#xA3;1.1 billion was the highest ever.</p>
          <p>Last year, we provided you with some new disclosures relating to the undiscounted new business and this monetization profile for each of our businesses. This year we have repeated the disclosures and in the case of the in-force we have extend these further to analyze the movement between the two year-end profiles.</p>
          <p>On this slide, the dark blue bars represent the end 2010 this monetization profile as reported last year. The grey bar on the left shows the actual that monetized in 2011, which at &#xA3;2.1 billion was higher than the expected &#xA3;1.9 billion due to positive operating experience. The light blue bars represent the updated profile for the end 2010 in-force one year later.</p>
          <p>As you can see, it is marginally lower than before by about &#xA3;0.1 billion each year. This reflects the impact of a 1% to 1.5% downward revision in future expected returns caused by the drop in yields globally. This in turn reduces our future profit expectations on unit length, separate accounts and with profits business where our income is influenced by future investment returns.</p>
          <p>The point I want to emphasize though is resilience. If you consider how big and how significant the interest rate drop has been, the decline in our expected free surplus profile is relatively modest. This reflects the defensive nature of our book and the fact that a significant proportion of this free surplus relates to insurance which is relatively immune to market movement. It also reflects the near absence of traditional interest rate guarantee business.</p>
          <p>When we now add the free surplus from the 2011 new business shown in red we have an overall profile that is higher than the one that we started with. This picture is a further illustration of the resilience of our model, the momentum of the business and reinforces our confidence and our ability to deliver our 2013 targets.</p>
          <p>Looking at the balance sheet, the message here is simple. We remain strongly capitalized and defensively positioned. The group's IGD surplus at the end of December is estimated at &#xA3;4 billion, equivalent to a cover of 275%.</p>
          <p>I appreciate that this is a Solvency I ratio but I'm afraid that at this stage we cannot provide you with a Solvency II ratio given the fluidity of the draft guidance. Let me reassure that we're working very hard to shape the right outcome for our business, our customers and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our central cash resources now stand at &#xA3;1.2 billion, we have a strong cash and liquidity position and the next call on our debt is not until 2014. We maintained a defensive credit position throughout the group in 2011. In the U.S. net unrealized gains at the end of the year have increased to &#xA3;2.1 billion and impairments in Jackson over the course of the year were only &#xA3;62 million.</p>
          <p>We have maintained our prudent stance in relation to UK annuity credit default reserves which at the end of 2011 stood at &#xA3;2 billion. Across the board, our balance sheet is conservatively positioned. Jackson's hedging program continues to perform very effectively and policyholder behavior on variable annuity is tracking in line with our assumptions. And as you know, we have minimal shareholder exposure to European peripheral, sovereign and banking dept, but let's take a closer look at these last few points in the next slides.</p>
          <p>Jackson maintained a strong RBC since the financial crisis and has ended 2011 with a ratio of 429%. In 2011, we saw volatile equity markets and a significant drop in long-term yields, but our resilient hedging program has helped mitigate the impact of these market effects. The growth in the asset base since 2008 has enabled Jackson to generate higher amounts of capital each year. We started the year with a stat capital base of $4.4 billion and through 2011, our capital formation has been strong. Jackson generated sufficient stat profits in the year to cover both the $0.5 billion remittance to group and provide risk capital to support business growth. The market effects increased the value of our living and death benefit guarantee reserves, but our macro-hedging program was effective in mitigating these increases and we closed the year at a broadly unchanged level of stat capital.</p>
          <p>Now in reporting our year-end RBC ratio of 429%, we have elected to retain the permitted practice for interest rate swaps, which has the effect of carrying these swaps at cost. As a result, $475 million of positive mark on these swap marks on the swaps are excluded from the calculation. If we were to include these positive marks, the end 2011 RBC ratio would increase to 482% which is broadly in line with the equivalent ratio at the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>At the Investor Conference in K.L., we said that we would provide you with sensitivities relating to policyholder behavior in our U.S. variable annuity business. Before covering the sensitivities, let me just comment on the current lapse in utilization assumption. Our philosophy is to both price and reserve conservatively assuming that policyholders will behave very efficiently. The methods that we use to track and analyze emerging experience, benchmark favorably when compared to those of our peers. And finally our actual lapse in utilization experience across the VA book continues to track within our pricing and reserving assumptions.</p>
          <p>The chart on this slide shows the impact on both IFRS equity and on U.S. statutory capital of stressing policyholder behavior assumptions in a very severe manner. The red bars illustrate the impact of halving the lapse rates for in-the-money policies from our already conservative levels which would mean that the ultimate lapse rates for significantly in-the-money policies are less than 2%; clearly an extremely low level. This would have an indicative impact of $310 million on IFRS equity and $365 million on U.S. stat capital.</p>
          <p>In the blue bars, you see the impact of increasing utilization rates across the board by an absolute 10% to bring these to the 90% level. This would have an indicative impact of $160 million on IFRS equity and $375 million on U.S. statutory.</p>
          <p>Therefore, even in the event of an extreme deterioration in policyholder behavior, the impact on capital and shareholders' equity would be manageable. This is because our assumptions are and always have been set at conservative levels. And because we have always focused on GMWB living benefits which we believe have significant less risk of adverse policyholder behavior than other forms of living benefit variable annuities.</p>
          <p>In my final slide, I provide you with an update on our shareholder exposure to sovereign and banking debt in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. You can see that our total exposure remains small at only &#xA3;372 million, and I would remind you that these holdings fit primarily in our UK Annuity business which is carrying &#xA3;2 billions of credit default reserves.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, Prudential has delivered another strong performance in 2011 across all of our financial metrics. What is particularly pleasing is that behind the headlines, there are some highly significant trends which evidence the quality, consistency and resilience of our earnings and underline our confidence in the future prospects of our business.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will now hand you back to Tidjane.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Nic. The group has delivered a good performance in 2011 across all of our businesses. 2011 was a challenging year and as we look at 2012, there are uncertainties ahead of us. A number of important steps have been taken in Europe to address the challenges of the Eurozone. That said, those challenges will remain a feature of 2012 and are unlikely to be resolved in the next 12 months. However, there are clear signs of economic recovery coming from the U.S. and if confirmed, this would provide a significant boost to all economies.</p>
          <p>In this context, we have achieved in 2011 two important milestones. One, Asia has become the largest contributor to IFRS while continuing to grow strongly. And each of our four businesses is now making material net remittances to the group. Over the last few years, we have built a track record of performance across our key financial metrics and we have here our new business profits, IFRS profits and cash and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:25) year. You see a similar fate.</p>
          <p>The point I want to make here is that these results have been delivered during two very contrastive periods. In 2005, 2006, 2007, we had a very benign macroeconomic environment, very favorable for our sector. And in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, we have had a much more challenging environment, to put in perspective the delivery here. And it is detriment to the quality of our franchises and our people but we have been able to continue to grow profitably in the face of such strong economic headwinds. And this gives you for me a sense of the potential of this company should the economic conditions improve.</p>
          <p>We have good momentum within our businesses, a robust and defensively positioned balance sheet, and significant exposure to one of the most attractive regions in the worldwide economy, namely Southeast Asia. As we tell you in our statement this morning, we have made a positive start to 2012. Our business has performed well in challenging times and is well positioned to perform even better as economic conditions improve and I believe they are doing so.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much and over to you now for questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Afternoon. Raghu Hariharan from Citi. Three questions, the first one was on the credit default impact on your IGD and on your EV, could you let us know what the impact would be if you were to hold the credit default reserve assumption at the same level and do not assume a higher liquidity premium?</p>
          <p>The second question was really on Hong Kong margins. Hong Kong margins I see fell from 74% to 66%. Could I have some color on is that a one-off effect or is that a longer-term trend that you're seeing in Hong Kong lately?</p>
          <p>The third is actually for Mike on the U.S., and it's a request for three data points. The first one was what are the level of last rates you're seeing in variable annuities? As you know, most of your U.S. peers and some of your European peers disclose this number. Secondly, what was the change in the net amount of risk year-over-year? And, thirdly, what proportion of your VA book is actually within the surrender charge period? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What proportion is &#x2013; I missed the last one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. What proportion of your VA book is within the surrender charge period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. All right, well, you're counting these as three questions, we'll be generous. That was a special numerical system. So let's go with IGD. Nic, you want to take the IGD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have an answer to that question. But all I would remind you is that our &#xA3;2 billion reserve against the &#xA3;24 billion investment portfolio that we have in UK annuities is roughly equivalent to a default rate of 7.6% across the whole portfolio. I would put to you that we're very comfortably reserved for a large variety of scenarios, if not most. So, we're comfortable with the amount that we carry in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just in the liquidity premium because there's an agreed methodology which is 50% of spreads or swaps like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:49) which is what AXA, Zurich and all these guys use. So just wondering whether you can actually take credit for the entire &#x2013; almost the entire rising spreads over the year into your IGD and into your EEV? So that was really the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, the amount of credit that we take in our IGD or in our Solvency I numbers in the UK is at the end of the day down to our judgment and down to the regulators' judgment as to what the appropriate level is. And we are comfortable, as I indicated to you, on where we are. In relation to EEV, you know our basis and you know our views on the market consistent approach. So we continue to report on the same basis as we always have done in that regard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:36) some of his question, 2008 and the MCV debates for those who remember those days. We had a very clear stance, we think, those assumptions for us are not appropriate. We're very comfortable with our position, it served us well through a crisis, and we think that we have an appropriate level of prudence. We don't believe that 50% is a fair assessment of ratio of credit risk at every point in the credit cycle and spread growth certain levels. You can't just fix the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:02) as a percentage obviously. We think that's inappropriate. That's the house view. Hong Kong margin 74%, 66%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's not terribly complicated. It largely has to do with product mix but, Pete, do you want to add some color to it or..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that there's probably two things going on one. One that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:24) assumptions which, clearly, with lower interest rates, you pull down the assumed bonus rates and therefore the shareholder transfers on the Power business, and then simply the product mix in terms of participating versus unit linked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we don't have margin in our KPIs. We drive NBP. Very clearly, when I talk to Barry or Mike what we discuss is NBP. I want your NBP to go here. After that your volume and your prices and your mix, honestly, I couldn't care less. You've got your <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:10:58) target, you've got your NBP target and you drive your business according to that. So, frankly, margins move. We're not too sensitive to that as long as we deliver on the targets we've given, the IFRS and NBP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one of the dynamics you do see as business moves, if you get a little bit of a shift from linked to the with-profits, often that's indicative of a slight strengthening of the bank channel, which is what's happened at Hong Kong. And while it's important to remember that we do attach riders to the with-profits business, it's generally not quite as rich a mix as with the linked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But from a capital perspective it also has some benefits because it increase profits.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's NBP, not margin. The U.S., the lapse rate, three question, lapse rates the NAO, year-on-year and, sorry, your third one I keep missing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh yeah. Surrender charge. Okay. <mark type="ph" /> Mike (1:12:04), do you want to give those a shot?</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we can happily cover those. I think they tend to be &#x2013; the assumptions that we have at around the 1% to 1.5% mark in the surrender charge period. We then allow for a lapse shock of 20% to 25% and then broadly after than period, they're broadly half. That's for policies that are out of the money. Policies that are in the money, for example, if you take a 30% policy that is 30% in the money, we would apply a third of those rates in our pricing and reserving and in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:12:40) that we showed, we then half those.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Raghu, I'm going to have <mark type="ph" /> Chad (1:12:48) give you &#x2013; he's got the deck in front of us here, the specific numbers. But on the surrender charge issue, I think the thing to think about with competitors is if you had a dollar-for-dollar withdrawal structure on a contract, you're going to get high utilization surrenders during the surrender charge period. We have very little of that. It was about &#xA3;3 billion of older stuff, but it's not the product we typically sell. Ours, there's a &#x2013; we don't have that same in surrender demand you're seeing, I think from some of the competitors. But do you want to give him the actual &#x2013; do you have an amount <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:22)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I do. The total net amount of risk for the year went up about &#xA3;2 billion on the VA. And then in terms of your question, in surrender charge, it's between 80% and 85% of the book is still on surrender charge.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks so much. Andy Hughes, Exane BNP Paribas. Dare I suggest there's a slide missing from the pack? I know you give a lot of slides, but there's one I'd like to see explained which should help me a lot. I know you're highlighting the growth in Asia as being highly significant in terms of APE. But one of my issues is when I turn to page 68 of the IFRS disclosures, when you give the in-force premium income for Asia which, as you point out, is a driver of the profitability under IFRS of certainly the insurance margin, the numbers look very different.</p>
          <p>Just highlighting the linked one which is &#xA3;1.1 billion of renewal premium income last year in 2010 and then you've reported &#xA3;1.163 billion, a growth of &#xA3;33 million last year in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:14:32) income. I understand some of this is India, but there's a huge difference between what you're reporting as new business premium income and what you're reporting as renewal premium income. I was just wondering, could you explain what's going on?</p>
          <p>And the second question is if I look at these renewal premium income figures and relate them back to the insurance margin of &#xA3;477 million, I've got a question about how profitable the rider actually is. Because if you're reporting in here &#xA3;3 billion of premium income across Asia in terms of renewal in-force premium and you're making &#xA3;477 million of insurance margin, some of that premium income is of course rider, so is there something exceptional about the insurance margin that you've been reporting the past few years? Or is this the rider roughly 50% profit on your <mark type="ph" /> perception (1:15:13) contracts? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. I think you largely answered your question on the regular premiums but, Nic, do you want to take &#x2013; India is basically there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify what the disclosures are, they're actually disclosures around the movement of the liability reserves, so that's the first point to make. That's not the same as premium because in arriving the difference between the actual premium and what we disclose in that reconciliation reflect charges that we did not grant up front from the products.</p>
          <p>The specific trend that you highlight in relation to unit linked is explained by India. I appreciate there's 250 odd pages of disclosure, but I can give you the ex-India numbers would have been &#xA3;922 million for 2011, &#xA3;781 million for 2010. And, therefore, you'd see they're &#xA3;140 million or 18% increase, in line, I guess, with the trends that you're seeing in terms of growth across the business that we sell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a lot lower than the &#xA3;1.2 billion of APE that you report in Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the amounts that we report in Asia are spread across a whole host of products, including with-profits, including unit-linked, including Protection. But the &#x2013; look, the underlying point is that the business is growing. It's growing fast. The nature of the products that we sell have very attractive profitability characteristics. You've seen that come through not only in the growth of the balance sheet, which we disclosed, not only in the growth of profits but also in cash...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can keep the policy but the number you're referring to ex-India grew 18%. So do you have a problem at that level of growth or not? If not, we can move to the next point. So 18% growth, I mean, no, fair question, but I was just saying you think that actually...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just looking this premium income number and comparing it to the insurance margin you're reporting. So the &#xA3;477 million compared to the &#xA3;3 billion of renewal premium that you're reporting across Asia. I mean, all that &#xA3;3 billion isn't riders, so your riders will be at the small proportion of the &#xA3;3 billion premium income assuming that's actual premium income and that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's &#x2013; yeah, that's suggesting to me the rider profitability is very, very high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, on the comparison you need to factor into that comparison the Health and Protection business share of operating expenses and acquisition costs. And only then can you express &#x2013; do the sums that you are describing and express an underlying return on the premiums that we deliver. So that's the difference in your calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will be happy to take this offline. At a high level, we don't disclose returns by product. You can judge profitability of a business by looking at the capital that goes in and the payback accomplished with cash comes and what returns are at a global level and we have never desegregated that and commented on a line-by-line <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:18:57)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it ought to be clear based upon some &#x2013; as you say, you look at the strain, you look at the level of profitability, you look at the &#x2013; what's happened over the last few years with margins, you look at the cash that's been generated, you look at what has changed in 2011 versus 2005, or 2006, and it is clear that the profile of Health and Protection of the business is certainly a part of the story.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Three questions on the U.S., please. You mentioned this sort of U.S. deal which we've not heard for a while. I wonder if you could just give us some idea about the appetite there in terms of liability, mix, size, how you might find outsets, whether there's a scenario in which you do something more transformational in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of market share, are you signaling in the U.S. that your mix sort of growing along with the market from here and, within that, is there any more distribution that you're going to add in the U.S.? So, is this basically share within distribution you've already got or are you going to maintain any share in distribution you might add in the future?</p>
          <p>And then, finally, on the lapse sensitivity you've given, I see it's the contracts which are already in the money. If you compared that &#x2013; if you did that calculation again but just combined it with a market shock, say S&amp;P down 25%, how would those numbers look? Are they still immaterial numbers?</p>

It would be accretive. It would be competitive with other returns around the group. And we are pursuing that objective. But next time I talk about it I'd love it to be to explain a deal to you, not &#x2013; we've been talking about this one for a while, I know. So, there are a number of properties in the U.S. that are available for various reasons and we keep looking at them and we'll continue to do so and only the things that make sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But probably the reason why it's been difficult is we're uncompromising on those criteria. So when you do that, we've looked at many, many things, but none has materialized yet. But our appetite is intact and it's something we would like to do, we think it makes a lot of sense strategically with a very short payback yield with very high IRR. So we have an appetite for it and it would be financeable on Jackson's own resources.</p>
          <p>Market share, look, it's always a difficult question for us in the U.S. because, as I've said a few times, we drive IRR, we don't really drive volume. Volume in the U.S. is dependent on a number of things. One, where we price our product and how we structure it. And we've got to fit ours to what the competition does and you've seen from quarter to quarter for new swings in what they do when there's a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:22:03) going on or major product change, people withdrawing from the market, et cetera, et cetera, and then the S&amp;P.</p>
          <p>So, frankly, it would take a brave person faced with those uncertainties to give any kind of volume prediction. We are clear about our appetite. We said when the returns are attractive we have the capital to write for business. But given our lack of control on other reactions of our competitors or the S&amp;P, we have to be relatively modest in volume predictions. Our ambition is to be a significant player provided the market conditions allow us to do that.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Jon, I think the other thing you're going to see is, you know, Met has been specific on a premium target or &#x2013; that they're looking to. And we think the balance of the sales that they had and that Sun had you'll probably see distributed more to the top five than you see in the top three. So that will be a change from previous conversations and last year. But we're very competitive, we like our pricing, we've got good distribution. A lot of the distribution we had in the last few years is still emerging. It takes a long time to get to every branch of some of these warehouses and develop the relationships you need over time and we're very happy with the results there but there's a lot of upside in those for us. So we don't feel we need a distribution relationship change, step change, to capture a competitive element in the market.</p>

So, an answer &#x2013; part of the answer to your question is that in our scenario the hedging would mitigate quite a lot of the impact that that would have on both IFRS and on the statutory capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. James Pearce from UBS. I think under Raghu's method, here's one question. First of all, could you talk about the balance of capital requirements for new business and dividends? You seem to need less and less capital for new business but you're not hitting your payout ratio on the dividend. How should we understand the equilibrium there?</p>
          <p>Second, someone at the Bank of England today is talking about being worried about insurers becoming shadow banks. What does that mean for <mark type="ph" /> pure capital and stock pending (01:25:16) and how do you feel the regulatory environment is developing in the U.K.? And also could you talk about the effect on European fund flows of LTRO 2, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, James. Capital required and dividend, look, our feelings on the dividend I think has been quite clear. It is ultimately to be able to pay a growing dividend. But the approach we have taken to that is to have a policy that is extremely safe. So what we do we don't look as we call addressing it a static way, but we look at it dynamically and we stress test it very severely. So if you do a static analysis, our dividend may look not that generous considering the improvement in the position of the group. But we always try to keep a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:26:05), between, if you wish, the earnings growth rate and the dividend growth rate.</p>
          <p>And I don't want to go back in history but it's a very wise thing to try and maintain, to never let the dividend growth rate get ahead of your earnings growth rate. So there is a lag there, if you wish. You've seen that the performance in 2007, 2008, 2009 finally had led to a significant rebasing in 2010 but we've calibrated the rebase, exactly by looking at the scenarios and computing how safe we would be post-rebase. So, that's how we look at it. So, I think if we look at it on that side, and as the group improves, as the position of the group improves, the cash generation improves, the balance sheet improves, the possibility to safely increase the dividend increases, so that's how we look at it.</p>
          <p>Then that thing on shadow banks, well, that's one for, I'm looking at John Foley here. John, would you like to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:27:05)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:27:08) if that's something that would come under any scrutiny. I think from the point of view of securities lending, I think that general view around the market and months of regulatory communities that that's a very positive thing for the market and provides liquidity to the market. So, again, I'm not sure that's going to foretell of any upcoming definitions around shadow banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I think what <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:27:43) referred to was very specific to get money from share lending and then use that to invest in very risky activities and that's not something we do at <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:28:01), that's not the model. And as John said, the FSA stays very close to that. We've addressed at our RO review, looked at all that and he's comfortable. And there's a question for <mark type="ph" /> Michael (1:28:02) on LTRO and net inflows in Europe.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Toby Langley from Barclays Capital. I've got one question for <mark type="ph" /> Mike, one for Rob and one for Michael (1:28:20). The first one for you, <mark type="ph" /> Mike (1:28:24). We noticed last week you launched a new product called Elite Access, and I'm quite keen to know what you think about the prospects of that product are in that market, what do you think of the no load space? There's a lot of big players, Fidelity, et cetera, in that market. What makes you think you can hold a candle to them? How do you think it will grow going forward?</p>
          <p>For <mark type="ph" /> Rob (1:28:45), ABI guidelines on annuities, open market annuities, how are they going to affect your business? Have you started to suffer at all yet from a much more proactive attitude, shall we say, to the open market option? And then for <mark type="ph" /> Michael (1:29:05), why should we not be worried about RDR class shares and the implications there for your AMC charge on your market-leading position in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:29:20)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with a challenge. I think Fidelity is probably our best U.S. competitor, all kidding aside. I think they, in the retirement space, they create some very good solutions and we still see ourselves that that's our primary role in business. So we do watch what they do carefully. Elite Access is actually not a no-load product, it's a no-guarantee product.</p>
          <p>And the intent is to give the consumers access to alternative asset class and asset management strategies that aren't available at the retail level, and so it's a fairly unique set of products that it's just launched. It's in days. But 74% of our selling group has it available to them, which gives you an idea of the firms signing the selling group agreement. Some of the &#x2013; firms have various processes to approve that and I haven't asked their permission to tell you who's in and who's out. I probably should have done that, but three quarters of them have said yes.</p>
          <p>And the &#x2013; most of the firms we do business with now for the retail consumer recommended allocations of alternative asset classes in that is somewhere between 15% and 30% of the clients, suggested allocation based on age. And have &#x2013; it's very difficult in the U.S. to access those products effectively and conveniently and we're seen as a good source for that. So can we wholesale and support a complicated product to devise a network? I think we can and I think we'll give them a run for the money. But to your point about competitors, the no-load space for VAs we don't think is mature yet and we don't think is a place to play assets or our resources yet. I think there's a couple of reasons &#x2013; they want the guarantees, so effectively we're going to let someone have access to our balance sheet but not pick up any of the fee revenue on assets which &#x2013; that's a business proposition we don't like.</p>
          <p>And second, the liquidity and volatility you're talking about from a hedging point of view, you really should be hedging those to the day. And you get into some very inefficient models from a hedging point of view in the sense that the clients &#x2013; every guarantee you've written is liquid, every hour of the day. So that tends to create a more expensive product if it's priced correctly. So we're going to let those go for a while, watch that space develop and see how they mature.</p>
          <p>But we're pretty pleased with &#x2013; lead access is not supposed to be the new product. It's supposed to be broadening our shelf space and the initial reaction from the advisors is good. They like it. They've never sold anything like it, but they like it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just coming back with you on that, to fully capture the value chain here, you don't have to ramp up the product proposition as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, one more time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your immediate annuity proposition, you don't have to ramp that up to catch the full value share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't have that involved in this product. We still don't &#x2013; the interest rate environment, there is some pickup in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:32:26) of products in the U.S. But there you still don't see retirees in the U.S. buying guaranteed income streams in the traditional sense &#x2013; in the sense you would hear when someone retires with a pension plan. What you are seeing now though is quite a few of the competing VA products effectively being a variable immediate annuity cash flow stream. That's the way a lot of clients are accessing that benefit. So Met's GMIB would be a good example of an equity-linked immediate annuity.</p>

            <mark type="ph" /> Rob (1:33:00), on the open market option?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the open market option, to your final question, first, Toby, we haven't seen any change in terms of the take-up rates. I think we will need to remind ourselves here kind of what our average annuitant looks like. In terms of annuitants we've got pot of between &#xA3;15,000 and &#xA3;20,000 depending on what the markets look like. These are pretty small pots. Typically, they are a long term Pru customer, they're a very high affiliation with the brand.</p>
          <p>So I think the changes which we have been involved in in developing, we are comfortable with. We don't think that &#x2013; this seems to make it a little bit trickier for our customers, they &#x2013; and slightly less efficient. We have a very efficient model for taking small pots and turning them into relatively small annuities. So it becomes slightly less efficient but that's at the margin, we don't think we'll see really any change that comes out of that change. We already know because we tested our customers, 90% of them are aware that they could shop around for annuity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the growth teams make that very clear, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we'll increase information. I think we'll decrease convenience for people who are generally, this is a small part of their life and they would like convenience. But that's fine, we've got other ways around to try and minimize the impact of that for our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:34:26) a good thing. We're very supportive of what VABI does. We are very involved and we're understanding this rate environment and if you wish a hit to annuities from QE, et cetera, it's important that people feel comfortable that they're getting the best value possible. So we're supportive of the industry's efforts. Michael, the RDR and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:34:43).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, other than passive funds, all the evidences of people want to buy performance net of fees. So as long as they're getting performance net the fee that is superior that's what they want and that's what they'll pay for. In an RDR world, we would expect to launch share classes that no longer are full of commission to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:35:04) In other words, the charge will come down by the amount of the commission that would otherwise have been paid. So we're likely to be launching share classes, carrying fees of 75 basis points and 100 basis points and we'd expect that to be entirely competitive and we'd be very surprised if premium alpha driven investment funds were launching at fee rates below that.</p>

          <p>Nick Holmes of Nomura. Two questions, first on the variable annuities, wondered, can you tell us what you think the economic performance of the hedge program was last year? I believe that your accounting stopped 03/01 or its latest update is not what you would call an economic measure but correct me if I'm wrong. And so my question is are the peers in the VA space report economic performance and suffered quite considerable losses last year. And I notice that there is a number of &#xA3;432 million in your free surplus. This is on page 45, which you describe as a fault of hedge loss, I think.</p>
          <p>And my question is, is that actually the economic loss? And a follow-up to that would be why don't you, if it is, why don't you put this in operating earnings as the peer group does, not in America. I know they're going to America but the Continental European peer group does. And then the second question is, just on the growth profile for the group, you have given us lots clear targets for Asia, obviously very, very sensible, but what about the rest of the group?</p>
          <p>Can you &#x2013; the round growth targets for the rest of the group? Can you elaborate? Can you tell us what sort of growth you would like to see? I mean 6% new business profit growth, I would suggest is not actually really very high growth. Is this the sort of growth that you would expect over the next couple of years or are you targeting significantly higher? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No problem. I'll take the second the one later but let's deal with the Vas and the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right that the income statement has &#x2013; includes the movement in reserves on an SOP of 301 basis. But we have &#x2013; what you should do is what we have guided you to do in the past. If you wanted to get a good appreciation what's happening on an economic basis, look at the RBC. And I have explained to you in taking you through that slide that the, if you like, the capital at the end of the year was the same as the one at the beginning of the year and we have two things going through. One is the operating profit generation offset by remittances in the financing growth, and then the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:38:14) guarantee reserves offset by the positive effects of the hedging program.</p>
          <p>So that's a lens. We have on slide 72 also repeated some of the disclosure that we gave you last year to tell you what would happen if we put all our liabilities on a FAS 157 basis and you see the effect there. But you have to remember that at that point we would unlock the assumption in relation to the fees that we can take credit against those additional liabilities and net-net it's like a quasar economic liabilities are the same as we currently reported cap liabilities.</p>
          <p>On your point on the free surplus the &#xA3;432 million, what you are seeing there is what I described in relation to the RBC that in effect we have not given ourselves credit for the positive marks on the swap program and in the same way as that has reduced the reported RBC, we have retained, if you like, the symmetry and that &#xA3;432 million also reflects in essence the mark not recognizing the mark under <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:39:22).</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The permitted purchases helped us a lot during the crisis. Fundamentally they will protect us against a rise in interest rates. Okay, they're hurting our RBC this time. We could have gone back to regulator and said, okay we want to do away with permitted purchases but really, if you have a hedging program you don't want to be going back and forth to regulator when it suits you on an accounting basis typically &#x2013; when it doesn't suit you on an accounting basis we're moving it. So we made a decision of &#x2013; we'll leave it in place. We'll take a hit and if the question comes we'll explain but that's what it is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean in conclusion, what would you say was the economic performance of the hedging program, of the variable annuity book, given that you've got all these other companies, you're making lots...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean through the RBC lens, it was very effective in that it mitigated the impact on the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on growth I understand a bit your frustration but I'll be also very open. If you go back to my script when I presented the six targets, I said that's what we ask you to judge us on. And as you rightly underlined, there's no growth target other than for Asia, okay, because we are very confident that that growth will be profitable. If you are able to convince me with the same degree of certainty but grew familiar over areas where we actually will be profitable I would then give you a growth target, all right. What we manage the group for is for profit, to grow the profit, we're confident that they're driving Asia as we are. We are going to grow the profit. You saw IFRS going up 32%.</p>
          <p>For the rest, I explained very well the dynamic in VAs. In the rest, I think it would be completely self-defeating to set a growth target in VA. I do not believe, and I think I said this on the record, in growth target in cyclical businesses. I think that's just silly. The business is cyclical, you give yourself a volume target, that's a recipe for disaster, okay, because others are watching your behavior. It doesn't make any sense economically. Your growth rate would be set if it's profitable, you will not rate it if it is not profitable, and that profitability will be determined by what others do very largely, okay.</p>
          <p>So you have to set your product parameters and then the volume, you have to set your parameters at a level so that your comfortable with what volume is written, and we have this downward flexibility because our costs are so low. We never have to trace volume to cut our fixed cost, and that's a very good position to be in. I often say we're like Saudi Arabian oil, they make money at a $5 oil barrel and all the rest is upside.</p>
          <p>So you have to be in a position where you're comfortable. And in good times, we'll put all the capital in and write it but if competition comes back or people will behave irrationally. And always if you really think about it, giving the volume targets compared to the fee is almost an invitation for people to misbehave. Because then you're under the hoop. They'll know exactly what you're going to do because you got to hit your volume target and you lose your flexibility. That's very poor management.</p>
          <p>So we are not going to stand here and give you a growth target in a cyclical activity that we don't control, where volumes are largely dependent on equity market levels, so I'll never give you a forecast on equity market levels. That's just silly. So we tell you how we operate, the targets we set. The volume will be a realization &#x2013; not ex-party. We're never going to tell you our target for Q1 is at <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:42:34). We'd be just putting ourselves under the hook.</p>
          <p>So we have said that the cost of that is that the top line numbers for the group may not be great, but I think we'll be very clear with you that we don't we should be judged by that. That is not the strategy we're following. We want to increase the share price and the market value of the group, not the top line. And we believe that the strategy that we are following will win the increment. It may produce some lackluster top line numbers sometimes, but we don't really mind.</p>
          <p>As well as Asia, which is what we focus on, the growth is driving forward. The rest is opportunistic. And we're happy to get it when we can. So, for the U.K., we don't really have growth aspirations. For M&amp;G, we are a bit again in a cyclical <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:43:19) business very dependent on markets. We can't set a volume target for an asset manager. Products vary depending on the economic cycle. Tell me what the Bank of England's going to do during the second half of 2012, I'll give you a target for M&amp;G. I don't know. And VAs are beating the same &#x2013; in the same category. So, very clear that we are above value in that volume and we're comfortable with that.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. It's Andrew Crean with Autonomous. Three questions. U.S. spread income variance, which is positive, at what basis points would that be in neutral? Is that 175 or 200? That was the first question. Second question, I see you were in the papers protesting about Solvency II, possibly protesting too much given the length of time on equivalents. But I've seen this is relative to the U.S. So, in order for investors to be able to judge what sort of potential threat this is to your U.S. business, could you tell us on a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:44:19) reading whether your U.S. business had enough capital in it?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, when I read the first pages of statement too, it was Asia, Asia, Asia followed by more Asia and then a couple of reference to the U.S. and U.K. Is this an &#x2013; are you trying to build an Asian shareholder base and what proportion of your shareholders are now some local Asians? And are you going to make special effort this year now that a greater proportion of the business is from Asia to sell the pretty story into Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the first one...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess even 200. 200.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Solvency II. As you said, we have been in the papers against our will because we've been having &#x2013; oh yes, I can say that with absolutely a straight face. We've been having those conversations for a while and they never made their way to the papers because there's no upside for us. Talking to a government forever and the regulator also so we were forced into an announcement which we made and we were very clear in the announcement that it is contingency planning, that there is an uncomfortable level of uncertainty under Solvency II and the range of potential outcomes is outside our risk appetite.</p>
          <p>And that as we get closer to the date, it's just prudent to examine other options, and you've mentioned domicile as one of the other options. And really, the regulators are very aware of that. It's almost something they asking us to do as I've been saying. As a good regulator, should do well, what is your plan B. Actually it's not a question that's asked to us. It's asked to every other insurance company. I don't know anybody today who is comfortable with the profit as it is at this point in time.</p>
          <p>We're seeing the situation change almost on a daily basis. Risk Solvency regime under which a company of our scale is going to have to operate is still uncertain. So looking at options I think it's just good planning. And on numbers, at this stage we're not &#x2013; we don't think it's helpful given this level of uncertainty and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:46:24).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>I take the answer to be no then.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, on our own economic capital basis, Jackson is positive. It was at the start of 2011 and it finished but that's a long economic capital which we use to inform the pricing and the behaviors that we deploy year-on-year. But on Solvency II, I think it's premature. There's just too much fluidity as Tidjane said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Asia, Asia, Asia; I think you read our release well. I think we're very clear on the strategy that we're trying to follow. We talked about the need to make sure that each of our businesses is viable across an economic cycle. And that's what we're doing and Asia is effectively doing very well. I mean, the numbers, the macroeconomic numbers I guess, they for me are staggering.</p>
          <p>But, Asia is a continent. It's 70% of the world's population. It's certainly a bridgeable part of the world and I believe that any company that has a real future on a global scale will be saying Asia, Asia, Asia in the future. It is 70% of the world whether we like or not, and growing.</p>
          <p>So I don't think we're saying anything, the market or the economy doesn't know. That's a reality that we are holding. So just a fact of life. And I don't think it's a particular shareholder base or &#x2013; it's just representing what the company is and no company so far has the power to choose its shareholders. So what we can do is produce results and the rest &#x2013; people decide to buy our shares on it. A very clear strategy. Blair?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Blair Stewart from BofA Merrill. Three quick mop ups from me. Nic, since you brought up slide 72, can you just explain again what the adjustment to full fees..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you do the 5157 calculation and you calculate the value if you like over the guarantees or the reserve for those guarantees, you're allowed under U.S. GAAP to bring in the fees that you will charge for those guarantees. But you're only allowed to bring in the proportion &#x2013; a sufficient proportion that doesn't generate a negative reserve. So, that's what happens in the calculation of liabilities, so what if you were to therefore, move all of the &#x2013; if you were to extend qualities, Blair, if you wish to extend the calculation for the rest of the portfolio effectively you need to do the same. And this is the opposite that's coming through in the column that you see on page 72.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, second question is given the state of the closing balance sheet in the U.S., what should be our expectations for dividend paid back to PLC and the third question is in the &#x2013; one of the slides on Asia, it is noticeable that you are at subscale given the context of the group in Thailand. Just wondered what your strategy there was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Nic, you want to talk about the dividend and I'll...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've given you our long-term objective which is by 2013, to have a dividend of &#xA3;200 million on a sustainable basis. We don't have anything flat to that particular objective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no &#x2013; there's no doubt that we're subscale in Thailand. We &#x2013; unfortunately we've managed to double the share of it. We went from 1% to 2%, a huge increase, but this was still subscale and we have a huge appetite for growth in Thailand. Barry's there regularly and we're trying a number of things. You want to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:50:40)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a &#x2013; one of the reasons, candidly, we're subscale in Thailand is because historically over the last 30 years, it's been an agency-driven market and it's the one place in Asia where we've not built a particularly large or strong agency force. So, we're working on that. We have, I would reckon, the best, most confident, most experienced, most professional head of agency we've ever had in that market who's come on board in the last year. So we're seeing a material uplift in the number of agents and in the productivity in those agents. It's still very small. So, you don't build an agency overnight. You build it over years. So, we're keenly aware of that gap.</p>
          <p>You can address the issue a little more quickly on the bank asides if you get the right deals and you executed against those deals effectively then you can have an impact. As Tidjane said, we have doubled our share. Not the greatest trick in the world, but we have doubled our share there and that's largely attributable to <mark type="ph" /> Banka (1:51:45) generally, to UOB and SCB specifically and particularly on the execution of the UOB. UOB is a pretty big bank in Thailand, over 150 branches.</p>
          <p>We're now basically, almost two years into the operation of that. We were able to execute very quickly, drive very high volumes of new business, including some months of triple-digit growth over the last year. That has not only improved the economics of the scale of our business, but it's gotten the attention of some other bank partners in Thailand and so it's now a lot &#x2013; it's pretty easy for us to get invited into conversations with other bank partners. So I'm optimistic that over the next year or two that we'll be able to continue to build out the scale of the distribution platform and that's really what it takes. I mean, we know what to do, we've just got to build a distribution platform that is in sync with the scale of our ambition now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How much time do we have on the? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two trends, one is getting lost and then asking specific questions, just on numbers. The first one is, I wonder if you can just remind us of the percentage contribution to Asian value of new business from Standard Chartered in Hong Kong specifically; and when that comes up for renegotiation in 2015, just the mechanics. Will you play a single large lump sum for access for the next 10 years or will you take that sum and you'll spread it over three or four or five years? Just in terms of how I should think about forecasting.</p>
          <p>And the second point is I noticed the agent productivity dropped from 8% year-on-year growth in the first half, and then on my numbers sort of bootstrapping out your full-year number. The growth rate was 2% year-on-year in the second half and Tidjane, at the November conference you said you would &#x2013; it would be a challenge to hold onto that. I was wondering if you could give us a sort of objective for 2012 that you might have in terms of your growth in Asian productivity just so I can give this year &#x2013; for full cost purposes?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:54:11).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I tell you the percentage of NBP that Standard Charter bank in Hong Kong is as a percentage of PCA? I think the answer to that question is no. But it's good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But oh yeah, I can. I can. Yeah, fair point. Fair point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's mainly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>SCB you know, it's a strong contributor, but there are many strong contributors across the region and that's just a slightly too granular question. I would also &#x2013; I will tell you, I don't like to get too specific about the terms of these agreements but I will tell you your calendar's wrong on when that deal will be renegotiated.</p>
          <p>In terms of agent productivity, when you get the kind of strong productivity improvements we've had over the last couple of years, it is &#x2013; there is not infinite scale to improve productivity so we do continue to chip away and get better and better and more and more efficient and productive but that's not an infinite game. You do get agents to a point where based upon the demographics of the market, based upon the macroeconomics of the market, there's a point at which these products we sell, you're not going to drive premiums higher. Agents &#x2013; there are still 24 hours in the day of most agents. There's only so much they can do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you test the limits of numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For instance, if you're driving growth in a relatively lower productivity area and <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:55:37) which you're very happy with, it may drive your productivity down, your average <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:55:43). It tells you of &#x2013; it's like margin, the product mix. This contributes. It tells you where your growth has been happening. So really, if you wanted a meaningful productivity conversation, it has to be on a country-by-country basis. Once you mix Indonesia with Vietnam, with Philippines, with &#x2013; there's so much move in different directions there, but it's not always meaningful. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:56:04) I'm just trying to understand the mechanics. UOB, you paid a lump sum up front. I was just wondering if you were going to pay a lump sum or it would be spread over the period. And Tidjane, you did &#x2013; I'll use the word step up, but two results ago you gave us the date and it was 2015 on the center chart. So are you saying that that somehow has moved &#x2013; I mean, there it's in the Q&amp;A two years ago. I'm just wondering if that's &#x2013; was that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a typo...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll check with the Q&amp;A. I'm trying to go back to my memory. But I am &#x2013; first of all, I bet what I first said something like at least &#x2013; but the reality is we don't communicate on the timing of that. It's not because we love secrecy, but we &#x2013; last year, for instance, we said a lot of meetings telling people that there is no problem with our agreement. At one point, we learned that we were going to lose it. One we were telling everybody we were going to lose it. Disinformation &#x2013; yes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:57:09) information around that deal.</p>
          <p>So we really find that there's no upsizing in adding to that. We're very happy with it, we have a great relationships with Standard Chartered. We've got &#x2013; we added Philippines this year, we're very happy with. They helped us a lot in Thailand. Great lucrative event and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:57:31) is not helpful. So really our fundamentally stance at this point and the agreement with Standard Chartered is not to start recreating on the date or the shape that an agreement would take, et cetera, et cetera. But on the meaningful horizon, planning horizon for you, I don't think it's something we need to worry about.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's William Elderkin from SocGen. I have three questions on the U.S. please. First of all, can you comment on the profitability of your, say, pre-2008, variable annuities cohorts and the current interest rate environment?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on slide 47 where you give the lapse and the utilization sensitivities or the negation of them, is there any way we can relate that information to your amount of risk disclosures?</p>
          <p>And, thirdly, I think you're reporting IRRs and new business in the U.S. somewhere north of 20%. My impression is most of your peers in the VA space have capped at around 15%, do correct me if I'm wrong. Can you just explain briefly where that excess return is coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="ph" /> Rob (1:58:41), do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. We don't &#x2013; let me give you a general statement that I think will answer your first question. We don't have a vintage or block of business that isn't profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is not profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is not profitable. So, the related question that the &#x2013; that you may have read about competitors, some of them are worried about additional premium going into old contracts, if that's where you were going. They can go to any of the previously written supplements. We have less than a 3% supplemental pay rate if you'd like but candidly it's not a concern for us if they go into a previous vintage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to add to that, I'm very aware that we're travelling 95 basis points or further is richer than today. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:59:22). We were more than 50% more expensive than the competition and it may explain to you why our profitability is different. It's much more expensive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I'm going to try to come back to you on a second piece, but on the IRR, there's a couple of things there, but I think the primary driver is we still have 25 plus basis points of an expense advantage on the entire industry and on some of the market leaders it's materially higher than that.</p>
          <p>So on just &#x2013; if you think about how critical 10 basis points are in this business to margin, it's a pretty nice place to start. And that has everything from choosing Lansing versus New York City as a home and all those sort of related tangible costs in that as well as the efficiency and the technology and things. It's not one single piece but it is the entire model's output and <mark type="ph" /> Chad's (2:00:12) got the &#x2013; you want to take the second one on NAR to lapse rate, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:00:17)</p>

      <speaker type="q">
