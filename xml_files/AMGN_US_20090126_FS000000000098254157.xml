          <p>My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Fourth Quarter Full Year 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers' prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dennis. Good afternoon everybody. I'd like to welcome you to our conference call. Over the next few minutes, we will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008 and we will also provide our estimate for growth outlook for 2009. At the end of our prepared comments, we will have time to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Leading the discussion today will be our Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer, who will provide a strategic review of our business in 2008 as well as the challenges and opportunities that we will face in 2009. Our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Bradway, will then provide analysis of our performance in the fourth quarter and how that translated into our full year performance for 2008. George Morrow, who as you know is our Head of Global Commercial Operations will target his discussion on specific product performance during the quarter and key drivers for each of these products going into 2009. Lastly, Roger Perlmutter, who is our Head of R&amp;D, will provide a brief R&amp;D update. This will be brief because we provided a rather exhaustive review of our pipeline opportunities at our recently held business review meeting.</p>
          <p>As in the past, we'll be using slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Before I turn the call over to Kevin I would like to note that through the course of our presentation today we'll make certain forward-looking statements and of course, actual results can vary materially.</p>
          <p>So with that I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone. Much has changed in the world around us since our last meeting with you in early November, but our strategy, results and prospects remain consistent with our remarks that day.</p>
          <p>First, I'd like to thank my colleagues for their excellent performance in 2008. We delivered on our financial promises, won or settled important legal matters, advanced the pipeline, especially denosumab and Nplate and supplied every patient, every time with high quality medicines manufactured in an ever more efficient manufacturing network. It was also gratifying after a difficult 2007 that shareholders were rewarded too.</p>
          <p>We issue 2009 guidance today consistent with our aspiration to grow revenue and earnings as well as invest for the future. This plan fully funds our preparations for denosumab, invests in the pipeline at aggressive levels and counts on continued progress in capital and expense efficiencies.</p>
          <p>It will not be easy to deliver but it represents the right set of goals and trade offs and was adopted after months of intensive efforts by the entire team. In 2009 we will make progress on a number of fronts. Important clinical date will be revealed, notably denosumab SRE and Vectibix combination therapy. We will also learn more about our Phase 2 pipeline.</p>
          <p>Two, work with regulators in the US and Europe on our denosumab PMO filing. Operate in Europe and an increasingly credited biosimilars environment as G-CSF biosimilars continue to emerge. We will work with the new administration on a variety of healthcare initiatives and hopefully see the bottom of our current financial and economic macro environment crisis with the financial system at least stabilized.</p>
          <p>Each year represents challenges and contains uncertainties, but 2009 will more than ever call on our best. Here is how we are operating going into 2009. We have a low altitude, short time constant mindset. Low altitude means paying attention more than ever to the details across a wider range of topics: the economy, revenue, cost, clinical trial operations, product safety, regulatory affairs, government development, the list goes on.</p>
          <p>Shorter time constants means paying attention to those key indicators even more frequently and especially at the most senior levels of management. We are rightly proud of our operational performance over the last few years and 2009 will demand all those skills and vigilance and more.</p>
          <p>As I said, we are ready. Now, I would like to turn the call over to my colleagues for a detailed discussion of our results. Bob?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. If I can direct your attention to page five, I'll walk you through the fourth quarter income statement. Starting with revenues, as you can see revenues for the fourth quarter were flat at $3.8 billion that reflects the fact that products sales for our anemia franchise were down 8%, while the rest of our products were up 8%, during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Wholesaler inventories for the quarter showed Aranesp and EPOGEN ending at the high end of the normal ranges, while inventories for ENBREL ended at the low end of our normal range. Inventories for our other major products ended in the middle to upper end of the normal ranges, and George will give you further product detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of geography, in the fourth quarter our US sales totaled about $2.9 billion, which represents an increase of 1% over the prior year, and internationally our fourth quarter sales were $774 million, which represents an increase of 4%. And these sales were negatively impacted by $30 million from foreign exchange, so excluding that foreign exchange impact our total product sales for the quarter were up 2% and our international product sales increased by 8%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to operating expenses, which I will discuss on an adjusted basis, let me start with the cost of sales for the quarter, which as you can see decreased by 3%. This decrease was primarily due to lower cost in the manufacturing of ENBREL.</p>
          <p>Moving to research and development. Our expenses in R&amp;D for the quarter decreased 2% year-over-year, and this was primarily driven by lower clinical trial costs as we completed the enrollment of our denosumab registrational studies as well as the benefit of our licensing agreement with Takeda. Together both of those partially offset the higher clinical trial spend that we incurred for our emerging pipeline in the quarter.</p>
          <p>With respect to SG&amp;A, SG&amp;A expenses were up 7% over the prior year, reflecting higher expenses associated with the Wyeth profit share for ENBREL, as well as product promotional expenses during the year which were partially offset by lower staff related expenses. Excluding the Wyeth profit share, SG&amp;A expenses increased 4% for the quarter versus the prior year. Adding it up then you can see total operating expenses increased 2% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to tax rate, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19%. This is a decrease from the 22.6% that we recorded in the prior year. And this decrease is due to the full year benefit that we received from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&amp;D tax credit, which occurred as you know in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>With respect to earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share were $1.06 for the quarter, which is up 6% versus the prior period. Looking at the fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share including stock options you can see that our earnings per share including stock option expenses were $1.04, which represents a 7% increase compared to the $0.97 that we earned in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Now if you'll turn to page six, I'll walk you through the 2008 full year adjusted income statement. As you can see for the full year revenues increased 2% from 14.8 billion to $15 billion. That reflects the fact that product sales for our anemia franchise were down 8% while the rest of our products increased by 11% during the year.</p>
          <p>Full year U.S. sales totaled $11.5 billion, which is relatively unchanged from a year ago. 2008 full year international sales were $3.2 billion, which represents an increase of 13% and these sales were positively impacted by $213 million from foreign exchange during the course of the year. Excluding the foreign exchange gain, total product sales were up 1% for the year and international product sales increased 5% on the year.</p>
          <p>Now turning again to operating expenses on an adjusted basis; as you can see, cost of sales for the year decreased by 3% in absolute dollars. You can also see the cost of sales margin improved by nearly one percentage point to 14.9% on the year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower excess inventory write-offs and lower cost ENBREL manufactured during the course -- or sold during the course of the year, which improvements were partially offset by higher sales volume and excess capacity charges.</p>
          <p>Turning to research and development; R&amp;D expenses decreased 5% during the year. Again, this was primarily due to lower clinical trial costs from our denosumab registrational studies, as well as the benefit of our licensing agreements with Takeda and Daiichi Sankyo in Japan, and lower staff related and discretionary expenses as a result of our restructuring undertaken at the beginning of 2007. Now, these decreases were partially offset by higher clinical trial spend in our emerging pipeline, as well as the upfront payment as part of our licensing agreement with Kyowa Hakko earlier in 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning to SG&amp;A; our SG&amp;A expenses increased by 10% on the year, and this reflects higher expenses associated, again, with the Wyeth profit share in ENBREL, as well as promotional and staff related increases during the course of the year. These were partially offset by lower litigation expenses as compared to 2007. Total operating expenses for the year increased 1% to an aggregate of $8.8 billion. Our tax rate for the year was 21.7%, which represents a mild increase from the 21.3% that we recorded in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the change in mix of revenues and expenses, as well as some modest increased accruals in 2008 for state taxes.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share for the year, we recorded adjusted earnings per share of $4.55, which represents an increase of 6% versus the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share including stock option expenses were $4.48, or an increase of 7% compared to the $4.17 that we recorded in 2007.</p>
          <p>If I can direct your attention to page seven, I'll walk you through some highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Starting with our cash at the end of the fourth quarter in 2008, as you can see our global cash balance was about $9.6 billion. That $9.6 billion remains conservatively invested with about 70% of that either directly invested in US Treasury and agency securities or indirectly invested in them through money market instruments whose underlying securities are Treasury and agencies.</p>
          <p>For 2008 looking at our cash flow from operations; as you can see we generated strong cash flow from operations in 2008 improving by $600 million compared to 2007 and as you can see our free cash flows improved year-over-year by $1.2 billion or improved by 29% during 2008.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditures for the year were approximately $700 million, which in turn is $600 million lower then what we spent in 2007. You may recall, that in August of 2007 we told you that we would lower our capital expenditures in response to our restructuring efforts, and ensure an increased cash flow and we are continuing to hold to that commitment. Based on our current cash position and the $2 billion of debt we raised in January of this year, we have more than sufficient liquidity in the US to repay our $1 billion which comes due in November of 2009.</p>
          <p>During the year we repurchased 45 million shares and 13 million of those shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2008. To remind you, we currently have $4.2 billion remaining under our Board authorized stock repurchase programs.</p>
          <p>Turning now to page eight, I'll give you our guidance for 2009. As you can see on the slide, we expect revenues for 2009 to be in the range of 14.8 to $15.2 billion. And let me provide you with some context around Aranesp which is obviously an important moving piece here.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned at our business review meeting in November, we began to see the step down related to label changes in Aranesp in our fourth quarter sales. And the range of expected revenues that I've provided here reflects what we expect the full year impact of the Aranesp label changes to be in 2009 along with the impact of the REMS implementation. And George will have more to say about Aranesp in a moment.</p>
          <p>You may recall, we also mentioned in November that we aspire to grow our earnings per share in 2009. And as such we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range as you can see on the slide of $4.55 to $4.75. Now operating expenses are a bit more difficult to forecast, or to provide guidance for at this point for the following reasons; first is, as Kevin pointed out in his remarks, we will begin to make investments this year to prepare for the commercialization of denosumab. And while these expenses are expected to be incurred primarily in the second half of the year, the timing will clearly be affected by our expected regulatory approval timeline. And although we haven't made any final determinations on commercial partners for denosumab, as we've stated before, it's likely that we'll market denosumab by ourselves in the US, and that we'll seek a commercial partner for outside of the United States.</p>
          <p>Finally, we're continuing to pursue operating efficiencies, particularly in G&amp;A in order to help fund our investment in denosumab in 2009 and we'll keep you apprised of our progress on the denosumab commercialization and the shape of our operating expenses in subsequent quarterly calls.</p>
          <p>Now, just a word with respect to foreign exchange rates. I'd like to share a few thoughts on how movement in 2009 foreign exchange rates could impact our financial performance and we're obviously expecting that the dollar will be significantly stronger in 2009 versus where it was in 2008. As you know the majority of our operating income is denominated &#x2013; majority of our foreign operating income rather is denominated in euros and in 2008 the average foreign exchange rate for the euro was approximately $1.48 to the euro as compared to the current spot rate, which is about $1.32 to the euro. Our guidance takes into consideration some expected volatility around this current spot rate.</p>
          <p>We feel we are well hedged heading into 2009. Let me remind you that we do not hedge revenues and operating expenses separately. We hedge our net foreign currency exposure over a rolling three year horizon with the financial impact of our hedges reflected in the revenue line of the income statement and while foreign exchange volatility could materially affect revenue or operating expenses during the year we don't anticipate material impact to our earnings per share from the foreign exchange volatility.</p>
          <p>And finally a word on capital expenditures for 2009, as in 2008 we're expecting capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Bob. So let's go right to the commercial highlights in slide 10. For the fourth quarter 2008 product sales increased 2% year-over-year with the US growing 1% and international growing 4%. The US Aranesp decline of 22% was largely offset by gains in ENBREL and Filgrastim</p>
          <p>Internationally, our Europe segment continued its strong performance with 8% growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange. It's possible that during the fourth quarter, demand for some of our products particularly those with significant out of pocket cash outlays in less serious conditions were adversely affected by broader economic conditions. As we learn more going forward, we'll share our observations with you.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2008, product sales increased 3% year-over-year driven mainly by growth in our international business. U.S. sales were flat year-over-year with an Aranesp sales decline of 23% offset by the remainder of the sales portfolio which grew 6%. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, international sales grew 5% with Aranesp declining 5% offset by Neulasta growth of 17%.</p>
          <p>The next slide graphically illustrates the components of year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. Consistent with last quarter, Aranesp was the only major component of our product portfolio to decline and was offset by solid growth in the other products. I can assure you that our commercial team is highly focused on stabilizing the Aranesp situation and driving continued growth with the inline products.</p>
          <p>Next I'll discuss each of the products results in more details starting with Aranesp. Worldwide Aranesp sales decreased 15% in the fourth quarter versus last year. In the U.S. Aranesp sales were down 22% year-over-year with oncology sales down 28% and nephrology sales down 8%. After normalizing for quarter end Aranesp volumes, overall segment share decreased by four points versus fourth quarter '07 and by two points versus the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Internationally Aranesp sales declined 2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflecting a decline in overall oncology and nephrology segments. Aranesp share increased slightly year-over-year and I will provide more details on biosimilars in a few moments.</p>
          <p>Next slide. This slide displays the actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to fourth quarter 2006. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs are a largely the result of inventory build ups and depletions, not fluctuation in actual patient utilization. Using red trends lines that indicate average weekly sales, we are highlighting three quarters over the past two years. These lines exclude returns and discount accrual true-ups, as well as the effects of the wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons shown on the pervious slide.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2006, we were averaging $58 million per week. After a significant drop, our sales stabilize in the fourth quarter of 2007 at $32 million per week. Sales remained relatively stable until the oncology label change in August 2008. In the third quarter '08 we averaged $30 million per week. As evidenced on this slide, we have seen distinct step downs in sales, which were caused by culmination of label and reimbursement changes, each having a 10 to 20% impact. And in November, we indicated a possible step down going forward of the same magnitude, due to new contracts, an ESA REMS and potential additional reimbursement changes. In the fourth quarter, we saw the effects of some of these changes with Aranesp sales dropping close to 20% to $25 million per week. It's possible that Aranesp sales may be further affected by an ESA REMS at some point in 2009.</p>
          <p>Next is EPOGEN. EPOGEN grew by 1% in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus the fourth quarter of 2007, driven by patient growth and a slight inventory build, partially offset by a net price decline and lower spillover adjustments. For the full year net sales declined 1%, driven by patient growth and a slight inventory build, offset by a net price decline, a dose decline and lower spillover adjustments.</p>
          <p>For 2009 dose fluctuations may continue as health practitioners refine their treatment practices in order to maintain patient hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 decimeter &#x2013; gram per decimeter range. 2009 growth will be driven primarily by patient growth.</p>
          <p>Next is slide 15. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN combined grew 6% for the fourth quarter '08 versus the fourth quarter '07. In the U.S. sales increased 6% primarily driven by demand and inventory. Internationally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew 3% year-on-year for the fourth quarter '08, 7% excluding foreign exchange effects. Before the effect of foreign exchange, quarter-on-quarter growth would have been positive at 2%.</p>
          <p>2008 full year U.S. Filgrastim growth was 6% driven by demand. Internationally Filgrastim grew 18%, 10% excluding foreign exchange effects. 2009 Neulasta growth will be driven primarily in the U.S. by patient and price growth, while in Europe by continued conversion from NEUPOGEN.</p>
          <p>ENBREL is next on slide 16. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we experienced growth of 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2007. Demand grew 10% year-on-year for the quarter, but was offset by a slight reduction in wholesaler inventory levels, an unfavorable FX rate and an unfavorable one-time item. For the full year sales grew 11% year-over-year to almost 3.6 billion in annual sales. Underlying demand grew 9% year-over-year with solid growth in both rheumatology and dermatology. As a reminder 2008 sales had a one-time impact of approximately $100 million due to the change in our distribution model from the drop shipped directly to customers to distribution via wholesalers. This change occurred in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the rheumatology segment, ENBREL maintains its position as a biologic of choice for rheumatologists and continues to lead the class in segment share. In 2009, we are expecting multiple new products to enter this highly competitive area, but we are comfortable that ENBREL's vast experience and long history of safety in the class will allow us to both grow and maintain our market leadership position in the face of this new competition.</p>
          <p>In the dermatology segment, ENBREL continues to get the majority of first-line biologic use for psoriasis capturing slightly under two-thirds of the dollar share during the fourth quarter. Dermatologists continue to believe that ENBREL has a solid balance of safety and efficacy, but new competition and economic conditions present significant hurdles to growth in this segment in 2009.</p>
          <p>On to Sensipar on slide 17, for the fourth quarter, worldwide Sensipar sales grew 20% versus the fourth quarter of 2007. International sales grew 31%, or 36% excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange. Fourth quarter sales decreased versus the third quarter primarily due to a return reserve adjustment during the quarter as well as the negative effect of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>On a full year basis strong demand delivered 24% year-over-year growth in U.S. which again was offset by a non-recurring adjustment for return reserves. Primary growth drivers for 2009 include greater penetration of patients whose PTH is greater than 300, price and patient growth.</p>
          <p>Next slide, fourth quarter Vectibix sales were $46 million. Our promotional efforts continue to focus on identifying specific and appropriate EGFR eligible patients based on our label. Future growth is highly dependent upon label expansions into first and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer which Roger will comment more on in a moment. Internationally, strong growth continues for Vectibix which contributed 46% of global sales in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now before, we move to international just a couple of words on Nplate. U.S. Nplate continues to experience steady growth in patient enrollment since launch. All physicians must enroll in Nplate's REMS program and our sales force did a terrific job of enrolling almost all key prescribers in a very short period of time. We expect sales to continue to grow as we promote the benefits of Nplate compared to current therapies and by the way, its way to early to comment on the impact of Promacta in this segment.</p>
          <p>The next slide summarizes our international sales performance. Internationally, Aranesp was down 2% overall excluding foreign exchange while strong growth from our other products resulted in overall growth of 8%. This performance reflects a slight increase in segment share with an overall decline in the ESA market and increased share for Neulasta. The next slide looks specifically at new competition in Europe in these segments.</p>
          <p>As you can see on this slide, most ESA competitors and biosimilars have launched in Europe in some major countries and other countries are expected to launch later this year. The net effect should be to accelerate the rate of contraction in Aranesp sales versus the fourth quarter of 2008. For G-CSF biosimilars, we saw the first launches in the first &#x2013; fourth quarter of this year and expect additional launches in 2009. So it's too early to comment on pricing or share dynamics.</p>
          <p>On the next slide we'll look at international segment share for Aranesp in nephrology. Our last quarter call, we showed you that biosimilars had taken share from EPO alpha and EPO beta, but not Aranesp. This remains the case as indicated by the share graph. I think it's important to note, however, that in some situations we respond to competition by lowering the price for Aranesp, but we always strive to maintain a premium to first-generations in the realm of 15 to 30%.</p>
          <p>Clearly physicians recognize the value of our second-generation product Aranesp in that we have actually expanded Aranesp share in nephrology, while the share on oncology has held steady. Roger?</p>

          <p>Thanks, George. As Kevin mentioned, 2008 was an extremely important year for research and development at Amgen with the approval and launch of Nplate and <mark type="inaudible" /> peptibody for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia purpura, and then finally the first registration package for denosumab.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 provides a list of some of the keys events for Amgen R&amp;D in 2008. In addition to the launch of Nplate in the US, we received a positive opinion from the committee for Human Medicinal Products in the EU for the use of Nplate in ITP patients with <mark type="inaudible" /> splenectomy and in treatingsplenectomy patients for whom surgical treatment is not appropriate.</p>
          <p>Denosumab was filed in the US and in Canada for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and for the prevention and treatment of bone loss in patients undergoing hormone ablation therapy for breast or prostate cancer.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we completed enrollment of pivotal studies for Vectibix in the treatment of colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy and we established an important partnership with the Takeda Pharmaceutical Corporation to assist in developing Vectibix along with a dozen programs at earlier stages for the Japanese market.</p>
          <p>Finally, in addition to maintaining impressive productivity through internal research we also licensed an important new therapeutic candidate AMG 761 from Kyowa Hakko in Japan.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 updates our progress in developing denosumab; the slide uses the same format that we've employed in earlier calls. You will note that we completed enrollment of the registration enabling study exploring the ability of monthly denosumab therapy to alleviate diversion of skeletal-related pathology in patients with prostate cancer metastatic to bone.</p>
          <p>Counting this study, we now have four ongoing Phase 3 studies that address the potential utility of denosumab in the oncology setting. The red box in the data availability column provides our best estimate of when we'll be able to share top line data with you for the denosumab skeletal related event studies.</p>
          <p>I wish to emphasize that these studies are event-driven, so we can only estimate when we'll able to close the study, lock the database and perform the analysis. These studies are especially complicated as well because of the need to ensure the adequacy of the central review of radiographs to make certain that all fractures in this population are correctly assigned.</p>
          <p>I should say that I'm especially proud of the work that we did to assemble the denosumab post-menopausal osteoporosis file, which was submitted on schedule in mid-December to U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities and less than a month later to regulatory authorities in the European Union. Our ability to orchestrate this very complex filing involving data from more than 11,000 patients &#x2013; the complete file includes more than 200,000 pages &#x2013; reflects the priority that we have given over the last three years to building an improved data management infrastructure and gives me confidence that we'll be able to assemble very high quality data sets in the denosumab oncology program.</p>
          <p>With respect to the pipeline, as we announced last year, our data safety and monitoring board requested that we replace &#x2013; place enrollment in the MONET1 study, a Phase 3 study exploring the utility of the multikinase inhibitor motesanib to improve the survival of patients undergoing traditional chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer on hold, and that we discontinue motesanib treatment in patients with squamous cell lung cancer. The study is continuing with respect to the majority of the enrolled patients who suffer from pulmonary malignancy of other histologic types. Our results are reminiscent of those that were obtained in the study of Avastin where administration to patients with squamous lung cancer was associated with an unacceptably high frequency of severe or fatal pulmonary bleeding events.</p>
          <p>Hence it appears that in addition the VEGF receptor signaling is associated with toxicities similar to those seen with the Avastin imposed VEGF blockade in this patient population. The DSMB has asked to review the data again in the next few weeks and will advise us to whether enrollment of patient with lung tumors of other histologies in the MONET1 study can commenced. Note that we are developing motesanib in collaboration with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Tokyo-based Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. The remainder of our development program for this molecule, including Phase 2 active comparator control studies remains on track as show on slide 25.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we also obtained Phase 2 results demonstrating that AMG 223, our non-absorbed metal free phosphate binding polymer administrated in association with meals substantially reduces serum phosphate levels as compared with those observed in patients receiving a placebo treatment. While these data are in accord with what has been achieved with other phosphate binders, we have decided to look at a range of options for the development of this molecule rather than perusing it by ourselves. I'll remind you that the development of AMG 223 in Japan is part with the Estellas Pharma.</p>
          <p>Slide 26 provides a summary of key clinical study results that will be able in 2009. This slide does not in any sense capture all of the data that we'll be reviewing this year for 2009 promises to be especially data rich, but rather notes those events that we believe will be of special interest to investors. Included on this slide are the Phase III results of Vectibix in first and second line colorectal cancer therapy. The denosumab Phase III studies that I mentioned earlier, and the TREAT study, which explore the ability of Aranesp to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with renal insufficiency, not on dialysis.</p>
          <p>We'll also be looking at Phase II studies for Motesanib, AMG 102, AMG 222, AMG 386, AMG 655 and recombinant Apo2 ligand/TRAIL, the latter of which we're developing with our colleagues at Genentech. Together these studies will define Amgen's next generation of important therapy, and we're looking forward to reviewing these data with you. Kevin?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the question. Roger, I notice in your AMG 223 comments, a little bit vague relative to the reasoning. But I'm wondering if I could just ask specifically was there an issue with the dose or are you just looking at phosphate levels lowering parameters that were not what you were looking for, maybe you could give us just a little bit more color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chris a little more color. We want very much to introduce drugs that are truly superior, and 223 certainly looks like it has the properties necessary to permit registration as a phosphate binder, but it didn't meet our current criteria in light of our other portfolio opportunities. So we are in the process of reassessing and asking how best to develop the drug. That was all I intended to say in that statement that I made.</p>

I'm not concerned that the agency would reject the file. But obviously, the agency needs to look at it and make their own decisions about how they want to handle it.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a question on the guidance; it seems to imply a certain level of cost cutting measures. I was just hoping you could maybe give us a little bit more insight into that. Is this from R&amp;D? Is it from SG&amp;A? And what portion of the denosumab launch cost should we assume show up in '09 versus 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. With respect to the cost outlook for 2009, I think we demonstrated in 2007 and 2008 that we've been pretty disciplined about expense management, and we will be focused very much in 2009 on our G&amp;A expenses. And with respect to R&amp;D and with respect to the investments in denosumab, we're really not providing any further color beyond what we gave you in November on those operating expense lines.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the way that to think about it is on a nearly $9 billion operating expense base, we've got some flexibility here. As I said in my remarks, it's a low altitude, short time constant year. So, we're going to watch this very carefully and we can adjust. And we're doing everything we need to do this year to get ready for the launch of denosumab. So, we're &#x2013; we have flexibility and we're investing ahead of the &#x2013; what we hope will be a launch.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for taking my question, I appreciate it. This question &#x2013; it may aggravate you little bit, but I've got to ask it. On your Analyst Meeting in November, I thought you guys were very clear that in 2009 your expenses were going to grow faster than revenue. I think that's actually in the transcript? And I'm looking at your guidance that you provided this year and its earnings I think it expressed as a percent growth of zero to 4% and change and revenue down marginally to up marginally. So number one, do you stand by that statement at the R&amp;D meeting or should we be adapting our thinking around that? And then number two if that statement holds is the difference &#x2013; is it a reasonable assumption the difference is share buybacks? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No aggravation there Mark, it's a sharp question. And I can't out of context respond to a very, very long multi-hour day with lots of presentations. So, I don't want try to comment on that. Let me give you, maybe a little bit different altitude response. I think, my overall remarks are, we're trying to invest where we need to invest, that's the pipeline and that's getting ready for denosumab and that's making sure we get enough money to support the products. And we're looking for efficiencies everywhere else we can possibly find them. If there is anything that has perhaps changed in the three months since we talked with you all in November, it's our confidence &#x2013; which was not zero then &#x2013; but it continues to grow and our ability to adjust expenses and make the right investments.</p>
          <p>So, I think what you are seeing in today's guidance is consistent with our aspiration to grow revenues and earnings and get ready for denosumab, and hopefully have this be a multi-year success. But we'll go back on that exact transcript and try to answer the question but I think I have given you a strategic sense of what's going on. There are certainly no major change in our outlook now compared to November with the exception, we are just more confident in our ability to manage expenses and invest in the right place.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A couple of quick questions for Roger on d-mab, did you ask for a priority review in the bone loss associated with cancer indication, and also has the interim analysis in prostate cancer &#x2013; that prevention study. Has that occurred as scheduled in Q4 '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Eric. We did ask for a priority review. However, I caution you that &#x2013; as you know, that it's entirely the FDA's decision on what represent a true priority application and what does not. I mean, we are impressed by the fracture reduction that was achieved as we mentioned before in men with prostate cancer receiving hormone ablation therapy. But they'll have to look at that carefully.</p>
          <p>And yes, we did go through the interim. I just remind you, that was an analysis that really is a tripping point for the Data Safety and Monitoring Board, was there a reason to halt the study for any result, either negative or positive or should it continue as planned. And the outcome from their review &#x2013; it completely blinded. We've not seen anything from it. The Data Safety and Monitoring Board looked at independently; was it should continue as planned.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So I have a question on the more strategic side of things, your cash balance and your cash flow offer some flexibility, obviously you're seeing a decline in revenue or potentially a decline in revenue this year flattening and it puts a lot of the importance on denosumab delivering. Are you thinking about diversifying that at all, looking outside of Amgen in this environment for strategic opportunities? Or have you &#x2013; you're going to continue to pursue share buyback or are you thinking differently about dividends now that you have potentially a position of strength?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, that's a good question. We &#x2013; let me start with the last question. We've said all along that we'd never say never on dividends, but we have no current plans and I'd stand by that statement.</p>
          <p>The other broader question is, I think that we're going to continue to do what we've done in the past, which is opportunistic acquisition focused on good product opportunities. I think over the last eight years we've spent on the order of &#x2013; can't remember the exact number, it's on the order of 18 to 20 billion in acquisitions. Obviously, most of that was Immunex, but still we've done others and half of our pipeline has come from outside the company if you will. So we look for good product opportunities.</p>
          <p>And so, for example, if a product opportunity we were not very interested in was worth &#x2013; was available for $1 last year and now that product opportunity is available for $0.50. We're still not interested because it's not a good product opportunity. But I think what this environment will do is have people who perhaps in the past didn't need money and therefore were not willing to be considered as a partner in acquisition, will, for a variety of reasons hopefully be more willing. So the net effect of this new macroeconomic environment is going to be that hopefully more people raise their hands and want more conversations.</p>
          <p>In terms of diversification, we're in the human therapeutics business and we're going to stay there. And in terms of pursuing, what I would call, industrial mergers to get a relatively brief increase perhaps in earnings per share without meaningful new product or top line growth opportunity, would not be something that interests us. But &#x2013; so we'll continue to be opportunistic and I would guess that we'll keep buying stuff that's good at it becomes available.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>But I will say that certainly we've made many, many acquisitions, and as I look at the scorecard, the net present value of the returns to shareholders in the totality of the program has been quite positive. Certainly, we're going to have a few that worked out better than we thought. A few that were disappointing, but that's the nature of the deal. So, I'll kind of leave it there. We analyze each one internally, and from every one we learn stuff.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. It's a question for Roger. Roger can you just help me clarify a little confusion that I have. When I talked to some of the management offline in November at the R&amp;D day, I can swear that I saw the breast cancer d-mab study was done in terms of all the events happened. So, can you just clarify, is that the case? And if so, is it that it's taking a long time to really, as you mentioned, look at all the scans and make sure everything is in line, or is the study still going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yaron, it's understandable confusion. It is, as you know, as I pointed out an event-driven study. The events that are important are the events that are centrally defined. So, we might reach an endpoint with respect to an internal tally from peripheral sites of fractures, but the question is what do they see at the central level in terms of their radiographic analysis? We are extremely close on the breast cancer study, but we haven't yet hit the final endpoint in terms of total number of events.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got you. And then, once that's completed, how long does it actually take to punch the data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot depends on the fundamental quality of the data. You can imagine that we're busy trying to clean these files as we go along, but there are a lot of queries that get generated, particularly in a study like this where, for example, there's just the clerical imbalances that occur because something is noted at a site but then it doesn't appear in the central record, and you have to reconcile those findings. We can't lock the database until we have reconciled all of those mismatches, and there typically are hundreds of them. So, we're busy doing that, and depending on how long it takes to finally close the last one, that's how long it will take to close the study. It takes some months to do.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This question is for George. You talked about stability of this year sometime for Aranesp in the US. How should we be thinking about international trends? Basically I guess another way to ask this is, is the year-over-year declines in the US really where the international sales are heading?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really hard to tell if they're headed in the same direction as the US. I think US is a bit extreme, because the European oncology segment was never as deeply penetrated as the US. So, I think the way to think about outside the US is we have biosimilars that are not taking share but, as I said, occasionally, we have to relax our price to maintain a good value proposition. So, I think we're setting the biosimilar erosion curve and so we'll just all going to learn from that. I think certainly the oncology market in Europe has a decline going on that's &#x2013; may be parallel in US in terms of slope; but certainly it's not as deep in terms of absolute euros, because it's a smaller market. And I think the doses probably come down a little bit as everybody is being a little bit cautious in terms of what hemoglobin they are titrating to.</p>
          <p>So, generally speaking the European market has held up better than the US, and I expect that to continue, although again we're learning every month when we get new data from the biosimilar situation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George I've a similar question but more detail on the US is what I'm after. So you made a prediction of a 10% step down last quarter and you pretty much got that now to a 25 million a week run rate. And is that the appropriate number to use? Have we troughed here? I mean what's the likelihood of a further step down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So what I said is that it was &#x2013; we've being experiencing 10 to 20% deflections, and already in the fourth quarter we were close to 20%, with the REM still in front of us so I suspect there is a little more to go, but again its very hard to tell until we see the final REMS.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. In the US, I think J&amp;J has said that Procrit has started to regain share in oncology clinics. Can you discuss the market share outlook, and how you're attempting to blunt that threat? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So there are number of dynamics ongoing. We of course went away from our family contracts and that probably had an impact. We're going to be very competitive going forward. I would be disappointed that we continue to lose share at the rate that we've been losing it but, I can't rule out further share declines at the same time.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you guys look to your ex-U.S. partner for denosumab can you just &#x2013; could you help us understand, one, how far along you are on this, I guess getting at how far and advance of launch you need to have a partner given that you've already filed. And then, two, what it is exactly you're looking for from a partner, whether it's more about sharing costs and R&amp;D expense or you want to profit split or royalty stream or how are you looking at structuring these deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we're going to be launching in Europe probably after the U.S. so we've got considerable time. We will be &#x2013; we will have a partner way in advance of when we need to have a partner. And so we're comfortably right on track. I'm not going to say exactly where we are but we're in robust discussions and a lot of interest and there's no question in our minds that there's a really good partner out there and we just have to make sure we choose the best partner.</p>
          <p>What are we looking for? Clearly, we would like to leverage another company's primary care sales capability throughout international and that includes the developed markets, the bigger European markets. But we also don't have a footprint, a commercial footprint in a lot of markets outside of the European Union for example, we just &#x2013; we're gradually expanding that. So certainly a partner could help us commercialize denosumab in places where we don't even have feet on the ground or a distributorship. So that's on the table as well. And we always want a partner who has an ability to challenge our thinking, and has a demonstrated track record of being very successfully in launching products in the primary care space. So, we're looking for a partner that's an intellectual partner, not just a company that's going to rent us some sales capability.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Most of my questions have been answered. I want to ask a question on biosimilar products. It's been over a year since biosimilar products were first approved in ESAs, the first biosimilar ESAs. What have you learned from the launch process in Europe, and are you better prepared now for biosimilars in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we expect biosimilars in the US. We support a law to make that pathway clear, that respects innovator rights and is patient-focused. I am sure we'll get there. I think in Europe, although it's early days, we've found out that we can compete against biosimilars. It's a rational, competitive environment with normal commercial characteristics. This year we're going to learn more as GCS &#x2013; GCSF biosimilars show up.</p>
          <p>But I think before Amgen's major US patent expiries happen in the mid to distant future, we're going to have a good model from Europe about what to know, or what to expect. But I am highly confident that that model is going to be one where we maintain with our products a very meaningful market share and have an experience quite different from what the standard pill pharmaceuticals do. Yet, payers will get the economic benefit that biosimilars will offer and patients will have choice. So I think it will be an important learning experience for us and so far so good.</p>
