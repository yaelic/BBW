          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the GSK Third Quarter Results Conference Call. My name is Heather, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all lines are in listen-only mode. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. At this time I would like to turn you over to your host for today's call Mr. Andrew Witty. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and thanks everybody for joining the call. I am going to make a few comments and ask Julian Heslop, our CFO who is with me to also make few comments and then we will take Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>You've seen today the results reported for Q3 for GSK and I think what they really demonstrate is the progress we are making to really develop the portfolio of this company, to diversify the sources of growth and in this quarter in particular I think you've begun to see those strategies start to deliver.</p>
          <p>For your information, less than 30% of this quarter's sales were generated from what I call white pill western market, compared to 38% in the quarter before I took over as CEO. You know that's something we've been driving towards and I think it's real evidence of the increasing degree of diversification within this company and particularly when you look at where the sources of sales growth are coming from.</p>
          <p>What you are also seeing are the consequences of a disciplined effort to reallocate resources to our key growth areas of the business, which is bringing us back to sales growth for the first time in over two years. That has been driven in particular by the areas we've been investing in, first of all Emerging Markets, where sales for the quarter were up 25%, really a phenomenal performance from Abbas Hussain's region and really reflected across the whole of our Emerging Markets: China, Russia, Latina and Middle East, North Africa. All of those business group performing extremely well. It's been delivered through a portfolio of different products ranging from the most innovative brands such as Seretide through to our classic products such as Augmentin and the uplift in our vaccine businesses.</p>
          <p>During the year so far we've increased by 15% the size of our Emerging Markets sales force`, and just for your information roughly, roughly during the last year or so we've reduced our European and American sales forces by about 2,200 people and we've increased our Emerging Markets sales forces by about 2,200 people, a very good example of where we've been restructuring to reduce our activity in mature markets and investing in growth markets.</p>
          <p>Also during the quarter, we've now made our first regulatory submissions for products from Aspen and from Dr. Reddy's. We've also continued to sign transactions to establish our footprint in China with the vaccine deal for flu and also the deal for MMR with Walvax announced just a few weeks ago, really giving us a much stronger entr&#xE9;e into the Chinese market, where I would remind you there are around 20 million babies per year entering the vaccine population. So Emerging Markets is really a strong growth area for us. We see really substantial opportunity here. I was in Brazil just last week and just another example of an economy which is really beginning to demonstrate huge potential for us in the future.</p>
          <p>If I move to a second growth market where again we have been diverting resources, we have been moving money from mature activities to, this business is Consumer Healthcare where again we've delivered terrific sales growth of 8% versus a market growth of around 1.5%. Our 8% growth has been delivered on a broad portfolio of businesses. Our OTC business was up 9%, our Oral Care business, the toothpaste business, up 10 and our nutritional business led by Lucozade and Horlicks up by four. Alli our new over-the-counter weight loss brand was launched in Europe and is now the largest selling weight loss product in Europe and among the top few OTC brands already.</p>
          <p>What's being driving this business, well you know one of the key priorities is brand innovation, if I just pick one example which is our toothpaste business in America. The launch of iso-active formulations in both Aquafresh and Sensodyne has already delivered a two market share point gain in the quarter and delivered for GSK the highest ever monthly toothpaste market share performance in the month of September. Across our whole consumer business, home-grown innovation of brands contributed a 100 million pounds worth of extra sales in Q3. That's from innovations which were introduced just in the previous three years.</p>
          <p>Our geographic expansion strategy continued apace. As you know, I'm focused on either acquiring or developing our own brands from relatively restricted geographies into a much more of a global position. We've done that in the past with acquisitions such as Breathe Right, we're doing it right now with the Biotene acquisition and of course we're also continuing to do it with our existing brand Sensodyne. It was launched in China at the end of 2008. And we've just signed an agreement to commercialize Lucozade in China, and you should anticipate further announcements on the globalization of our nutritionals business as we move forward.</p>
          <p>If I look at our third area of significant investment, that's Vaccines. In Q3 you'll see that our vaccine growth was not as strong as we've seen in the past, for me that's not surprising, this is a very good example of the volatility that is associated with this business because of the very significant quantity of government tendered in Q2, we had very large European tenders for Cervarix. In Q4 we're going to have very large deliveries of not just H1N1 vaccine but Cervarix, Synflorix, and Rotarix. And it's not surprising to me that we will have the occasional quarters where our vaccine growth rates bounce around. Notwithstanding all of that the underlying performance of our vaccine business is extremely good. In our Pediatric business, in the new innovative vaccines, particularly Cervarix, Synflorix, Rotarix and of course in our flu portfolio more of that later.</p>
          <p>As we look our overall portfolio of vaccines I was delighted to see the progression of a series of approvals in important filings during the quarter. The approval of Cervarix in America and Japan is obviously critical to the brand, and I'm delighted that those two approvals represented countries number 99 and 100 on the Cervarix approval schedule.</p>
          <p>The approval of the novel adjuvant for Cervarix is also a significant landmark for the company as it was for FDA. As you will know FDA have really not approved a novel adjuvant for vaccine pretty much for about 50 years, maybe even in the history of the FDA. And what this really demonstrates is the framework for us now to develop a dialogue with FDA on a wide portfolio of potential vaccines under developments at GSK, all of which incorporate different types of adjuvant technologies. It's a very important milestone to open up the pathway for our new vaccines.</p>
          <p>Pandemrix our H1N1 vaccine was approved in Europe and MenHibrix our new combination vaccine for meningitis was filed in the US in August. We also secured during the quarter a very significant contract for Synflorix in Brazil. This contract has a life of ten years and involves a technology transfer procedure at the end of that period where the Brazilian government has contracted to purchase from GSK 13 million does of Synflorix per year. That's a very significant volume, and represents a meaningful market share of the overall market from an emerging economy. So, suddenly by being successful in an economy such as Brazil, you're all ready in a very big way taking on the competition in this marketplace on a global basis.</p>
          <p>Synflorix roll-out is progressing well. We continue to achieve approvals and we're seeing some very significant wins in terms of retail market share. Typically around 30% of the market is coming to Synflorix in the first few months. We have tender procedures underway in a number of countries and have already begun to win regional tenders in Canada, Australia, Sweden and elsewhere. Some major countries going to tender in the next few months.</p>
          <p>Of course H1N1 remains a huge focus for our organization in total, and of course for our vaccine business. You know we've announced 440 million doses of vaccine have been ordered already by governments, and we are already underway shipping. We shipped in the last three weeks 25 million doses of vaccine. We are on schedule to meet all of our contractual commitments over the next few months. As you'll be aware, these shipments will take place during the balance of this year and into the first half of 2010. I have to say this is all the product of 10 years of very diligent research by scientists at GSK and around $2 billion worth of investment both in the technology and in the manufacturing capacities which are now being put into full production. It's a very significant venture for GSK and has required an enormous amount of activity from across the business.</p>
          <p>If I look at another area of our business where we are really beginning to light-up some very exciting growth opportunities is Japan. I made this a priority when I took over as CEO. I've made several visits to Japan personally and it's an area where we continue to invest significantly on upgrading our capabilities.</p>
          <p>Products in Japan which have been launched in the last three years contributed &#x20A4;170 million in new sales in year to-date '09. It's clear that Japan is capable of moving the needle for this company going forward especially so because we can see very clearly a route to deliver between 30 and 40 line extensions and new chemical entities between now and 2013. We had some great progress in this quarter, Adavair or Advair market share continues to grow and now achieves a 16% market share.</p>
          <p>We also had some phenomenal progress in our R&amp;D efforts in Japan with three significant first time medicines, Avolve or Avodart is the first 5-ARI approved in Japan for BPH and was launched in September ahead of the competition.</p>
          <p>Secondly Cervarix as I just mentioned was the first HPV Vaccine to be approved in October and Promacta, the first TPO agonist was filed in September. The reason I pick those three out is because it really gives evidence to what we've been saying for a while which is that we can deliver the heritage portfolio of GSK, if you will, typified by Avodart/Avolve, the current portfolio of GSK, Cervarix, and the next portfolio of GSK, Promacta and other oncology drugs. We believe we can get these drugs now registered in Japan and really bring an opportunity to have three generations of product hit that marketplace very much simultaneously. This is a terrific opportunity and I am very excited about progress in Japan. This is also been augmented by the Japanese government's decision to import flu vaccines for the first time, which as you know resulted in GSK receiving an order to supply H1N1 vaccine to cover 37 million people in Japan. Again a significant shift in the strategic stance of Japan in terms of opening its market for companies like GSK.</p>
          <p>Our acquisition strategy has again I think demonstrated its ability to contribute to growth. We've seen sales now delivered in Q3 from our acquisitions in the Emerging Markets and of course from Stiefel. Our new dermatology platform is created and we've begun the integration process of that operation already announced in the rationalization of the real estate platform, and in the next few weeks we'll be making announcements about the manufacturing network.</p>
          <p>Stiefel is a very important opportunity for us. It creates a new platform of business and of course it gives us a tremendous opportunity to extract around $250 million of synergy, which will allow us to take that business into a much more profitable state, it's a really good evidence of how GSK can add value to an acquisition target.</p>
          <p>On a much bigger scale next week we will be making announcements to launch our new HIV company, the joint venture with Pfizer which has now received all of its regulatory clearances, and we're going through the final steps of creating that business, which you will see more announced on that on Monday and Tuesday of next week.</p>
          <p>Let me touch briefly on our American business, a huge part of our organization, it's a critical piece of the business and it's a part of the organization which has faced many challenges over the last few years with multiple products been exposed to generic competition for the first time. As you know we are actively engaged in changing our approach to the American marketplace, in the way we structure our sales force, in the way that we have re-approached the managed market, in the way we are managing our contracting strategy and in the way in which we've changed our senior management team.</p>
          <p>I believe that those changes are really beginning to show evidence of a different approach to our environment in the US, and I think they will underpin long-term success for us in the United States. I would also say that when you look at the degree to which our US business has been exposed to very strong headwinds of both genericization of multiple brands and the loss of Avandia, and yet has been able to broadly as a corporation and within the US pretty much hold its own, I think there is a real credit to that business. As we move forward those headwinds will start to diminish. You're already seeing many of the genericizations drop away. We have one more to go which is Valtrex. We're beginning to see Avandia now stabilize particularly post the record results. And on the positive side of the register, the approval of Cervarix, Votrient and Arzerra really represent chances for us to start to reenergize momentum in our base business of the US.</p>
          <p>So, the US is still a work in progress, there is still a lot for us to achieve and certainly a lot to prove. But I'm confident that we have the right strategy here. I'm very sure that we're beginning to see the headwinds diminish and clearly we're beginning to see the ammunition be created for us to start to drive this business forward again.</p>
          <p>I have to say, I think it's probably a rare occasion that a CEO of a drug company can go on to a quarterly call and say that they've received three new molecular entity approvals in the last seven days, and with Cervarix, Votrient and Arzerra I'm very proud to be able to make that claim. We've also during the quarter been reloading our US pipeline with two key FDA filings; one for Avodart in prostate cancer risk reduction and the other our combination meningitis vaccine MenHibrix. All of this represents the building blocks for change in the States, and I believe that we will continue to see those changes executed well over the next year or so.</p>
          <p>Now, our strategic priorities have really been focused on driving our growth and making sure that we drive our business forward from a sales perspective. But of course delivering earnings is also critical, and being absolutely rigorous around cost reduction is also very high on my agenda. I'm very pleased to say that we remain absolutely on schedule to deliver our committed &#xA3;1.7 billion cost saving program, we are now at an annualized cost saving level of &#xA3; one billion and we are being very, very aggressive around how we allocate capital across the organization. You see that in a number of areas, you see it for example in the reduction, if you will, in the percent of sales in R&amp;D, and you see us slightly guiding downwards in terms of the amount we are spending in R&amp;D. And you know that that is in the background of more drugs in development than ever before, with more vaccines in development and more consumer innovation in development than we have ever had. That tells you the efficiency program in R&amp;D is really, really working and great evidence of that is in a molecule like darapladib. So first thing, very strong focus on efficiency.</p>
          <p>Secondly, within the SG&amp;A line we are very much focused on taking expenditures down in mature markets, so to give you an idea of that we've reduced in U.S. and Western Europe our SG&amp;A spend by about 6%, but we've offset that by a 12% increase in our investment areas such as the Emerging Markets. That's the kind of rotation of investment.</p>
          <p>Now as we go forward clearly many of these investment businesses are getting up to the level we need to get to. So as we move into the next year or so what we'll be focused on is ensuring that our sales growth is really then translated into strong earnings growth and that's obviously the objective we want to move this organization to, and I've been clear on since I took over, that that's the shift in the business model we wanted to achieve and we are making good steps in that direction.</p>
          <p>Now if I just finish-off on pipeline, it wouldn't be right to miss what has been a very strong quarter for R&amp;D. We still have 30 drugs in late-stage development, a metric we've set for ourselves in spite of the fact of achieving 10 products approval so far this year. I've already mentioned two new filings, our MenHibrix and Avodart for prostate cancer. We made two terminations, but both relatively small molecules. One was Rezonic we just didn't believe it was worth the allocation of further R&amp;D and launch investment, it was a poor investment decision to carry on so we terminated. And we also terminated mepolizumab for an orphan indication HES, because we couldn't see a regulatory pathway. I am very pleased to say that that molecule has also however been identified as a potential molecule for severe asthma and that clearly represents a much more significant commercial opportunity.</p>
          <p>We also made progress in some of our major Phase III programs. So darapladib has now well on the way through it's first trial, 15,000 patients have been enrolled in the first study, it's enrolled about six months ahead of schedule, we'll be up to full enrollment in the next couple of weeks. We've already executed the first interim safety analysis, in particular looking at blood pressure, as you know many cardiovascular or putative cardiovascular medicines have failed because of raises in blood pressure, we wanted to dismiss that risk early before we spent a lot of money on this program, delighted to say that the results from that study were extremely reassuring and we're carrying on full speed on study 1, and we will be initiating the second study shortly. So we will have studies both in the heart failure group and the post ACS group going forward. The second study will recruit around 13,000 patients.</p>
          <p>Let me also just make a quick comment on an announcement we made yesterday. I am very pleased that Horizon COPD initiated first patient dosed last week, we made the announcement yesterday. Horizon of course is just one of a portfolio of respiratory medicines that we are now moving forward to essentially build on our Advair position in the respiratory market.</p>
          <p>As far as biopharmaceuticals are concerned when I took over as CEO I made this a priority for the company to establish itself as &#x2013; within its R&amp;D portfolio a player in biopharmaceuticals. You've seen some significant delivery in this area. Collaboration with Amgen for denosumab in the European Union and Emerging Markets is one example. Arzerra's approval is our first large molecule approval, and of course the very good data for Benlysta also gives us a great optimism going forward. We'll see the second data in the next few days, so we'll see. But nonetheless some good evidence of progress in biopharms.</p>
          <p>And for your information we now have six large molecules in late stage development and 15% of our overall clinical pipeline is biopharmaceutical. Again reinforcing the drive in this organization to build a business which has greater annuity value and a greater degree of predictability, even within the R&amp;D portfolio, and then augmented by the other growth businesses such as Consumer and Vaccine.</p>
          <p>Cash generation for the quarter was sustained, and that allows us to support our progressive dividend. Cumulative net cash inflow from operations was up 10% and as a result we are increasing our quarter three dividend by 7% to 15 pence per share.</p>
          <p>On that note I just conclude by saying that I believe Q3 reinforces our expectations of an improved performance for GSK in the second half of 2009. And Q4 I expect we will see further improvement including substantial sales generated from our influenza products.</p>
          <p>With that I'll hand over for Julian to give you a little bit more detail on the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Andrew and as usual I'll comment on the results using constant exchange rates and also excluding major restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>Turnover in the quarter was up 3% to 6.8 billion with Pharmaceuticals up 2% and Consumer Healthcare up 8. US Pharma performance continued to be impacted by generic competition and turnover there declined 12%. However, Pharmaceuticals growth in other regions was strong with sales up 3% in Europe, 25% in Emerging markets, and 13% in Asia-Pacific, Japan. Stiefel contributed sales of &#xA3;111 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>At the product level, total sales of Advair rose 5% to over 1.1 billion. The reported U.S. Advair decline of 1% was impacted by both stocking patterns and the true-up of rebate provisions. Our best estimate is that underlying growth in the U.S. was around 4% in the quarter. Advair grew very strongly in all other regions. Relenza sales were 182 million in the quarter and reflected significant pandemic stockpiling orders from governments around the world. Other strong pharma performances included Avodart, Lovaza, and Tykerb, with sales growth of 14%, 27%, and 54% respectively. However, Avandia sales declined by 14%. Sales of newly launched pharmaceutical products totaled 318 million in the quarter and this brings the year-to-date sales contribution from these products to over &#xA3;960 million.</p>
          <p>Our Consumer Healthcare business reported strong sales growth of 8% well ahead of estimated market growth. We delivered sales growth in our OTC, Oral Healthcare, and Nutritional sectors, and saw good performances from our Sensodyne franchise and weight loss treatment alli, which was launched in Europe earlier in the year. However Lucozade and Ribena continued to be impacted by lower demand in Europe in the Impulse segment.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results before major restructuring costs in more detail, you will have seen that cost of goods for both the quarter and the year-to-date was just less than one percentage point higher as a percentage of turnover than the prior year. This principally reflects the impact of generic competition to higher margin products in the U.S. and changes to product mix including the Stiefel acquisition in the quarter. We continue to expect full year cost of goods to be in the range of 24 to 25% of sales.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A costs, excluding legal charges, were 29.6% of turnover in the quarter. This is higher than the prior year reflecting the increased investment we are making in growth markets, the consolidation of the Stiefel business for the first time and increased pension costs partly offset by the benefits of the restructuring program, which are reducing costs in both U.S. and Europe. You'll appreciate that the SG&amp;A margin is a function of both the phasing of cost and turnover, and with a significant boost to Q4 turnover expected from H1N1, I continue to expect the SG&amp;A margin excluding legal charges to be around 29% for the full year.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D costs were favorably impacted in the quarter by a provision release due to reassessment of a receivable balance. Excluding this item R&amp;D costs in the quarter were 13.6% of turnover. I now expect full year R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of sales to be broadly in-line with 2008.</p>
          <p>In the quarter Other Operating Income was 123 million and this included normal royalty income of &#x20A4;74 million. Year to-date Other Operating Income is 582 million and I now expect the total for this line for the year to be more than 700 million. This does however exclude the one-off accounting gain we will make on the formation of the new HIV Company with Pfizer which we will report in the fourth quarter. In addition, as you will recall, we've already reported a gain of 115 million on our disposal of Quest shares earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>The cumulative effective tax rate is now 28.8%, which is broadly in line with last year's rate of 29%, and I continue to expect the full year rate to be around 29%. Earnings per share before major restructuring costs was 28.5p for the quarter, down 3% in CER terms. Currency continued to be beneficial in the quarter, and the actual Sterling EPS growth excluding major restructuring charges was 13%, reflecting a 16% currency benefit. I don't currently expect a currency benefit in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The restructuring program is progressing well and after deducting charges of 152 million in the quarter, we reported total EPS of 26.3 pence.</p>
          <p>You will have also seen the commitment we have given to provide more P&amp;L information from next year on our major business units. This will include our major trading segments such as US Pharma, Emerging Markets, and Consumer Healthcare, but we will also provide additional memorandum information on our global vaccines and dermatological businesses.</p>
          <p>Finally, if you look at the nine month cash flow, you will see that the net cash inflow from operating activities was &#xA3;5.6 billion. Working capital moved adversely in the quarter reflecting an H1N1 and Synflorix stock build, but I expect it to be positive for the full year before taking account of any abnormal levels of H1N1 inventory and receivables. Cash generated by the business was used to fund capital investment of 1.2 billion, pay dividends of 2.3 billion, and fund the majority of the acquisition spend of 2.7 billion. Net debt was flat compared to last year and reflected net cash utilization of some 800 million almost exactly offset by favorable exchange rate movement.</p>
          <p>Overall the company is on track to deliver its strategic programs and remains committed to its progressive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand back to Andrew.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Three quick questions, firstly could Andrew comment on experience with NICE and Tykerb? We've watched GSK apparently turn somersaults trying to get the NICE happy on the cost benefit of the drug. Is this a worrying sign for dealing with other systems such as IQWiG in terms of getting reimbursements?</p>
          <p>Second on the US turnaround, could you give us some sense of how long you think it will take and how much it depends on product mix versus on integrating the two sales forces? And then finally, on your HIV &#x2013; HPV vaccine franchise in the US. What market share in the US do you think is achievable after how long with Cervarix? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Andrew, thanks for the questions. Yes, we have been jumping somersaults with NICE. And we continue to go through a process with them, it's not over, but it is very difficult, and I think there is no doubt that NICE, you've seen this with many other companies and particularly with end-of-life type drugs. It's a very different environment trying to work with NICE. There is very little read-across, to be honest with you Andrew, to other authorities, even in Europe.</p>
          <p>So whether it be IQWiG or Transparency Commission in Paris, we haven't had the same issues. We have &#x2013; Tykerb essentially reimbursed and doing very well actually in Continental Europe. So NICE is a &#x2013; at this point a standalone issue. We don't see a read-across. There is a philosophical difference between the way NICE operate and many of the other authorities and it doesn't &#x2013; it's not easy to negotiate through.</p>
          <p>As far as the US is concerned, lot of change going on in the US. The restructure of the sales force is basically done. That's behind us I think they're really beginning to get into their groove, we're seeing the respiratory sales organization I think really get back into its step. That's reflected in the beginnings of some sustained volume growth on Advair which is important obviously. And I think something I'm very pleased to see, continue to see that albeit relatively low numbers but nonetheless positive, and that's good.</p>
          <p>So I think the sales force is in pretty good place structurally. A lot of effort going in right now in terms of modernizing our managed care approach and making sure we're ready for healthcare reform, making sure we have the right value propositions, making sure we have the right balance of discounting versus access and not be too far over balanced in one direction or another, all of that is underway. And no doubt this is a journey which will take some time to get right.</p>
          <p>In terms of what the US business looks like over the next year or two &#x2013; there are two or three big drivers. Obviously there is all the change program that I am just describing to you, and I think as each month goes by I'm confident that this will all improve the US for the better. Secondly, it's about what happens to Valtrex, so when exactly do we see generic competition to Valtrex will have an influence on our US and obviously the overall business. And thirdly in our ability to commercialize some of our newer products, particularly products like Cervarix, Votrient and let's wait and see for the Benlysta trials, but if the Benlysta second trial comes through positively that's a significant opportunity for the US in the relatively near term.</p>
          <p>So that &#x2013; and what I like about the US is the portfolio swings are starting to move in our favor. It's not over yet because we still have Valtrex, but the portfolio swings are beginning to move our way. We've demonstrated again an ability to get significant new products approved, including products like Cervarix, to get those approved by FDA. That is giving us now a balance of products which allows us to feel more confident about the future.</p>
          <p>We have to work our way through Valtrex and we have to make sure that our capabilities and our presence in the US is properly matched to our portfolio and the environment, but it's going in the right direction, it's absolutely going in the right direction. I was there last week for a week. I met with the top 1,000 leaders of our US organization. And I have to say I came away from that meeting feeling like our people are very revved up and our people feel confident about the future, which is 90% of the challenge in these sorts of things.</p>
          <p>As far as HPV vaccine, I mean you're not going to be surprised although I've been very confident we would get approval Andrew, you also know that I'm not the kind of person who is going to give you a specific market share forecast. The only thing I would say is I think that Rotarix serves as a pretty reasonable kind of proxy. So again, we &#x2013; although we were the first in the world to launch a rotavirus vaccine, we were not first to launch in America. We've launched after Merck and I think you can see from our performance there that we've been able to take some pretty material market share. And so maybe that's a good proxy without me having to give you a specific number which you know I just don't do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Gbola Amusa, UBS. Three questions. First on your Horizon program disclosure yesterday. The program's showing you're testing your lab with your inhaled corticosteroid, but doesn't mention other compounds. Can you confirm that this press release isn't effectively ruling out a triple combo being progressed ahead of the results of the studies which just started?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the impressive 35% Emerging Markets growth, our market share data's now showing Glaxo is pretty impressive in most regions, just about everywhere except certain Latin American countries. Would you update us on your strategy in those Latin American regions ahead of your Emerging Markets Day, especially given what's happened with business development activities in 2009? And then lastly, I'll push my luck a little bit, if I may. Could you comment on your understanding of the status of Ranbaxy's ability to launch a generic Valtrex in the US at year end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Gbola. It's an interesting set of question. So as far as Horizon is concerned, the announcement yesterday was only about the announcement yesterday. So, and you know how thoughtful I am about how much we say about what we're doing in respiratory, we're by far and away the leader in this field and I'm not in the business of giving any of my competitors any help.</p>
          <p>And I would refer you to comments I've made previously which is Horizon is just one of a portfolio of products which we expect to develop, so that we will build on the Advair foundations not with a single brand, but with multiple new products. And maybe just leave it at that because rather than get into all the nuances of it. I think for sure you should not regard Horizon's announcement yesterday as being the totality of our respiratory strategy, completely the opposite. It's an update on one, one of the lead programs, but by no means a comprehensive coverage of it.</p>
          <p>As far as Emerging Markets are concerned, absolutely we're very, very pleased with the progress. I think what you are seeing is region after region essentially click into our comprehensive strategy for Emerging Markets, so what does that look like? It looks like making sure we are doing the best we can with our established core GSK innovative products, so Seretide fabulous growth rates in Emerging Markets for Seretide.</p>
          <p>It means making sure our classic portfolios like Augmentin and Ventolin, which remain extremely big brands are growing very well, it means bringing in other brands, so this is product coming from outside of the company like UCB, BMS, we've now begun to file the Aspen and Reddy's portfolios, all of those coming together, and really hit Vaccines out of the park. I mean those are, it's a kind of playbook for our business. If you look our Middle East, North Africa, you see all of those things flying in parallel and you see all of our regions beginning to come up to speed on that same approach. Now, in some countries it takes longer. China we need to establish some joint ventures before we can get Vaccines to where we needed it to be. But that's the strategy.</p>
          <p>You are absolutely on the money about Latina. I was in Brazil two weeks ago, spent a very &#x2013; it was a very good chance for me to go meet both with government and with our organizations in Latina. But no doubt in my mind at all that this is a huge opportunity for GSK, this is a priority area for us to invest in, either organically or inorganically if we see the right opportunity. We are clearly making great progress on one of our key planks which is our vaccine business.</p>
          <p>Rotarix is a very significant player for us in Latina particularly in Mexico, but certainly across the board, and the Synflorix deal with Fiocruz is a very material deal, 30 million doses a year for a decade is a very big deal and represents a substantial amount of market share from that overall marketplace globally.</p>
          <p>So yes Latina is key, the playbook will be very analogous to the playbook we're deploying around all of our Emerging Markets, and you should anticipate us looking to invest either organically or if we see opportunities for bolt-on then we will do that. We do, as you may also know Gbola, have a tenth of December update coming up on Emerging Markets when you get a chance to talk to Abbas who is obviously driving all of this.</p>
          <p>As far as Ranbaxy and Valtrex, this is all down to whether or not they can get their act together, right? So I don't know the answer to that. And we have to wait and see &#x2013; all I can tell you is as of today I am not hearing anything on the presence of a potential generic, it doesn't mean to say it isn't going to be there, I don't know. I can't give you any guidance on that. The only people can really give you on that of course are the generic manufacturer. So I am sorry I can't help you on that, but thanks for the question.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Few questions, I know it's a little bit tough to talk about a drug ahead of data being released, but can you expand a little bit on your level of excitement with Benlysta? Any nuances we need to appreciate as we approach the next data set. And assuming that data is positive what would be the development timeline from there?</p>
          <p>On H1N1, in the past you've talked about that being a sustainable revenue stream. From your direct competitors who have skin the game say something very different, say it's not a sustainable revenue stream, and I'm wondering why there is a difference in opinion. And last question is SG&amp;A, if you exclude Stiefel out of the numbers what would have been the figure? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. I'm going to ask Julian to answer the third question, but let me take the first two Tim. So Benlysta, obviously we were thrilled to get the data from the first Benlysta trial and we will have the data from the second trial in the next few days. So this is one of, thanks for the question because depending on what that data set I could look pretty silly pretty quickly. But listen, we were thrilled to see that first study come in. The fact that it was so comprehensive and positive in a population where everything else has failed, that obviously caught everybody's imagination, we were thrilled by that. I am very proud of the people at GSK who are involved in the trial design because I think that's a real credit to the skills of our R&amp;D organization. How that got done with HGS first off.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if the data that's coming in over the next few days reaffirms the first study then this is a very significant opportunity for ourselves and HGS. This is a unmet medical need, significant population, not everybody with lupus is going to use this product, obviously there are other &#x2013; people are going to go through steroids and other treatments first, but nonetheless this is a significant population.</p>
          <p>I think if we have two positive studies we're going to be heading for a rapid filing, hopefully in the first quarter of next year. I would hope that we would achieve an accelerated review given that nothing has ever been proven to work for 50 years. And we, all going well, I'd like to see this to be a material source of growth for us in the pretty near term future, but it all depends on the results of the trial coming up in the next few days, and as a result I can't be more definitive than that.</p>
          <p>Now as far as H1N1 is concerned, what I've said is I believe we will have peaks and shoulders in this market. I don't believe it's going to be steady state at the high levels we're seeing now. I think we will see peaks and shoulders. Why do I say that? Primarily because we have such a broad portfolio of products in this space. So in addition to H1N1 we've got Relenza, we've got flu mask, we've now got diagnostic products being developed. So first of all we have a broader portfolio.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I think it's really important to understand the difference between GSK's adjuvanted vaccine and the non-adjuvanted vaccine as far as stockpiling is concern. So, if you go with a non-adjuvanted vaccine, then essentially you have to wait until you know what the antigen is before you can buy the vaccine, by definition. If you go with an adjuvanted technology, you can actually keep a stockpile of your adjuvants and then simply rotate in the antigen at the last minute, right, which is basically what the leading countries like Switzerland do. So, Switzerland actually stockpiled from us three years ago, H1N1 antigen and adjuvant. It turned out, sorry, I'm sorry, H5N1 antigen and adjuvant, it turned out that the pandemic wasn't H5N1. So, they didn't use the H5N1 antigen and they reordered from us, H1N1 antigen to go with the adjuvant they already had on hand.</p>
          <p>And so what you will see, I believe, is a range of behaviors from governments as they continually keep now a stock of both anti-virals and vaccines, and in our case keeping the adjuvant is a real option for them as a standby ready to plug with whatever antigen they need. The reason why this becomes more material compared to prior to May 2009, pre-May 2009 there were probably less than 10 countries in the world that we're running any kind of materials stockpiling strategy. And those stockpiling strategies were almost all entirely Tamiflu driven, so it was anti-viral and it was Tamiflu.</p>
          <p>Today, something like 60 countries are running stockpiling strategies. They include both anti-viral and vaccine, and within the anti-viral portfolio, they've rebalanced their stockpiles to be much more heavily weighted &#x2013; so much more of it is Relenza than it use to be, still majority Tamiflu, but still now a big chunk of Relenza.</p>
          <p>So what's been created during the summer is essentially a stockpiling marketplace, which over a period of time will need to be refreshed, either because of product obsolescence or because of new challenges in terms of strain development, and that's exactly where we see there had been some kind steady-state. I am not promising that it's going to be 90% of this year's sales, but it's going to be something more than we've seen in the past and it's going be less sporadic than what we've seen in the past, and that's why we take that view.</p>
          <p>I'll ask Julian to comment on the SG&amp;A question.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Alexandra Hauber, JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I've got three four questions. Firstly on the Horizon program, I seem to remember that around the second quarter results when you first talked about, and you also were mentioning a mobi-mortality study which wasn't part of your announcement yesterday. Is that something you're not going to do, or is that something you considered to do more in a post-approval setting? And also from your announcement about the study that is conducted against another COPD medication. Can we rule out that this is going to be Advair your active comparator?</p>
          <p>Secondly, obviously your government orders you have for H1N1 products for bulk adjuvant and vaccine is worth over 2 billion sterling. How much of that will you ship this year? Because your ratios you're giving for the various cost supplies are of course percentage of sales, so the H1N1 shipment in the fourth quarter becomes a very important part of our calculations. And then finally, you said, you emphasized that the first approval of a novel adjuvant in the US open possibilities for new vaccines. Beyond flu, are there any other areas you could point to that could be of interest? Oh actually and I have one other question, can you just remind us what the shelf life of bulk adjuvant is once it's on the stockpile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Alexandra, thanks for the questions. So as far as the Horizon program is concerned, we're basically, again I'm going to reiterate what I said already, we are being frugal with what we're saying about these programs for completely obvious reasons. What we announced yesterday is what we announced yesterday is not the whole story of the trial program of Horizon, okay. We will, as I've said previously, we will run a very big program, it will involve a big focus on generating differentiation and it will include trials involving active comparators, and it will have many thousands of patients in it. The studies we announced yesterday are, if you will, the core regulatory program, but rest assured that we're tackling this opportunity in exactly the way I've described to you before.</p>
          <p>As far as the flu, the H1N1 sales, I think a good guide, I think consensus actually in the market is pretty close to what I'd expect in Q4 to be honest with you. The only caveat I'd say is obviously by the end of the year, we're going to be manufacturing and shipping very large quantities per week. And therefore if we have a -- if things go slightly better or slightly worse in a particular week at the end of December, then you could see that number bounce around a little bit on the margin. But I think consensus estimates for H1N1 shipments in Q4 are pretty reasonable.</p>
          <p>As far as adjuvant is concerned, if you look our portfolio it's a very significant piece of our development program. So in addition to Cervarix, in addition to H1N1 our flu improved, so this is our improved seasonal flu vaccine which is particularly for elderly and other populations who historically don't get such a good immune response from non-adjuvanted vaccines. It's there, it's in our MAGE-A3 therapy or a set of adjuvants or in our MAGE-A3 therapeutic cancer vaccines and they are also in our malaria vaccines. So there is, the adjuvant technology is a major platform for the company.</p>
          <p>In terms of shelf life, work in progress Alexandra, but my expectation is it will be probably between three and five years, but obviously the shelf life, just as it has done with Relenza, shelf life is extended the longer you have time to generate more data. My expectation is that for the adjuvant it's likely to be three to five years, and for the antigen it's more like 18 months.</p>
          <p>Now just to be absolutely clear, at the movement we have a two year shelf life on Pandemrix, but my expectation is that over time we will be able to extend it, because I know what you're trying to get to which is trying to work out obsolescence of stockpiles. So over the period of a stock-pile I think we will be able to generate shelf life data which is more in the three to five years, although as of today we are at two years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Alexandra. I'd just like also to make a correction I think when I was talking about darapladib earlier, which is a product I'm very, very pleased to see progress so well, I think I described it in trials for ACS patients and congestive heart failure, I should have said of course chronic coronary heart disease which is different. So just I want to make sure in case anybody did pick that up and thought I was having a senior moment, I was, and that's a minor correction.</p>
          <p>Next question?</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Graham Parry [Merrill Lynch]. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking my questions. And just starting of on Relenza, the 180 million you've booked in the third quarter was probably a little bit above certainly our expectation. I was just wondering if you can give us an update there on current capacity and whether there is the potential to exceed previous capacities that you've talked about. Secondly, just looking at Promacta just wondering why the CLD study was suspended there. I remember that the Hep C study also was suspended briefly at one point, so if you can just make any comment on that.</p>
          <p>And thirdly on Horizon, having see Novartis running into some dosing issues at the regulator and QAB149. I was just wondering what conversations you've had with FDA on dosing in 444 in Horizon and how certain you are you won't fall down a similar path with them. And then finally on Benlysta just in a hypothetical situation where you saw borderline data at 76 weeks, so for example a trend, but not statistically significant &#x2013; can you combine the studies to try and get a meta analysis to regulate it, or could you still attempt filing on one study? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Graham. Okay, interesting set of questions again. So Relenza, yes we've had a very good run obviously in Relenza. We have been able to increase our capacity quite a bit. So we've previously talked about a capacity of around 60 million packs a year, we're actually running at closer to 90 million as of now. And we are putting in place new capacity which will take us well over 100 million packs from the end of next year onwards. We've also put into production a second device, a much simpler device, a lower cost device, Rotacaps for frankly lower price marketplaces, and that capacity is just about coming on stream now. So we will have more and more capacity as we go forward. Things are going very well as far as Relenza is concerned.</p>
          <p>Promacta, this was &#x2013; so what we've seen in this chronic liver disease population was some thromboembolic events which as you know there is a background tendency for these sorts of events to come along in these sorts of patients because of sluggish blood flow and the like, and so what's going on at the moment is trying to untangle. Is it possible for us to untangle whether there is a drug effect or not a drug effect, so that's why it's on hold. We've got a variety of dialogue going on at the moment to figure out what's going forward, it has no impact on any of the other indications for Promacta all of which are carrying on, but that's the issue there. It's really just trying to un-pick the different pieces.</p>
          <p>As far as I have seen over the last three months many of our respiratory putative competitors run into issues. Obviously we keep an eye on all of those things and obviously we make sure that we learn any lessons we come from that. I am very content that the start of our Phase III program for Horizon was all agreed with FDA, but nonetheless I think you always have to keep on going back and making absolutely sure there is nothing to be learned, and we will make sure of that. But once again I think it simply reiterates what I said repeatedly is that bringing an inhaled respiratory medicine to the marketplace, especially in America, is a very, very challenging thing to do. This company has achieved it in the last four decades and I think this is a company that is experienced. We are very open-eyed about keeping up with the latest demands of regulators and I am confident that we're in the right direction.</p>
          <p>As far as Benlysta is concerned I'm kind of not going to address your question because it's so hypothetical and it's so proximate to the data coming out Graham, and I just &#x2013; so listen, the first data is fabulous, let's see what the second data looks like, and then we will make &#x2013; obviously we and the regulators will take a view on what can be reasonably expected. So I am going to frustrate you on that one, but we will be able to talk to you about it with the real data next week.</p>
          <p>Okay, last question please?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just two questions from me. On Arzerra could you talk a little about your reimbursement expectations given what I gather is a fairly high price for a six month course, I think close to $100,000 was mentioned by Gen Lab yesterday. What disclosure have you had with those who might reimburse it? And secondly, how should we think about, in the longer term the reinvestment of the cost savings of 1.7 billion which you've clearly been putting into those other markets. How long will it take before some of those savings make it down to operating profit, if ever?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Kevin, listen, thanks for the questions. So as far as Arzerra is concerned, obviously Arzerra's first indication is really, it's a very, it's a narrow indication, these are refractory patients, CLL patients and they do receive a very high dose. If you then look at the rest of the indications in development for Arzerra you'll see much lower doses. So I don't anticipate a huge issue with reimbursers because it's not as if this price is being applied to a very high volume of patients, it's not.</p>
          <p>It's for a niche indication, and as the bigger volume indications come along those folks receive a lower drug weight, and really the best way to think about this is a price per milligram rather than the total price. Obviously ultimately it's a total price, but the way to think about the pricing strategy is much more around price per milligram. And then you just simply need to understand what the likely dose weights will be for those other bigger volume indications down the road. So that's the first part.</p>
          <p>The second question, in terms of the flow of benefits from the investment, well clearly we've been through a phase where we've been, it's obvious that you have to invest ahead of the curve to try and generate returns. And what we're going to be looking for from our investment businesses is that improvement in both sales growth and then earnings growth. And I think Consumer is a really good example of that where we've been ramping up our expenditure, you see in this quarter again very good sales growth, you see earnings ahead of sales growth, and that's the kind of performance obviously you want to try and get businesses to get to.</p>
          <p>What I am not prepared to do is to short-change the investment and fall short of the long-term opportunity. What I've said repeatedly is that we will deliver the best we can in terms of earnings performance in the first two or three years that I'm CEO, but meanwhile in parallel we are going to reinvent the business model of this company so we are not vulnerable to major patent expirations, major troughs which create enormous volatility for the investor.</p>
          <p>To do that we need to make sure we have a reliable delivery from our R&amp;D portfolio, and we need to make sure that our businesses are properly built to compete wherever they are, and that means making sure we have the right investment level and then we start, we'll titrate the flattening off of that investment curve when we feel comfortable that we are there, and that will be different in different parts. So I can tell you we're more likely to hit that point in Middle East North Africa than we are in Latina, because we have a lot more opportunity to grow in Latina from where we start. So you will start to see that discipline being applied.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would say to you is, we will continue to look for further incremental cost savings in this company. I don't believe that's over. I think this organization has plenty of capability to drive more efficiency out of it, and you should anticipate seeing a continued focus on delivering more cost efficiency because it's obvious than we need to make sure we're driving the best earnings performance we can alongside a recovery in sales line. I think the momentum of this business is going in the right direction. I think the progress on our strategies is now becoming clearer and clearer and obviously what we need to do is maintain that as we go forward.`</p>
