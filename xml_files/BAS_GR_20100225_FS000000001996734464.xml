        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and a warm welcome from all of us to the BASF 2009 annual results conference call. The past year has continued to be a challenging environment, but the early and decisive steps taken by BASF has delivered strong results and enhanced our competitive position for the future.</p>
          <p>With me on the call today, are Dr. J&#xFC;rgen Hambrecht, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, Dr. Kurt Bock, our Chief Financial Officer, and Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel, Member of the Board of Executive Directors, responsible for the Oil and Gas segment and the Integration of Ciba.</p>
          <p>In the next 30 minutes, Dr. Hambrecht and Dr. Bock and Dr. Engel, will talk about the business development in 2009, especially with a special view on the fourth quarter and then comment on the business prospects for 2010. Dr. Engel in particular will give you an update on the progress we made with respect to the Ciba integration, as well as the synergies generated.</p>
          <p>Following their presentation, all three gentlemen will be happy to take your questions. Just a usual reminder, today's conference call will be limited to one hour. I would therefore like to ask you that you limit your questions to one at a time. We've also posted the presentations and the speeches on our website under the basf.com/share.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to hand over to Dr. Hambrecht.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to all of you around the world for joining us today. We successfully cleared very high hurdles in 2009. We coped successfully with the economic crisis. We integrated Ciba. We stepped up our operational excellence programs and in the end we finished the year with a strong performance.</p>
          <p>Q4 was the first quarter where significantly, where we significantly exceeded previous year's earnings figures. However, don't forget the base effect of the difficult Q4 in 2008. Kurt will give you more details on that later.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009, sales declined by 19% to &#x20AC;51 billion, EBITDA declined by 23% to &#x20AC;7.4 billion translating into an EBITDA margin of 14.6%, which exceeds our minimum goal of 14% under trough conditions as you remember. We generated a record cash flow of &#x20AC;6.3 billion, up 25% compared with the previous year. Even though we narrowly missed our goal of earning our cost of capital, we are proposing the payment of an appropriate dividend &#x20AC;1.70 per share, which translates into an attractive dividend yield of almost 4%.</p>
          <p>Sales volumes 2009 declined by 9%, demand however started to recover in the second half of the year and volumes in Q4 exceeded the corresponding period of 2008. In 2009, prices declined significantly in nearly all divisions and we are 14% lower than 2008, acquisitions, mainly Ciba contributed 4% to sales, currency effects had almost no impact.</p>
          <p>The regional sales dynamics of our chemical activities over the last five quarters differentiate clearly between Europe and North America on the one hand, where sales remained 20% and 27% below the pre-crisis levels, and Asia-Pacific and South America on the other hand, where we recovered rapidly. In Q4 sales were only five and 6% below pre-crisis levels.</p>
          <p>How did we manage our way out of the downturn? Our activities in 2009 were focused on two priorities. First, ensuring liquidity and profit in the short term, and second shaping the future and securing our leading position in the long-term. All our actions are based on four strategic guidelines leading us to profitable growth and you know about them. We want to achieve attractive returns, deliver innovative products and solutions to our customers, provider our employees with interesting perspectives and career development opportunities, and offer our customers, shareholders and the society at large, problem solutions.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we delivered on our promises. Despite the difficult business environment and special charges related to the Ciba acquisition, we missed our goal of earning our cost of capital by only &#x20AC;226 million. Our efficiency improvement project NEXT is clearly on track. The EBITDA margin of 14.6% exceeded our target for trough conditions and working capital management was highly successful and led to a record cash flow.</p>
          <p>In 2009, the BASF team, including the former Ciba employees, delivered a world-class performance by showing utmost flexibility in work allocation and execution, setting new technical benchmarks in successfully operating plants at very, very low capacity utilization rates, shaping our future through outstanding innovations. BASF was ranked number one in the new overall Patent Asset Index in 2009.</p>
          <p>In helping our customers to be more successful, we increased our R&amp;D expenditure with a special focus on close to customer development in the regions, we strengthened our market focus through newly implemented industry and customer target groups, we developed new system solutions which helped for example Tata Nano to be energy-efficient and affordable to a very broad class of consumers, and we have been acknowledged by many of our customers, for example by Procter &amp; Gamble through "Supplier of the Year" awards.</p>
          <p>For us, ensuring sustainable development means to combine economic success with environmental protection and social responsibility: We constantly improve BASF's corporate carbon footprint, which was confirmed at 3 to 1. In 2009 we started for example a new process to produce cyclododecanone in which we use nitrous oxide or laughing gas as you may know, as a key raw material. Laughing gas has 300 times the CO2 global warming potential of &#x2013; as I said of CO2. Through our newly started social business at BASF Grameen Limited in Bangladesh, we give poor people access to better healthcare and provide them with entrepreneurial opportunities.</p>
          <p>And now to Kurt who will provide more details from Q4 2009 to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, J&#xFC;rgen and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. After a challenging start to the year, our business environment improved sequentially in the course of 2009. Looking at the fourth quarter, BASF posted satisfying results despite a seasonal slowdown in some business areas. In addition, continuously strong cash flow generation in Q4 lifted our full-year operating cash flow to a record high.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you through BASF's performance in the fourth quarter with a focus on sequential development compared with the third quarter of 2009. Sales rose by 3% in Q4 compared with the previous quarter due to higher volumes. Prices were virtually unchanged, while adverse currency effects reduced sales slightly. EBITDA increased by 12%, yielding a strong EBITDA margin of 17% in the fourth quarter. EBIT before special items increased by 19% to &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Special items amounted to &#x20AC;473 million and were mostly related to costs for the Ciba integration and for restructuring measures as well as goodwill impairments in Inorganics and Care Chemicals.</p>
          <p>Net income rose to &#x20AC;455 million and nearly doubled compared with the previous quarter. This increase was driven by higher income from operations and a lower tax rate. In Q4, the tax rate decreased to 37% after 60% in the third quarter. In Q3, the tax rate was exceptionally high due to one time effects related to the Ciba acquisition, as you know.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a closer look at the performance of each segment. Chemicals increased sales by 8% compared with the previous quarter due to solid demand from key customer industries, especially in Asia, and higher prices. Customers are continuing to order at short notice and we see no signs of pre-stocking.</p>
          <p>Earnings in Petrochemicals declined due to cracker outages and because higher raw material costs could not be fully passed on to customers. EBIT before special items in Inorganics and Intermediates was flat. In the fourth quarter, Chemicals incurred special items of &#x20AC;285 million due to the relocation of our fuel cell operations to North America and the shutdown of our maleic anhydride production in Belgium. Additionally, we impaired the goodwill of our electronics chemicals business. For 2010, we expect a significant improvement in sales and EBIT before special items in this segment.</p>
          <p>In Plastics, we almost achieved Q3 sales levels despite a seasonal slowdown in demand for products for the building and construction industry. Polyurethanes benefited from slightly higher volumes for MDI and TDI. The sequential earnings improvement throughout the year was driven by stronger demand for our products and the effect of our restructuring measures, especially plant closures in Performance Polymers.</p>
          <p>Earnings in Polyurethanes increased in Q4 compared with the previous quarter due to higher volumes and margins, especially in Asia.</p>
          <p>In Performance Polymers, earnings were at the same level as in Q3. We expect significantly higher sales and EBIT before special items in this segment in 2010.</p>
          <p>Sales in Performance Products decreased by 2% sequentially, mainly due to a seasonal slowdown in Dispersions &amp; Pigments. Care Chemicals, Performance Chemicals and Dispersions &amp; Pigments were able to pass on higher raw material prices and maintained margins.</p>
          <p>Two divisions, namely Care Chemicals and Dispersions &amp; Pigments, delivered earnings at the level of Q3. Performance Chemicals and Paper Chemicals, however, posted slightly negative EBIT before special items because of the continuously difficult business environment.</p>
          <p>The segment's earnings were burdened by costs related to the acquisition and integration of Ciba, which Hans-Ulrich Engel will explain to you in more detail.</p>
          <p>We expect demand to recover and sales to increase in 2010. Earnings should improve considerably thanks to higher synergy effects from the acquisition and considerably lower integration costs. We aim to significantly outperform the cumulative results that the now combined businesses achieved in 2008.</p>
          <p>In Functional Solutions, the seasonal sales decline in Construction Chemicals was offset by higher sales in Catalysts and Coatings. Earnings for the segment remained at the same level as in the third quarter despite the seasonally weaker contribution from Construction Chemicals. Coatings and Catalysts increased earnings due to a recovery in volumes and lower fixed costs.</p>
          <p>For 2010, we expect higher sales as a result of an improvement in the market environment in the automotive industry. We also aim to further reduce costs and generate considerably higher EBIT before special items in Functional Solutions.</p>
          <p>In Crop Protection as you know a sequential comparison is less meaningful due to the seasonal patterns of that business. Fourth quarter sales were 5% above the level of last year's fourth quarter driven by strong demand in South America. At &#x20AC;44 million, however, EBIT before special items declined slightly by &#x20AC;9 million due to negative currency effects.</p>
          <p>Full year sales rose thanks to higher prices for our products, especially in Europe and North America. Over the course of the year, a significant volume decline in the Northern Hemisphere due to unfavorable weather conditions was offset by strong volume growth in the Southern Hemisphere. At constant exchange rates and with a comparable portfolio, growth rates were the highest in South America and Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009, earnings rose to a new record level despite higher expenses for marketing and sales and R&amp;D. With an EBITDA margin of 26.7%, we again exceeded our EBITDA margin target of 25%. In 2010, we want to achieve a slight increase in sales and maintain our profitability at the high level of 2009.</p>
          <p>Oil &amp; Gas. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, sales of Oil &amp; Gas decreased considerably, mainly due to lower gas prices, which lag behind the oil price development by six to nine months. The higher oil price and the increase in gas production in Exploration &amp; Production was unable to compensate for lower gas prices and reduced oil production. Earnings declined accordingly.</p>
          <p>Although volumes in Natural Gas Trading were at the same level as in Q4 2008, sales and earnings declined significantly because of lower prices. Earnings in Natural Gas Trading were only 39% of what we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>A look at the income statement of the Oil &amp; Gas segment shows that the fourth quarter EBIT declined by 47% compared with the same period of the previous year. At the same time net income after minority interests decreased by 61% to &#x20AC;132 million. In 2010 we expect higher sales and EBIT before special items in the Oil &amp; Gas segment.</p>
          <p>Now I'm coming to the most interesting segment, Other. In Other EBIT before special items improved to &#x20AC;51 million from minus &#x20AC;295 million in the third quarter. This improvement was mainly attributable to the allocation of employee bonus accruals to the operating divisions and an improved currency result.</p>
          <p>Special items in Other were plus &#x20AC;293 million, due to the reversal of restructuring provisions, which were specified and mainly allocated to the Chemicals segment in the fourth quarter. As a result, EBIT in Other amounted to plus &#x20AC;344 million in the fourth quarter, compared to minus &#x20AC;390 million in the previous quarter and minus &#x20AC;370 million in Q4 of 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2009, BASF incurred special items of &#x20AC;1.175 billion, of which &#x20AC;718 million was related to the integration of Ciba. In the fourth quarter, special items associated with the Ciba integration amounted to &#x20AC;260 million. This includes the final write-off of Ciba's IT system as well as restructuring costs, for instance, for severance payments and site restructuring. In 2010, we expect a decline in special items, not surprisingly, to the level of the previous years.</p>
          <p>Let me now briefly discuss our cash flow. Operating cash flow achieved a record &#x2013; a new record level of &#x20AC;6.3 billion. The increase of more than &#x20AC;1.2 billion compared with 2009 was mainly driven by a swing in working capital.</p>
          <p>In 2009 we could reduce net working capital by &#x20AC;1.6 billion. At &#x20AC;3.7 billion, higher depreciation and amortization compared with last year partially compensated for the drop in earnings after tax.</p>
          <p>Looking at fourth quarter operating cash flow, you should be aware of two negative effects. Net working capital increased by &#x20AC;400 million, driven by lower trade liabilities as of December 31. In addition, we endowed a BASF pension fund with &#x20AC;250 million to meet regulatory requirements. Just to clarify this issue, our funded BASF pension plans had a funding ratio of 100% by the end of 2009 compared to 94% in 2008 supported by a very healthy return on invested assets. As a percentage of BASF total pension obligations 96% are funded as of the year end 2009.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we stuck to our priorities with regard to the use of cash. We spent &#x20AC;2.5 billion for capital expenditures, including Ciba and Revus, the oil exploration company we acquired in 2008 in Norway. This figure matches the level of 2008. Net cash-out for the purchase of Ciba amounted to &#x20AC;1.6 billion, including shares acquired prior to April 9. We paid &#x20AC;1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders on top of that.</p>
          <p>Let me now very briefly turn to our balance sheet. The major result of the Ciba acquisition is a net increase in long-term assets by about &#x20AC;2 billion. This was due to an increase in both intangible assets as well as in property, plant and equipment. Intangible assets contain goodwill of &#x20AC;571 million related to Ciba.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year inventories and accounts receivables remained constant, despite the fact that Ciba added &#x20AC;1.5 billion as of the date of the acquisition, which we managed down to &#x20AC;1.1 billion by end of December.</p>
          <p>Due to the Ciba acquisition, net debt increased to &#x20AC;14.3 billion by mid-year 2009. Up to the end of the year, we reduced net debt by &#x20AC;1.3 billion to &#x20AC;13 billion. This figure includes &#x20AC;0.9 billion of financial debt taken over from Ciba.</p>
          <p>We also changed the maturity profile of our debt as we started into 2009. Today, 84% of our debt has a maturity of more than one year, compared with 75% in January of 200 &#x2013; 57% in January of 2009. With this we have further improved our financial profile as we go into meeting the challenges of 2010.</p>
          <p>With this I hand over to Hans for further details on the Ciba integration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kurt and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Today I can confirm that the acquisition of Ciba has further strengthened BASF. During one of the worst economic crisis we have evolved as a leading provider of specialty chemicals. We are currently adapting the business models of the combined businesses according to their market needs. As a result, our customers can benefit from a broader and more focused product and solutions portfolio.</p>
          <p>Overall, earnings of the acquired businesses were negatively impacted by expenses for the rapidly introduced integration and restructuring measures, which I'm going to describe in more detail in a minute.</p>
          <p>Sales from the acquired businesses amounted to &#x20AC;2.3 billion, Ciba reduced after-tax earnings of BASF Group by &#x20AC;739 million. In the integration process, we are ahead of our initially announced schedule, both with regard to synergies and timing. In 2009, &#x20AC;60 million in cost synergies were already P&amp;L effective. The annual cost synergy run rate at the end of 2009 amounted to &#x20AC;130 million, &#x20AC;50 million more than the run rate expected at the end of the second quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>By the end of 2010, the annual cost synergy run rate for the integration of Ciba will increase to &#x20AC;350 million, again, &#x20AC;50 million more than our initial target. Once we have fully completed the Ciba integration by 2012, we are confident of achieving more than &#x20AC;450 million of cost synergies per year going forward.</p>
          <p>The chart 26 gives you more details on the progress of the integration of Ciba. In 2009, we incurred &#x20AC;785 million of integration costs, of which, &#x20AC;718 million were booked as special items. These special items encompass &#x20AC;280 million of step-up on inventories, &#x20AC;176 million for the depreciation of Ciba's IT system, and &#x20AC;334 million of restructuring costs. The remaining &#x20AC;67 million are booked in EBIT before special items and relate to relocation costs and IT costs. About &#x20AC;150 million of the &#x20AC;785 million were cash costs.</p>
          <p>As previously announced, we expect Ciba integration costs totaling nearly &#x20AC;1.1 billion, leaving about &#x20AC;300 million for the years 2010 through 2012. The restructuring plans include a reduction of more than 3,800 positions. More than 700 of these positions had been eliminated by the end of 2009. The majority of the remaining positions will be eliminated in the course of 2010.</p>
          <p>By the end of 2009, we completed 33 of planned 58 closures of Ciba's sales and administrative offices and research sites. Last quarter, we announced the closure of six production sites; final decisions concerning the 17 remaining production sites under strategic review will be made in the first quarter 2010. All major structural integration activities are planned to be completed in April this year, following the remaining steps to implement the IT system.</p>
          <p>And with that, back to J&#xFC;rgen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Returning to profitable growth and again earning a premium on our cost of capital will be our major focus in 2010. BASF will continue to further enhance operational leadership and maintain cost discipline through rigorous efficiency programs, such as NEXT, through reducing complexity with regard to products, customers and markets and through further increasing effectiveness and efficiency in R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Our target is to successfully complete the Ciba integration this year and to harvest annual synergies of more than &#x20AC;450 million as Hans has explained.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we will consistently increase value by implementing our successful value before volume strategy, adjusting capacities to market demand and proactively reducing overcapacities in the industry. By optimizing BASF's portfolio through the planned divestment of Styrenics and Leather &amp; Textile Chemicals, and by investing in growth markets as well as in research and development, concentrating on future megatrends.</p>
          <p>The key to our success is the best team in the industry. We therefore strive to attract new employees with different backgrounds, experience, and talent. At the same time, we are investing significantly in developing their skills and establishing programs to ensure sustainable successions throughout the entire team. BASF intends to further expand its contributions to sustainability by developing system solutions that help our customers to save primary resources and products, thus protecting the environment. There are a multitude of examples for that which I explained already to you. With its excellent business profile and good financial position, BASF strives to maintain its solid 'A' credit rating. And in addition we will pursue our long-term dividend policy.</p>
          <p>What are our macroeconomic assumptions in 2010? In 2010 we expect a recovery of the world economy and a moderate rise in global gross domestic product by 2.7%. Asia, especially China, will continue to be the growth engine. After a strong decline in 2008 and 2009, we expect chemical production without pharmaceuticals to grow almost twice as fast as GDP with plus 5.3%. For 2010, we expect an average oil price of $75 per barrel, and an average exchange rate of $1.40 per euro.</p>
          <p>Our customer industries are returning to the growth path with worldwide global industrial production likely to experience above average growth of almost 5% in 2010 after a sharp decline in 2009.</p>
          <p>The construction industry, however, will remain challenging, despite slight global growth of 1.8%, driven by state construction programs, it may shrink again in some European countries, in the U.S. and in the Middle East. Higher growth rates are expected for the automotive, ICT and electronic industries.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the overall outlook for 2010. The stabilization of the global economy, which started in the second half of 2009, is expected to continue in 2010. However, economic recovery in 2010 will likely to be slow and uneven and there is always the possibility of a surprises. After a very difficult business year in 2009, we expect higher sales and significant increase in EBIT before special items in 2010.</p>
          <p>These expectations are based on the change in the economic environment, further cost savings and cost synergies from the integration of Ciba. In 2010, we are confident to once more and once again earn a premium on our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>We are also abiding by our medium-term targets and our dividend policy. We aim to grow sales on average by two percentage points per year above chemical market growth. We strive for an EBITDA margin of 18% until 2012. And we aim to continuously increase the annual dividend, or at least maintain it at the level of the previous year.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and we are now happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Yes good afternoon thank you for taking my question. I'm going to abide by the rules and just ask one question. Just to go back to the Other division and the profitability there, obviously a marked increase year-on-year, the bonus payments that were taken out of that division and put into the operational divisions. First of all, can you confirm that that actually reduces the profit of each of the operating segments? And secondly, is this the first year you have done this and why did you &#x2013; did you make that decision to change the way you account for the bonus payments? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Rhian, first question, yes; second question, no. More specifically this is allocated obviously to the divisions, order of magnitude is about &#x20AC;130 million and we have done this in the past as well. We always &#x2013; starting a couple of years ago, we always allocated the effect of the options program in Other waiting then for the final &#x2013; for the final year end share price and then we allocated it to the businesses, so there was no change compared with last year. The big change obviously is in &#x2013; in so far happened in 2009 because in 2009 we saw an expense and in 2008 we had a profit from releasing provisions for our options program. So it has a very counter cyclical nature.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have a question regarding the oil and gas division. As there is quite a long delay between the gas and &#x2013; the gas contract price and the oil price, you should have also a good feeling how the gas price will be in 2010. Can you say whether the average gas contract price for your E&amp;P business will be above the year of 2009 in 2010 or below? And related to the gas question, there is quite a huge spread between the spot price and the contract price in Europe. Could you elaborate how this impacts your business in gas trading, in E&amp;P and maybe also in the C-one value chain of mainly probably inorganics, please? Thanks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with your first question on gas price in exploration. You're absolutely right; the gas price in exploration sees a significant time lag, so in Q4 the oil prices of Q1 and Q2 are applied. That is then also the reason for our expectation that in the gas exploration we will see gas prices in the year 2010 based on an increasing oil price throughout the year 2009, which will be higher than what we have experienced in gas price in exploration for the year 2009.</p>
          <p>Your second question with respect to differences in spot prices and contract prices, yes, there is a significant difference between spot and contract prices that has developed during the course of 2009, we are all aware of the reasons for that. Significant oversupply resulting from: 1) significantly lower consumption in Western Europe driven by the economic crisis and 2) contract quantities being delivered to Western Europe as well as LNG quantities coming from new production.</p>
          <p>How will that develop during the course of 2010? I'd say that remains to be seen. At this point in time we still see a significant spread between the spot and the contract prices. I think it will depend to a large extent on what we will see with respect to consumption happening during the course 2010. So far, private consumption due to weather conditions was above what we've seen in January of the year 2009. The industrial consumption, however, has not really picked up to the same extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Andreas to complement with regard to C-one added value chain. We try as much as we can to use the spot price and to take volumes in from the spot market. But this is somehow limited, and it's interlaid with storage facilities we have on our own. Of course, we have some benefits out of it, but not sufficient compared to the overall situation around the world, where spot prices and contract prices, for example in North America, but are also in parts of Asia, lower.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I would like to stay with the topic of the oil and gas division please and specifically E&amp;P. Just looking at your specific guidance on broadly &#x2013; of sales broadly flat year-on-year and taking into account the answer you've just given on the fact that prices on average are likely to be up, presumably there will be some positive volume effect from Achimgaz coming on. And your assumption of $75 oil, I'm struggling to see what's going to prevent sales from being up more significantly year-on-year unless you're assuming volumes being down elsewhere. Could you sort of correct me if any of those assumptions are wrong, please? Thank you</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Hans. The guidance that we're giving relates to the segment oil and gas, and if you look there at the effect that we started the year 2009 in the gas trading business with very high gas prices as a result of the six months &#x2013; roughly six months time lag, we will see that these will not happen in the same way in the year 2010, that's why we're saying the sales will be at the same level or slightly higher, but we think that the results will be better than what we've seen in the year 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which has to do with the fact that we see still in &#x2013; going into the year 2010, capacity reductions that have increased during the course of the year 2009 and that will have an effect through the year 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if we take the sort of Q4 on Q4 capacity reduction that you've seen in E&amp;P and roll that forward through 2010, that would be a fair assumption to make?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the outlook -- slide 31, about the medium-term target. You state that you strive for an EBITDA margin of 18% until 2012. Does this mean that you expect this number already in 2010 and 2011? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mutlu this is too early to predict. I really have to say this is in too much detailed in guidance. We strive very much to come back to limited former performance level in EBITDA margin and I'm pretty confident that we constantly will increase as specialty business in our portfolio has increased significantly through Ciba. However, Ciba acquisition and integration still has to be completed in the year 2010 and as we go forward we should see improvements.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Perhaps, also a question on oil and gas. You have seen that Eurogas has negotiated with Gazprom more flexible contracts. My question is do you believe it looks like for me that it is the starting point that the link from the gas price through oil price perhaps will go off and do you think, do you believe that and we also negotiated movement with Gazprom such contracts and what do you think overall if really the change will be what this will be the impact for the next year on your results on oil and gas?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah as you read in the newspapers, I read about the negotiations between Gazprom and E.ON and based on that I understand that Gazprom and E.ON agreed on a certain spot price element in the long-term contracts. WINGAS is having discussions with Gazprom also about a price revision, too early to tell at this point in time what the outcome will be. My expectation is that we'll also see a spot price element in the pricing formula. But as I say we are in the midst of the negotiations with our &#x2013; which I think will probably conclude sometime during the month of March.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question; this is actually on goodwill write-downs. Would we be correct in assuming that if the outlook on interest rates starts to increase that we may then seen actually more goodwill write-downs by essentially revaluation of your future cash flows? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, actually when you will receive our annual report, you will see that we already increased the discount rate for calculating our impairment needs. So far we have been very clean in 2009, we have a couple of impairments in the order of magnitude of 220 million, smaller businesses where we took a closer look and that is all driven by business outlook and not by interest rates and as you all know, then at the end of 2010, we will make the next impairment study based on then the business outlook and the interest rate outlook.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Yes, Dr. Hambrecht, you talked about adjusting capacities to market demand and proactively reducing your capacities. Other than Styrenics, could you talk about the measures that you have taken and whether they are reversible? And also in the same context what do you see in terms of your competitors adjusting their capacities and is it temporary or permanent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, yes, first of all let me say that most of the capacities which have been taken out and I talked about &#x2013; and I talked about, will be taken out forever and you named Styrenics which is, let me say, the most prominent one and very visible and very clear. Then you have a few crackers which are out of operation and will remain out of operation. As a matter of fact, they will be closed down or are already closed down.</p>
          <p>Now there are a few others just to name a very few Capalitan, Mitsubishi and Braskem took out about 120,000 tons altogether. Dow is closing down a TDI plant in Freeport. We are closing down, now coming back to us and I think I talked about this already last time to some extent. We are taking out substantial amount of SP dispersion. This is almost 40% of the entire capacity we have, in Europe. This is huge, very big helping our paper chemicals business, which still is suffering somehow from the structural problems in this industry. But we are also, as you know, taking out for example the maleic anhydride plant in Feluy in Belgium. And this is forever, we will close it down, as we have closed down our EPS plant in Tarragona, our BDO, THF plant in Ulsan.</p>
          <p>On the other hand we are selling sometimes a few of our assets as we did it for example in the catalyst business with the Nanjing operations. All in all I think this time is a remarkable change with quite a lot of capacities have been taken out and will remain closed.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Special items have been quite lumpy over the year. So we had 370 in Q2 and then 280, Q3 and now in the previous quarter you just reported we've had over 470 million of special items. How should we think about the phasing for 2010?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Kurt. I think you should assume that special items would come down to the normal course of business which is in the order of magnitude of 300 million plus and minus. And that is what you've seen in the past, right about. 2009, obviously for the reason of acquiring Ciba, was exceptional.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I was wondering whether you could update us please on sequential volume and price movements in the plastic activities and also raw material trends? And just how you see those three factors playing out in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Raw material, Sophie, looking to the raw material situation I think what we cannot expect any more is a deflationary tendency in raw materials. The raw materials will most probably slightly go up and as we look into the &#x2013; let me say the specifics, you will see quite huge volatility, let me specifically name benzene, maybe less so on ethylene, propylene and others, but benzene is very much depends on the gasoline pool and what's going on there over the year. So, this, for plastics, certainly is a little bit an unpredictable piece, however now looking into the sequential of plastics and I'm not going back, looking into the future I personally what we see at this very moment I have to say there is some recovery in the business around the world in some areas somewhat tight already and I personally believe that we will see some growth especially looking into polyurethanes but also engineering plastics.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on your good results. In your guidance for 2010 you expect sales growth and a significant improvement of adjusted EBIT so could you narrow it down a bit, especially on the EBIT level like above 9% and below 20% or double-digit something like that, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, we do not translate this into figures, I have to say this, however if we differentiate between increase and significant increase this really means something. And you &#x2013; just to give you a little bit of guidance, is just look into special items, of this &#x2013; of last year. This certainly and we just talked briefly before about it, these will certainly substantially be reduced, and if you look into the overall, this translates all to also on EBIT, before special items not on the EBIT level, as integration is moving ahead and synergies will be harvested now from now onward, and therefore, yes, we will see a real significant increase in EBIT, no further quantification.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we do not see at this very moment, really significant changes occurring in China as a matter of fact Chinese New Year, I have to say this year almost didn't exist. So China is with full power going ahead. However yes, there is an inflation through stimulus packages and the government is now slowly, steadily pulling a little bit back. You should also consider that growth rates are somewhat inflated because of very bad weather from the food side. This is rather substantial and therefore if you look into the growth rates you should reduce it a little bit. But overall China remains the horsepower for growth.</p>

          <p>Hi, yeah thank you. It's a question again on the 18% EBITDA margin target I know it's something you strive for, but <mark type="inaudible" />. I seem to remember the definition that you gave back in summer of 2008 was an average through 2012 and I'm just wondering if that's still what you mean by until. I understand that it is a target you're striving for, etcetera, etcetera but of course it would mean a significant improvement in the margin over the next period if you were to achieve it.

Could you please update us on the disposal progress of the textile and Styrenics business. And I mean on the same topic you provided the sales for Styrenics.

          <p>Looking forward of course, we are looking at all kinds of further improvement of our portfolio. This includes divestiture and acquisitions but for the time being, we need to focus on Ciba integration and maybe the other one or the other bolt additions.

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Van Hougenbou, good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I have a question regarding sales and specifically your slide number six and also a few of your remarks about China. I was a little bit amazed that you still had a minus figure in Q4 of '09 and in relation to that it struck me that your EBIT in the fourth quarter except in Europe outside Germany was still dramatically decreased. Has that to do with the fact that most factories in Europe have now been closed outside Germany, can you give some light on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First to comment, on the overall situation also in Asia, we should not forget that prices have deteriorated a lot and this is the main reason of the major changes. Looking into Europe, Europe was heavily impacted mostly, mostly by oil and gas. If you deduct oil and gas, things have improved quite a bit. However we have to cope with the entire portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there are now some follow up questions, the first is Nobert Barth</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Still coming to the favorite, Others or Special &#x2013; and also special items. You mentioned somewhere that you had some releases for provision for inventories which you have taken last year. Can you give us the amount of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nobert, that is a very small number. It's a two-digit million number, something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Smaller one, really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Rhian Tucker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. A quick follow on question on cash flow in Q4 specifically. You did a great job on cash flow throughout the year but I noticed in Q4 your CapEx went up quite substantially and you had working capital outflow as well. Is that related to a kind of normalization of the business and what can we expect in 2010 for both CapEx and working capital please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Rhian, let me try to give it &#x2013; to explain it. Cash flow as you said we had net working capital negative effect in Q4, that is only based on lower payables, trade payables. That was a special effect basically dependent on the day of the year and 31st when we paid. So that is something to normalize in Q1 again.</p>
          <p>And with regard to CapEx, it also now includes obviously when you compare with previous year, the additional CapEx from the Ciba, from Ciba operations and other than that, there is no special event happening in CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So with working capital you should have a negative number in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This year? That's too early to say, I mean it's certainly to some degree dependent on our sales development, but we're also striving for further improving our operating efficiency which means days outstanding both for inventories and receivables should further come down over the course of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, now we have Martin Evans from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Just returning to a previous acquisition of Engelhard from several years ago and your comments on the cuts for this division, which obviously reflect the downturn in the automotive markets, however are you not a little bit disappointed with the way that business has responded to the downturn because part of the rationale, I seem to recall, for buying it, was that it did have certain counter-cyclical qualities that would be the benefits of emission legislation you saw coming through and is it something that you feel you possibly need to refocus in terms of how you service the customers in the auto market in the automotive markets or are you more confident that in fact it will rebound quite strongly as the car market comes back? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. I think it gives me an opportunity to explain a little bit what's happening there. Other than you, we have the benefit of comparing our number precisely with our competitors' numbers and I can assure you that we are absolutely satisfied with our performance. We haven't lost any market share and we gained in some areas. We are performing at a level of profitability, which is absolutely comparable with them if not better than what our competition does.</p>
          <p>The problem you have looking at our numbers is for instance that our EBIT numbers when we talk about it, do not include for instance the joint venture operations, which come at equity which we operate both in Korea and in Japan, they have very high market shares, very successful. In terms of how we operate, I think it has grown nicely over the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>It is &#x2013; is it cyclical? When we talked about cyclicality in the past, we always said this is pretty much unrelated to the typical chemical cycle. That is what we had in mind when we talked about improving with regard to cyclicality. We did never say that this is not related &#x2013; this catalyst business to the automotive industry cycle and obviously we suffered quite a bit in 2008 and 2009 because the automotive industry deteriorated so heavily over the course of those two years. But I can assure you, if the automotive industry picks up, we will have our very fair share of new models and products and be very satisfied.</p>
          <p>On top of that we have the chemical catalyst business; sorry for the long answer &#x2013; the chemical catalyst business took a little bit of a deep dive starting in the second half of 2009 following the decline in the chemical industry. So that business is certainly related to the chemical cycle, but we assume that over the course of 2010 the chemical catalyst business will recover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Martin, to be very clear here also, we never talked about synergies from technology, there is a lot of synergy from technology, we are a technology leader in catalysts and this is exactly what we strive for. So we are satisfied with this acquisition. Yes, unfortunately, business in this automotive industry has suffered a lot and now one can argue whether this was good or bad. Yes, it is dependent on the automotive industry to a large extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So now we move on to Martin R&#xF6;diger from Cheuvreux.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Question on capacity utilization rate. We heard I think it was two months ago that Mr. Bruderm&#xFC;ller mentioned a figure of 70%. Is that a figure for Q4 and what is the level of capacity utilization rate you see in the first two months of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, you know that this is a question I always refuse to comment on because I think if you argue along the line with capacity utilization, especially comparing ourselves to the industry is not very helpful because there is no standard answer how to measure capacity utilization.</p>
          <p>However, having said this, what I can indicate to you is we are not back at the level we have seen before in the first half of 2008 or even 2007. Side remark: this was, let me say, a hyper year because of inflation of demand, which should not be taken as a normal year, so I would take 2008 as a reference year and here I have to say we are below the 2008 level, have improved quarter-by-quarter, but still far away from the capacity utilization we had in the past. Translating into one indication there is still overcapacity in the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we now moving to the final three questions because we are running out of time here and what I promise though is we will call you back from Investor Relations, whomever we cannot &#x2013; get on the &#x2013; in the queue right now. But we would like to continue with Paul Walsh from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good afternoon to everybody. My question was just simply on pricing power, clearly there is a push within the sector in general to pursue stronger pricing power going forward. Can you talk a little bit about what you think has changed in the industry to bring this pricing power back into the system selectively? Is it capacity closures? Is it more responsible actions towards the customers? Can you just flesh that out for me a little bit, so I can help &#x2013; you can help me understand the process that's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul just referring to Martin and before to Jenny. Yeah, there is a change. We have better addressed the capacity issue compared to past cycles, but not everywhere and still there is remaining overcapacity, as I just said. However, looking into the overall attitude I think value before volume strategy have been realized by the industry as we have run it and we have successfully run it. People, I think, look to the industry leader &#x2013; how the industry leader is coping with it.</p>
          <p>At the same time, there are always desperate cash runners out there and we need to look and watch out for them. Usually they are more on the commodity side and less so on the specialty side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a question from Yana Mishi from ECM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I just have a question about your liquidity position in your balance sheet, you do have constantly more than one billion bonds maturing over the next couple of years, what do you consider sort of minimum balance of cash you need to hold on to your balance sheet? And if you can just remind me what you said about the cash restructuring cost for 2010, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We consider a number between 1.5 and two billion as normal, given the current circumstances and the cost of carrying liquidity, obviously relatively high depending what you compare. We also have to keep in mind that our commercial paper interest rates are very, very attractive. We basically issue paper &#x2013; commercial papers at 50 basis points below the benchmark, which makes liquidity for us relatively inexpensive, however, if we could invest the money in more profitable chemical assets, we would have a higher overall profitability but obviously we need the liquidity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm sorry the restructuring cash costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That of the about &#x2013; I think we said that. 366 million was the restructuring cost, 718 million was Ciba integration cost and the remaining difference is basically is the goodwill impairments I talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So and then we come to our final question and it comes from Jenny Barker [Nomura].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thank you, glad I squeezed in. Yeah, you said that Yuzhno Russkoye has plateaued. Given the maturity of Libya, does this mean that the E&amp;P overall volumes are now in structural decline? I understand that Achimgaz is going to come on. You won't actually show the reserve in your numbers, how will Achimgaz affect the financials? Will it be in the consolidated sales and profit line? And will the financial impact of that compensate for the maturity of the rest of the portfolio please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, this is Hans. So first of all if you look at a portfolio, that doesn't move and if you have one part of the portfolio that plateaus out then your assumption is absolutely right. But I can assure you that our portfolio will move and it moves in the right direction. And we've done a major move there with the acquisition that we did in 2008 with Revus, which as you know is focused on oil and the results that we've see there during the year 2009 and going into 2010 are quite promising. So I think that is basically the answer to your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry; so it will come from Revus and existing positions or are you talking about acquiring more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you saying that that compensation will come from existing positions like Revus...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or you'll just be acquiring more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My reference was specifically to existing positions in the portfolio and here in particular to the prospects that we acquired with Revus.</p>
          <p>On Achimgaz briefly, on Achimgaz, we are in the pilot phase, produced last year about a 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas. We are currently evaluating on how to move forward with that project together with Gazprom and I think during the course of the year there is more to talk about Achimgaz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, with this ladies and gentlemen, this brings us to the end of our conference. I would like to thank you all for participating and for your interesting questions. I also apologize to those whom we couldn't get answered yet, but we will call you back, my colleagues and I myself from the IR team.</p>
          <p>And before we close, I would also like to invite to you to our Performance Product Segment Day, which will take place in London on June 1, and a copy of it will be New York on June 2. On that day we will discuss BASF's overall strategy as well as the prospects for the Performance Product segment, including the acquired Ciba businesses.</p>
          <p>We will also in addition certainly to Dr. Hambrecht, and Dr. Feldmann we'll be able to bring along the division heads to London, in order to provide you with an opportunity to discuss the businesses even in more detail with them personally. We will next report on our first quarter results and this will be on April 29, 2010. So this is it for now and we would like you to thank you again and wish you a nice day. Bye, bye.</p>
