          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding. This is Yvonne welcoming you to ING's Q1, 2011 Conference Call. Before handing this conference over to Mr. Jan Hommen, Chief Executive Officer of ING Group, let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comments are subject to a number of current views, assumptions and variables, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movement in security markets, including equity markets and underlying economic conditions and changes -- I beg your pardon. They are set out in a great detail in our public filings, which we would urge you to read. The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered by unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables.</p>
          <p>Good morning, Jan, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And welcome, everyone to the ING conference call on the first quarter results 2011. I'm happy to report that bank posted another strong quarter, and that the insurance company showed significant improvement in the first quarter as well. I will talk you through the presentation and then afterwards, Koos Timmermans, Patrick Flynn and Matt Rider are here with me and we are all available to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>I am going to page two. The ING Groep reported underlying profit, net profit of &#x20AC;1.492 million. In the first quarter, that was up from the &#x20AC;923 million that we had last year. The bank posted another strong quarter and underlying result before tax of &#x20AC;1.7 billion. The bank results benefited from my healthy interest margin from higher client balances, lower risk cost and an improvement in expenses compared to Q4 last year.</p>
          <p>Underlying results of the insurance company showed a significant improvement compared to a year ago, they were up by 280% from Q1 last year to &#x20AC;461 million. Insurance results benefited from the higher fees and premium based revenues and an improvement in the investment margin and especially also very cost control.</p>
          <p>Restructuring of the Groep is on track. We continue to work towards the physical separation of the banking and insurance activities. We have already an arms-length arrangement with each other that was put in place at the end of last year. But at the same time, we are now laying the foundation for two IPOs, one for the U.S. and one for the European-Asian insurance business. And then we are looking at the repurchase of the &#x20AC;2 billion of core Tier-1 securities from the Dutch state. We plan to do that next week on May 13th. And we will also pay a premium of &#x20AC;1 billion when we make the &#x20AC;2 billion payment.</p>
          <p>On page three, you see the results from bank and insurance, strong numbers in this quarter. Significant improvement for the insurance company, operating results of &#x20AC;561 million, a 35% increase compared with the first quarter of last year, and the negative impact of non-operating results diminished significantly. For the Groep, that net to underlying profits -- net profits of &#x20AC;1.492 million, up significantly compared with a year ago and also the first quarter of last year. And then, a net profit of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, &#x20AC;1.4 billion included a negative &#x20AC;111 million for special items, primarily related to the restructuring programs and some of the separation costs that we are still having.</p>
          <p>Page four, a good progress compared to the ambition that we have set for the year 2013. Income growth supported by healthy margins and higher client balances. Cost income ratio declined to 55%, risk costs that are trending down to more normalized levels and a return on equity at 20.3% that is based on the target of 7.5% core Tier 1. And if you calculate it based on current equity on IFRS accounting, then the returns for the bank on equity was 13.7%.</p>
          <p>Insurance, also good progress on the ambition we set for the year 2013. Investment margin continued to improve following the reinvestments we did last year. Administrative expenses down from a peak in the fourth quarter 2010, led by reductions in the Benelux and in the U.S. Ratio of administrative expense improved to 40%. The first quarter is seasonally low, so the full-year number is expected to be below the level of last year, but we will remain focused on the ambition that we have set of 35%. And we had a positive return on equity of 6.2%. Some work here to be done, we still need to go to double-digit levels here, but clearly, a good improvement by insurance.</p>
          <p>Our separation and divestment process is on track. We anticipate that we will spend this year about &#x20AC;200 million in after-tax cost. And mainly, we're using that for replacing temporary solutions for more permanent solutions. In the first quarter, the separation costs were low, only &#x20AC;20 million, because most of the costs are skewed to the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In 2011, the main priority is that we prepare the businesses for the two base cases, two IPOs, no final decision yet on what we are going to do with Latin America, where we continue to look for the strategic options that we have for that business. And we are taking steps that we can meet the other requirements that we had from the European Commission, including the divestment of US ING Direct and the carve-out of the WestlandUtrecht Bank from our retail operations in the Netherlands. But the overall restructuring is on schedule and we expect that to be completed by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>Page seven, you see what we are deferring with the repayment of the Dutch State core Tier 1. As said earlier, we plan to repay, sorry, on May 13th, &#x20AC;2 billion of the core Tier 1, plus the premium of &#x20AC;1 billion. And then, the total amounts that we will pay so far -- if you look at all the numbers we have done, had the &#x20AC;400 million of interest payment we did in May plus the payments we made earlier, &#x20AC;5 billion plus &#x20AC;600 million premium, then we will have already paid &#x20AC;9 billion, so we are very close to the full amount of &#x20AC;10 billion. And then next year, we expect that we will repay the remainder, the remainder of &#x20AC;3 billion, assuming that market circumstances will stay favorable.</p>
          <p>In page number eight, you see the second tranche of the state aid will be repaid out of retained earnings. Again, we had a good quarter, we had a net profit of &#x20AC;1.4 billion that was basically offset by foreign exchange changes and by revals of our debt securities. But, we ended up with an equity of &#x20AC;40.1 billion and on the right side you see what happens when we pay the core Tier 1, our ratio, core Tier-1 ratio will go down to 9.1% on a pro-forma basis when we do the repayment to the Dutch State.</p>
          <p>On page nine, you see the Alt-A market values are recovering, that the repayments continue and the cash losses remain rather limited. And we have put this in because we had a number of questions from you to help you understanding where we are. You see that the market value of the portfolio has increased to 66.4% at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the face value of the portfolio that we sold to the Dutch State has declined from &#x20AC;24 billion to &#x20AC;14.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. And that happened because we had faster repayments and faster prepayments than we had anticipated in the original plan, also currency movements have helped here. The government has used the excess cash that was generated to reduce the receivable that it has from ING. So, that has come down from &#x20AC;21.6 billion at the end of 2008 to &#x20AC;11 billion now at the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me go to the bank and discuss the numbers of the bank in more detail.</p>
          <p>On page 11, you see the good quarter that we had and gross results rose by almost 14% compared with a year ago and income increased by 8%, supported by continued solid interest margin and higher client balances. Risk cost continued to trend downward to a more normalized level mainly driven by improvements in the mid-corporate and the SME segments in the Benelux. Underlying results increased to &#x20AC;1.7 billion, compared to &#x20AC;1.3 billion in the first quarter of last year and &#x20AC;1.5 billion in Q4 last year.</p>
          <p>Interest results held up well. In the first quarter we're rising 4.1% compared with the quarter a year ago, driven by growth in client balances and interest margin remain very healthy at 144 basis points. We saw a decline compared with Q4 of three basis points that was -- and general lending held up quite well compared with Q4. Margins from mortgages, and of course savings, were somewhat lower, especially in the Netherlands where we saw quite some competition.</p>
          <p>Interest margins in the mid-corporate and SME segments were flat in the Netherlands but improved slightly compared in most other countries. On the volume side, page 13, net production and residential mortgages was &#x20AC;4.6 billion, slightly lower than the previous quarter. And other lending showed a net increase of &#x20AC;4.9 billion, basically driven by growth in structured finance and retail in Central Europe.</p>
          <p>The net production of funds entrusted at retail banking was &#x20AC;12.5 billion, driven by ING direct. Commercial banking reported a decline of &#x20AC;12 billion net outflow but is showing a seasonal effect because always in Q4 you get lot of corporate treasurers is to park excess cash with the banks and then taking that up again after year-end. And that happened again this year, same happened, in fact, the year before.</p>
          <p>When you look at expense, expenses are up 3.4% compared to the year ago, but they are down 1.9% compared with last quarter. And you see the underlying cost income ratio down to 55% compared with 57.2% in the previous quarter. The target still is 50% for 2013, and we are looking to do that with structural improvements while at the same time, we want to continue to invest in our business and in the future of our franchise mainly in IT and in operational excellence in the loan bank structure that we've designed.</p>
          <p>Risk cost gradually declining to more normalized level. We saw a small uptake in Q4 as a result of model updates on the mortgages portfolio, but again, risk cost declined in Q1 this year to 42 basis points over average risk-weighted assets.  A very low number of incidents, especially in the mid-corporate segment and retail Benelux. For the quarters ahead, we are seeing risk cost as percent of risk-weighted assets that are expected to remain below the average of 2010.</p>
          <p>Non-performing loans, a slight decrease to 2.1%. And we saw that risk costs declined by &#x20AC;83 million. The decline was mainly visible in mid-corporate and the Benelux and retail, and lower risk cost for the Dutch mortgage portfolio after the model updates that we did in Q4. And on the right hand side of the slide, you can see that the non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans decline to 2.1%.</p>
          <p>You see on page 17 that Retail Banking results increased sharply compared with a year ago and also compared with  the previous quarter, and underlying result before tax rose to 12.7% compared to the first quarter mainly driven, by ING Direct and by Retail Netherlands. Strong performance also from the commercial bank, and Real Estate continued to be profitable. The commercial bank published a record result in Q1, up 13% compared with a year ago, and driven especially by lending activities and structured finance on leasing, as well as higher results in financial markets. But financial markets basically all driven by client relations.</p>
          <p>And our retail business -- I'm sorry, our Real Estate business, another quarter of a positive underlying results. And that reflects the ongoing recovery that we are seeing in real estate markets. Our core Tier-1 ratio strengthened to 10%. We generated &#x20AC;1 billion of core Tier-1 capital, as the net profit was offset by a small increase in risk-weighted assets. The strong capital generation from the bank provides important strategic flexibility as we work towards the repurchasing of the remaining outstanding core Tier-1 securities by the Dutch State. And also in this context, the upcoming regulatory changes under Basel III, ING Bank will continue to focus on maintaining a strong capital position.</p>
          <p>And then the last slide for the Bank, slide number 20. The loan-to-deposit ratio is 1.06, a good funding mix with little dependence on short-term professional funding, and basically we have met already, at this moment, more than our &#x2013; we have already raised &#x20AC;10 billion so far this year, which is almost all the requirement we have for refunding the outstanding maturities that are coming due this year.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the Insurance now. Page 22, Insurance had good results in the first quarter. Operating result of &#x20AC;561 million, that was up 35%. A good growth in sales and assets under management that drove fees and premium-based revenues higher, investment margins continued to improve and gradual reinvestment in higher-yielding assets. The negative impact of non-operating results diminished significantly in both this quarter and last quarter and underlying results before tax was up to &#x20AC;461 million.</p>
          <p>On slide 23, you see the spreads further improved to 95 basis points. Yeah, that's an increase of about 19% compared to the year-ago quarter, mainly due to reinvestment into fixed income securities in the Netherlands and in the U.S., as well as accretion of assets that were previously impaired, in particular in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And then you look on page 24, you'll see that the -- on the left side that fees and premium-based revenues are the greatest contributor to the Insurance earnings. In Q1, that was they grew by 10.5% compared with the same quarter a year ago, primarily driven by increases in Asia, in IM and in the U.S. And the increase in Asia related to -- reflected reduced sales coupled with higher renewal premiums and at ING IM fees increased as a result of higher assets under management.</p>
          <p>Administrative expenses declined, in fact, sharply compared with the last quarter of last year and they were up just 0.8% compared with the year ago if you exclude the foreign exchange impact. So, good cost containment, in particular in the U.S. and the Benelux, as well as non-recurring releases that have an impact of &#x20AC;22 million, in particular, related to incentive compensation in the U.S.</p>
          <p>On the right hand, you'll see that ratio of administrative expense to operating income declined to 40%. And while the first quarter is always seasonally low, the full-year number is expected to be below the level that we had last year and we remained focus on moving to that 35% goal that we have set for 2013.</p>
          <p>You see on page 26, the operating results in all the units are basically doing well everywhere except in Central &amp; the Rest of Europe and there was some pressure there due to the financial institution tax that was set in Hungary as well as some regulatory changes that impact the pension business in Hungary also higher costs that we have to make in order to make ourselves ready for Solvency II, and the margins that we had on insurance products were little bit lower in this area as well.</p>
          <p>Page 27, you see the interest rates and activities. They have been significantly reduced because we had changes in our hedging strategy for the separate account pension contract in the Netherland. The revised hedging strategy reduces earnings volatility, but at the same time offering and equivalent economic hedge. And we used long-duration government bonds here to replace the interest rate swaps as a strategy to hedge our interest rate risk.</p>
          <p>Then you see that equity-related earnings sensitivities reflect direct equity exposure, primarily in the Benelux, and indirect equity exposure that arises primarily from the U.S. DAC unlocking and hedging activities. Effective in the first quarter 2011 and in line with U.S. peers, we have seen mean reversion methodology that will be utilized in determining the short-term equity growth assumptions in U.S. DAC calculations, again, reducing the sensitivities to earnings moments in equity markets as we go forward.</p>
          <p>And then the market-related impact has been negative in the past years. However, after the mergers that we took in Q4 last year on the U.S. VA and in Q1 this year on hedging in the Benelux, we believe that the volatility will clearly have diminished and that non-operating results going forward could be positively impacted by that.</p>
          <p>You'll see sales, on page 28, increased by 11%. If you eliminate the impact of foreign exchange, and that was 8%. Sales in Central &amp; the Rest of Europe and Latin America declined, compared with the first quarter last year, but they were higher an Asia-Pacific and the Benelux and in the U.S. In Latin America, the decline was mainly because we had some lower mandatory pension sales as new regulations led to a reduction in transfer activity. In fact, that is good news for us because lower transfer activity means more stable levels of income for our business in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Our capital ratios are solid, are good, and the insurance solvency ratio remains stable, at 241%, and the RBC ratio improved significantly to 456%. And that reflects the favorable impact of higher equity markets on the U.S. Closed Block.</p>
          <p>That will do it for now. I would say that we are ready to answer your questions and we have Patrick, Koos and Matthew available to do that together with me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Duncan Russell. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. JPMorgan. First question is, have you got any update on your ability to call hybrids <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:00), have you been in any discussions with them? And actually, I do note that you've got about &#x20AC;1.2 billion of cash in the holding company, I am assuming that's there for that purpose, so could you just update me on that?</p>
          <p>And second thing then is on ING Direct USA, you said you're thinking about transferring the Alt-A within ING Groep. Are there any regulatory things we need to be aware of when doing that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, your ability to strip out capital from ING Direct USA, are there any regulatory things we need to think about there as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the hybrids, we cannot make any comments. There's no news on that. On ING Direct U.S. Alt-A, Koos, you want to take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the Alt-A side, Duncan, what we want to do is the following. We want to make sure that if something would happen with ING Direct, in case you would come to a sale that you don't automatically become a fourth seller of an Alt-A transaction. And we realize that the government does not want to be directly related with the U.S. entity. So, simply what we are doing right now is looking at potentially re-hanging the Alt-A portfolio outside of ING Direct U.S. into ING Bank NV and continuing the transaction as is, and that is our first priority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's no regulatory issues within the U.S. regulator &#x2013; you don't have to do anything to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on the precise way how to structure that. That's  -- there's different ways how you can re-hang that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. And then the capital -- excess capital in ING Direct USA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excess capital in ING Direct USA, that is question that we need to evaluate here as well, that depends on what the transaction will be that will be done. So, I don't think we can comment on that at this moment yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Farooq Hanif. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. Actually, I want follow-up on the point that Duncan raised. Firstly, when you say re-hang the Alt-A, is that as straightforward as basically taking cash from European balance sheet putting it in place of the Alt-A in the U.S.? So, I mean, would that not actually recognize a loss? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is, the -- I understand, obviously, that in the U.S. what the kind of core Tier-1 ratios that you see are primarily kind of above a one type of model. Would that be a big change, if you moved to Basal III and you looked at core Tier-1 ratio of the U.S. business-- ING Direct U.S. on a Basal III basis. Would it be, actually, positive?</p>
          <p>And another question is, the competition that you're seeing in the net interest margin, effective net interest margin, is that going to be quite significant going forward or do think it's just a small blip? Those are all my questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Farooq, maybe on the first one on the Alt-A, what we have right now is ING Direct U.S. owns a government receivable and it owns a 20% Alt-A itself. Potentially, what would happen in such a case is that ING Bank would be buying these two assets for cash and it needs them to look at financing for this and that financing could potentially also come from ING Direct U.S.</p>
          <p>So, I don't need to do anything with European assets on this. It's just more focusing on those particular assets on the balance sheet of ING Direct in the U.S. But again, there is various options on how we want to do that and that is what we are still exploring. So, I don't have a definite of answer on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at -- we have Basel III for us, it's more on a consolidated basis. If you look at RWAs, and that is something which you have under U.S. GAAP and the local filing, they look approximately equivalent as what you have seen under IFRS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, basically you would -- the transaction wouldn't really affect the ratio &#x2013; the capital ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of bank interest margin, I presume you referring to the overall bank and not just ING Direct U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the interest margin has come down a little bit and that's broadly in line with what said last quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter last year, the interest margin was 147 basis points. We indicated that they would come down a little bit from that and that generally is what's happened, it's come down to 144. And that, in part, reflects some lower demand and increased competition in mid-corporate and a little bit of more pressure emerging in terms of our mortgage portfolio in Benelux.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, our specialized finance activities, we've had strong production there at good margins. Perhaps they are a little bit lower than Q4, but they're still away ahead were they were pre-crisis. And on the financial markets, well as you know we've said before, it's volatile, that can be a volatile factor. Good financial markets results this quarter, which is a typical seasonal effect when corporate treasurers get active again.</p>
          <p>On the liability side, we're seeing some pressure on savings and deposits and with some small client rate increases in Q1 in the Benelux. And as mentioned before, deposit competition in ING Direct countries, like Spain, remains strong. However, overall our margins are strong. We expect them to declines at a small rate, but remain elevated as compared to historical levels.</p>

          <p>Okay. Okay, just to come back on one thing, sorry to take so long. But just, of the Alt-A, when you said that you might fund it by a disposal, I mean, the conclusion from that is that you wouldn't have a liquidity do it without a disposal. Is that correct to &#x2013; that that's why you're transferring the Alt-A from one bank to another?</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from William Hawkins. Please state your company name follow by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much. It's William Hawkins from KBW. Two questions. With regards to the total bank, in the past you've given guidance to the potential Basel III impact on the core Tier-1 ratio. Forgive me, I haven't seen that in this. Could you maybe give us an update? So, I see the 10% core Tier 1, I know you say that that could come down 95 basis points post the final repayment to the Dutch state. But what pro forma impact be of Basel III? I think the last number was a cut of 75 basis points. So, if you could update?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in the Insurance business on slide 26. Strong operating result in the Benelux division, there's clearly ongoing regulatory pressure around specific products that may be broadening wider regulatory pressure on profitability in Dutch Insurance. Can you just give us sort of some kind of update of, you know, what the potential costs of regulation in the Dutch life insurance market could be and whether you view this becoming a systemic issue or just something that you have to deal with and move on from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe William, first, it's Koos, on the Basel III effects. What we have stated, that we have a core Tier-1 ratio of 10% right now. What we have done in the past, and you refer to a 70 basis point decline under Basel III, that is what we have said in the past and we have given an update and that was at an investor conference later on, that it was somewhere around 130.</p>
          <p>Let me make a few points on this. First one is what we did at that time when we defined it is we said like, if we implement it as of now, and as of now means no catching up of DTAs, no future profitabilities and we are depending a bit on the revaluation reserve and whether that will be basically neutralized to IFRS 9. So, there's plenty of uncertainties under there, and that makes a big impact.</p>
          <p>Overall, we feel that the way how our core Tier-1 is developing is very favorable and we feel, you know, in that sense, good. This full update is something which we don't want to give every quarter and nevertheless you can calculate it yourself easily because maybe the main changing particle is our profitability, because that's a plus, and you have the revaluation reserve, which is plus or minus depending on whether the interest rates goes down or up. So &#x2013; but overall, I think we have relatively comfortable starting position on Basel III.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe on the regulatory developments in the Netherlands, I think there are probably two important ones. The first is a requirement by the end of 2012 to go to a unisex pricing for all insurance contracts. Our reading of it right now is that would apply only to new contracts, but that's unclear at this moment. It will probably have operational implications, but not so much profitability implications, especially if it's going forward in pricing.</p>
          <p>The second one relates to discussions that have being going on, especially in the press and in the Parliament, around the so-called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:32) contracts. Now, you may recall back in 2008 ING had reached agreement with various consumer organizations to compensate contract holders. We have established provisions of something like &#x20AC;365 million, up through that time and we thought that that agreement had been, that that was done.</p>
          <p>It is now a bit reopened in Parliament and now it goes to the Minister of Finance, who has asked for a study to be done on the various arrangements that individual insurance companies have done to compensate these claims. I think it's a little bit too early to talk about what the potential impact of that might be; this will be an ongoing discussion within the industry, within the Netherlands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My overall question is, do you judge that's systemic risk to the sustainable profitability that you're reporting in the operating result? Or is it something that you'll work through and reprice for?</p>

          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Johnny from Goldman Sachs. The question is, just can you give us an update on the EC appeal that you've put in motion? That's the first question. The second question is just in terms of your new business sales on insurance side, you seem to be growing quite effectively and in particular the U.S. seems to be showing some growth there. Could you just talk about the growth that you're seeing in the U.S. insurance side? Thanks.</p>

You're seeing some very nice upticks in retirement services business, and the individual life side seems to be doing extremely well, up 43% in terms of application volumes over the first quarter of last year.

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Spencer Horgan. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning. It's Spencer Horgan from Deutsche Bank. Can I just ask to two small questions back on the topic of the core Tier-1 ratio? And firstly, when the 130 basis points impact of Basel III you mentioned before, can you remind me how much of that relates to deferred tax? And if the profitability of the bank will sort of stay current levels, for example, how long would it take that effect unwind? And then the second piece is, you talked about that the bank focusing on having strong capital ratios. Have you sort of changed your view on where the core Tier-1 ratio should be conceptually in the future? Maybe you can give us your thoughts on that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, Spencer, let me otherwise quickly update you on the core Tier-1 ratio had 130. Again, the one thing what I want to remind there the deduction there was based on both DTAs as well as the fact that we have IFRS9. So, they were various impacts, if you look at the DTAs it was approximately 40 basis points. So normally, what you would expect if you take 40 basis points and then, we are now calculating out loud a little bit, 40 basis points is little in access of &#x20AC;1 billion. So, you know our run rate profit, so that is something which you should be able to catch up in a reasonable time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That makes sense. In terms of the target sort of core Tier-1, prospectively?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe on the target there the point is we are comfortable where we are right now, clearly, because otherwise we wouldn't be making our repayment to the state. But giving a final target is a difficult one because we also have to look at the regulators and it does not make a lot of sense at the moment to make a target.</p>
          <p>We want to keep it in line with the major banks and the major deposit taking banks. But, at the same time, we also have to recognize that regulators have not given there final target yet. So, rather they are giving two updates we want to do that just one more time after that field is a bit more stabilized as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And have you got any expectations of sort of when that might be or what the new music from the regulators is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Spencer, Jan Hommen. We have been in touch, as Koos was saying, with all the regulators that deal with this topic. And in fact, we participate heavily in the discussions there. I would say that we expect more clarity at some time in the middle of the year and that final decisions will be made by the end of the year when they get together under the G20. I believe the G20, ultimately, will make that decision.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. It's William Elderkin from Soc Gen. I have three questions please. First of all, in terms of the new business sales, can you just give us a sense of how the margins on those new sales are developing, even just in the quarter, a sense? Secondly, you can reiterate the 50% cost income ratio target in the bank?</p>
          <p>Given the comments you've made in terms of the likely trend of net interest margin, can you give us --  or remind us again what sort of assumptions you're making in terms of absolute revenue and costs growth from here? And then, finally, can you give us an update in terms of how discussions in respect to the Latin American insurance business are developing in terms of any potential trade buyers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the sales and our margins in general these &#x2013; they're actually either staying stable in some areas, were improving. It's generally an upward trend, though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost income ratio targets for the bank, Jan has mentioned, yes we're keeping the target at 50%. It did come down from 57 to 55 in the first quarter. Getting it to 50% is going to require focusing on structural improvements. Those include things like procurement professionalizing or procurement process. It also includes the transformation programs we have in the Benelux and IT programs which are designed to eliminate complexity.</p>
          <p>So, this is structural work which will take time to deliver. In addition, we also have to invest and will invest in the business and continue to build the franchise and invest in marketing. So, this will be a long-term process of taking out structural cost overtime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add to that that we want to make sure that we continue to have &#x2013; we're not running the business for the next week or the next quarter. We're running the business for the long term. And we want to make this a very sound, very professional, one bank that has very local but at the same time has fantastic systems, that can stand the test of time.</p>
          <p>We want to build an excellent operational performance system and so we will continue to make investment where needed. This is something fundamental because I believe that once you do that that you will create savings themselves that allow you to make the professional investments that are needed to constantly upgrade your business. So, cost reductions, yes, but also upgrading our business and making the performance for our clients much more acceptable and much more attractive.</p>

          <p>Latin America, we are at this moment still where we though we would be in our plan, we are reviewing our options, strategic options, we have. And I would expect sometime later this year that we can give you an update what that would mean. No decisions have been made yet.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thomas Nagtegaal, RBS. I have two questions remaining. First of all, you again had some positive credit migration effect on your risk-weighted assets in Q1. What do you expect there for the remainder of the year? And second, coming back to Basel III, I know that the negative impacts for you is relevantly limited. Do you still see any potential additional mitigation which you can do going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thomas, two points if we look at the credit migration. Yes, we have seen a slight positive migration in the first quarter. What we would expect, actually, over the next quarters is on some model updates a slightly negative development there. I mean, we are not talking about big numbers but I don't expect the same level of migration positive as what we had in Q1. So, a slightly negative number there, but not big numbers.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Basel III negative impact and mitigation, let's take the starting point. The starting point is we are at a core Tier 1 of 10 right now and after repayment of the state it will be 9. That 9% is well above the minimum 7, as we know it right now. So, I think we don't need to do a lot of mitigation. I mean, if you look at us right now we are making a decent profit. We have a decent capital number. So, mitigation is not something I am looking forward or looking for to at the movement.</p>

          <p>Yes, morning. It's Mike van Wegen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. One question please. You talked about your conversations with regulators with regard to the future levels of core Tier 1. Can you update us maybe, specifically, on how you see the Dutch Central Bank developing currently, its way of thinking with regards to the implementation with SIFI and potentially any additional buffers on top of that? You just talked about 7% as a minimum and you feel comfortable with 9 but what are you getting back from your main regulator on this topic?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. We have discussions with them on a regular basis. I think we see in quite, let's say, on the one hand modest, but on the other hand quite, a strong relationship where we see they're not going to the extreme but somewhere in the middle of the pack I would say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Andrew Coombs from Citigroup. I have two questions please. First one is just coming back to ING Direct U.S.A., you talk about having the right structure in place to transfer the Alt-A assets. I was just wondering if you can give us a feel for how long the timeline might be in order to get that right structure in place? And also, therefore, what the implications are for a sale of ING Direct U.S.A., should we be thinking of that more as a 2011 or 2012 event?</p>
          <p>My second question just comes on the financial markets division within bank. If I look at your 2010 pre-tax profit numbers, I think 41% of the pre-tax profit came in the first quarter in that division. Do you think this year we'll see similar levels of seasonality or do you think it's more likely to be less pronounced, so perhaps closer to 30% for example, being booked in the first quarter this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to ING Direct U.S., the process we are following is a very diligent one. We have earlier indicated that we would wait as long as possible. We have now decided that we are going to canvass the options earlier, because of the complexity of this transaction potentially. If you do the unwinding of the Alt-A, or you need restructure that together with governments, that will take some time. So we are reviewing what options we have, including what we can do with the Alt-A, and I cannot make a prediction. I think it's quite unlikely that it will happen to be a deal this year, I cannot rule it out, but it's more likely 2012, in my opinion. But still, it all depends on how quickly that you come to agreement son these, again,  very complex type of structures that we need to resolve.</p>
          <p>With respect to the financial markets division, yeah, they do quite well always in Q1, because a lot of customers do their business in Q1, when they do their hedging and they're looking at the exposures that they have. So, Q1 is always the peak. Will it be the same this year as last year? Always very difficult to say, but I cannot give a good prediction on what that will be. But, maybe if you look at what they have done in the past, I must say that this division, this unit, has performed extremely well in the last three years and never lost anything in any quarter. So, quite a good performance there.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Jan Willem Weidema, ABN AMRO. I have two questions, the sales of insurance in the Benelux are higher. Could you give us a bit of how much of that is from renewals and how much is especially from new pension contracts? And ING Direct U.S., q-on-q, that online result  is down quite a bit, could you help me, what it is except for exchange rate changes?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>And ING Direct U.S., yes, we had the model updates in our loan loss provisions, which given at one time a step up in loan loss provision this quarter, which is the primary reason for the lower PBT as compared to Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Benoit P&#xE9;trarque. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Benoit P&#xE9;trarque from Kepler in Amsterdam. Couple of question, first one is one ING Direct, ING Direct U.S. You have US$8 billion equity allocated to the business for just $30 billion of risk weighted assets. So, I was wondering could you give us a bit of detail in terms of whether you leverage a bank holding, i.e., part of the equity allocated to ING Direct U.S. is not core equity but might also be debt holding, bank debt holding. Can you just clarify that?</p>
          <p>Could you also give us a bit of more details on the funding structure of WestlandUtrecht? I know you have been quite aggressive on the savings rates at WestlandUtrecht recently. So, does that bring savings and do you improve the balance sheet? Have you improved the balance sheet over the last quarter?</p>
          <p>Also on the DTA, I see the DTA in the January report of the bank table on 2010 versus 2009, I see the DTA down sharply in the U.S., which makes sense because of the profitability of the U.S. operation, but looks like some -- you have new DTA in other jurisdictions, so can you clarify that? And you still think the DTA can come down further in the coming years? And then, can you remember us what is the risk-weighted assets rating on the Alt-A portfolio please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with respect to WestlandUtrecht, you know, we are trying to build that franchise and improve the division to generate local deposits. We're also supporting the business in terms of its ability to start to think about issuing long-term debt to support it. I mean, the balance sheet is &#x20AC;37 billion of assets so and still the deposit franchise will take some time, but it's a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p>In terms of the overall DTAs, they are particularly in respect of DTAs on losses, they are coming down, they're less than &#x20AC;1 billion and as referred to in an earlier question, given the pay &#x2013; if current profitability picks up, they'll come down reasonably rapidly. I don't have a breakdown to handle country-by-country, given like before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with regards to with risk-weighted assets, Benoit, I don't have a breakdown of risk-weighted assets for individual type of categories, like ALT-A, so that is not the type of breakdown I have available for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I did not hear the answer on the first question. Sorry, the line was bad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on ING Direct, you have a big amount of equity allocated to the U.S. for a relatively small amount of risk-weighted assets to this business, so I was wondering if you have debt, leverage at bank holding level which you injected as equity in the U.S. security, because this could be obviously relevant in estimating the amount access capital you have in this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Benoit, on that, you are right. I mean, what you have and you can see that in local filings you have an operating company and a holding company above it. In the operating company, your total equity is higher, that's approximately &#x20AC;8 billion, and in the holding company they are some leverage above it. The reason why this is done this way is that the U.S. is also still run on a Basal I type of metric rather than on a Basal II, so that difference is what you see in that holding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Farquhar, Autonomous Research here. Just one quick question from me, really a follow-up on ING Direct U.S. Are there actually any tax asset implications from either a disposal of that business or a shift in Alt-A portfolio? And I don't know if you really -- I know you just said that you don't have the detailed breakdown by country, but might you just have the one for the U.S. by chance? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry about that, can you hear better now? Can you hear better now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's just a final follow-up on ING Direct U.S. I'm just wondering are there any actual tax and asset implications from a disposal of ING Direct U.S. or indeed, a shift in Alt-A portfolio? And I know you said that you &#x2013; you're not giving the details by country. But I just wondered whether you might have the U.S. ING Direct one by chance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean there is in Section 382, when you dispose can give rise to potential haircuts for the acquirer on DTAs, if you meet to certain thresholds on change the ownership clauses. But at this juncture, we are not in a position to confirm whether that would be the case or not -- and I don't happen to have the breakout for the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks much, indeed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Hans Pluijgers. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Hans Pluijgers, Cheuvreux. Three questions if I may, first of all looking at the insurance side &#x2013; the cost base which was quite strong, 40% expense income ratio. Could you, a little bit, talk us through what you expect to transfer the coming quarters and what measures still you are taking to reduce cost there?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the solvency, 241 and stable against -- compared to the end of last year, despite an increase in interest rates. Could you give some indication and how the sensitivity of this solvency is compared to changes in interest rates currently?</p>
          <p>And lastly, on ING Direct, are you still looking or more into ING Direct and the strategic review on what the total business could be for the future is -- do you see <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:19) funding company for the other parts of the business? And do you in principally strive for excess deposits at ING Direct in terms of, especially, the Benelux operations, or do you believe that -- do you see some part of the operations which still do not have to -- the group profile going forward is to remain in the company? I am more referring to, of course, Australia which has been rumored that you're looking that? Could you be at the liberty to give some more feeling on how you will see ING Direct within the Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me deal, there with the last one and then Matt will deal with the insurance questions. We see ING Direct as a very important vehicle in the future of our bank. Why? Because we do have the ability to, as a universal bank, use the assets or the liability generating capability of ING Direct and combine that with the strong capability we have on the commercial bank sides to generate assets.</p>
          <p>That will create a very powerful combination. We can do that in different countries and different regions. We are not doing that in the U.S. for a number of reasons, but we are doing it in other places where we can. And so, we see that as a very important part of our business. And rumors, normally we don't comment on rumors because we can make a day job out of that, but in this case I would say ING Direct Australia is not for sale. And Matt, can you deal with the other topics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, with respect to the, sort of, the cost income ratio for the insurance and investment manager, we saw that come down to 40% in the first quarter, and that's obviously a very good number against our overall target of 35%.</p>
          <p>However, important to note that the first quarter is generally seasonally a little bit low. We generally see lower expenses in the first quarter. Also, I think Jan had mentioned in his opening remarks that there were some provision releases for some incentive compensation, so that drove the number down maybe a little bit, maybe by a percentage point or so.</p>
          <p>We would expect this number for the balance of year to go up slightly. We still have some measures that we intend to take as a management team, but for the balance of the year we would expect to see it somewhat below the level of the full year last year.</p>
          <p>Then, your other question with respect to the Solvency 1 IGD ratio, we had seen it's stable from the fourth quarter. It's actually not a number that is incredibly sensitive to interest rates and you can see that over the past several years that's been extremely stable, something between 240% and 260%. So, increasingly, we're going to be looking obviously as the rest of the industry at more Solvency 2-type measures, but that's to come.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Lemer Salah. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Lemer Salah from SNS Securities. I have two questions. First of all, can you elaborate a bit on the timing of the Latin American insurance disposal? I mean, the timing at this moment is really beneficial for financials and taking into account that you have to do two IPOs in 2012, would it be beneficial for you to do a trade sale or another divestment structure for the Latin American insurance division in 2011? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is, I missed in your presentation the net stable funding ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio for -- at this moment for ING. Do you have the numbers in front of you, can you share it with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Lemer, let me view this first question and Koos will take the second one. Timing for LatAm, we are doing our strategic review for LatAm and we are very &#x2013; progressing, I think, very well. I realize together this year, that we see a good market. And so, we are completing that review with some urgency as well. But, we need to take our time, we need to do it right, we need to our processes in a diligent way. And that will happen. I cannot make any further comment, but I promised earlier that as soon as we have made our decision, you will know as the first one. And that mean you as collectively you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wonderful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lemer, on the NSFR and the LCR, indeed, we didn't give an update and that is for two reasons. One is there was not a material change in that. As you know, we have a loan to deposit ratio 106 and our liquidity coverage ratio was around the 90s. And we have not seen a material change. If you look at the next stable funding ratio. I think for me, it makes not a lot of sense to update all the time on this &#x2013; this is an implementation 2018. So therefore, we want to ask that &#x2013; yes, we need to be proactive in reporting but this is a 2018 measures. So, it's far away. And therefore, from time to time we gave an update if we have a significant change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pleased to have your answers. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The question is from Marcus Rivaldi. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Marcus Rivaldi here from Morgan Stanley. And my first question please is on the pace of your appeals to the EC. If you're still in dispute with the EC come May next year, would that impact your decision to press ahead with repaying remaining state aid to the Dutch state?</p>
          <p>My second question is, unfortunately, around hybrid calls, I'm afraid. If, ultimately, you do push on with the repayment of that remaining &#x20AC;3 billion, but you're still in dispute around the premium paid on the first tranche, would that in your opinion impact your ability, or prevent you from calling hybrids?</p>
          <p>And then finally, a very specific one, we also see there's a hybrid call in the insurance business coming up very shortly. You were given some very clear guidance, obviously, on previous hybrid calls. Do you expect that the EC might change their view, allowing you to call that bond, given IPO prospects for the insurance operation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc, we are -- on the appeal, it's very difficult to make any comments on the appeal. We don't know what the end result will be. We are not speculating what it might be. I think that's not what we are doing here. I cannot tell you what that that might do. I can only say that we will do our best when we are called, but no more than that. Those are the hybrids.</p>
          <p>And then the second question related to if we are still arguing the premium. Again here I cannot speculate on that. In fact, we cannot make any comments whatsoever with respect to hybrids because we each time have to request whether we can do so by the European Commission and they basically determine whether we can or not. So, I cannot make any comments on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But can I just go back to your statement that you make report around the &#x2013; your target of repaying remaining state support by May 2012. What are you thinking around the EC dispute when setting out that target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the target is that we pay the core Tier-1 -- to buy back the core Tier-1 securities and we will have to do what we have to do when we know what the rules are at that time. I cannot predict what they are. The worst thing that we can do is plan for the worst, which is we assume that we have to pay a 50% premium, but we cannot say anything else on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Tony Silverman from Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. It's just a question about the profitability of ING Direct in the U.S. As you've mentioned, you're progressing the sale. I don't -- I may have missed it here, but I don't see a sort of line or column from ING Direct in the U.S. specifically. Wondering what you can say about its profitability and the capital that any profitability number is based on? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a lot of separate segments in our results that vary within ING Direct itself, although we do give some detail in the statistical supplement on the profitability to PBT for it to standalone. Remember, we said earlier it did come down as compared to the fourth quarter, which was due to a one-time update to the loan loss model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would be -- when you're looking at this profitability, what is the NAV of it? Just as I was looking at the statistical supplements, I don't see a column for ING Direct in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's there and perhaps we can help you. After the call we'll point you directly to it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Fran&#xE7;ois Boissin from Exane BNP Paribas. Two questions on my side, please. The first one is related to WestlandUtrecht, and basically what type of timeframe are you looking at on that? And basically, if you had the choice, would you be happier keeping this asset or basically are you happy to sell it?</p>
          <p>And second question is with regard to ING Direct, you mentioned that clearly balance sheet integration is a key issue for ING Direct. I was just wondering to what extent this applies to their geographies, i.e., is this just a European matter or does this entail Canada and Australia as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, sorry, it's Koos. Let me first start on the ING Direct. I think the easiest integration for us, Indeed, is in Europe and that is what you see is also in this quarter we did &#x20AC;2 billion more of balance sheet integration. So, that is something which is happening.</p>
          <p>I think the other parts are less significant in order to do that. I mean, there is limited Australian options, because balance sheet integration simply means if we have an excess of savings in ING Direct and we can connect it to other assets which are funding externally in the market. And but, the biggest opportunity is clearly in Europe. You are right on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean as follow-up question is, would you at some point in time reconsider your exposures elsewhere than Europe for ING Direct as a total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think ING Direct is a very important franchise for us and it has done extremely well. But, looking at, and it's still a growth opportunity that we have with ING Direct. I think we want to look through that very carefully and as I said earlier, at this moment, we're very happy with the business, we're still growing the business and it is doing extremely well. So, there's no need for making any change here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And WestlandUtrecht?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>WestlandUtrecht, yeah. We are, of course, we have carved out a business, it is standalone, it is running basically on itself. The only relation we have is the funding is still being done by ING and they are actively pursuing new opportunities to fund themselves as you can see in the marketplace here in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Timing of that is still open. We like to do it of course when we can, but we need to have the right type of counter parties to execute a transaction here and we have not found them yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess if you were -- I mean, if you were unable to find a good price for that, would you come back to the EC saying, right, funding is too important and keeping the asset makes more sense for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are not starting on that premise, I think we are starting on the premise that we need to do what we have been told by the European Commission when we signed that agreement in November 2009, and we are going further on the premise. So, we're not looking at maintaining that in-house.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> There appear to be no further -- I beg your pardon, we have a question from Dirk Peeters. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, Dirk Peeters from KBC Securities. I have two small questions. You are currently in litigation with Europe regarding the commission of state aid and price leadership restrictions and so on. But, at the same time you haven't paid a dividend for two years. Now, I have seen what is the next step there that triggers the renotification report, which in turn could trigger some price leadership restrictions and so on from the European Commission. Just wanted to check that if you win the case with Europe in the summer time that you just don't end up again with price leadership restrictions, linked to the fact that you don't pay any dividends?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, when I look at Basel III in the slide you showed with the assumption that you have 130 basis points impact, it mentioned that you don't know yet whether you will be considered as a systemic bank whereas I think most of the investors do believe that you will be considered a systemic bank. But, when I look at the press, the have the impression of the Dutch government wants to speed up this process of introduction of Basel III. And then, I would like to know what this could mean for you, if you are considering a systemic bank and you need 1% or 2% solvency capital?</p>

          <p>Okay. With respect to renotification, we have not paid dividends, but we are repaying the Dutch state and we are paying that with a big premium. So, I think we need to rate what that means and I cannot really anticipate on whatever can happen in the court case, that is too complex and we don't want to speculate on that.</p>
          <p>With respect to Basel III, I know that the regulators are looking to make some implementations, but at the same time, I think they was also good coordination between the other regulators, with respect to implementation of Basel III. Are we a SIFI, as I know, we don't know yet. The regulators determine that. And if we are a SIFI, yes, we may need additional capital, but we will only know that by the time that we have been notified and that we know exactly what type of SIFI we are.</p>
