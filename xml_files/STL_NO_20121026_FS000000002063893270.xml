          <p>Good day and welcome to the Statoil ASA Q3 Results Presentation Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Please be advised, there may be silence before the call begins.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over Hilde Nafstad.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">

          <p>[Foreign Language] (0:23-1:35) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Statoil's Third Quarter Earnings Presentation, both to the audience here in Oslo and to our audience &#x2013; or the webcast audiences. My name is Hilde Nafstad. I'm the head of Statoil Investor Relations Group.</p>
          <p>This morning at 7:30 Central European time, Statoil announced the results for the third quarter 2012. The press release and presentations for today's events were distributed through the wires and through Oslo Stock Exchange. The quarterly reports and the presentations can, as usual, be downloaded from our website, statoil.com. I would kindly ask you to make special note of information regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found on the last page.</p>
          <p>Today's program will start with Statoil's CEO (sic) [CFO] (2:25), Torgrim Reitan, going through the earnings and the outlook for the company. As usual, the presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session. Please note that questions can be posted by means of telephone, but not directly from the web. The dial-in numbers for posting questions can be found on our website.</p>
          <p>It is now my privilege to introduce Statoil's Chief Financial Officer, Torgrim Reitan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hilde, and good afternoon to all of you here in our new office at Fornebu, and good morning and good afternoon to those of you following us on the webcast. It is a pleasure to present our results for the third quarter this year. And once again, we present solid financial results and operational performance.</p>
          <p>We are delivering at 10% higher year-on-year production, on the same period as last year, and an 8% production growth if you compare it to the full 2011. We continue to add barrels from discoveries and increase the recoveries, and we sharpened our portfolio through value-creating transactions.</p>
          <p>On Monday, we filed an asset deal with Wintershall, exiting our operated Brage field and farming zone in Gj&#xF8;a and Vega. We realized $1.45 billion in cash from non-core assets, and there we added 15% in Edvard Grieg. That was previously known as Luno, and that is adding growth and growth assets, close to Johan Sverdrup, which is a key asset. And the transaction demonstrates the underlying value of our NCS portfolio.</p>
          <p>Johan Sverdrup is one of the largest well-developed oil fields in the world, and it is one of our key assets for the future. And we now have secured working interest in all discoveries on the Utsira High; Johan Sverdrup, Edvard Grieg, Dagny and Ivar Aasen. And as the largest player in that area, we take these positions to drive the development and capture additional potential in that area.</p>
          <p>So, we do this to revitalize the Norwegian continental shelf, and we continue to create value to the management of our portfolio and to sharpen our portfolio further.</p>
          <p>We have added substantial new volumes from the Geitungen prospect, which is part of the ongoing appraisal program and development activity on the giant Johan Sverdrup. We will come back with the total resource estimate for that field early next year. We have also proved oil in the basement rock, and that's a possible upside.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we have stepped up all activities in the Arctic. We signed agreements with Rosneft to establish joint ventures for four offshore licenses in Russia, and we will drill nine wells in the Norwegian Barents Sea next year. And I'm eager to see what Tim and his team can deliver on that one.</p>
          <p>We have added new volumes to increase oil recovery. In the third quarter, we increased average recovery rate from oil fields on NCS from around 49% to 50%. That is setting a new world record within increased oil recovery. And 1 percentage point, that equals 327 million barrels. And if you use the oil prices of today, that is actually some NOK 200 billion in revenues. And this pays significant value to Statoil and to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And if you look back at the point of sanction, the average recovery rate was around 30% on these fields and we have actually added some 7.5 billion barrels from increased oil recovery. And to put that in perspective, that is similar to two Statoil fields.</p>
          <p>So, based on this success, we have launched a new ambition early this quarter of getting to 60% recovery rate on our operated fields on the shelf.</p>
          <p>And then, we continue to mature oil project portfolio. We have been sanctioning four new IOR projects in the quarter, and we continue to ramp up productions from our new fields.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we delivered solid operational performance. I have said before that I have been looking forward to 2012, and this year we see significant growth. And we deliver as planned. So this &#x2013; so far this year, we have increased production by 8% compared to last year's average, and I will come back to oil production outlook in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>We have increased our gas production by 18% in the quarter, and this is due to strong gas markets in Europe with good prices. So, at high value, we increased our volumes, and that is in line with our flexibility strategy.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our liquid production is slightly down in the quarter, and that is, as I told you, last quarter. And we are very pleased with the execution of the large turnaround program, and that has been a great job done by our teams and our suppliers.</p>
          <p>The decline rate on mature fields is also stable, and that's in line with what we have discussed earlier. It's around 5%. And as you know, we are adjusting the production related to the Heidrun redetermination, which means that we will not book any production volumes from this field in the second half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we see the effects of the divestment of the Centrica last year, so that is impacting the production in the second half. And even with a significant higher turnaround in the third quarter and the point mentioned, we delivered production growth in Norway.</p>
          <p>We are also progressing well on Gullfaks, low at more than 100,000 barrels per day. And internationally, we increased our production by 24% quarter-on-quarter. And year-to-date, we stand at an even stronger 27%. And we continue to build up our production outside Norway.</p>
          <p>Pazflor in Angola, that is operated by Total, continued to deliver, and that field contributed with 47,000 barrels per day for us in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Then, we produced 38,000 barrels per day from Bakken, the asset that we acquired a year ago, and we have added a rail capacity to that asset and bypassing the pipeline bottlenecks that is currently &#x2013; that we currently experience in that area. And that is to ensure that we get the oil to the market at the highest price possible and reducing the differentials. And we see that is works. And our trading organization in Stamford created a lot of value from these balance.</p>
          <p>Marcellus also delivers strong production, at over 63,000 barrels per day in the quarter. On the Eagle Ford, we will take up operatorship of the acreage and in the Eastern part next year, stepping up for our second operatorship in U.S. onshore. So, we produced as planned.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, our net operating income was NOK 40.9 billion, that is up NOK 1.6 billion from last year or 4%. Our net income is NOK 14.5 million, which is up 47% from last year. And we see a lower effective tax rate this quarter, and I will come back to text a little bit later.</p>
          <p>The adjusted earnings before tax were NOK 40 billion. That's a slight decrease over the last year, and that is due to higher exploration expenses partly offset by higher gas production and prices.  And then, we continue with a high exploration activity, with drilling ongoing in several exciting prospects.</p>
          <p>Operational costs and SG&amp;A are at the same level as last year, at NOK 19 billion. If we adjust for the SFR divestment, we see a flat cost development over the last quarter despite the high activity levels and the production growth. And we will continue to attack our cost base.</p>
          <p>After tax, we made NOK 11.9 billion, quarter on an adjusted basis. That's an increase of 4% from the same period last year.</p>
          <p>We delivered NOK 31.1 billion in adjusted earnings from development and production, Norway. That's a decrease of 13%. And as discussed, our liquid production is down, and that is impacting earnings by some NOK 7.7 billion. And this is from the planned turnarounds activity, the Heidrun redetermination, and our divestments of producing assets to Centrica.</p>
          <p>We saw lower depreciation in this segment, and that is due to higher reserves and lower production this quarter.</p>
          <p>Then, we produced a lot of gas, and that is increasing by 11%, and we realized a 14% higher gas price this quarter than the same period last year.</p>
          <p>In international development and production, the adjusted earnings was NOK 4.4 billion. That is up 7% from NOK 4.1 billion in the third quarter last year. And we are growing our international production significantly, and this increase was partly offset by increased exploration and depreciation expenses from lower prices and increased royalties.</p>
          <p>The higher exploration charges are partly due to a significantly increased seismic activity, including the activity in the Kwanza Basin in Angola where we are preparing for <mark type="ph" /> hosting (14:19), I must say, pre-salt wells to be drilled in 2014.</p>
          <p>Then, we see a very strong quarter in marketing, processing and renewables, delivered earnings of NOK 4.1 billion, which is a 67% increase over the same period last year. For natural gas earnings, we had NOK 2.7 billion compared to NOK 2.81 billion a year ago, and that is despite the lower gas <mark type="ph" /> in the States (14:45) this year. And normally, that contributed with NOK 1 billion per quarter.</p>
          <p>The strong result was due to higher margins from our gas sales and higher volumes and higher prices and good saving and end user sales.</p>
          <p>For the crude part and marketing and trading, earnings were NOK 1.5 billion in the quarter compared to a loss last year of NOK 0.2 billion. Increase came from strong refining margins and continued strong results from the trading activities and another good quarter from our trading floors.</p>
          <p>Plus, there is still a demanding outlook for the refinery business, and we must be prepared for lower margins than we have seen in the quarter. And we will continue our improvement program with full force, and we actually see the impact and effects of the improvement program in our earnings. And then, just a reminder that the results for MPR, that will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>The reported tax rate was 66.9% in the quarter. And based on adjusted earnings, it was 70.4%. This is in the lower part of our guided range of 70% to 73%. And I said earlier that you should expect our tax rate for the full year to be in upper part of that range or slightly above, and this is unchanged. The decrease in the tax rate is mainly related to a relatively higher adjusted earnings outside the Norwegian continental shelf.</p>
          <p>Over to the cash flows. The cash flow from our underlying operations year-to-date is NOK 188 billion. We have invested for NOK 84 billion. We have freed up NOK 29 billion from value-creating portfolio management, and NOK 29 billion amounts to the market cap of a top 10 company on the Oslo Stock Exchange.</p>
          <p>Purchase transactions are, and will continue to be, an important and integrated part of our strategy going forward, and I will come back to that shortly. We paid NOK 77 billion in tax and NOK 21 billion in dividends. And please note that the paid taxes of NOK 77 billion is significantly lower than the reported income tax in the account of NOK 104 billion so far this year.</p>
          <p>And as you know, we pay tax in Norway six times per year. We have already paid one installment in the fourth quarter, and we will pay another one on 1st of December of around NOK 20 billion.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our cash flow. Operating cash flow has grown by 10% in the first nine months based on stable prices, and this is in line with our production growth. And this contributes to our strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We have now close to NOK 85 billion or $15 billion in cash and current papers, and we have taken down our adjusted net debt to 12.6% this quarter. So, financial robustness is still very important to us and a very important strategic issue.</p>
          <p>Our project portfolio is capable of producing more than 3.5 million barrels per day in 2020, and it is an attractive portfolio, as you now. However, we will continue to optimize the portfolio to sharpen the growth further and putting our money where our strategy is. And I think the recent transactions illustrate this in a pretty good way.</p>
          <p>We realize value from non-core assets like in Gassled and Statoil Fuel &amp; Retail. We balance risk by taking in new partners in Peregrino and KKD, and we focus our portfolio by deploying resources into core areas and divesting non-core assets like we did with Centrica and Wintershall.</p>
          <p>These transactions bring more than NOK 15 billion in proceeds to the company in addition to our new stake in Edvard Grieg. And we have realized accounting gains of more than NOK 6 billion based on these transactions, and we will continue our strategy of targeted investments in addition like our Bakken acquisition last year.</p>
          <p>So, we will add and we will subtract and, thereby, creating significant value for our shareholders. And then, our growth towards 2020 will be of even higher quality. So, we will balance our investment program going forward with an active portfolio management, and we maintain our policy of a predictable and growing dividend and we will continue to maintain a strong and solid balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So, we are progressing as planned &#x2013; excuse me. We are delivering a 10% growth in production year-to-date compared to same period last year, and an 8% growth if you compare it to the average of the full year last year. And this is an industry-leading performance, and it is in line with our guidance.</p>
          <p>Then, looking ahead, we will have organic investments of around NOK 18 billion in 2012. Given the solid production growth we see for the next year, it is likely that we will see some growth in the gross CapEx next year, and I will revert more closely to this in February. However, we are investing for growth with a low breakeven price across the portfolio and industry-leading rate of returns on the projects. So, we are spending money to make even more money.</p>
          <p>We will explore for around $3.5 billion. We will drill 45 wells in total this year, and we have already added more resources this year than the 2011, which was a record year for us since the IPO.</p>
          <p>And then, we will drill some 20 to 25 high-impact wells from 2012 to 2014. We will run, I must say, a very interesting drilling campaign in Barents starting next year &#x2013; or starting in this winter of nine wells. We'll start with spudding the Nunatak prospect next month, and this is close to the Skrugard and Havis discoveries.</p>
          <p>We are on-track for our 2012 production outlook. We are delivering growth as planned. And then, we expect our fourth quarter production to be around the level of fourth quarter last year. And let me give some color to this.</p>
          <p>We are currently ramping up production from Peregrino, Pazflor, Marcellus, Bakken, Eagle Ford. And then, we plan to bring three fast-track project on stream during the next &#x2013; during the fourth quarter. Plus, you should remember that you have to adjust for Heidrun redetermination and the reduced ownership shares on Kvitebj&#xF8;rn, as well as the delays for start-ups, and that will counter the new production expected in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the longer term, we are steadily heading towards 2020 and our ambition to produce more than 2.5 million barrels per day. And we are on-track for an average growth of 2% to 3% from 2012 to 2016, thus production will fluctuate from year-to-year. And we see 2013 production lower than 2012 production. And I would like to give some color on the reasoning for that.</p>
          <p>First, the Wintershall transaction will reduce production in 2013. The divested fields produce around 40,000 barrels per day in 2012, and that similar level is expected in 2013.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we will reduce the rig counts in the U.S., responding to the low U.S. gas prices. And the beauty of that asset is the ability to react to prices to create more value. The growth in the U.S. will be slow next year, and the impact may be in the order of 25,000 barrels per day compared to <mark type="ph" /> flatt (24:55).</p>
          <p>So, the reduced production from our U.S. gas position will, however, have limited impact on earnings, which is the whole point. So, both of these things are deliberate actions by ourselves to create value through our divestment and through value-over-volume strategy in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we are significantly growing, both on production and our earnings: 8% production growth compared to the full 2011; adjusted earnings, year-to-date, gross, also with 8%; and our operating cash flow is growing with 10% so far this year. And then, we are continuing to invest into a very profitable project portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, thank you very much for your attention. And then, I'll leave the word to you, Hilde, to lead us through the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I hope that you could give some comments about the renegotiations of gas contracts. Because I think it was last year or the beginning of this year, you also comment that 50% is due &#x2013; 50% of volumes is up for renegotiation. I assume you can't tell much, but how much is remaining when you consider renegotiation now?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="ph" /> Anna (27:37). Let me start with what's going on. And you're right, we are renegotiating our contracts and more than, I think, our gas contract portfolio, which is about taking back flexibility and changing the structure of some of those contracts.</p>
          <p>So, that work is actually going well. We have concluded some half &#x2013; like 50% of the contracts. They have been renegotiated, and I think I'd have say that we are well satisfied with the results. So, quite a bit of the new contract <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:30) is reflected in our gas price that we report today. And as you, it's healthy. It's a healthy gas price. And it also enables us to use the flexibility in the portfolio that we have, Troll, Oseberg, the transportation facilities and all the landing points and so on. So, we are able to create value on that flexibility.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Lars from SEB Enskilda. In relation to your 2013 guidance where I think when you say that production will be lower than 2012, can you explain or can you tell, have you excluded the been-sold-related volumes from 1st of January or actually from the second half of 2013? Because you have said that the transaction will take place due to regulatory work from second half, so from when &#x2013; when have you exclude the 35,000 barrels per day to 40,000 barrels per day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean when that transaction &#x2013; that transaction will have an effective date of 1st of January. So, there will be earnings impact from 1st of January, in a way, or it will have an economic impact from the effective date. So, the way this works is that when everything is closed, you have a settlement in cash for that period, number one. And then, you count barrels until you have closed everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, when the point of closure is, of course, uncertain because there needs to be approvals from the authorities on transactions like this. So, that is uncertain. But what the data point that I gave you is that that portfolio produced 40,000 barrels per day in 2012, and they will produce approximately on similar levels in 2013. And then, of course, when you count barrels, you need to make an assumption on when this is closed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>So, okay, just to clarify then, which means if this transaction takes place in the beginning of fourth quarter next year, you have produced 39,000 barrels for the first three quarters, so the full year effect is only 10,000 barrels for you next year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Even with that effect, you have &#x2013; you will say that you are below in 2013 compared to 2012, or has you excluded 40,000 barrels?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't go into those details in the guiding. But based on that transaction, and also what we're doing in U.S. gas, we'll now see that it will be lower than 2012. Both are two data points that I'm giving to you today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One more question related to CapEx for next year; sort of  kind of a soft guidance, a little bit higher next year or some higher, can you tell little bit more about the split between, in your CapEx growth, between offshore, onshore and conventional, what will grow, what will not grow in your contracts? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, typically, 45% of oil investments will be related to Norwegian continental shelf. Some 50% will be within the international segment. The remainder will be related to midstream investments that is there to support the upstream business. Then, in general, 70% of oil investments goes into greenfield development, 30% into brownfield, and that brownfield is split between IOR projects and drilling of wells. And then, finally, maintenance and modifications on the platforms. But this mainly going into new developments.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the spilt within the international segments, we don't give that specific guidance. But due to the lower rig counts between Marcellus, it is sort of slightly lower than we anticipated in a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question, can you please state your name of &#x2013; your own name and the name of your company. And I think that's your turn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Trond Omdal, Arctic Securities. On your fourth quarter guiding of the same level as last year, is there some upside on gas, or does that assume robust off-take? Because as you said, gas prices in the UK are very high for the season 65 pence per therm, so is that the even assuming price reduction or is there still some upside, if you can give some color on that?</p>
          <p>The second question; I assume almost all of the lower drilling activity is on Marcellus, or wouldn't some of it be on the gas part of Eagle Ford. And I think you've indicated you're drilling some more of the liquids-rich component of Marcellus. Will that have any effect on liquid from Marcellus next year or will that negligible?</p>
          <p>Third on ACG, of course, you're not the operator, but is there anything you can say about the ongoing discussion between the government and BP on trying to maintain their production longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Trond. When it comes to production in the fourth quarter and gas assumptions, it is healthy a gas market on the continent. I mean, the UK, currently. We see going forward somewhat more tightening on the LNG side, more to Asia, so we do expect a healthy market for the full of fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The way that we run the gas machine is that, typically, in the fourth quarter and first quarter, it runs on full speed. And then, there are some assets that have flexibility. For instance, at Oseberg field. The Oseberg field, we can produce the production permit in 80 days and pick the very best dates and so on. So that, of course is &#x2013; there is also always an uncertainty when you want to produce that field. in a way, but it is less uncertainty related to the gas production and gas off-take in the first quarter &#x2013; in the fourth quarter and first quarter than during the summer months.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Marcellus, or the U.S. gas, this would typically be in the northern part, in the dry gas area. And the liquid area in the south is less affected on what we are doing.</p>
          <p>A couple of reflections on the gas markets; in the U.S., currently, some $3.30 per MBtu and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:31), an increase since this summer, so it is better. But in dealing with the gas in the U.S., it is extremely important to take care of your gas and add additional value to how you deal with your gas.</p>
          <p>So, from 1st of November, we will start to sell &#x2013; transport and sell our gas in Toronto, increasing, keeping in pace, quite generous at least on our gas. And then, we are working on our pipeline together with Spectra and Con Edison and Chesapeake to cross the Hudson River to the U.S. This would actually come up at Penn station and connect to the grid there. And you know the gas prices on Manhattan is totally different than on the Jersey side of the river. So taking care of our gas is extremely important, and we do that and we trade quite a bit of additional value on top of that.</p>
          <p>When it comes to ACG, I cannot go into discussions that BP has with the government there. I think you are better asking them about that. So, I think on a general comment, we have BP as operator in several places in the portfolio. Sn&#xF8;hvit has been mentioned earlier; in Azerbaijan, ACG and Shah Deniz; PSVM in Angola; and Schiehallion in the UK. Those are sort of, I guess, the most notable assets that BP is an operator. So, we have BP as an operator, several places in the portfolio. But when it comes to ACG, I think you are better placed to ask a question to BP on how they look at that.</p>

          <p>Yes, okay. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:54), thank you. Yes, we have plans to increase the production in Bakken and Eagle Ford. So, for instance, Bakken is producing some 38,000 barrels per day in this quarter. When we acquired it a year ago, it produced 21,000, so it's almost doubled. We are continuing with &#x2013; is it 15 &#x2013; Svein, 15 rigs now?</p>

          <p>About 14 to 15 rigs recently in Bakken. Operations actually runs very smoothly.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hilde. Good morning, all, and &#x2013; or good afternoon. I just wanted to ask three quick questions, if I could. Well, firstly, just a point of clarification about the gas contracts renegotiations, just the question you answered earlier on, Torgrim. I just wanted to understand, did you specifically say half of all the gas contracts that you have outstanding or half of the amount that you originally said was up for renegotiation? Just to clarify, that will be great, thanks.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on CapEx, and I know you may wish to reserve the right to answer this question with the strategy update early next year, but I just &#x2013; given your comment around some growth in gross CapEx and given the sort of &#x2013; the recent acquisition of the stake in Edvard Grieg and some of the projects you have upcoming, I just wondered if we should be thinking about this as a step-change in CapEx over the coming one to two years or is it sort of something more benign than that? It just would be great to get your thoughts on that.</p>
          <p>And then finally, just an update, if possible, on some of the key wells that are being drilled at the moment so &#x2013; specifically, I'm thinking of Kilchurn, but also the Lavani and Zafarani appraisals, where we are on those three? That will be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Haythem, thank you. On the gas contracts, this is 50% on the totality...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the scope, so it is progressing well. When it comes to CapEx 2013 and whether you should expect significant step-up on it, I used the word some increase in CapEx, which is certainly not a significant step-up as you say, but it is a direction on the numbers. Svein, can you give an update on the drilling program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On Zafarani and Lavani, we are in the progress of them &#x2013; evaluating them and looking at more appraisal, what's in the rock for Lavani and Zafarani. In addition to that, we're also then evaluating further prospects and then come up with a drilling campaign for that a little bit later. So as of now, we will do the appraisal drilling for Lavani and Zafarani.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Kilchurn is in an evaluation phase, looking at that one. So, that, we need to come back to a little bit later when we are done our evaluation on it. Also maybe then on others, on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:20) which is then ongoing, where we expect the results in a couple of months' time.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, afternoon. Three questions from me as well. First one, coming back to those gas contracts, average <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:45) gas price increase of 10% Q3 on Q3. I'm conscious of the commercial sensitivities, but could you tell us very broadly following the recent round of contract renegotiations. So what percentage of your total portfolio gas sale price is tied to oil products versus spot indexation?</p>
          <p>Two, on Bakken, you mentioned higher realization because of gas capacity. What kind of realization price relative to the benchmark should we factor in?</p>
          <p>And finally, in an interview yesterday, President of STL Canada Operations expressed interest in LNG assets in the country. Is this something on near-term agenda of the company? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. So <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:33) gas prices. A significant increase in that. And your question is about the exposure to oil products in there. Typically, 70% of our gas sales is related to long-term contracts. The rest is, typically, spot index. And of those 70%, half of the contract had been renegotiated. That should give you a flavor of the impact.</p>
          <p>So, we are &#x2013; when I talk about the renegotiations, it's much &#x2013; it of course comes down to price, but the long-term contracts, they &#x2013; we are not selling &#x2013; all the long-term contracts, that is not a spot product. You sell flexibility and you sell energy security in those contracts in addition to gas. So, the long-term contract should have a different price than a spot product.</p>
          <p>When we are allowing more gas indexations into the contract, I mean the flexibility is taken back to the producers, and also &#x2013; yes, and also access to the traders' hubs and so on. So, that flexibility is actually very valuable to us. And I'll give you one example, and that was in 2009 when the gas markets in the UK more or less <mark type="ph" /> flat (47:30) from &#xA3;0.70 per therm to &#xA3;0.20 per therm in two or three months.</p>
          <p>We decided at that point in time that this was not a market that we would like to produce into. So we pulled back production and produced it the next year at twice the price, 100% return on that flexibility. So, just to make example of how much flexibility can be <mark type="ph" /> good (47:55).</p>
          <p>Then, on Bakken and the realized prices, quite healthy. On average, in the mid-$70s is what we realized for products there, so that is good.</p>
          <p>And then, a more strategic question on LNG assets, there is one project has been passed is firm and coming on-stream on LNG export, and there are several other projects that are evaluated what to do currently. I think when going forward, I mean it's hard to see any greenfield development of LNG export facilities especially in the U.S., <mark type="ph" /> so we say confirm it (48:47) typically on current re-gasification plants and so on.</p>
          <p>I guess the big discussion over there, to do such an investment, you actually have to be a strong believer as well. You need to believe in some $4 spreads between the U.S. markets and the other markets, and you need to believe in that for some 20 years or 30 years to justify that investment. But those tabulations are done, and we think about the local scene in our company, and then sort of that is also part of what we think about from time to time. But there are no firm plans in any direction in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:28).</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hilde. Good afternoon. Another three questions, actually. Just very quickly, coming back to 2013 production, can you just talk about perhaps just your assumptions on maintenance for next year relative to this year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, justly exploration expense is clearly very, very volatile, but again I was just wondering what sort of assumptions we should make going forward in terms of the percentage that you sort of think is appropriate to expense as a forecast?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, in terms of Tanzania, there had been some thoughts of a discussion, consolidations with other players in Tanzania for a development, I was just hoping for an update there in terms of what you thought maybe a solution for early development for gas in Tanzania? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. When it comes to maintenance, I mean we have to refer to that in February. But in other statements I made today, we take into account the expected maintenance.</p>
          <p>On exploration expense, we have earlier said that you should expect capitalization of 33% or one-third of our expenditure. And my best advice is to do that going forward as well. It will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, it is sort of the nature of exploration. But so far this year, it is actually 33%. So, I think that's an assumption that is fair to use going forward.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Tanzania and East Africa, I mean there's a lot of things going on there and it's quite a dynamic picture and a lot of activities. And there's a lot of players as well. So, it is &#x2013; no firm plants yet and so on, but it is natural that sort of companies that operates in the same areas have discussions on how to deal with issues. But there are no firm things in any directions, Theepan.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The message is that we are not going to be specific on today. I think in February, it's more prudent for us to lay that out in more detail. But it is sort of I've taken into account in the things that we have said today.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Good news is, there's just two questions; bad news is they're each in two parts. First one is in the international business and the costs. Those were higher than expected, or higher than I expected, costs in DD&amp;A, and to some extent, on exploration. You also mentioned increased royalties. Can you just sort of say where the sort of increase in DD&amp;A versus last year is coming from? Is it fairly geographically spread, or is it related to the backend or pass flow or any particular areas driving that? On the exploration, is that merely all the increase? Because it was NOK 1.3 billion this quarter compared to the NOK 1 billion for the first half, is that all on seismic, and the royalties, again, geographical split?</p>
          <p>The second question is simpler, on exploration, you mentioned the seismic on Block 38 and Block 39 in Angola, and just an update on sort of the quality of that seismic and the status and how you're working with that. And also, is there &#x2013; you're a partner on Block 22, which is directly between the two discoveries made so far with Repsol, the operator. Can you give us a feel as to what the progress is on that block as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Peter, thank you. Good and detailed questions. Svein, can you address the exploration, seismic &#x2013; and seismic questions. When it comes to the DD&amp;A and when you compare it together with the third quarter last year, this is related to the Bakken acquisition we made last year. That was not part of numbers last year, it is currently. That is the quite a chunk of it. Then, we have higher production, and higher production means higher DD&amp;A because it's a unit of production, depreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then, we have ramp ups of new fields, and those newer fields typically have much higher depreciation than older fields. And that is &#x2013; back to that, it is depreciated based on booked reserves. And then you start a field, you typically book some 40% of the reserves and then you keep booking as you produce. So in this early phase of a field, then the deprecation is typically much higher.</p>
          <p>And then, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:42), particularly on Peregrino and the Pazflor. And then, we have those elements. I think you have it all in the explanation of the increased DD&amp;A on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Svein, on seismic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the seismic activity, as Torgrim said, we are stepping up our seismic activity in the Kwanza basin quite significant, so &#x2013; which is an important explanation of the increased exploration cost this quarter. And what we are doing there is that we are collecting the seismic, and we are now going over them to process it. And what we will do with the seismic, we will be doing some processing of the seismic. We have developed tools for that internally, which we will then process in the seismic activity. And that will make us ready then for drilling wells in 2014.</p>
          <p>Specific issues related then to the block around 22, I think that is too early to comment on. And so, <mark type="ph" /> generally, (56:52) we are excited about the Kwanza basin and we will come back with more details on that later.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much, Hilde. Yes, a couple of questions please. The first one &#x2013; the first on, just on that value-to-volume strategy for the Marcellus, on the flipside of that, what gas price &#x2013; or what Henry Hub gas price do you need to see to bring back the sort of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent next year that you tend to switch off next year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just also on the Bakken kind of sequential growth there on the oil slowed to kind of sub-double-digit level in 3Q versus 2Q. Is there anything going on there? Is that just rigs or you need to increase the rigs to keep that part of the production growing? I'm just curious about that growth level.</p>
          <p>And then, actually, I was more curious on the European gas side. In terms of the sort of big increase in coal coming in to kind of UK, parts of Europe, and displacing natural gas, so are you seeing any of that start to impact your European gas business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. In Marcellus, I mean we are earning money in the current price environment, but we would like to earn more. So, this is based on our &#x2013; the way we look at the price outlook and so on. So, we think these volumes are better produced later. So, we will sort, of course, monitor the situation in the market closely, and also the way we look at it and so on. But you should expect us to apply that strategy in the current price environment.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Bakken and the growth, I mean it is growing well. We &#x2013; the rigs we are running are really efficient. And your question is two-part. There is a full value chain that needs to contemplate here taking care of the volumes and also that you have the right rig crew and all of that. So, I think we are comfortable with rig count that we currently are running. I'm sure we could have step it up further, but I think it's a balancing act and I think we're faring with the levels that we have currently.</p>
          <p>When it comes to European gas and coal, sort of one of my favorite themes and I think I can talk for a couple of hours on this one, but Europe actually needs gas. I mean, that place, especially Germany, I would say, and also UK. I mean it is quite a lot of it and Europe is in the middle of it when they &#x2013; between Norway, LNG, North Africa, Azerbaijan and so on, and it is here to say.</p>
          <p>And it's rather affordable. It doesn't needs subsidies. And the third and very important point, it is that it is very clean. It is the cleanest fuel and so on. And this is not the political speech, but it is to give you some background of the discussions.</p>
          <p>In Germany, they have not been able to distinguish between various fossil fuels. They are very &#x2013; they have clear views on nuclear and clear views on renewables. And we think that German politicians need a clear stance on the gas versus coal and so on. That will really &#x2013; that will really solve CO2 emission issues, and it will actually make Germany even more competitive going forward.</p>
          <p>Both in the UK and Germany, we sense more positive signals to gas and we very much appreciate that. And if you see that there are more realism coming into all the discussions and in all points towards the direction of natural gas, so we are welcoming that discussion. Okay. Thank you, Oswald.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, guys. I had a big picture strategic question here, we've recently seen comments from the press noting that Statoil needs to become more global, which is obviously consistent with the strategy you guys are undertaking. But there's also an increased willingness on your part to perform large strategic alliances. So, I was just hoping you could elaborate on this comment, and are you referring to additional agreements similar to what you've done with Rosneft or potentially something more significant? How do we think about that? And can you just reiterate what the primary objectives there may or may not be? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Guy, thank you. Our international projection currently is becoming quite significant and it is growing. And I think I'll dare to say that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:02:34) does well in key basins in the world, and then we are working actively on accessing the basins for the future, what really could be the next big thing.</p>
          <p>And Arctic is very important to us, and both East Africa and West Africa as we have discussed today. Brazil, key elements, we have had some really nice discoveries there, and the Gulf of Mexico as well, large acreage holder and so on.</p>
          <p>And then, working together with other companies internationally is a natural thing in this industry. I think the Rosneft deal is a good example of that. And then, we actually see quite a bit of increased interest in working together with us going forward as well, and we take that as a compliment. They're sort of a natural part of &#x2013; a part of this business and so on.</p>
          <p>On any bigger things, of course, I can never give any directions, as such. I think it's fair to say that if you look at our project portfolio, I mean it is there, it's high quality, it can deliver in 2020. Of course, what we have guided at, so we know what to do. We know what to do all the way towards 2020. But this is about execution. And then, we will add and subtract from portfolio management, but it actually allow us time to explore. We are not in a situation where we feel that we have to do something to fix anything. When we think it works well and we feel that the strategy is working and we can do what we are best at. So that's sort of the thinking and so on, so I think that is a good starting point for any strategic discussion.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions, if I can, please. Firstly, just on the sort of financial framework. You've obviously &#x2013; you see an increasing cash flow progression, as you mentioned in your presentation, but you're also seeing obviously an increasing CapEx burden for the group. And I just wanted to know as you think about it into 2013 and beyond, it seems like breakeven is north of $100 per barrel, and I was just wondering whether you have a view on whether there's an absolute level of sort of disposal that you plan to do. I guess the easy wins have &#x2013; well, not easy wins, but the more obvious divestments like Statoil Fuel &amp; Retail, et cetera, have been done. Could you maybe talk about your sort of disposal strategy in more depth? And also &#x2013; or is it simply that you're going to be increasing drilling levels over the next few years?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, just on sort of cost in particular on the NCS, could you maybe talk a little bit about how you're managing what is I guess a tight services market? I mean what the cost inflation is there, and I guess how you're dealing with any bottlenecks that you're seeing in the services market on the NCS? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Michael, thank you. On the financial framework, it is &#x2013; we have not said anything upfront on how much we want to divest and sort of acquire. And I think that is a deliberate choice and so on. So, I think we need to look into history to see what has happened. And we have to say that we have been pretty active over the last decade, actually, to sharpen our portfolio to divest assets and then reinvest it into things that are much more strategic. So, you should expect that to go forward. It is sort of one of the six elements in the honeycomb that we use when we communicate our strategy. So, it is close to our heart to use that actively and so on. So, you shouldn't be surprised going forward if there are subtractions or additions to the portfolio. So, that's there.</p>
          <p>And then, when it comes to &#x2013; you touch upon the CapEx going forward and what sort of dollar oil price we need to balance the portfolio. This is &#x2013; this tends to be a black-and-white discussion I noticed, so, to me, it's important to put some context around that. I mean we are running with a balance sheet &#x2013; a solid balance sheet, AA- rating, 13% net debt, NOK 15 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and that is for us to be able to follow through our strategy in a high-cyclical business.</p>
          <p>Then, we are growing the cash flow and so on, and we have a &#x2013; I must say, a great project portfolio that we would like to realize. And then, we have a firm dividend policy, and the dividend policy is very important for me, that is both predictable and trustworthy, and that you believe that this will come and that we are able to handle this in an uncertain world and so on. And we have the liquidity, we have the balance sheet, we have flexibility into the investment program, and we have also flexibility in other parts of the company. So, this is &#x2013; a lot of things goes into this. And of all the things in the world to worry about, this is not one of them you should be worried about, to be honest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And specifically on sort of cost inflation in the NCS, is there sort of anything you can talk to about sort of bottlenecks you're seeing in the services market there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are certain elements in the market where there are scarcity, we all know that. And there are other areas that have capacity. The way we &#x2013; I mean, there will be some cost inflation typically but there was &#x2013; it's all about how to position yourself and handle it. And I think the type of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:24) actually enable us to deal with that quite well, taking the longer-term positions within rig capacity, frame agreements, on the stuff that we procure, working closely with the suppliers, knowing that we have capacity with them and, also, working with standardizing the project portfolio and working more effective with that.</p>
          <p>I think the fast-track portfolio is a great example of that, where we have &#x2013; had that. These fields should be developed in a quite similar way, using this type of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:07) in place, these of risers, these type of walls and so on. And then, we have reduced the cost by some 30% on those fields and the time from discovery to production by 50%.</p>
          <p>So, that's the way we think about dealing with that. So, it is a tight market in certain areas, and yes, we will be somewhat impacted on it over time, but it is really important to take some longer-term perspective and longer-term positions to handle that. And as you see, we are all dealing with that in a good manner.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for the presentation. I had two quick questions. The first one is whether you could give us a guidance on the tax rate for next year. Are we still likely to be at the top the 70% to 72% range or in a different place?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just going back for moment to the question about cost inflation in the NCS, your position clearly allows you to get some good frame agreement and some discounts. But overall, what is the level of percentage cost inflation that you're seeing in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So, K&#xE5;re, if you can take the tax question. And when it comes to the specific rate, I'm not ready to give that. There is a global market within certain elements, so we are to a larger extent capitalizing on that and using that also to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:11:56). So, K&#xE5;re?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the adjusted tax rate year-to-date, we are at 72.3%, in line with our guidance of 70% to 72%, maybe a little bit above. And we will report, if there are any changes to it, when we address it in February. But we don't see any signs of any major changes, but of course we will reassess it when the year has passed and come back to that.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, good afternoon. I know you've got a lot of questions on Marcellus already, but a couple more from if you don't mind. One is, you've quantified the rate of change in the plan but I haven't heard, I don't think, the new plan as far as how much growth you expect from U.S. gas next year versus this year. And then, related to that, how much of a contribution might you receive from the liquidation of drilled but uncompleted well or wells that have been completed but are still stuck behind pipe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Robert. I mean what we have said, that it will impact our outlook with some 25,000 barrels per day. But that wasn't quite that good a growth projection. There will be some growth in Marcellus next year, but it is, I would say, limited. That is as far as I can go on that one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Marcellus and well that is ready, I mean there are some 230 wells that we have drilled that is waiting for gathering systems and needs to be completed and so on. So, it's quite an okay environment of inventory of wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. Thanks for that. And then, an unrelated one, if you don't mind. Your Barents Sea exploration program for next year, do you have an aggregate unrisked resource size estimate you might be willing to share on that program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. No, I'm not, but I can say that we find the Barents very interesting. It is a huge area, so there are a lot of different plays. And when we &#x2013; Skrugard and Havis discovered it. It opened up a totally new play in that area, and that is what we are pursuing now with quite a few of the nine well program. Then, we are going to test out something that is called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:15:04) area. That is further north and that is the northern-most wells that have been drilled in Norwegian waters.</p>
          <p>But that is all, of course, very virgin area, it has of course a lower probability for discoveries, but again potential is absolutely there. So while I would love &#x2013; like to give you all the details that I have, but I don't think it is prudent, Robert, but we are very encouraged by the development in the Barents area.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi there. A question on the oil price breakeven levels. So is it possible to give some color &#x2013; some indication of where your oil price breakeven level is for 2012 after dividends? Maybe also for 2012, with lower production due to higher CapEx, how much will that cash breakeven level increase in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Hi, John. Thank you. Svein, do you mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you're looking at &#x2013; if you look at cash flow from the three first quarters of 2012, what Torgrim showed today, he has showed a graph with the cash flow from operations, deducting CapEx, adding on what they have received in divestments and dividend. And then, showing a surplus of NOK 35 billion based on what we see there. We have paid one more installment of tax, as I said in first of October, and we will pay one more.</p>
          <p>So, so far in 2012, we have been a cash surplus of NOK 35 billion with the crisis that they have realized now. Going into 2013, I think that is too early to say. We will come back to that with an updated forecast for the CapEx and all things in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my question &#x2013; second question goes to the sales of some U.S. assets that were acquired with the Brigham acquisition, could you tell us how that is moving forward and maybe how big were those sales been, like in proportion of the Brigham acquisition, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have the details on that, Svein?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not have the details, but we are in a position to disclose that now, but it's some optimized portfolio, it's not a big one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. So in general, John, it's an active part of what we do within our conventional all the time. There are so many things that we divest in that. And although that interest is acquired, it's sort of natural part of optimizing the portfolio assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I read you correctly, it will be a small proportion of the Brigham acquisition that would actually dissolve?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. We've heard you adjust your guidance on the gas production in light of market conditions. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the Canadian side with the oil sands, whether you've seen any change in environment there to affect some of your thinking? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mathew. Thank you. On the Canadian side, we are exporting gas from Marcellus. It's the front area. In the frontal area, it has healthy demand. Historically, that area has been sourced by gas from the West. That now used within the oil sands business, opening up new markets from the South. We are actually &#x2013; we will actually export gas out of the U.S. This is an interesting concept, but it's actually working very well and we are earning moment in that respect. Was that answering your question, Mathew?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I was just referring more to the planned investments towards the back-end of the decade in the oil sands, given that the realizations to the Canadian oil sands are pretty weak at the moment. Whether you view that as a just a temporary bottleneck issue, or whether it's more structural and you may rethink your commitment there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're touching upon a very important general theme in the U.S., and that is actually bottleneck issues which is seen in all &#x2013; on many of the unconventional plays due to that special step-up in production. And there is something about market forces that works and they actually work pretty well in that part of the world. So over time, you'd see that bottleneck issues will be gradually be less and less as infrastructure is built and the industry develops. But yes, you are right there are bottleneck issues currently that we are actually handling well.</p>

          <p>Secondly, enhanced oil recovery and the 60% target, can you talk a little bit about the economics of these projects? Obviously, they work in a world of $110 oil, to what extent is the expected higher CapEx next year linked to that? And then, finally, your third quarter exploration expense included NOK 1.6 billion from previous periods. I'm told that relates to the <mark type="ph" /> Piceance (1:22:11) gas discovery. Can you talk a little bit about what that tells you concerning commercialization of discoveries such as in shallow reservoirs in other words? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Irene. When it comes to DD&amp;A in 2013, when it comes to the assets that we have divested; Gj&#xF8;a and Vega and Brage, I mean that will lead to reduced DD&amp;A related to those fields. So, yes, it will have an impact in that respect. And on the gas side, it will also have some effect on the DD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>When it comes to IOR, 60% economics. IOR projects are normally very profitable. I think the average internal rate of return we have seen across that portfolio lately is a 45% internal rate of return, so these projects compete very well.</p>
          <p>Now, we have crossed the 50% limit and working hard going forward. This is very much about technology development within reservoir diagnostics, about drilling technologies and so on and how we can actually get the reservoirs to grow even better.</p>
          <p>We have recently opened a new IOR center in Trondheim, where we are going to use quite a bit of effort to address all of these opportunities and so on. And I visited <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:24:17) a few weeks back and I mean I'm really fascinated on what you actually can do currently, both on reservior <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:24:26) and also on the drilling technology. So I'm really looking forward to that. I'm sure this is going to be highly valuable going forward as well.</p>
          <p>When it comes to whether this impacts cost base, I mean next year we will spend some NOK 2.8 billion on R&amp;D, which is quite a significant step-up and is much linked to IOR efforts and so on. And then, over time, it will feed into investments into profitable projects and so on. And this quarter, we have sanctioned some four IOR projects. So, I mean we are moving ahead on this one and I'm really looking forward to that development. And then, Irene, you had a question on expense of exploration from previous period on <mark type="ph" /> Piceance (1:25:26), K&#xE5;re?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I want to answer more in general terms, and that is for accounting purposes, there is also a time horizon you have to evaluate when you are looking at your capitalized expenditure. And if you &#x2013; and you need to have a firm plan in the near future to have it on your books. And of course, as you work with your portfolio, that could change, but the underlying business case doesn't change due to the timing of it. So, you can say this is also a result of some prioritization you take into account when you make plans, and then we have to convert that into the accounting language, so to say, and sometimes we get that result. But basically, no changes in the commerciality of those averages.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a question on the 2013 production guidance. You have already highlighted a couple of items that will lead to lower production in 2013, but have you seen an underlying decline on your current portfolio?</p>
          <p>And also, secondly, when it comes to Sverdrup, are you planning to come with the new resource estimate before year-end 2012, or will you wait until Lundin has built the two appraisal wells on 501 before you discuss a new resource estimate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Teodor, thank you. When it comes to the underlying decline, I mean this is developing healthy and as we have expected so there are no indications that the decline rate is increasing. It is still 5%, as we &#x2013; as it has been over the last years and then that is developing just as it should.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Johan Sverdrup and the new resource estimate, we have said next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the questions, I admire your stamina. Just three quick ones, actually. The first is on the balance sheet, now I recognize that since Macondo you've been generating lots of free cash flow both because of the oil price and the disposals, but is the shape of the balance sheet with a such a large amount of cash sacked on it something that you see is being appropriate going forward, or are you're just waiting for the right time to start paying down some of your debt facilities? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second, just on Bakken, can I confirm where you are in terms of realizing the better oil price realizations? Is the railcar work that you've been doing now in place? So, is it sort of in the third quarter numbers, or do you have more upside, potentially both volume and price?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just on the last note you have in the release, can you just confirm that the deferred tax changes that you referenced, that's purely non-cash, there won't be any go-forward effects in terms of actual taxes and cash taxes? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. On the deferred taxes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:29:59) those ones first, I mean, yes, I mean it's a &#x2013; absolutely, the right observation, that the balance sheet is quite cash-rich and that is by purpose. And having liquidity at hand is something that is important to us, and so on. And I think the way you should read that is related to the uncertainty in the macro environment and so on.</p>
          <p>So, to me, it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:30:32) as a company, it is extremely important to be prepared for almost any outcome and any developments in the macro environment. And what this industry and oher industry learned after 2008 was the importance of cash, and that is managed diligently and actively but quite conservatively. So, we will continue to run with both a solid balance sheet and significant liquidity. When it comes to the liquidity, it's fluctuating. And the day after &#x2013; this quarter, we paid NOK 20 billion in taxes, so it goes up and down as you will understand.</p>
          <p>When it comes to rail in Bakken, we have rail in place. It will grow over the next year, and we have &#x2013; when it comes to the summer, I think it is, then we will have some 1,040 railcars available, and that is sufficient to cover our needs. And you should look at these railcars as an onshore LNG ship. You can actually get your oils to exactly where you get the best price of it. So, this can go north and south and east and west. So, a part of that is &#x2013; the growth, a limited part is part of the third quarter results, a very limited part.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, K&#xE5;re, deferred taxes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, deferred taxes, you refer to the subsequent event where in the national budget, there's a white paper suggesting just an all income- and cost-related to foreign petroleum activity. And we have a deferred tax there, and that's the non-cash effect. But we had assumed to get that reduced from our future cash payments that's why it's deferred. So, there's no immediate cash effect, but we had assumed to get that deducted from the tax return in the years to come.</p>
          <p>When it comes to future effects, with the present set-up for our activity, then it will have an influence on the international tax rate.</p>

          <p>Hi, Torgrim, just two quick questions, if I may. Firstly, just on Skrugard and Barents Sea gas. You've recently stooped work on a possible second train at Skrugard or alternative to the pipeline. My question is when do you think you'll have firmed up enough gas resources in the broader area to be able to get back to the drawing table and look at options again?</p>
          <p>My second question is on the rig contracting strategy, just getting back to an earlier questions on cost inflation. Statoil has been very active in the rig market lately. I think you've recently contracted three new semi-subs at quite high rates. Just wondering if you could give us an update on sort of how many more rigs you need to contract in the next sort of the six to 12 months to be able to execute your drilling plans in the medium term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Kim. Thank you. We have second train at Skrugard. So together we are partners there, we decided to not to take a decision on the second train on Skrugard and just to await the situation. It is partly linked to that there are more optionalities in the area. And also, related to a strong competition for investment funds within Statoil currently and our other projects that compete better than this project. So <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:34:56) and it's an opportunity, and going one time in the future, it will be revisited. I'm sure about that, but I can't give you more specific guidance on that.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the rig market, I mean we are active and it is by purpose. And we take a long term view on our need, and we know that our portfolio will need rig capacities for the long time going forward. I cannot however get into some specific comments on contracting strategy going forward. That is something that we would like to keep to ourselves. So, thank you, Kim.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for that, Hilde, and I agree with the stamina comment. Just I'll limit myself to one question, I'll cut the questions off. Just can you remind us in terms of East Africa, just your current rig capacity? And I guess, the question more specifically, just timing around the drilling commitments in Mozambique and just whether this Total-PETRONAS well is going to influence the positioning of the first well that you'll drill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, when it comes to &#x2013; we have a global rig fleet presence and sort of we tend to move rigs around where they actually can be to the best use for us. We have the capacity available for the appraisal programs that we want to put in place. And so, that's sort of fine going forward on &#x2013; you also bought Mozambique, I mean do you have that, Svein, the rigs?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
