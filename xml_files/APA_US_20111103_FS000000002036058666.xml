        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Apache Corporation's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, before the market opened, we reported third quarter 2011 net income of $983 million or $2.50 per diluted share. As disclosed in the release, Apache's adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $1.2 billion or $2.95 per diluted share. Cash flows from operation totaled $2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>On today's call, we will have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions: Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; Roger Plank, President and Chief Corporate Officer; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>We have prepared our usual detailed supplemental data package for your use, which includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we use such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred. The data package can be found on our Web site at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our Web site.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, again. We had a great quarter. As I mentioned in the silent part of this, it was &#x2013; it set a new record. We've had record production of 752,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day which is &#x2013; 50% of it was liquids. The bulk of that was oil. We had record cash flow, as Patrick pointed out, of $2.7 billion, which on an annualized basis, gets us close to $11 billion for the year. We reduced our debt by $650 million and we funded a very ambitious investment program.</p>
          <p>Roger is going to point out a little later, we had an excellent drilling result across a wide portfolio of exploration and development plays around the world during the quarter. And on the project side, we had achievements of positive final investment decision on our stray and Wheatstone LNG development, a major long-term project which shows visible value over a long period of time, 20 years, with no decline and it's based on an oil link revenue.</p>
          <p>Importantly, Wheatstone is really a growth platform which will provide us multiple additional phases of development that we can bring additional gas in from other discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin. At the opposite end of the Pacific, we obtained a 20-year export license for our proposed Kitimat LNG project from the West Coast of Canada, which is the other long-term oil linked project in our portfolio. And that moves this closer to our final investment decision there which should hopefully happen in the first half of next year.</p>
          <p>And on the strategic side, we announced the addition of Exxon Mobil North Sea business. We added that to our North Sea portfolio which is a major legacy asset which has tremendous potential for value upside due to the same things that we did in our Forties field and exploitation capabilities and really geophysical technology.</p>
          <p>All of that actually happened in a single quarter. Obviously for us it's very exciting but what's ahead of us is also very exciting. As the market fluctuates, the cash flows strength of our portfolio and the robustness of our balances are key strengths of our company. We are in a position to build two major oil link products, Wheatstone and Kitimat, because of the strength of our existing assets and what Apaches do every day to focus on coming up with efficiencies and economic opportunities in which to grow our production.</p>
          <p>Every work over and recompletion in the Anadarko Basin and every discovery in Egypt or the Gulf of Mexico shelf which is quickly tied in turns in the cash flow to help fund these long-term projects. And as we have launched one of these LNG projects, we're getting ready to embark upon the second one and it's important to underline that we continue to emphasize our core business, which is wringing value out of daily operations, which really enables our shareholders to be able to invest in these long-term projects that in the future will provide steady, visible cash stream for decades to come.</p>
          <p>As I'm sure many of you are aware, we're also stepping up our exploration activity and we have always been an exploration company. If you look at some of the things we have done in Australia, Egypt, and in international shales, all of those were key positions that we built through exploration. What we're now able to do with our enlarged financial and talent resource is to spread out a bit more and take more exploration risk. You can see some of the elements of that strategy are already taking shape.</p>
          <p>We're building a serious exploration business in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We have 110 exploration blocks. We are now the largest acreage holder in the Cook Inlet of Alaska. We're running a big 3D seismic shoot there as we speak. Hopefully we'll be drilling a well there next year.</p>
          <p>We're in the Deepwater Kenya, and we'll drill an oil prospect there next year also. We're an early mover in the unconventional oil play in New Zealand, which ultimately could provide access to about 1.7 million gross acres. All of these opportunities have the potential to be very material to our shareholders from a contribution standpoint.</p>
          <p>If you look at our history, there is nothing new to any of this. Apache has added a new core area to its portfolio every couple of years over time and built a real business with real value in each one of them. We intend to continue to do that; and as well, we continue to squeeze value out of our existing assets through recompletions, work overs and efficiencies.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod Eichler, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to provide operating highlights. And I'd urge him to turn on his mic.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. In the Permian, our production increased 3% sequentially driven by strong drilling results and prior period adjustments. We operated 24 rigs during the third quarter with 132 new wells spud and with initial completion operations started on 171 wells. This increased level of completion activity has reduced our backlog of wells waiting on completion at the end of the third quarter to 71, which we will continue to work down over the next two quarters.</p>
          <p>The key focus areas of activity during the quarter continue to be the horizontal redevelopment of legacy waterfront units and the multi-zone development of Mariner's Deadwood area. We also continue to progress other plays and projects across the basin where we have about 3 million acres. One notable example is the horizontal Cline play at Deadwood where we have a positive update. After a somewhat disappointing first test in the previous quarter, our second Cline horizontal well came in filling 325 barrels of oil per day and 320 Mcf of gas per day after a 10-stage stick-water frac and has produced 8,800 barrels of oil equivalent in its first 30 days. We anticipate putting two additional Cline horizontal wells in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Central region, production increased 4% sequentially driven by higher-margin liquid drilling. We operated nine rigs during the quarter and drilled 18 wells, including seven at Granite Wash, three Cherokee, two Hogshooter, two exploratory wells in the Bivens Ranch. For the year, the region is primed to complete 34 Granite Wash, 14 Cherokee, 11 Hogshooter, 8 Cleveland and 1 Marmiton well. The region's transformation from vertical to horizontal drilling has evolved over the last two years and now the region is targeting liquids-focused objectives. Since the beginning of 2010, central gas production has increased 11% and oil production has grown over 200%.</p>
          <p>Acquisition of a 240 square mile 3D survey is underway now across our Bivens Ranch new ventures play where we had a 75% interest in 126,000 gross acres and we are already seeing positive well results. Our first well tested over 700 barrels of oil per day from 230 feet of objective Canyon Wash pay. Two additional wells are presently drilling, and we expect to be running two drilling rigs through the end of the year. In 2012 we expect to drill a minimum of six wells on the Bivens Ranch acreage.</p>
          <p>Gulf of Mexico shelf production was down 4% sequentially including down time impact from tropical storms Dawn and Lee. All of the fields affected by the storms were put back into service by the end of the quarter. Unrelated third-party downtime and natural field decline accounted for the remaining drop in production from the prior quarter. We operated five rigs on the shelf during the quarter and reached TD on seven wells with 100% success. We are on track to deliver our target of 41 wells in the shelf this year, and we are preparing to ramp up our activity further in this very profitable region in 2012 as the permitting process becomes more predictable. We grew our block footprint in this region by over 40% last year to over 600 blocks and we have a deep inventory of exploitation and low-risk exploration opportunities ahead of us.</p>
          <p>In the Deepwater Gulf region, production declined 11% sequentially due to some weather down time and this timing of new projects coming online. We expect a further small decline in fourth quarter before three additional new projects, Mandy, Bushwood and Wyberg, come on stream next year. Two of these projects were originally scheduled for fourth quarter first production but have been pushed back due to third-party operator delays. Our large development projects in Deepwater continue to move forward. Lucius is on track for a final investment decision before year end and drilling an appraisal well at Heidelberg is currently underway.</p>
          <p>We've recently contracted a semi-submersible drilling rig and are preparing for a deepwater exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico next year. Gulf Coast onshore region production was up 2.5% sequentially on strong drilling results at new properties on production. We operated three drilling rigs during the quarter and participated in 17 wells.</p>
          <p>In Canada, production declined 3% sequentially driven by property divestments. We operated eight rigs during the quarter and participated in 48 wells. Activity focused on oil and liquids-driven plays with 28 wells in Provost, 5 wells at Blue Sky, 3 wells in Housemont Mariette, 3 wells in the Grelcadyte and 1 well in the Monte. In addition, we've progressed our development plans for the Chinook play, which will start in the fourth quarter and we moved forward one more liquids rich play within our enlarged acreage, the Gooseberry Sparky play, which alone could represent as many as 37 wells for us next year.</p>
          <p>Natural gas production continued to be robust. Third quarter Horn River production increased by 18% as compared to second quarter and averaged 98 million cubic feet of gas per day net to Apache's working interest, with peak working interest production approximately 122 million cubic feet of gas per day. Third quarter production levels don't reflect the benefit of our activity in liquid driven plays yet and a significant volume of the wells we have drilled in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:10) in Canada year-to-date are still not on production.</p>
          <p>The Kitimat LNG project, which Apache operates with a 40% interest, has made yet another important step forward with the award by the National Energy Board of Canada of a 20-year export license for a two train development of 10 million tons of LNG per annum. This approved throughput doubled the size of our initial project scope of one train. We continue to work toward our targeted final investment decision in 2012.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, net production increased 4% sequentially driven largely by drilling results. Gross production also grew, up 3%. We operated 25 rigs during the quarter and drilled 57 wells with a 93% success rate, including seven successful exploration wells in the Faghur, Natura and Abu Gharadig basins. We continue to have excellent drilling results in Egypt. We've recently achieved a record level of oil rig completions since we began operations in the western desert in 1996. This completion was an exploration well, the Tayim South 1X discovery, which tested 8,200 barrels of oil per day. This well found pay in the cretaceous AEB, Jurassic Safa and Paleozoic formations.</p>
          <p>In the Abu Gharadig basin a development well on the former of BP assets tested at 7,600 barrels of oil per day and 1.5 million cubic feet of gas per day from the Lower Baharia formation. As an update on the BP assets in Egypt, we have drilled 16 wells with 100% success on the acreage acquired from BP last year. Since becoming an operator last November, we have increased oil production by 34% to 28,000 barrels of oil per day and gas production by 64% to 70 million cubic feet of gas per day. This incremental production has enabled us to fill the export pipeline we acquired from BP to its current D-rated capacity of 70 million cubic feet of gas per day.</p>
          <p>We have also completed the pigging and studding of this pipeline and we expect to re-rate it to 135 million cubic feet of gas per day in 2012 to repair work requiring about six months of down time. This project will add a gross 65 million cubic feet of gas per day to our current export capacity and position us to significantly expand this capacity through looping further down the line.</p>
          <p>Interesting opportunities in Egypt continue to grow with 4 million acres now being offered at a new licensing around in the western desert, the first in almost five years. The contractual framework for these 15 blocks on offer is the same one under which oil and gas operations have been conducted in Egypt consistently over the years. This is clearly a positive development for the sector and consistent with Egypt's strong need for large continued investment by oil and gas companies to meet its energy needs. We are currently evaluating the blocks included in this licensing round.</p>
          <p>Turning to Australia, production was up slightly from second quarter. Van Gogh production resumed in August and averaged a net 9,700 barrels of oil per day during the third quarter, up 1,000 barrels of oil per day sequentially. It is currently producing at 29,400 barrels of oil per day or 15,500 barrels of oil per day net to Apache. Swivel and compressor performance remain a risk to medium-term production levels and we are finalizing a solution involving a shipyard remediation program now expected to take place in 2013.</p>
          <p>We operated one rig during the quarter in Australia and reached TD on three offshore wells, two of which have been completed as successful offshore oil producers. During the quarter, we achieved a positive final investment decision for the landmark Wheatstone LNG project in which Apache will participate with a 13% interest and which is now moving forward.</p>
          <p>Wheatstone will monetize an estimated 2.1 Tcf and 42 million barrels of <mark type="inaudible" /> (17:24) from our operated Julimar and Grunella fields. Expected investment net to Apache for the combined upstream and LNG projects is approximately $4 billion dollars in aggregate for 2016. Average net sales to Apache will be 140 million cubic feet of gas per day of LNG with prices pegged to crude oil indices, 22 million cubic feet of gas per day of sales gas into the attractively priced West Australia domestic market, and 3,300 barrels of condensate per day.</p>
          <p>Importantly, Wheatstone is a platform for our future growth via exploration in Australia. The project has already been environmentally approved for nearly three times the size of this two train, 9 million ton grant of free space of development.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we achieved final investment approval for yet another oil project in Australia, Balnaves. The gross peak initial production is expected in 2014 at 30,000 barrels of oil per day through an FPSO. Apache's interest in the project is 65%.</p>
          <p>Finally, we continue to progress our existing pipeline and development projects. Reindeer at Devil Creek, our second domestic gas processing hub, was 98% complete at the end of the third quarter and will be onstream before the end of the year. Apache's interest in this project is 55%.</p>
          <p>The North Sea region production increased 1% sequentially on exceptional drilling results despite some unplanned infrastructure constraints. We continued to operate three rigs, two platform strings and one heavy duty jack up during the quarter, and have drilled 15 Forties wells so far during 2011 with an 87% success rate. We plan to drill three more wells before year end. The new Bravo to Charlie pipeline was successfully installed, allowing an extra 4,000 barrels a day to be exported beginning in August.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Exxon's Mobil North Sea business which will significantly expand our opportunity set in the region with the addition of the Barrow complex as a second operated area for us. We also gain important midstream assets and an experienced and talented organization that represents a terrific addition to our North Sea team. As Steve mentioned, and really the track record at Forties has demonstrated, Apache's expertise and exploitation and geophysics represents a unique fit for a maturing basin like the North Sea and we are very happy to have finally secured the right assets for our expansion there. We continue to work toward a year-end closing for this transaction.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, production increased 3% sequentially driven by growth in premium price gas production. We operated eight drilling rigs during the quarter and drilled 11 wells. One highlight of activity was our resource delineation in our 1.7 million acres within the shale fairway in the Newcomb Basin.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we got our first horizontal shale well in production and reached target depth on three vertical wells that we'll also test for shales. Our first test, the ACLX20001H, was completed with nine fracs on a 2100 foot horizontal Los Mojas shale section. Initial production is 4.5 million cubic feet of gas per day and we're selling the gas at $5.22 per Mcf under a gas plus contract.</p>
          <p>We are currently designing the fracture stimulation program for the other vertical wells that reached target depth during the quarter. Log and core data obtained in those wells are encouraging and our work continues as we appraise a very large resource in a market where it is very seriously needed.</p>
          <p>Tom?</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. As Steve indicated in his opening remarks, record production set the tone for our strong financial performance in the quarter with record cash flow and very good earnings underpinned by solid margins, the results of a balanced portfolio and a focus on holding the line on cost. For the third quarter, Apache reported earnings of $983 million or $2.50 per share, up 18% on a per share basis from the year ago quarter but down slightly from the sequential quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for the FX impact of deferred taxes and the previously announced charge for the tax increase in the U.K., we earned $1.2 billion, or $2.95 per share, up 34% from the prior-year period.</p>
          <p>Cash from operations before working capital items of $60.7 billion, our best quarter ever, was up 35% versus the year ago quarter and up 2% over the second quarter despite lower realized prices.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio continues to deliver excellent results with oil currently garnering around 24 times the price of North American gas in our international gas portfolio exposed to rising gas prices, particularly in Australia and Argentina. Our oil and liquids volumes currently make up 50% of our total production but account for more than three-quarters of our $4.3 billion in revenue. It's important to note that almost 92% of our liquids are crude oil, which sells for almost double the price of NGLs.</p>
          <p>Further bolstering our revenue generation ability is the fact that nearly 75% of all our oil production receives Brent index &#x2013; or Brent comparable index pricing. This balance allowed us to post solid margins despite market pressure which decreased average price realizations by $2 a BOE, or 3%. Cash margins of $46.23 per BOE were down less than 2% compared to the prior quarter's $46.96 while pre-tax margins, which include DD&amp;A, were $30.26 per BOE versus $31.29 in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on margins and holding the line on costs. As evidence, total cash costs of $16.29 a BOE decreased $0.40 from the prior quarter as we continued to integrate the prior-year acquisitions. As we mentioned last quarter, cash costs should remain in the range of around $16.50 per BOE given current strip prices for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>A detailed calculation of our margins, adjusted earnings and cash from operations can be found in the financial supplement located on our Web site.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, one of our core strategies is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. Our ability to generate excess cash flow and prudently manage our spending has served us well in this regard. We have to date been able to increase our planned capital expenditures to $8 billion without compromising our balance sheet. Based on current prices, we forecast that not only will we have been able to increase our capital expenditures, but we will be able to pay for the recently announced North Sea acquisition and still meet our debt reduction objectives, all from available excess cash.</p>
          <p>This quarter we paid down $650 million of debt, bringing the balance at the end of the quarter to $7.2 billion, which drove our debt-to-capitalization ratio down to 20.5% from 23% at the end of last quarter and 25% at year end. We believe this serves as a critical foundation as we head into 2012 and ramp up our significant long-term growth projects as you heard from Steve and Rod.</p>
          <p>A key point I need to highlight for the third quarter is our effective tax rate of 52%. The largest impact to the rate was a non-recurring charge of $274 million for our deferred tax balances as a result of the U.K. tax increase. This we told you about on our last call and it was enacted this quarter, requiring this retroactive adjustment. We recorded a total charge of $305 million in the third quarter, but $274 million is truly out-of-period. Specifically, $218 million of the $274 million resulted from the re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities prior to 2011 and $56 million is related to operating results for the first and second quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>This adjustment was partially offset by a $99 million benefit related to the impact of foreign currency gains on our deferred taxes. Absent any impact of foreign exchange movements, which we really can't predict, we would expect our go-forward effective tax rate to be in the range of 42% to 44% and our deferred tax percentage to average 40% to 45% for the year.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, we are building a great deal of momentum heading into the fourth quarter and into 2012. From a financial perspective, rising production, exceptional cash flow, a continued focus on delivering margins and returns and a strong balance sheet give us a solid foundation from which to build future growth and shareholder wealth.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Tom. At a time of seemingly unprecedented volatility, we take solace in earning high returns, having a strong balance sheet and generating substantial excess cash flow. I'm going to update you today briefly on some new business at Apache that improves our lot and supports our ongoing objective of consistent, profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Our North Sea acquisition from Exxon Mobile is on track and slated to close at year end. All pref-right periods have run their course with no exercises, so we should benefit from the full complement of incremental daily production of around 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent for all of next year.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that two-thirds of this production is Brent-priced crude, currently selling at about $110 per barrel, and the remainder is North Sea gas, which goes for around $9.50 per thousand cubic feet. So this is very high margin production that will contribute meaningfully to our North Sea profits and cash flow throughout next year and beyond.</p>
          <p>In Australia during the quarter, we signed two new agreements to sell gas at prices substantially above our current realizations. While confidentiality precludes us from disclosing individual specifics, cumulatively this new business will add approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas per day at variable prices linked to oil and to inflation. These agreements have built-in floor prices that are more than 2.5 times our current average realizations of just under $3 dollars per Mcf. The majority of this production is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2012 and ramp up into 2014.</p>
          <p>Clearly, strong demand from mining projects is raising the bar for gas pricing in Western Australia. And while specific timing of these lumpy demand increases is tied to completion of major projects that is difficult to predict, we now have agreements in place covering approximately 150 million cubic feet of gas per day at prices that are at a multiple of current realizations. These volumes represent some three-quarters of our current production that will come on line between January of 2012 and year-end 2015. That makes for a nice bridge to 2016, which, as you've heard, is the time at which our Julimar Wheatstone gas is slated to add another 160 million cubic feet per day of production.</p>
          <p>After years in the making, the improvement in Australian gas market fundamentals is upon us with first sales of significantly higher price gas finally hitting our coffers beginning this January and volumes rising progressively throughout the coming decade. Consequently, Apache's Australian gas margins and profitability are on track to grow rapidly from here on out. As Steve indicated at the outset, 2011 is shaping up to be a record year for Apache across the board, but it is also a year that has laid a solid foundation for a strong start in 2012.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon here, guys. I wanted to follow up on one of the comments you made. Roger, you just talked about higher prices starting in January of 2012. I guess that's your Reindeer project. Can you give us an indication of what type of gas prices you expect to see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Floor price is 2.5 times in excess of $3, about $7.50, so north of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that you'll see that on the Reindeer volumes; and can you mind just kind of roughly what those volumes are to Apache?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's going to be a commissioning period and it's very difficult to predict exactly what the timing is but we'll probably start with about 10 million cubic feet a day in January and ultimately, gross; that will rise to 100 million cubic feet of gas per day. How much of that takes place next year is uncertain, but probably the lion's share of it. And we have 55% of that quantity, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you guys kind of comment on the pace of permitting in the Gulf of Mexico? Trying to get a sense of where your activity levels might be able to go next year. I know this year, obviously, they were certainly hampered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the shelf, the shallow water area, things have moved along <mark type="audio gap" /> (31:15) this year to be able to accommodate our 41-well program and we're expecting similar performance next year going throughout the program.</p>
          <p>The deepwater, things of course certainly are slower there since Macondo. Just to give you an idea, in the deepwater areas we used to take about 45 days to 60 days to get a drilling permit approved in deepwater. Now using &#x2013; since Macondo, using the BOEM actual data it takes between 225 and 250 days to get a permit approved <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:51). It's seen some slight improvements in and out of the year, but they did some more &#x2013; additional reorganization at the regulatory level and it remains to be seen if that trend will be significantly improving in 2012. And we have been getting permits on our projects, but it's still remains to be slow for the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A question on Argentina; you guys talked about your first shale well. It sounded like good results. I'm just trying to get a sense of what that well cost you guys to drill there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd have to look that up and have Patrick get back with you on the exact cost. These early wells are tested concept wells and we drill pilot holes, we dig a lot of cores, we do a lot of petrophysical work, almost research type work to really understand the nature of the resource we're dealing with because there are very few control points that have been targeted specifically for these shales. And that's the purpose for a lot of the placement of the wells and the type of work programs we have, but I'll have Patrick give you the number after the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You guys talked about the Cook Inlet area; you picked up a lot of acreage recently. Can you talk about kind of what some of your targets are next year? Is it going to be both oil and gas? And just kind of give us a sense of the opportunity there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're basically &#x2013; frankly, we &#x2013; hopefully by the midyear &#x2013; we're shooting our 3D as we speak, actually. Hopefully, we'll get the first pass of some field cubes in the first quarter of next year, but that whole play is all about oil. I mean, we're looking at all of the oil plays there. And if you look at a claiming curve of the amount of activity that was in the Cook Inlet before, where Prudhoe Bay was found and afterward, it just goes flat. So truthfully, we're very excited about the potential of finding reserves with 3D seismic because there's been very little 3D seismic shot up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess I had seen a press story somewhere that talked about you guys looking at spending about $1.5 billion next year in Egypt. Is that &#x2013; any truth to that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I happen to be the Chairman of the U.S. Egyptian Business Council and I was in D.C. at a council meeting. I think what I said is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, which is about &#x2013; we're going to spend $1 billion this year and next year, it'll probably be the same. We've got 25 rigs running there and we continue to be very active in terms of drilling wells and increasing production. Nothing's changed there really for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A quick question on the Gulf Coast Onshore; can you talk about what sort of plays you're targeting? And any news from some of the Southern Louisiana deep prospects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our programs, they range across the coast from South Texas development programs like at Chapman Ranch with gas plays around to the South Louisiana Miocene plays. We currently have one well in progress there that's outside operated at Shalimar and we have recently acquired properties in the quarter from Phoenix, which we're beginning the planning for both exploitation and exploration drilling on those at the current time. So we're kind of in the early stages of our exploration work there at South Louisiana.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but you have been &#x2013; and I might just elaborate a little, we'll be looking for some of that deep gas in South Louisiana. We have a huge mineral acreage position there and we've got 3D seismic over it so there's a number of plays that are coming through there. I think that well that Rod mentioned is about a 28,000-foot well that we are a non-operator in. But that's going to be a future for us there also.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we &#x2013; they've been in discussions, we understand, for quite some time on that property so we did not look at that specific piece of land. As far as them being in that general area, it's &#x2013; we understand they've been looking in that area for quite some time and it's &#x2013; they will probably come on at the end of this decade and we'll be moving on in the middle, so we're fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're talking about, of course, is the &#x2013; specifically, is the wharf area, the landing area in the harbor with Shell's acquisition in the former Methanex properties. We have similar land that we own by buying a similar industrial site adjacent to this. It provides us the same type of access. Of course the actual LNG site itself is about 15 kilometers to the West in Fish Cove, where our facility will be located at.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. In the Permian, when you think about the horizontal opportunities and shifting to more of a horizontal strategy, do you see the Permian competing better for more capital relative to other opportunities within the company? Or do you just see redirecting more of the Permian's budget towards horizontal drilling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say a little of both. The Permian is a premier oil play in the lower 48 that competes very effectively inside the company for its share of capital. And likewise, this year we'll probably drill about 700 wells total in the Permian of which about 40 are horizontals. Next year I expect a similar number or perhaps more total wells and probably over 100 horizontal wells. So our program is definitely focused on increasing the number of horizontal drilling opportunities as the basin yields a large number of opportunities that are unconventional reservoirs that are suitable for horizontal exploitation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So essentially you're viewing it as more incremental as opposed to reducing vertical; just adding to the budget and then doing more on the horizontal &#x2013; then adding to the horizontal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're adding to the horizontal, but like in the Deadwood area we've drilled so many wells, we've probably drilled about 200 wells there this year, that we have really driven the cost down. So we get more wells per dollar invested in our drilling program by a wide margin. In fact, we've cut the drilling time almost in half in the last 30 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then shifting to Australia on Van Gogh, what do you think the existing unit can produce per day until 2013 when you begin the remediation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now it's &#x2013; it performed ably the last 60 days, typically about 30,000 to 32,000 barrels a day gross production which would be probably reflective of ongoing field performance on a natural field reservoir decline basis. So barring some mechanical upsets dealing with compression or the swivel again, I'd expect to see a normal decline through that time period before we had to go to dry docks to do significant repairs to the vessel. At that time, we'll be able to bring the vessel back into the field to not only produce Van Gogh but also tie into our Codison Field development, which is adjacent to the Van Gogh field.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up question on what Brian just asked about Van Gogh. I just want to make sure that I understood correctly because I think in the past you talked about doing the remediation program next year. And I just wanted to make sure I understood why it got pushed to 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we did a lot of work on the vessel this fall. We had a lot of down time in 2011 in the second quarter associated &#x2013; in the first quarter associated with these repairs. We've made good progress on those temporary &#x2013; we think of them as kind of temporary repairs; we've been very good with our production levels exceeding our expectations. But the boat has been performing ably for the last 60 to 90 days. I think that's kind of changed our approach or our look toward the project going forward with it changing from 2012 to 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now that's a good way to describe it, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then back on the Permian. I apologize if I missed this. How many rigs are currently running in the Permian? Is it still the 24?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I know that in the past at least the constraint on trying to add more rigs in that area, a lot of it was on the people side. Is that still sort of the major constraint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of both the equipment as well as good qualified personnel, or experienced personnel. It remains an industry problem across the entire Basin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a little bit of it is capital because I can't say enough &#x2013; if you recall where we were a year ago when we were talking about what 2011 was going to look like, we projected to pay down debt. We paid $650 million down this quarter. I think we paid $400 million down the quarter before that. Because when we bought BP, we put ourselves a goal out there to be at about $7.5 billion or thereabouts at the end of this year. And I think what you're seeing is, is we've been slow to ramp up that activity just because we've got other needs for cash right now. So I think for 2012 what you'll see is, is us start to increase the activity level there, and then it will be subject to people and rigs. But right now it's a capital constraint because we're going to pay down debt first before the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Steve, a question on Egypt. Just from your expertise, I'd love to see what you see as sort of the road path for formation of an elected Egyptian government. I think we're supposed to have elections in December and then how do you see that happening? And ultimately, what do you think it's going to take to give investors more confidence in the Egypt story as it's been an overhang on Apache this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what it's &#x2013; you're going to &#x2013; not what I think you're going to see, I think they've announced here recently what the schedule is for the parliamentary and the Shura Council, which is the grand congressional oversight, basically, like the Senate in the U.S., the Shura Council; and those are going to take place over a three-month period starting, I think, November 28 and they're going to stagger those across the country. So you won't see final Shura Council elections, I think, until about the middle of March.</p>
          <p>There is some question as to whether or not the presidential election will follow immediately or will it be a little time afterward. So you're going &#x2013; it's going to be an evolution going forward. And I think &#x2013; honestly, I think that is a very practical way to go about doing it because they are evolving into a true democracy and I think you see it in everything that you do and I don't think &#x2013; like anything, it's always up and to the right because there are times when things kind of get jagged. But in the scheme of things they've done a very good job and I don't why that doesn't continue.</p>

          <p>And then switching to the Gulf of Mexico, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, do you think rig capacity could become an issue if Gulf of Mexico permits really start picking up? Do you think this could be an issue in '12? And how does it impact your plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I &#x2013; I'll let &#x2013; Rob mentioned a little bit about the permitting. I think we've got our first exploration permit as Apache and we're securing a rig.</p>
          <p>The one thing I would say is that all of these things are connected to everything else because rigs are based on cost. And as you see more activity, you're going to see increased costs, you're going to see increased term, which means people are going to have to decide how in the hell they see that.</p>
          <p>So we're going to be active in the Deepwater. We haven't put that in our plans in terms of hard numbers because we're still trying to understand what's going on with permitting, et cetera, but over time it is going to be a core area for us from an exploration standpoint and a production standpoint.  And what's happened out there really has been a benefit to us because we're learning something. And you've got a lot of &#x2013; we're saddled up to some good operators with Anadarko and some other folks so we're very comfortable with where we are.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm going to try a couple of quick ones. First of all, jumping back to Egypt, Roger, you made some, I guess, some interesting remarks regarding the pipeline. I wondered if you could just elaborate a little bit as to the down time you anticipate. And specifically, I think you said there was room for lifting and significant expansion. If you could talk a little bit about what that means in terms of your 100,000 barrels a day production target in Egypt? And I've got a quick follow up, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to how it fits into the 100,000 barrel a day goal, just off the top of my head I'm not sure how &#x2013; what that compote would be like, but to give you an idea of the &#x2013; I mean it would certainly be a positive addition to the goal itself and we've had some really good results on the drilling side this year that would add nicely to the goal. But the pipeline itself, after we had it pigged and fully evaluated the pigging results, actually it was in much better condition than we were expecting. There are about two dozen places along the line, scattered across the entire 260 kilometer length, that require &#x2013; had wall loss greater than 50% that require replacement.</p>
          <p>The total amount of pipe that's needed to replace those, in the end was only about 4 kilometers of 24-inch pipe. The problem is we have to dig it up at about 25 different places to be able to install these limited sections of pipe to effect the repairs. But we're very optimistic that can be done in 2012 and we're just now working through the normal bureaucracy with the joint venture through the tenders and things to procure the pipe and equipment to get the job done as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we're looking at moving the gas around other ways we have in the basin. Perhaps reversing the flow of our southern 18-inch gas pipeline and bring it back up to the plants up in the north where we have some <mark type="indiscernible" /> 47:32]; so there are a lot of possibilities. Ultimately we will have the opportunity to loop the line. There's a possibility to increase the capacity, to access the trunk line that goes through upper Egypt, which is the main national grid line, a 34-inch line that goes to Aciute, Luxor Aswam. To be able to do that, we'll have to add a small amount of compression at the outlet of the line to be sure to be able to enter that higher pressure pipeline environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to be clear, you're running ahead of that kind of &#x2013; the run rate for the 100,000 barrels a day currently, or ...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say we're making progress toward that goal. We've got three years, I believe, to get that 425,000 barrels a day with 100,000 increment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And another way to look at it, we're over-planned for 2011, what our projected plan was for 2011. So we're ahead of the longer-term goal too, then.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. My follow up is real quick on the Permian, I guess this year you held your CapEx back a little bit and as you pointed out your cash flow is well ahead of what you're going to spend. Where are you in terms of being able to really step up the activity level in the BP assets that you picked up last year? And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're still giving a significant effort on bringing the BP assets in the door in terms of integrating the land position, understanding exactly what BP owns and its working interest and level of development. However we &#x2013; we're attacking the plays on a rate of return basis and places where we have drilling obligations of course have the highest priority. Other places &#x2013; we're not really focused just specifically on BP projects; it's where the best opportunities are to achieve the best value for the dollars we're investing.</p>
          <p>Of course BP assets are a significant part of our position in the Permian basin and I expect that we will continue to expand on those properties as time goes by. Right now, the biggest part of our development in the Permian has been focused in the Deadwood area, which is the former Mariner property, so it's a &#x2013; been a very core asset of 100,000 acres that we have to exploit that area.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. He pronounces it better than I do. Argentina, you had a good well result, there are others to go. What kind of a program ramp are you going to get since you're getting higher gas prices there than in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What kind of a &#x2013; I didn't hear that second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Program ramp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Well, our program in Argentina is pretty much tied to our investment level to cash flow in that country at the present time, but most of the drilling program is focused partly on our base development of our existing properties, which also includes horizontal drilling in our conventional reservoirs where we have gas-plus contracts. And the other half is exploration projects dealing with testing the unconventional reservoirs in the Los Mojas and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:48) shales principally.</p>
          <p>I expect to see additional wells, horizontal wells, drilled in the shale as a follow-up to this year's tested concept program in some of these concessions we have. And since we don't have the results of those key vertical wells yet and we won't be able to have those completions underway until probably early in the first quarter next year, it's a little hard to say what the exact level of activity will be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd mention too, John, that part of this gas-plus program, it's a fairly recent program so it's kind of gaining its sea legs. Heretofore, a lot of that gas-plus has gone to quasi government-owned type electrical generation companies. And now, it's starting to branch out into the rest of industry so we're very pleased to see of late that beginning to take hold within a broader industry within the country. And as that continues to pick up, then there'll be more and more of that gas-plus market that we'll be able to tie our production into.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Roger. With the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Steve, you're going to have your first Apache operated well, you have some non-oppositions. Should we expect just a couple of wells a year in total for Apache overall on a going-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know in total. Certainly you are probably are going to see a couple wells exploration &#x2013; I mean, a couple of operated wells out of us a year. And then whatever our activity level is from our non-operated.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Egypt again, should I read into the high level of activity there what, 23 rigs, almost the same as what you've got in the Permian, as an indicator as to your confidence that things will remain constructive? And then your comments just now about the new concession, not much different than previous concessions; should we take this all to mean that the confidence, your insights are good for continued business there?</p>

          <p>From an operating standpoint, it really it's been business as usual, right through the revolution. The week of the revolution, you can look at our production curve over the last 12 months and you'd be hard-pressed to point at that curve and say what &#x2013; when did the revolution take place.</p>
          <p>We've had growing production, as I indicated. So the bureaucracy there is a little slower than normal, I have to say, because there's some confusion. There's been a lot of ministers change in and out. But overall, they're honoring the concession agreements as they always have and the field operations continue as they have. And this announcement of this bid round, which they haven't had one of those in quite a long time with Western governments, this is very encouraging and the terms that the government's put out are consistent with the bid rounds we've seen in the recent past, including the blocks we have ourselves.</p>
          <p>So those are all good signs. And from a financial standpoint, they haven't missed a beat on paying us or permitting and allowing our exports per our contracts. Everything has worked very nicely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might just add, the one difference between Egypt and other countries around them is Egypt really uses all its product in country. They have tremendous growth in use of domestic natural gas, about 12% per year for over five years. They're right on the cusp of having to import crude oil, to actually import product now. So it's &#x2013; they need companies that invest and find oil and gas, and we've had very good relationship there.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question, if I may. One company, large E&amp;P in the United States, which has yet to do a JV on its properties is indicating a JV possibility on its properties. They're well-heeled; you're well-heeled. Has that been a consideration of Apache to accelerate your activity on such a big base of properties that you have and was augmented last year? I mean, how do you think about those JVs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think about them. And I don't mean that &#x2013; I think they have a role for some companies in terms of the way they want to invest; that's really not something that we do. And we have more than &#x2013; opportunities than we can't fund right now if you take the Permian and what we're doing in Anadarko and what we're doing in Canada and the stuff that we're doing in the Deepwater, we're opportunity rich and we've got to find what places that we really can add value and that's not, as far as we're concerned, one of them.</p>
