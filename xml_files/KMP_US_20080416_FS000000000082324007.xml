          <p>Welcome and I would like to thank you all for standing by and inform you that you are on a listen-only during today's conference until the question-and-answer session.  This call is also being recorded and if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.</p>
          <p>I'd like to turn the call to Rich Kinder.  Sir you may begin.</p>

          <p>Okay.  Thank you Ed, and welcome to the Kinder Morgan Energy Partners first quarter analyst call.  As usual we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Also as usual I'll give of an overview of and update of the first quarter and talk about strategic developments during the quarter.  Then Park Shaper, our President, will go through the financial results in detail and then in a bit of departure from what we normally do, Steve Kean, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer is going to give you an update on how we're managing our rather large portfolio of expansion projects.</p>
          <p>Let me just start out by talking about the quarter itself.  We had an exceptionally strong first quarter.  In fact I guess in terms of financial performance, it's the best quarter we've ever had.  We announced today an increase in our quarterly distribution per unit to $0.96; that's up from our 3.84 annualized, which is up from $0.92 in the prior quarter.  Compared to the first quarter of 2007, that's a 16% increase.  Distributable cash flow before certain items was a little over $280 million; that's up 49% from last year.  Probably the most meaningful number is that the distributable cash flow per unit was $1.12; that's 37% above the $0.82 per unit for the comparable period last year.  So we earned $1.12 per unit.  We're distributing $0.96 per unit for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our segment earnings before DD&amp;A which certainly drive the whole bus reached an all-time quarterly high of 685 million.  That's up $182 million or 36% over the results from the first quarter of 2007.  Now the drivers of this performance were our CO2, Natural Gas Pipeline, and Terminals business segments. And I think it's fair to say that in the first quarter we began to derive some significant benefit from some of the more than $7 billion in CapEx projects that we have undertaken, most importantly the Rockies Express project.</p>
          <p>And we continue to make pretty progress on those projects that will drive growth certainly not just in 2008 but 2009 and beyond, there is no denying that this is a challenging environment; construction and material cost have increased. But I think we get pretty good marks for managing the process.  For example, we went through the details of our capital expenditure budget with you at the analyst conference in January and since that time we've continued to constantly update the numbers and our estimates, and we're only up a little over 2% from the estimated expenditures detailed at that January investor conference.</p>
          <p>Equally importantly, probably, we believe we continue to remain on track to bring virtually all of those projects into service pretty close to on schedule.  Now Steve Kean is going to talk in more detail about we're managing this process because I think it's a legitimate question as to how any MLP today that's growing is managing its estimating and cost side of its construction projects.  We're going to spend a little time with you on that.</p>
          <p>Now let me sort of go through the first quarter on a segment-by-segment basis.  Our Products Pipelines group had first quarter earnings of 141 million; that's earnings before DD&amp;A of course.  That's a little less than last year but that's due to the sale of the North System which closed in October of 2007.  If you excluded the North System, the Products Pipelines group was up 5.5% compared in the first quarter of 2007.  We had good growth in the Pacific operations, Southeast terminals and Central Florida pipeline.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, our Cochin Pipeline underperformed our expectations during the quarter and that was due to low propane volumes.  We think we've resolved that moving forward because we've implemented a new shipper provided line fill program, but it was below our expectations in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at the overall volumes on refined products pipeline, while the revenues were up 3.5%, volumes across the whole system were actually down 5.4%.  If you exclude Plantation, which we usually do because there is a lot of moving parts there involving competition and reconstituted different specs on some of the gasoline being shifted in the southeast.</p>
          <p>If you excluded that, probably a more realistic number is that the products volumes were down 1.9% for the quarter.  Now put some perspective on that, the EIA current estimate for the first quarter nationwide is negative 0.7%.  However, EIA has already revised January downward and has indicated that they'll likely have a downward revision in February.  So I expect that the EIA number will end up somewhat worse or less throughput than the present number of negative 0.7%, but that's the number we have right now.  And as I said revenues held up well even on Plantation, while the volumes were down, revenues were up almost 3.5% compared to the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Moving to Natural Gas Pipelines business, they had earnings before DD&amp;A of $188 million, up 39% from the first quarter of 2007.  Once again our Texas Intrastate pipelines were the major contributors to that growth, handsomely from 2007 and well above their plan for 2008.  We also of course had contributions from REX-West and strong performance from Transcolorado.  The drivers within the Texas Intrastate were increased transportation revenue from long-term contracts.  We're getting a lot of value out of our large storage facilities, and we've got improved processing volumes and margins.</p>
          <p>Now while we benefited from REX-West, we didn't get the full benefit that we would have hoped for in the quarter because as you recall we brought most of REX-West on January 12, but we are just now this month bringing on the last part of REX-West which will take the capacity up marginally from 1.4 Bcf to 1.5 Bcf but the reason for the delay is we have experienced what's almost a nova spurt type wet fall and winter in that portion of the upper mid-west, but we are bringing that online within this month, within the next few days, but it did have a slight negative on REX-West contribution, although it was still a very nice up-tick from a year ago obviously.</p>
          <p>Transport volumes in our natural gas segment were up about 22% compared to the first quarter of '07 and that is primarily as result of the startup of REX-West and we're now moving about little over 1.2 billion cubic feet a day on that REX-West system, so we are moving a lot of gas physically since we started up early this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now moving to our CO2 business.  This was a real star this time, delivered earnings at -- right at $200 million, up from about 125 million a year ago, and the real drivers there were stronger than expected oil production at the Yates Field, production in line with our budget at the SACROC, higher hedge prices on crude production. And in addition we had CO2 delivery volumes that were up around 9% due to the January startup of our new source field what we call Doe Canyon in southwest Colorado.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some of production numbers, because I think they are important and we watch them very carefully obviously starting with Yates.  The average oil production at Yates increased to 28,600 barrels per day.  That's a record since we invested in Yates and it is up 9% compared to the first quarter of 2007.  At SACROC for the quarter our average oil production was 27,300 barrels per day and while the volumes were down from the first quarter a year ago, they were up 8% over the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Similarly NGL sales volumes driven largely by our activity at SACROC declined by 3% versus the first quarter of '07, but were up 5% over the fourth quarter.  So I think the message here is that the SACROC volumes sequentially have moved upward fairly nicely, and that comes from what we mentioned in the last call that we were getting back on track in the fourth quarter to start adding a target of 5 patterns per month.  We have now been making that target for the last four or five months and that is having results in our production at SACROC.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would add is that when we talk about price help, the biggest help of course is the higher hedge prices as we have old lower priced hedges rolling off, new higher priced hedges coming on, but also we have a number of our CO2 sales contracts that are &#x2013; that have minimums but also have upside from higher oil prices and we did benefit from that in the first quarter also.</p>
          <p>Moving to our fourth business segment which is our Terminals business, we had a nice first quarter there.  Earnings before DD&amp;A were about $126 million, up 27% from a year ago, and the growth was almost equally split between organic increases and acquisitions and that's because as you may recall we had a number of internal expansions that were completed in the first quarter.  We've detailed a lot of these projects in our written release, I won't go through all of them, but we also had acquisitions such as Vancouver Wharves in May of 2007 and our Marine Terminals acquisition in September of 2007.</p>
          <p>We added about 7 million additional barrels, if you compare 2008 first quarter to first quarter of '07, we have 7 million additional barrels of liquids tankage capacity available than we did last year. And that drove a lot higher liquids throughput through the system.  If you compare the two quarters, our liquids throughput that's gasoline, jet fuel and diesel and associated products was up 17.2% versus the first quarter a year-ago.  Particularly noteworthy for the increases are, our petroleum products rose by 31% and the volumes of ethanol we handled rose by 32%, so we had nice growth in our Terminals segment.</p>
          <p>Our fifth and by far the smallest segment of our business operations is the Trans Mountain Pipeline which KMP acquired in a dropdown on April 30th of last year.  So we had first quarter segment earnings there before DD&amp;A of just a little over $30 million, somewhat below our budget primarily due to foreign exchange rate and higher income taxes.  Those income taxes to a large extent will come back to us later in the year.</p>
          <p>So that's sort of a segment-by-segment viewpoint to sort of drop back and look at the forest instead of the trees for a minute, we previously announced that we expected to declare cash distributions of $4.02 per unit for 2008.  Given the strength of our first quarter, we now expect to meet or exceed that target for 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, before I turn it over to Park, let me bring you up-to-date on a few of our most significant capital projects, which are helping drive our strong growth both now and in the future and a number of other projects beyond what I will talk about are also detailed in our written release.</p>
          <p>Let me start -- again go through the segments in our Products Pipeline segment, we continue to advance our ethanol handling capacity.  We've added and brought online capacity at both our Tampa and Orlando, Florida terminals.  We've begun preparatory work to start making the modification to actually batch ethanol in our pipeline that runs between Tampa and Orlando, and we hope to do that later this year, and we've added ethanol facilities in five terminals in our Southeast Terminals Group and in two projects in our Products Pipeline group in the State of Oregon.</p>
          <p>We continue to progress on our major CALNEV expansion.  During the quarter we had three public hearings on the environmental permitting of this project, and we continue to move forward with the project that we expect to cost in the neighborhood of $425 million, and we would expect that expansion to come online sometime in early 2011.</p>
          <p>Another project that we have not announced until today we have within the last few days reached an agreement with the Defense Energy Support Center regarding nearly $50 million of capital expenditures or capital projects in California.  These will involve the construction and operation of pipeline, storage and filtration facilities, both at our Carson terminal and the Los Angeles area and also at the Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.  So those are the major expansion projects that are underway at our Products Pipeline group.</p>
          <p>The bulk of the 7 billion plus of expenditures or projects actually reside in our Natural Gas Pipeline group.  The biggest by far is the REX project and I talked about REX-West earlier that we began interim service there on January 12th.  Turning to REX-East which is the section of the pipeline that runs from the terminus of REX-West in Eastern Missouri, Audrain County in Missouri to the Ohio, Pennsylvania border, we had an important development there last week when the FERC issued its final environmental approval for the project REX-East, so we expect to begin construction in June.</p>
          <p>We have a completion date of that pipeline by year end.  We'll still be adding some compression early next year so that the pipeline with its ultimate capacity of 1.8 billion cubic feet a day should be fully operational by June of 2009.  Again as we've said on many occasions, we have binding firm commitments from creditworthy shippers for all of that 1.8 Bcf a day.</p>
          <p>On a project that's related to REX and has gotten quite a bit of play I guess in some of the trade press, so I'll just mention it here and that's our Northeast Express project.  That's a project that's essentially an extension of REX.  We would actually increase the capacity by compression from 11 in Ohio, on the Clarington, the present endpoint of REX, and then we would extend the pipeline to Princeton, New Jersey and then on up to Linden just across of New York City, Linden New Jersey.  And it's a major project that we're working on.</p>
          <p>We had a very promising non-binding open season, and we are now working with a number of shippers to see if we get sufficient binding commitments to justify the project and obviously we'll also need the appropriate regulatory approvals.  Assuming we get those, this is a $2 billion plus project that could begin service in late 2010. But I want to emphasize as you know our strategy is not to undertake these projects unless we have firm commitments from shippers.  So far it looks promising but there are no guarantees until you've actually signed the shippers up and we won't do it unless we get commitments.</p>
          <p>Another major natural gas project we have is the Midcontinent Express Pipeline.  That's a $1.3 billion project, which is drawing production out of the Barnett Shale.  It actually starts in Southeast Oklahoma, crosses Northeast Texas, Northern Louisiana, and Central Mississippi ending up at the Transco Pipeline near Butler, Louisiana.  Again it's a $1.3 billion project.  It has initial capacity of 1.4 billion cubic feet per day, I am glad to report that we now have over 1.3 billion cubic feet of that fully subscribed under long-term binding commitments from creditworthy shippers.  We expect to fill the rest of that 1.4 Bcf within the next couple of weeks, and we're hopeful that we will be able to expand that project on a going forward basis.</p>
          <p>Construction on the project which is a 50-50 joint venture between ourselves and Energy Transfer Partners is expected to begin this summer.  The final large project we have in our Natural Gas Pipeline Group is our Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline.  That's a roughly $500 million project that runs about 130 miles, a 42-inch pipe from the Cheniere Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana, total capacity of 3.2 Bcf a day all subscribed by Chevron and Total, and we expect that to be operational no later than January 1, 2009, about three months sooner than initially projected, and that project is obviously already under construction.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Terminals group, we had a number of significant projects completed during the first quarter, and actually within the last couple of weeks.  Construction was completed on our big North 40 terminal there Edmonton, Alberta.  We began service in the first week of April.  That was a project that cost a little over $150 million Canadian.  It consists of nine storage tanks with capacity of about 2.15 million barrels all of which is subscribed by shippers under long-term contracts.</p>
          <p>And then, we also completed an additional 350 million in terminal projects during the last six months.  I kind of referred to that earlier when I talked about how much more capacity we have, but just in these six months, we added 650,000 barrels of storage capacity at our Galena Park facility here on the Houston Ship Channel, 1.4 million barrels of new capacity at Perth Amboy in New York Harbor and then 95,000 barrels of ethanol storage at Argo, Illinois together with numerous other smaller projects.  So we materially added to our handling capacity in our Terminals operation.</p>
          <p>And then finally, our other major construction project, in our Trans Mountain Pipeline Project, construction continues on the approximately $485 million Anchor Loop project.  That will increase capacity on Trans Mountain from about 260,000 barrels a day to 300,000 barrels a day.  The Jasper spread, which will add 25,000 barrels per day, is now completed.  It received a certificate either yesterday or today to be in service on May 1st, and the Mount Robson spread, the last part of the project, is still expected to be completed by the end of November.  So that's where we stand.  We've got a lot of projects.  We are moving along, we had a very strong first quarter, but given all these projects and intrinsic growth, we expect the rest of the year to be very strong for us.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Park Shaper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thanks Rich, and I'm now going to go through the financial pages that are attached to the press release, and so starting with the first financial page, that again should, hopefully all of you have in front of you, it's behind the text in the press release.  It's the base of the income statement, and really, I'm just going to focus on the bottom line here which showed the declared distribution as Rich mentioned, the $0.96 versus $0.83 a year ago, that's an increase of 16% from where we were a year ago and actually just slightly ahead of where we thought we'd be in order to hit our budgeted distribution for the year which is $4.2.</p>
          <p>With that let's turn to the second financial page and talk about the cash that we generated to support that $0.96 distribution and I'll start in the middle of the page.  Right above the weighted average units outstanding you'll see DCF per unit before certain items $1.12, up from $0.815 a year ago, up about $0.30 a unit or 37% growth and of course we've issued a number of units in the last year including in the last quarter and so that's in the face of increased units outstanding which you can see right below that about 20 million of additional average units outstanding.  Just demonstrating that, we're funding our investments conservatively with equity and that will show up on the balance sheet as well, but they are earning well in excess of our cost to capital which is generating tremendous growth.</p>
          <p>So again DCF per unit is up to $1.12, up 37% from where it was a year ago.  $1.12 clearly covers the $0.96 per unit distribution.  In fact it clears it with a tremendous amount of excess cash.  That excess for the quarter is about $40 million.  Some of you may remember from January when we went through the budget, our budget call for excess for the year of about $10 million.  We are well above that in the first quarter and we expect that we'll actually end the year well above that excess cash flow of $10 million.  We expect we'll have greater excess cash flow than that number and again truthfully that's similar to what we discussed in January and similar to what we've seen in prior years that we have exceeded our budget on that excess cash number.</p>
          <p>Now that being said and we talked about this a year ago as well, when we look forward to the quarters, we do have some seasonality in our business.  And generally, the first and the fourth quarters are stronger than the second and the third quarters.  And it could be that, and truthfully, when we look at the second quarter right now, we don't quite cover our distribution for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now we certainly do cumulatively.  So, if you look for the first half, we more than cover our distribution for the first half.  And so, I just want to get your heads up, it may turn out that way.  Now, truthfully, we said the exact same thing if you go back a year ago.  And we ended up covering the distribution in the second quarter and the third quarter.  And so, we'll see how it plays out, but we're just telling you, giving you warning as we look at it today, that we may not have coverage for the second quarter distribution although we will clearly cover it on a cumulative basis for the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>And so looking at where we're generating that DCF per unit of $1.12, clearly most of it's coming from earnings before DD&amp;A, so coming from the actual earnings that we're generating. But let me talk about two other pieces of it.  First, just moving up from that $1.12, you'll see DCF before certain items at $280.5 million, up from about 189, that's about $92 million increase in terms of distributable cash flow or about 49% growth year-over-year, gives us tremendous growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Above that, sustaining capital expenditures were about 30 million in the quarter, up from about 30 &#x2013; from about 27 million in the quarter a year ago.  Now, the $30 million is actually a little bit below our budget where we expected to be in the first quarter of 2008, but we do think that our full-year sustaining CapEx will be on our budget of about $196 million.  So, we still think we will come in at about that level for the year.</p>
          <p>Book/cash taxes, again this is the difference between book taxes and cash taxes, you can see were a negative for the quarter of almost $17 million.  A year ago, they were a positive meaning cash taxes were less than book taxes of about $5.5 million.  This is actually a hurt relative to our budget.  We did expect that cash taxes would exceed book taxes in the first quarter of 2008 by about $5.5 million.  Clearly, we've gone over that by over $11 million.  It's largely a timing issue, related to some dock premiums on the Trans Mountain System.  And we pay taxes on those dock premiums, but in essence, we get those cash taxes back, although we don't expect that we will get them back until 2009. So, we think that this incremental cash tax relative to our budget will persist this year, but then return flow back to us in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now overall, you may recall or if you look back to the January conference materials, we expected that our cash taxes would be less than our book taxes by a modest amount, about $4 million.  We now project that to be a little bit less than that, and in truth, what we project is that cash taxes are going to be just a little bit higher than book taxes for the year.</p>
          <p>So again, those are two other components that go into this DCF.  Relative to budget, we've got a little bit of pickup on sustaining CapEx and a little bit of hurt on the book/cash taxes. But again, most of the growth in DCF is coming from the segments.  Now, Rich touched on these, but if we go up to the top, you'll see Products Pipeline as Rich mentioned, $141 million of earnings before DD&amp;A, a little bit below where we were last year, but if you adjust for North System which was in there last year, is not in there this year, then we are ahead of where we were last year by almost 5.5%.</p>
          <p>Now, it was a little bit below our budget, driven by the impacts of Cochin and a little bit at Pacific.  We do expect products will come in a little bit under its budget for the year largely because those Cochin volumes and revenues won't be recovered this year.  We do believe the line fill program will have a significant impact on next winter season although we'll feel most of that in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Natural Gas Pipeline, again as Rich mentioned, just a tremendous quarter, up $52.5 million from where they were a year ago, a little bit ahead of our plan driven by the Texas Intrastate, which were up $30 million from where they were a year ago and a little bit ahead of plan and Rockies Express which is up $17 million from where it was a year ago, although it's a little bit under its plan, again as Rich mentioned, we didn't have it in service for much of the quarter.  We didn't have it fully in service for any of the quarter, and we had expected that it would be fully in service for some of the quarter in our budget.</p>
          <p>CO2, $200 million of earnings before DD&amp;A for the quarter, up almost $75 million from where it was a year ago, again volumes at SACROC, right on our plan, volumes at Yates, above our plan and very strong there.  And then we've got some help from price.  Now, some of that we expected.  We had factored in the increase in our hedges, but the unhedged price was even higher than what we had in our budget, and that helps us unhedged crude oil, it helps us on our NGLs, it helps us on our CO2 prices.</p>
          <p>On the Terminals side, $126 million, up from about $99 million a year ago, so very nice growth of $27 million for the quarter, a little bit under plan on the Terminals side.  Now we're getting nice growth from both acquisitions and the main acquisitions are the Marine Terminals acquisition, which was completed in September of last year, and the Vancouver Wharves acquisition which was completed in May of last year.  And then as Rich went through, a whole slew of expansion capital projects that have come on line especially on the liquids terminal side, but also on the call handling side, that has driven that tremendous growth. Terminals we think will be very close to its budget, maybe slightly under it for the year.</p>
          <p>Trans Mountain, you will see an increase of about $30 million versus last year, and that's because KMP did not own Trans Mountain in the first quarter last year.  The acquisition was effective at the end of April.  Now, there are some accounting complications to that which we talked about last year, and I'll remind you of in a minute.  But first Trans Mountain was a little bit under its plan, driven again by the two items that Rich mentioned, foreign exchange went against us a little bit, and then taxes were a little bit higher which we believe will be a timing issue.</p>
          <p>Now, our total segment earnings before DD&amp;A, 685 million up from $503 million a year ago basically on plan, dead on its plan for the quarter, although we expect for the year that our segments will generate greater than plan earnings before DD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>With that, let me drop down and you can see the changes in DD&amp;A there.  And then you can see the segment earnings contributions which are after DD&amp;A, we don't believe it's meaningful as the numbers before DD&amp;A.  I am going to drop all the way down to the general and administrative costs.  You'll see 75 million, up from about $62 million.  That's about a $13.5 million increase.  It's a little bit unfavorable at plan, first relative to plan, legal was a little bit over, payroll taxes were over, but that's largely timing.</p>
          <p>Now, Trans Mountain was a little bit over, some of that is just increased insurance cost which we are going to see all year, and then some other timing on capitalized overhead versus last year, we were up $13.5 million.  A huge portion of that is Trans Mountain, about $8 million of that is Trans Mountain, and that's because we did not own it in the first quarter last year.  And then you have benefit costs which were up, some of which will be timing, some of which is a function of higher head count.</p>
          <p>Interest, you'd see at 97 million versus $90.5 million is up about $7 million.  The increase is driven by higher balance.  We'll talk about &#x2013; well, at least the investments that we made in the last quarter shortly, and of course, then all of the investments that we made in the last three quarters of 2007 would also drive that balance up from where it averaged in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Now rate is significantly lower than last year, and lower than our budget.  And what that means is that interest expense is actually favorable to our plan by about $10 million.  So relative to budget, we are getting a nice pickup in interest expense.  Certain items are really meaningless in the first quarter of 2008, but there are significant items in there for the first quarter of 2007.  So, let me just identify the big ones for you.  If you'll recall, because Trans Mountain was dropped down from KMI to KMP with the new accounting rules, we have to treat Trans Mountain as if KMP has owned it ever since KMI controlled it, even though KMP did not economically benefit from Trans Mountain until that transaction closed at the end of April.</p>
          <p>So this was just an accounting issue.  For that reason, for the last three quarters of 2007, we called out the portion of Trans Mountain that occurred before KMP purchased it.  And that's what you see on the first two lines of the certain items, Trans Mountain before dropped down.  Those are the earnings from Trans Mountain in the first quarter of 2007, and then the goodwill impairment, did the goodwill impairment that KMI took in the first quarter of 2007.  But again according to GAAP, we have to reflect that on KMP's books now.  We're pulling it out as a certain item because it did not impact KMP.</p>
          <p>The rest of the items are relatively small, they are relatively consistent between the two years.  But again, that takes you down to your net income before certain items of $249 million, up from 219.  Again, I think that's more meaningful to look at that before DD&amp;A.  And you will see the DD&amp;A line down below there.  That's the earnings.  The first page of the income statement is not overly meaningful largely because of the certain items that are incorporated into 2007.  And again, we went over those ad nauseam last year.  I just touched on them briefly.  Again this year, I don't think there is any reason to continue discussing this.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'm going to the balance sheet.  And so that's the last financial page and -- accompanying the press release.  Cash and cash equivalents are basically unchanged.  Other current assets, you'll see up about $250 million.  Restricted deposits are up, accounts receivable are up, gas and storage is up, largely a function of an increase in gas prices, PP&amp;E is up by about $450 million, largely a function of capital expenditures, offset by depreciation.  I'll talk a little bit more about the capital expenditures in a minute.</p>
          <p>Investments are up because of a contribution to Rockies Express.  I will talk about that also in a minute when we reconcile the debt.  Deferred charges and other assets are up about $118 million, that's the mark-to-market of the hedges that goes through the balance sheet.  Total assets about 16.3 billion, up about 1.1 billion from where we were at the beginning of the year.  Now &#x2013; and that's a function of the expansion CapEx plus the investment in Rockies Express.</p>
          <p>Notes payables and current maturities of long-term debt, I will talk about in a minute when we talk about the total debt.  Your other current liabilities is up about $150 million, the mark-to-market, the hedges, the current portion flows through there.  Accounts payable increased some, and then accrued interest came down a fair amount, just a function of timing on our interest payments.</p>
          <p>Long-term debt is up; again I will talk about that in terms of total debt in a minute.  Value of interest rate swaps goes up, and that's just a function of the forward curve for interest rate.  Hedges down -- or other liabilities are up, that again is a mark-to-market, the hedges, minority interest hedge, clearly unchanged, accumulated other comprehensive loss, again that's the mark-to-market of the hedges, we call it the net change.  Other partners' capital you will see is up almost $400 million, largely a function of equity offerings that happened during this quarter, and I'll talk about that a little bit more in a minute as well.</p>
          <p>And then it takes you down, looking at total debt, $7.6 billion up almost $600 million from where we were at the beginning of the year, then again I will talk about that increase of $600 million in a second.  First, let's look at the strength of the balance sheet.  You will see that results in a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 3.4 times, so and that's a very strong balance sheet considering the stability and the cash generation capability of our assets.  But one other things I will point out, and I have talked about this in the past, this debt-to-EBITDA number is conservative because we use trailing 12-months EBITDA.</p>
          <p>We have a number of projects and acquisitions that have come on during the last 12 months and the debts associated with those expansion projects and those acquisitions is incorporated in this debt number.  But clearly, if they've come on in the last 12 months, we don't have a full 12 months of EBITDA for them in this calculation.  We have not pro forma for those partial years.  And so again, and we were just to stop right now, and go forward a year or some period of time to pick up all of those events, you'd see an even stronger debt-to-EBITDA ratio than we show here.</p>
          <p>With that, let me talk about the change in debt.  Again, the change in debt for the quarter is about $582 million.  Our expansion CapEx during the quarter totaled about $623 million.  And then we had contributions of Rockies Express of about $306 million.  So, we invested about $930 million during the quarter.  Now, that being said, we got back from MEP, Midcontinent Express a little over $60 million during the quarter, and that's because we put a facility in place at that joint venture, which, and then borrowed under the facility which allowed us to recoup cash and allowed our partner to recoup cash that had been invested in that entity.</p>
          <p>So, in our source of cash of about $60 million, we issued equity which generated about $384 million in cash during the quarter.  KMR distributions are an effective equity issuance as well, and so they generated cash of about $67 million during the quarter.  And then we had an increase in margin deposits of about $99 million, so that's the use of cash of about $100 million.</p>
          <p>And then for working capital and other items, we had a use of cash of about $68 million.  And then just to touch on that $68 million real quick, AR and AP was a use of cash of about 55 million, other current assets and current liabilities, largely accrued interest, I talked about that a minute ago.  That was a use of cash of about $100 million.  And then we had some other offsets to that of about $80 million, just largely related to timing associated with CapEx and other cash items that came back the other way, and those netted again to about $68 million use of cash for working capital and other items.</p>
          <p>Now, I talked about $623 million of expansion CapEx.  Let me give you some highlights on what that was.  Products was about $39 million, finishing up the EPX project and a couple of other projects.  Natural Gas was about $180 million.  Most of that was the Kinder Morgan Louisiana Line, the new pipeline that's under construction.  CO2 was about $142 million.  That's continued expansion at SACROC, although a little bit at Southwest Colorado and at Yates as well.</p>
          <p>Terminals was about $118 million.  The North 40 was a chunk of that and then additional tanks here in Houston in the Ship Channel at our Galena Park and Pasadena terminals.  And then Trans Mountain was about $145 million, and most of that is the Anchor Loop Project.</p>
          <p>Now, the last thing I want to touch on is financing.  We did have a very active quarter, and we're quite pleased with this because it was not an attractive quarter as far as the financial markets go.  But the financial markets were absolutely open to us.  And I think we demonstrated once again that one, we are committed to financing these projects conservatively in any market, and we're able to finance these projects conservatively in any market.  So let's go back over what we accomplished from a financing perspective in the quarter.  As I said before, we issued $384 million of equity.  There were too offerings in the quarter.  One was a private placement of about $60 million and the second was an offering of about $324 million.</p>
          <p>Now of course, that was on the heels of another equity issuance that we did in November in a very similar market, at the tail end of November where we raised $300 million.  So if you look back over the last six months, it's almost $700 million of equity that we've raised in the capital markets.  Also during February, we termed up $900 million of debt.  So we were able to go out and do a long-term issuance of debt and term up $900 million.  And we also put in place as I mentioned before, the bank facility at MEP.  And so that's a 1.4 billion facility, and really it will be in place during construction just like we did on the Rockies Express joint venture.</p>
          <p>We expect that we will primarily debt finance during the construction phase, and then that debt will be taken out with equity contributions from the partners and long-term debt once the project is in service in 2009.  So, again this was not a very attractive bank market during the first quarter of 2008, but we were able to get the MEP facility in place on very attractive terms.  So again, we're emphasizing those points to show you our belief that even in unattractive capital markets, we can continue to access capital to finance our projects, and that's largely because our projects are low risk.  We have committed commercial contracts from creditworthy counterparties that support the investments that we're making, and that makes those projects financeable.</p>
          <p>With that actually, I'm going to turn it over to Steve for an update on the major projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm going to cover two things pretty quickly.  One is to update progress on our major projects, the numbers we showed you in January, and then second, take you through the process that we go through to manage that expansion program.  First, recall that in the January conference, we provided you I think a pretty detailed update on $7 billion at that time forecast to spend, and the set of projects associated with that both in the overview presentation as well as in the individual business unit segments.  And that information is still on our website.  And so, we've gone through this before, and we've updated you I think pretty thoroughly.  And I think that's a good starting point for the discussion now.</p>
          <p>So updating those numbers were our most current estimate, foreseeing total capital expenditures that are about another 2.2% higher than what we showed you in January, and that's on an apples-to-apples basis.  So, we're comparing the current estimates to the January estimates on the same set of projects.  And what that set of projects really include, is what we call our major expansion projects, that's projects that are $10 million or above.  And it's also projects that were coming in or came on in 2007 or were underway at the time of accounting.  So, we're not counting stuff that we've added since then.</p>
          <p>So, in those estimates, again we are about 2.2% on the total capital spend, higher than what we're talking about there.  In addition, that Projects Group that we were talking about in January is now about 40% in service on a share of the total spend base.  And that includes REX-West.  In January, it's about a third complete.  So, we've got a substantial part of this project that's in service and is already contributing to the results as Richard mentioned.</p>
          <p>And on those projects in service, we have an overrun.  It's a smaller overrun though than what's in our forecast is the work that remains to be done.  The reason that that's important is that we're not somehow at this level of estimated this current forecast by assuming that we're going to do dramatically better on the project or the work that's yet to come than we did on the work that's already done.  So we're making progress.  We're forecasting costs up a bit, but we're making good progress.</p>
          <p>Now, here is how we make that progress.  The process we go through is as follows.  We review each of these projects in a monthly major projects review each businesses.  And we update their project status, the cost, schedule, how the contract is performing, et cetera.  And we include in those updates the people who are the heads of project management for the different businesses.  So, we're getting pretty close to what's really going on, on the front-line.</p>
          <p>We also get updates on the projects and report of the business reviews.  We get updates on key items of the <mark type="Inaudible" />.  So in short, we're managing this really pretty much the same way we try to manage everything that's important around here.  We want to know early about what the problems are, we want to hear about what the opportunities are, we want to get updated frequently so that we can resolve the problems and capture the opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now that's what happens kind of at a very senior level, but also, there is a lot more going on at the business unit level and in the project management organizations and stuff.  Now first, our business units and the project management teams are experienced and got good expansion project track record.  The business units have set up separate organizations that are dedicated to managing the major projects we have and outsource everything that we do to contractors.  They've also tried to lock their costs early where they can.  I think they have responsibly allocated risk between ourselves, our customers and the contractors and suppliers.  And no process is perfect, but I think this is a pretty good process.  Yet, we will never overcome every challenge and this is certainly a challenging environment.  But I think we bargained for good returns, our business units have done a good job. Getting a contract to underpin the project, they've bargained for good returns that compensates for the risks that we assume and we've done a pretty good job managing those risks.</p>
          <p>Now part of the reason that we track these projects so closely is because these numbers do change, yes it is, and we all know it's very difficult and challenging cost environment, and these numbers that we are updating now today are going to change.  No guarantee that they are going to be limited to our current estimate.</p>
          <p>In fact, we would expect more likely than not that they will be some further increases from where we are today.  And we also hope to see some additional increases in EBITDA from some of those projects as we as we fold them into the rest of the network and we get some additional benefit from them.  And just to give you some idea of the order of magnitude of the increases and how closely we're tracking them, in other words, we're not just sort of drifting along the six months, building this stuff and not checking in and seeing how we're doing.  So, we'll have our share of surprises, and we have already, but we've tried hard this quarter, and tracked at what the risks are, and I think we're doing pretty well so far.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question on plantation.  Just can you tell us from 20,000 feet, what's going on there?  I guess where you guys are connected to certain refineries is impacting some of your volumes there, but if you can talk about that and what the year-over-year volume change was there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a couple of things, let's see, Tom is not here.  But let me &#x2013; what's really driving this is that the quality or specs for gasoline in the Southeast are varying. And of course, our largest single customer is the Exxon Baton Rouge refinery.  And they are making more RBOB [reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending] right now, which is moving over Colonial. And so that is driving lower volumes on Plantation. There are some other tos and fros. And as a matter of fact, we have seen a pickup in April from the March numbers, because we have had one customer switch back to Plantation, but there is a lot of moving parts in serving the Atlanta market, and other parts of the Southeast, between which kind of gasoline gets handled. We only handle certain kinds obviously. And the RBOB is moving across Colonial, and that is hurting us substantially in terms of volumes. Now we do have our tariff structure, and our PPI escalator combined to get us, as I said, actually we are up about &#x2013; in revenues about 3.5% from a year ago.</p>
          <p>In terms of comparison to plan for the first quarter, Ross, which had a lot bigger volume number obviously for Plantation, we are actually within 3 or $400,000 of our plan for the quarter, so almost on plan, but we are suffering from volumes. And I think, we will continue to see that volatility. And the reason we exclude that is &#x2013; from the percentage is I know that a lot of people as we are one of the early reporters, a lot of people look at our volumes in our Products segment and say, "Well, this is an indication of where the national trend line is going with regard to products volumes across America. And I just &#x2013; we don't want to give you the impression that Plantation is keyed off of that. So, I think, it kind of skews the results.</p>
          <p>We always give it to you both ways. We give you with Plantation, and then without it. And as I said, without it, it's about 1.9%.  But that's what's happening. We have some things in the works that like I say will improve it somewhat in the coming months, but I think we will continue to experience this volatility and probably continue to experience a little lower volumes than we would like to see, because of &#x2013; largely because of this gasoline spec issue. Park or Steve, did you want to add anything...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, the only other thing I would say with respect to plantation volumes, why we give it to you also without it is, even reporting it with it distorts the Kinder Morgan impact some, because we only own 50% of Plantation. So, when we give you the volumes including Plantation, that's including the 100% of the impact of Plantation, and again as that volume impact on us is only 50%. Similarly the increase in revenue impact on us is only 50%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also on Plantation, just real quick, what is it about the pipe that keeps you from carrying some of the different grades?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's not really the pipe.  It's the &#x2013; it's both the markets and the source. So it's where they are coming form. For this particular customer, they have other refineries, that are generating other types of grades, and where they are going, what markets they are delivering that gasoline into.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Mark Reichman, Sanders Morris Harris. I wanted to ask if Steve could just touch on the $10 billion of projects that were summarize on page 21 of the January presentation, just to include timing, how the expenses break out, and whether there have been any updates to that slide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I can start, and you can chime in, but I think there &#x2013; some of the projects that we are on there are like potential for additional workup, REX, those projects were covered by Rich, and they are really still &#x2013; are still very much in the hunk of those. I think, the one thing that's probably, I won't say is falling off, but it's less likely is there was a --  the 'Chinook' project, which is a major oil pipeline expansion from the Alberta oil sands all the way down to Gulf Coast. And that one, I think we would probably gauge as less likely now than maybe we would at the time, but I think, the opportunities really across the network are still very robust as they were in January. And of course in January, all we were doing was trying to be select &#x2013; come up with a selected set of projects, not necessarily say these are the ones, and the only ones, or that these are the ones that these are the ones that are going to get done. So, I think that there's still good prospects across the network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, it's right. And for example Northeast Express was on there. I think, the Chicago Express was on there. A potential expansion of MEP, and those all still look very realistic, but we will &#x2013; I think the real point was that there is a lot of other things out there we are constantly looking at.  And some of them are going to go. And I think that we all made the point in January, we were not using that slide to say, "Hey, here is another 10 million -- $10 billion just like we have $7 billion our share today. I think another maybe indicator of that, Steve would have these exact numbers in front of him if I am sure, but I think just since the January conference, we have added in terms of new projects, that Steve took out to get apples-to-apples. We have added about 350 million, is that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, 300 million not counting today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. 300 million and then our Board approved about another over 100 million today.  So we are &#x2013; we have approved since January in excess of $400 million of new projects that were not in that $7 billion number that we talked about in January. I think, you will continue to see that.</p>
          <p>Now you'll &#x2013; sometimes, you will have big pigs going to the boa constrictor like if we get Northeast Express, that's a big pig. Sometimes, you will have mice and rats in terms of an individual terminal. But we do have a lot of things going on. And the &#x2013; again I have said this so many times, but the &#x2013; really, the real advantage of our size and our huge footprint across North America, it just gives us the opportunity to expand, extend, make acquisitions that are folded into our operations. I think it gives us a big head start.</p>
          <p>So we have got a lot of other things going. We certainly won't get every project. I wouldn't guarantee we will get Northeast Express or &#x2013; but we are certainly in the hunt for projects like that.</p>

          <p>I had a couple questions related to the REX-West. You said it underperformed in the quarter versus your budget. I was wondering how much that was, and given that it's still to come on in &#x2013; later in April, do you expect it to under-perform in the second quarter as well or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would not expect it to under-perform in the second quarter, because again, we expect it to be fully online. And most of the benefit of REX-West, we have already gotten by virtue of getting to the ANR Interconnect in Eastern Kansas. As I said earlier, that gets us about 1.3 Bcf a day of capacity.  When we &#x2013; 1.4, excuse me.  When we go to, all the way to Mexico, Audrain County, Missouri that gets us to 1.5 plus, or it will give higher tariff on that additional couple hundred miles. But we expect that to go in service within the next few days. So &#x2013; and that's what we expected for the rest of the year.  So we would expect REX-West to be on plan or maybe even slightly above it for the rest of the year.  Now with regard to the first quarter, Park.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was $5 million, was the impact, the variance of REX versus the plan, so not overly significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then similarly on the CO2, I was wondering if you can give me a sense of the field there in Colorado, the Doe Canyon Deep Unit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we had not drilled that before. And we knew the reserves were there, but we drilled &#x2013; we thought it would take six well. What we wanted to do is get sustained production of additional 100 million a day &#x2013; 100 million cubic feet a day of CO2 out of the Doe Canyon field, which we own about almost 90% of.  So, we are &#x2013; and operate, of course.  And we did that, and then actually, we are moving about 100 million cubic feet a day out of that already. And we are only using two wells. That's how prolific they are. So, the wells have turned out to be very good.</p>
          <p>I think that's going to be a very promising field for us. Now, in all likelihood, I don't want to mislead you.  It doesn't have the size of reserves that McElmo Dome has, but at McElmo Dome, we own substantially less of it ourselves. So, it's very significant in terms of Kinder Morgan CO2. And I think there is certainly potential in the future that as we continue to want to take more CO2 out of Southwest Colorado, we now have another formation at Doe or another field at Doe in addition to McElmo Dome. So, if you look at it right now, we are increasing both of course. And we are also upsizing the Cortez Pipeline.</p>
          <p>So, we are adding 200 million a day of capacity on the Cortez Pipeline that goes down to the Permian Basin.  We are adding 100 million of throughput or production at Doe, and 200 million at McElmo Dome. So, we are adding 300, but only increasing the capacity of the takeaway pipeline by 200, the additional 100 million we are selling under a contract with a producer in Southern Utah. So we have market for all of this, and we are very, so far very pleased with the progress in the Doe Canyon area. Did that answer your question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Merrill Lynch. Staying on CO2 for one sec, Rich, you had mentioned the price escalators in some of your sales and transportation contracts. I am just trying to get a sense of what's the magnitude of the benefits that you realize, and just how many of your contracts have that language written into them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well again, it's a good question, Gabe. And the contracts &#x2013; we have a number of different contracts with the third-party customers that we supply. And most of them today that have been re-negotiated within the last really about three or four years ago, we started putting in these escalator clauses, and so most of our contracts today have those. I couldn't break it out exactly, but certainly well over half have those provisions. And the way &#x2013; and now the details of those provisions, Gabe vary.</p>
          <p>But the way they usually work is something like this. You have a set number per Mcf which is a floor. So, we are not willing to take downside risk, because we have certain costs involved in Southwest Colorado production, and in the pipelines to get it down to the Permian Basin, and then distribute it throughout the Permian Basin. So we insist on a floor, but the way we sell this to our customers and it's through bulk benefits.</p>
          <p>Look guys, if you're going to have $100 oil, your &#x2013; the CO2 that you are using to flood to produce additional barrels is worth a way of a lot more than if you have $50 oil. And we want part of that. And you keep the great majority of it. So that's the way it works. The individual contracts vary. And generally, as prices have gotten higher, obviously there is more of a kicker. So, that's the way it works.  But of the price improvement year-to-year, about a third of the price improvement that we got came from those contracts. So, it is significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it is pretty much a linear relationship at these levels, if crude goes up 20%, you are kind of getting a 20% higher tariff on those contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say it's linear, because there are so many varied contracts, Gabe.  And it does &#x2013; some of them have various step-downs, lesser or greater percentage as the price varies. So it's kind of a basket of contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Gabe, Steve is looking for sensitivity to crude prices, that's in our January conference materials, and I would need to confirm, but I am virtually positive that that sensitivity included the impact of CO2 and NGLs. It wasn't just the impact of unhedged crude volumes. And I can't remember the number off the top of my head, but again at 10 &#x2013; $6 million for every dollar change in crude prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Rich, can you just comment, the improved processing volumes and margins, or maybe Park do you have it, how much of that contribute to &#x2013; in the Natural Gas segment, how much of that contribute to the upside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's relatively small. I mean, the biggest source, and of course that would be in the Texas Intrastate, although we have a little bit of processing in the Rocky Mountains as well, although they were actually down versus budget. In the Texas Intrastate, the largest source of growth was from a new contract that we signed with our largest customer last year, and from which we felt the largest impact in the first quarter of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then Rich could you expand a little bit on the ethanol pipeline that you have been working on, and you talked about at the analyst meeting, and there has been a fair amount of publicity on it. What's &#x2013; how do things stand now with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. What we &#x2013; we are very consistent with what we said in January. We have now authorized the funds, and we have started the engineering work to make some retrofits and changes in that pipeline that runs from Tampa to Orlando to handle ethanol in batched quantities. Then we will run a test of that probably in the August timeframe, sometime in the third quarter. Assuming that's successful and our operations people believe it will be, then we will start offering that service to our customers in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now the reason of course that it has gotten widespread publicity at least in the trade rags is that I think a lot of people think this is the precursor to doing this over longer lines. I think everybody knows that probably while there is a lot of issues with ethanol, but certainly one of the biggest problems is how do you get ethanol from the rather concentrated areas of production in the Upper Midwest to the place where its highest and best use is namely on both coasts.</p>
          <p>And I think we are particularly on point in Florida, because huge demand for ethanol, a lot of people want to move ethanol into Florida and indeed the whole Southeast. So &#x2013; but the caveat I would add is that it's one thing to move ethanol in batched system on a 160 mile system. It's something different to move it on a 1,500 mile system across the country.</p>
          <p>So it's a long way from moving it on Central Florida pipeline to moving it on SFPP or Plantation or Colonial or explore some of the other major pipelines, but certainly it will be a very good test. Our customers are enthusiastic about it. It would be assuming it works a nice return item for us on the expenditures that we will make, and then we will just see how it goes and whether we want to apply it elsewhere.</p>
          <p>If you could ever get to the point of moving more ethanol by pipeline, whether a dedicated pipeline or batched &#x2013; batching it in a products line, it would obviously have enormous positive impact on the overall cost of ethanol distribution. But certainly we got to walk before we run.</p>
          <p>But it's all on schedule right now. And as a matter of fact, the larger expenditure thus far in Florida was the facilities that we have put in at both Tampa and Orlando, and those are now essentially complete and we actually received cargos both from the Caribbean and barges from internal ethanol within the last few days at our Tampa offloading facility. And we now have the not only storage capability, but we have ethanol blending facility, so we can blend it at the REX in both Tampa and Orlando.</p>
          <p>And so, right now that blend that neat ethanol that goes to Orlando is being trucked over there by our customers, who economically and for whatever reasons want to blend it, and so we hope that by the end of the year we will actually be moving it in the pipeline in a batched way, which obviously is much cheaper than moving it by truck for our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then on the CapEx, the 2.2% higher CapEx that's on top of the budget from the January analyst meeting, is that correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My questions are more focused on the increases in the construction costs. Could you guys clarify which particular projects you are seeing have higher cost versus the other projects? And also the extent that the cost is more from labor versus just pure raw material price increases from steel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me attack the second part of it, then I will turn it over to Steve for the first part, but &#x2013; and we said a lot of this in January. On most of these major projects, we have locked in the materials. So for example, REX before we ever broke ground, we had locked in our pipe costs and our compression cost, so the cost of the compression and these thousands of miles or hundreds of miles of pipe, so that leaves the great denominator overwhelmingly as the labor cost, and as you no doubt heard from others what's happened in this environment is that you are moving from fixed cost contracts where all the risk of overruns or profit from under-runs was on the contractor. Contractors are simply unwilling to do that today on large projects.</p>
          <p>Now on some of the smaller projects, you can still get that, but on large for instance REX or MEP where you have 42 inch pipe, a relatively smaller universe of people who can again install that pipe, you are forced to go by the market to time and materials contracts. And there what you usually do is set a target price. If the price goes higher than that, then you agree on that with your contractor. If the price goes higher, you have some kind of sharing of that, the contractor each part of it, we part of it. If it's lower, there is some kind of sharing. They get part of that lowered cost, we get part of it. But it's not nearly as certain, and generally it leads to higher costs in a T&amp;M contract than in a fixed contract.</p>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; most of the risk is on the labor side. And I don't mean that it's all just hourly pass-through.  Diesel fuel has gone up dramatically, for example. So that's a cost. In a time-and-materials contract that hits the overall target price, so we bear a part of that risk. If you have rainy weather, and have to put match down, because you can't work on the right of way in the mud with your heavy equipment, and you have to spend money to have mats hauled in for a working platform, that's an add-on cost. So those are the kind of things that altogether go to make up the risk profile and there are other things, but it's all &#x2013; almost all in the construction side, not in the ordering of the equipment itself. Steve you want to add to that or talk about where the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. With carrying on with that theme really, so where we are seeing the share of the increases from what we saw in January, and talked about January really on the pipeline, so that includes pipeline in the CO2 segment, it includes <mark type="inaudible" /> as was mentioned earlier we have the benefit of having higher CO2 revenues, so a lot of that there is an offset, I think, probably more than an offset on the revenue side associated with that. CO2 pipeline Trans Mountain has an increase, and the gas pipeline projects have increased. Less so or smaller share is really in terms of Terminals and the CO2 investments in the field sort of production investments, so the biggest share have been coming from the pipeline side for all the reasons that Rich is talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would you say that a lot of the pipe costs for let's say Midcontinent or CALNEV for the Louisiana line are pretty much locked in, and so the greatest variability is still just labor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, I can't speak for CALNEV yet, because we are still early in the permitting process there, but Scott Parker is sitting here, all of the costs on MEP, Kinder Morgan &#x2013; all of the pipe on Kinder Morgan Louisiana, MEP and REX have been ordered, committed, and so we have a fixed price on those.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, I have three quick questions for you. The first is can you talk about potential for acquisitions especially given the success you have had in accessing the capital markets, number one?  Number two, in terms in of Midcontinent Express, could you talk about potentially what the nature of the expansion could be? Would it be adding compression or would it actually be looping, and how large an expansion could that possibly be?  And then thirdly, are you considering moving gas Northwest out of Rockies, a project that might be able to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the potential acquisitions, we do continue to look at acquisitions. In fact our Board approved three small acquisitions today. So we continue to look at acquisitions, most are relatively small tuck-ins. A couple that we are looking at are much larger, but I certainly wouldn't predict that those are going to work out. We are just looking.</p>
          <p>It's a function of what we are willing to pay versus what somebody else is willing to pay.  I think at least in large scale acquisitions companies like Kinder Morgan may be advantaged a little bit because we do still as an investment grade company have access to capital markets and some smaller companies don't, but that said, there is a lot of companies out there that have access to the capital market.</p>
          <p>So we will just have to see on the acquisitions, and we never intend anything on acquisitions. For example, we always make it very clear that our forecast and out budget numbers do not include any acquisitions. Those would be in addition to our present budget. And then I will ask Scott Parker, who is here who runs our Natural Gas Pipeline group to talk about the expansion on MEP.</p>

          <p>On MEP, we have 1.4 Bcf project today, as Rich described, getting very close to sold out. And we have very economic compression expansions that would range anywhere from a total of 1.8 to a little over 2 Bcf. So clearly those are right in front of us, things we could do quickly, and very economic and beneficial to Kinder Morgan and our partners.</p>
          <p>Beyond that level of capacity increase, we would look at looping like we do on all our existing assets, we start looping downstream to your compression. So really both those are available to us, but as typical we would do the compression expansions first. And on MEP, we continue to look at extending the pipeline too as we expressed in the conference, and we are seeing a little more interest there, again one of those projects that are out there in front of us in the future that we will compete for.</p>
          <p>On the Northeast question or Northwest question, we really don't have a footprint on the gas side.  In the Northwest, we don't compete well there, so we are not looking at moving from the Rockies to the Northwest, but we are looking aggressively at &#x2013; on additional assets out of the Rockies towards the East.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Yves, just to clarify what Scott was saying is he didn't mean to expand &#x2013; he meant expanding to 1.8 Bcf or slightly over 2 Bcf through compression. So, net expansion of 400 million a day to 600 million a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, how much would &#x2013; any thoughts on how much that would cost to add compression?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's certainly &#x2013; I don't know, if we want to get in the detailed costs of it, but it certainly is much more economic than a new build is, so it would be a good project for us, a good project for our shippers, and of course, what's really happening there is as you know there is a competitive line here that's being built also, so I think when we started out I think some people had a question mark as to whether our line is going to be filled.  Now it clearly is.</p>
          <p>And it's really a mark, I would like to say, of good management here, and hopefully that's part of it, but it's also a mark of just the exponentially almost expansion of production in the Barnett Shale, and then of course some of the Fayetteville trend has the ability to hook into parts of this if they want to go this way.</p>
          <p>So, it's a real opportunity for us, and I think, there is a good likelihood there that we will be able to do some size of future expansion, and maybe even as Scott said an extension on it, given the demand for natural gas. And you know, we kind of blow that off sometimes, we hear everyday in the papers, and even on television now about carbon caps and trades and what's going to happen in &#x2013; and of course, coal getting beaten up with a big stick at every turn by every politician. And of course, the natural beneficiary of all that is natural gas. And if you are not going to build as many coal plants as you thought, and I think, that's pretty clear now that that's the case, and you are not going to get nuclear built in the short term, get it permitted and built, although I want to say I think we need a broad basket of alternatives, and I think nuclear plays a role in that, but my guess is you are talking 10 years or so before you would actually get nukes onboard.</p>
          <p>So you have got to do something to supply the increased need for electric generation capacity in this country, if your economy continues to even grow modestly. And so that leads you to natural gas as probably the most likely alternative. So I think, you are going to see a lot of growth in need for natural gas and electric generation, and where that's helpful to us is that that drives the need for new infrastructure capacity to get that gas from producing basins some of which are also relatively new like the Barnett Shale across to wherever the need for that natural gas is.  So that's what's tremendously beneficial whether it's projects coming out of Rockies, projects moving re-gasified LNG, or projects coming out of the Barnett Shale or the Fayetteville.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Rich, you sort of opened up the door to another question, and that is that competing pipeline I think still has unsold capacity of I think it's around 300 million cubic feet a day, so could you envision actually being able to sign up more capacity even given that other pipeline still has more capacity to sell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not ever worried about competitors. We have enough to worry about just managing our own business, so I am not sure where the competing pipeline is, but obviously one advantage to Scott and his team have is we have got a tremendous footprint with our partner, Energy Transfer and ourselves, upstream of the start of this pipeline. And of course, we connect into others of our pipelines along the way, including NGPL and including our Texas Intrastate. So there's lot of things, I think, we bring to the party. But again, we will just have to see, and I want to emphasize we are not going to do an expansion unless we have throughput agreements signed, and just like we do on all of our pipelines.</p>

          <p>Yeah. I am still with Morgan Keegan also. I forgot to ask on your variable rate debt, what are you seeing now as far as your interest rate?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, clearly on paper and certainly our swaps as well, it's a spread off of LIBOR. Now your swaps depend upon &#x2013; your swaps in terms of when they were struck, what's fixed rates, you were swapping that at &#x2013; you can't narrow that down to a single rate, but what I am telling you is our budget incorporated LIBOR at 4.75%, and I think, all of you all know where LIBOR is now, but it's less than 3% and so we are getting a nice pickup from that clearly the spread doesn't necessarily move.  I mean the commercial paper spreads can move around, but it has not changed significantly and the spread on the swaps are fixed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then Yves' question made me think of another item, with a lot of the publicity with these announcements from the Marcellus Shale and Haynesville, I thought maybe if you could care to comment how you think that might play into future opportunities for Kinder Morgan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is nothing we like more than new producing area that is projected to incur big time increases in production because invariably they don't have the pipeline takeaway capacity, so we are looking at both of those areas. Nothing is definitive at this point. We are looking at both those areas, how we could provide capacity there, how we could tie into it, and in both cases, we know those producers.  We have relationships with them, and we will just continue to look at those opportunities, but again as I have said so many times, I think, we have had a real renaissance of natural gas drilling activity led by a lot of large independents around the country, and that's led to some very nice increases which will probably lead to less demand for LNG, and more production in the Lower 48.</p>
          <p>And I think we are as well positioned as anybody to take advantage of expanding, extending, building the additional infrastructure that needs to be done to accommodate this. We are still seeing a very nice growth in the Rockies, and Scott made the point earlier today that we have these other pipelines coming out of the Rockies aside from REX and here REX is taking in the month of March on average I think slightly over 1.2 Bcf a day of real physical gas out of the area, and yet we saw no meaningful declines on our other pipelines coming out of the Rockies.</p>
          <p>Now, I can't vouch for everybody, but I expect that's pretty much the case which says that all REX did was take up a lot of pent-up demand, and if you extend the kind of production increases that that indicates out over the next two or three years, and the kind of drilling programs that a lot of companies have, and $10 gas, that's a pretty strong combination. And so I think, that's why you are seeing so many players wanting to build new capacity, and I think, there will probably be something built West and something built East within the next few years to accommodate still additional growth in the Rockies production.</p>
          <p>Could say the same thing in the Barnett Shale, the Fayetteville, now probably the Marcellus. I mean just a lot of opportunities for infrastructure expansion, now you got to make sure in our judgment that you have the right contracts, you have the right shippers, that they are creditworthy, and that you have good contracts with them, but there is enormous opportunities if &#x2013; to take advantage of.</p>
