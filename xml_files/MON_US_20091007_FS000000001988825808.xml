          <p>Greetings and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2009 Monsanto Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Scarlett Foster; Vice President of Investor Relations for Monsanto. Thank you Miss Foster, you may now begin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning to everybody on the line. I'd like to welcome you to Monsanto's fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant; our Chairman and CEO and Carl Casale, our CFO. Also with me are Manny Cruz, Will McAndrew and Ruben Mella, my colleagues in Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we're webcasting this call. You can access it at Monsanto's website at monsanto.com and the replay is also available at that address. For those of you who would like to go to our website, the slides for this call are posted on the investor information page.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that this call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty. The company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language contained in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are providing you with measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. And those cases where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we've provided you with the reconciliation to the GAAP measures in the slides and in the earnings press release.</p>
          <p>And it has been our practice. We also have published today the final numbers for our biotech trade acreage penetration by crop, and by country.</p>
          <p>Our conversation today is really focused on two areas. First, we need to outline how we will grow our seeds and traits 13 to 15% in 2010 with the associated costs and complexities of launching two new products on a scale not seen before on farm. Carl will focus here along with the financial guidance for 2010.</p>
          <p>Backend, we need to set up the milestones that will demonstrate our ability to deliver on our 2012 commitment. Hugh will address this area, driven by growth preference for our seeds and traits, which anchors our commitment to double gross profit in 2012.</p>
          <p>In the longer term context, fiscal year 2009 was a sign of the decade to come. Grower adoption of our seeds and traits created the lion's share of our growth accounting for over 65% of total gross profit, growing at a 17% rate with a nearly one percentage point gross margin left, all while we prepared to launch two game changing technologies.</p>
          <p>Roundup gross profit declined 7% and the business has now been repositioned in the marketplace for 2010. We have defined a clear path to optimizing round up gross profit at the $1 billion target by 2012 and at that level, the entire Ag productivity segment would be only 15% of total company gross profit.</p>
          <p>Slide four allows us to take a slightly more detailed view of the fourth quarter and full year. And the reconciliation at the end of the slide deck and in the press release, provides you with a bridge from as reported to ongoing earnings.</p>
          <p>I would note for you that the restructuring charges in the fourth quarter are reflected both in cost of goods sold at $45 million and as an expense line item of 361million, both pre-tax. The net after-tax effect is $0.53 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.52 per share for the full year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial effect of our operations; in the quarter, total company net sales and gross profit declined 8 and 11% respectively. Somewhat better results than we originally forecast in seed and traits, coupled with significant one-time cost saving measures, put in place for the last four months of the fiscal year to help bridge the forecasted gross profit gap and round up.</p>
          <p>As a result, ongoing EPS was $0.02 rather than our typical seasonal loss in the fourth quarter. For the full year, company net sales and gross profit were up 3% and 9% respectively.</p>
          <p>Strong growth preference for our seed and traits coupled with the extraordinary actions we took to reduce expenses to offset the roundup gross profit decline resulted in ongoing EPS growth of 21% at $4.41. The full year also reflected the mid-point of our anticipated tax rate of 28 to 29%.</p>
          <p>If you refer to slide five, full year gross profit for seed and traits of 4.5 billion was larger than Monsanto's entire gross profit in 2007, picking due to the rapid adoption of our products in two short years.</p>
          <p>Our corn platform, set the pace, for gross profit growth of 20% with margins expanding by nearly two percentage points to 63%. The pace setter for corn was the U.S. business. Our gross profit grew over 30% as Triple Stack corn accounted for more than 70% of the growers choice from the DEKALB and American Seeds portfolio.</p>
          <p>That value, more than offset flat market share in those brands and less aggressive sales of Triple Stack products by our licensees. Market share in Brazil and Argentina flourished with grower use of our new hybrids.</p>
          <p>Share gains of one and three points, respectively, established the base for the future ramp of trade penetration in Latin America. Soybean gross profit grew 20% to 871 million. In the United States, the Asgrow brand grew by half a share point and American Seeds was down nearly one point.</p>
          <p>Gross margins declined two percentage points, given the mixed effect of selling more seeds at a higher value in a year, when we had only introductory levels of the Roundup Ready 2 Yield trade. We're just beginning to see the payoff of our increased investment for cotton growers two years ago.</p>
          <p>The introduction of the Class of 2009 variety is helping us to begin to turn the corner with growers, even though Delta Pine Land shares dropped nearly two points in a smaller planning market in the heart of the cotton belt.</p>
          <p>Trade penetration and mix in India, and an increase in acreage in Australia, led to a better than expected gross profit of $344 million, a 10% increase over the prior year with a margin left of four percentage points.</p>
          <p>Gross profit for our vegetable segment grew 6% to $416 million, reflecting a benefit of adding the De Ruiter protected culture business. Margins decreased by two percentage points given the inclusion of 36 million for the inventory step up related to the De Ruiter acquisition. Excluding the inventory step up, vegetable gross margins would have been 56%.</p>
          <p>It's an outcome of our final global market share numbers for the large row crops in 2009 can be found on slide six. Results were mixed, with the strongest performances coming in corn, in Brazil, Argentina, India and Europe.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide seven, gross profit for the Roundup business was $1.8 billion, with global volumes for the year at a 182 million gallons and the percent of branded material sold flat at 58% of total volume.</p>
          <p>Price for Global branded Roundup peaked above the $20 per gallon level. Slide eight summarizes some other key results in fiscal year 2009. On the cost side, SG&amp;A as the percent of sales was just over 17%.</p>
          <p>The special cost savings program launched in May, resulted in reduced expenses of $262 million, largely because of lower incentive, travel limitations and other extraordinary cost measures.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D as a percent of net sales was 9%. As we managed an historically large number of potential new products in the regulatory approval phase, prior to commercialization.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow reached 1.5 billion for the year with a operating cash flow of 2.2 billion. Three factors caused the decline in operating cash year-over-year. One, we managed a lower level of accounts payable because we reduced spending.</p>
          <p>Two, we had an extraordinary level of prepaid reflected in deferred revenue in Brazil, in August of 2008. The cash effect was in the range of 400 million, which was pulled into fiscal year 2008 from the 2009 fiscal year cash flow.</p>
          <p>Third, we produced corn seeds for a larger corn market in both the United States and Argentina, and inventories are higher than the prior year. This will be metered down as we change the mix for the 2010 product line up to prepare for the launch of SmartStax.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures were 916 million inline with last year as we neared completion of the major seed manufacturing expansion and the round up of the de-bottlenecking projects.</p>
          <p>Over 300 million of cash was used for jump, hire and acquisition in adjacent spaces such as wheat and sugarcane and that was paid for, by some 300 million in divestitures.</p>
          <p>We repurchased 398 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2009 and are one-third of the way through our second 800 million authorization.</p>
          <p>At year's end, we can sum up the total of our efforts by working at return on capital. We have consistently increased return on capital through a combination of earnings growth and efficient use of capital.</p>
          <p>In 2008 and 2009, the significant levels of Roundup gross profit just tore through ROC trajectory.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, because of the strong growth in seed and traits, we were able to increase total company ROC by one percentage point to 25%.</p>
          <p>In sum, during fiscal year 2009, Monsanto optimized gross profit across both seeds and traits and Roundup and realized significant cost savings to deliver a 21% increase in ongoing EPS and free cash flow of 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, we witnessed the end of the peak years for Roundup gross profit and used the cash flow generated that -- by that business over the last three years to expand a higher margin seed and traits business, while sharing value with our customers and returning value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Scarlett and good morning to everyone on the line. I've had the opportunity to participate in these calls in my previous roles, it is now a privilege to do so as Monsanto's new CFO. The strong legacy created here is challenging and make the best even better. This is a task I take seriously and I'm fortunate to have served with and learned from Terry over the last decade.</p>
          <p>It would have served us well for our first decade as a standalone company, it forms a second decade. Specifically, I'd point to four tenants.</p>
          <p>First and foremost, our focus is the customer and every financial choice we make should inform how we bring more value to growers and how we improve their return on investments.</p>
          <p>Second, if we succeed at the first, we then must execute so that we deliver to our owners consistent earnings growth as a commitment, not an aspiration, recognizing effect of resetting the earnings expectations around us.</p>
          <p>Third, growth comes with a price tag that spending must be disciplined and the last dollar spent needs to bring as much value as the first.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we should translate earnings into cash and that value should be returned to our owners through a combination of investments in future growth, dividends and share repurchases. These footprints were also behind the commitments we've made in 2010. And it resulted in our ongoing EPS guidance of 3.10 to 3.30 assuming a 30% tax rate.</p>
          <p>Our corresponding free cash flow guidance is 900 million to 1 billion, equating the after-tax cash effect from restructuring were approximately 250 million. The components of our guidance are reflected on slide nine. As you think about the quarterly breakout of the earnings, I will anticipate that we will breakeven or have a modest loss in the first quarter and a small loss in the fourth.</p>
          <p>Approximately, 60% of the earnings should flow through in the end second quarter and roughly, 40% in the third. As we would expect, this reflects the shift in around at the Latin America at the start of the year, in the U.S. at the end, with the growth in seed and traits driving the middle of this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>A considerably lighter first quarter will not be an indicator of the year to come and we expect the business will gain strength as we move into the middle half of the year in the peak of the buying season for season three.</p>
          <p>Our earnings base in 2010 is a direct function of the competitive dynamic surrounding the Roundup business and the clear signal from our customers that the premium for our branded products over the competition last season, outstrips the value received. By knowing the GAAP on that premium, Roundup becomes a 650 to $750 million gross profit business this year, as shown on slide 10.</p>
          <p>Our bid to optimize that gross profit at $1 billion in 2012 is the function of things we control, most specifically volumes and cost savings assuming that we continue to price appropriately for the value the farmer receives.</p>
          <p>At these levels the total Ag productivity segment is 16 to 17% of our total gross profit generation in 2010. More germane to our customers and our owners is the some 85% of the business that is expected to deliver a 13 to 15% growth rate in the 2010 fiscal year.</p>
          <p>As we review the growth projections received in trades back on slide nine, it's critical to keep in mind that our ability to cross the $5 billion mark for the first time, is the sole function of our ability to create new value for growers and increase their profitability on farm magnitude of our long term growth remains, only the mix changes.</p>
          <p>As I just mentioned, every financial and operational choice we make should drive farmer profitability, embedded in our growth rates for seeds and traits in the underlying belief based on our technology. We've created more value than we've priced for and that irrespective of the swings in commodity prices, the farmers should receive a positive return on the investment from the use of Monsanto seeds and traits.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 goes to south. If you use SmartStax as a new standard for corn production, you can see that the farmer received a significant boost in the return on his seed investment. Even when we take bare case of $1.95 corn, which is afore set by the government for corn pricing in United States. The farmer experiences a 20% return on his incremental investments, if he chooses SmartStax over DEKALB Triple Stack.</p>
          <p>This pricing conversation correlates to my second sense. If we succeed in increasing growth profitability, our execution then drives our earning growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 serves as a reference. As the 2010 selling season starts magnitude of our long term growth remains, only the mix changes.</p>
          <p>As I just mentioned, every financial and operational choice we make should drive farmer profitability, embedded in our growth rates for seeds and traits in the underlying belief based on our technology.

          <p>This pricing conversation correlates to my second sense. If we succeed in increasing growth profitability, our execution then drives our earning growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 serves as a reference. As the 2010 selling season starts, we have some new tools that we believe will open the farm gate wider for Monsanto.</p>
          <p>First among these are the launches of Roundup Ready 2 Yield and SmartStax at levels unprecedented in our history and best in the industry. How we ensure broad growers experience in 2010, dictates our ability of fully serving the needs of farmers in 2012.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we're focused on the sales team, which now sells only seeds and trades so as there are more touches for the customers. Our experience shows that if we can get trial on farm the grower can directly experience the benefits and the profitability generated by our technology. The challenge for our sales team is to accelerate grower experience with not one, but two blockbuster products through two channels that offer unique grower purchasing experiences.</p>
          <p>Aggressive launches that propel long-term growth come with a cost and grower trials in one year, don't immediately translate into share shifts. But financially, it is money well spent to accelerate grower experience with these two products by spending a bit more in 2010 to ensure SmartStax arrives on farm in the top yielding hybrid in the largest possible quantities the financial effect of all this will be corn gross profits growth targeted at 19% range but with flat margins, while soybeans are expected to advance 9% on the absence of profit basis, but also with flat margins.</p>
          <p>Farmers openly determine our sales mix based upon what makes the most sense for their farm. In 2009, more than 70% of everything's purchased from DEKALB or American Seeds portfolio was a Triple Stack.</p>
          <p>In 2010, farmers will have more stack corn products in more combinations available for them, at some 75% plus of everything we expect to sell in DEKALB and American Seeds will be a Triple or SmartStax, as we show on slide 15.</p>
          <p>Behind that Triple Stack package will be some 10% of our DEKALB and American Seeds portfolios, that have proven Germplasm performers on farm and for that solid return, farmers will have the choice to pay the same or less, than they did in 2009.</p>
          <p>Execution drives cotton and vegetables as well and both are poised to shine in 2010. Given the better than expected gross profit for cotton in 2009. We now expect gross profit in 2010 to increase by 9% to approximately 375 million.</p>
          <p>Next year our plan is for 65% of the DEKALB brand to be from new seed varieties with higher yields launched in either 2009 or 2010.</p>
          <p>Including Germplasm, also gives growers the best protection package in the market with the double-double stack of two second generation traits. The Bollgard II rounded pretty flat, leading to a modest up tick in margins that have already topped 70%.</p>
          <p>The vegetable segments is expected to continue to expand margins in 2010 to over 60%, and increase gross profit to roughly 525 million.</p>
          <p>Our third tenant espouses that you must invest in order to grow, but you have to ensure the last dollar spent provides as great a return as the first.</p>
          <p>As we announced last month, the company increased the pre-tax restructuring reserve to a range of 550 to 600 million of which 290 million after tax or $0.52 per share was recorded in our fiscal fourth quarter, with the remaining charge of 19 to $0.25 per share expected to be expensed in the fiscal year 2010.</p>
          <p>Approximately, 70% of the total restructuring charge or roughly 250 million after tax will have a cash effect with the remaining non-cash portion for asset write-offs related to site closures and consolidation.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows the annual cost savings from this program, totaling 220 to 250 million, primarily from reduction in corporate spending, some savings from R&amp;D and a lower cost of goods sold and SG&amp;A for Roundup and seeds and traits. We expect approximately 35% of the annual savings will be realized in 2010 with the full benefit realized in 2011.</p>
          <p>Our expansion of the restructuring plan reflected a forward-looking review that asked where could we accelerate change that would in turn accelerate growth. As a result, we took more actions in seeds and traits. We originally planned, closing inefficient facilities and aggressively pairing product lines, particularly in vegetables.</p>
          <p>The seeds and traits numbers also reflect a heavier allocation of restructuring actions related to corporate overheads, which benefits the seeds and traits business on a go-forward basis.</p>
          <p>As you can see on Slide 15, total company SG&amp;A as a percent of sales is expected to be in the 18.5 to 19.5% range. We believe the relevant benchmark for SG&amp;A in 2008, given the extraordinarily and non-replicable measures taken to reduce costs in 2009. Therefore, we anticipate 2010 on an absolute basis to be around 3 or 4% lower than 2008.</p>
          <p>The leverage in the seeds and traits business was actually better than the percentages make it appear. Now with the Ag productivity business has been reset, 80% of the corporate overhead is allocated to seeds and traits versus 50% in 2009, which affects the comparison from 2009 to 2010 for that segment's spend.</p>
          <p>In terms of R&amp;D, we expect to spend 10.5 to 11.5% of sales in 2010 to fund future projects that will drive grower profitability through the next decade.</p>
          <p>The absolute dollar increase of 15% reflects the number of projects that we have back loaded in the phase of three and four in the pipeline. Where we are in large scale field trials and global regulatory reviews. That said, we do not base the dollars we spend on the percent of our sale. Our philosophy employs a bottoms up review based on the promise of technologies in our pipeline, projects are reviewed twice a year to ensure they deliver an adequate return on investments.</p>
          <p>The speed at which these projects move through the pipeline, the velocity of that invested dollars is one of the determinants of how large the expenditures can reach. The other factor is simply people capacity with a natural limit as to how many projects are signed, we can manage at any given time. We periodically review our processes and we'll continue to revisit this to ensure we are maximizing the power of each dollar invested in our technology efforts.</p>
          <p>Finally, our earnings must translate including the cash that we return to our owners.</p>
          <p>Obviously, our earnings reset inherently means a lower level of free cash flow and we're forecasting 900 million to 1 billion for fiscal year 2010 inclusive of the after tax cash effect of approximately 250 million for restructuring. A lower level of earnings must be offset by heavy focus on managing working capital and leveraging capital expenditures without damaging customer purchases or forestalling growth.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures are expected to be in the 750 to $850 million range. As we continue to support new platforms in seed expansion globally by adding drawing capacity.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to maintain the financial discipline that gives us a clean balance sheet and the opportunity to use that balance sheet for opportunistic acquisitions. For the total company we expect inventory as a percent of net sales to migrate back to 2008 levels, in the low 20's as a percent of sales, as we turn it over to the new platforms in corn, soybean to cotton, particularly in the U.S. and Latin America.</p>
          <p>We'll be prudent with our credit and stringent with economic conditions dictates.</p>
          <p>As a result, we're targeting account receivables as a percent of sales to remain flat in the mid-teens range.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 16, the growth for our business and the health of our balance sheet gives us the flexibility to re-invest for our customers and our owners, while returning additional value through dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Share repurchases are an effective way to offset share dilution, which we continue to believe is an appropriate use of cash. We also believe it remains important to consistently payout a portion of our earnings back for owners as dividend and then allow you to decide how best to invest that cash outlet.</p>
          <p>As Scarlett mentioned, the trajectory for ROC in 2008, 2009 is skewed by the round of gross profit expansions. For 2010, we anticipate a decline in ROC of some 900 basis points as the ROC uplifts from seeds and traits will not be able to offset the decline in gross profit contribution from around us.</p>
          <p>Going forward as Roundup stabilizes, we should reclaim the lost ground in ROC.</p>
          <p>In summary, our 2010 ongoing EPS guidance of 3.10 to 3.30 takes into account the new outlook for Roundup and the continued growth in seeds and traits. Our ability to deliver on this commitment will be a direct function of our ability to improve the farmer's return on his investment, to execute the delivery of new value on farm, to leverage our spending, but not starve our growth, and to deliver the cash results of the first three back for our owners.</p>
          <p>At this point, let me turn the call over to Hugh, for our outlook for 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot Carl, and good morning to everybody joining us on the call today. In November 2007, in an auditorium in St. Louis, not too far from here, we laid a path that translated growers adoption of our technologies worldwide. Intra-company growth plan that would allow us to double gross profit in five years. In another short month, we will revisit those plans with you in an auditorium in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, the home of our newest and I think our most exciting facility yet.</p>
          <p>We believe today as we did in the fall of 2007, that the growth of this company is directly correlated to the value of our seeds and traits on farm. As a result, we are holding prudes, our commitment of more than doubling total company gross profit in 2012 over by 2007 base as we show in Slide 17.</p>
          <p>Carl has outlined the cash consent efforts for 2010. As mentioned lately, growth rate in 2010 for seeds and traits dropped a tick from the last two years as we enter a completely new era of product launches. But the plans that would influencing in 2010 are critical as they have the sling shot that propels us through the milestones that we expect will deliver 20% CAGR on our seeds and traits business from 2007 through 2012.</p>
          <p>Many of the choices that define 2012 are being made today. A part of today's call, that open measure begins four core beliefs, one that our success is forever linked to the farmer's success. Two, that our commitments are only as good as our ability to deliver new value on farm. Three, that the gross has to be funded but prudently. And four, that the value that we create must be shared with our customers and with our owners.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 18, you can see that we're bridging 2.8 to $3 billion in gross profit in seeds and traits from 2009 to 2012. There are three buckets of roughly equal size that make up the components of this growth.</p>
          <p>First lets take a look them. First, is growth reduction of Roundup Ready 2 Yield and SmartStax and the associated market share growth as shown on slide 19.</p>
          <p>As provide the compelling recurrence that we believe these two technologies promise. We can see a path servicing some 65 to 75% of the market opportunity with seeds and traits and our brands or through our licensees in 2012.</p>
          <p>Second, our plans this year that we continue to advance yields in corn, soybeans and cotton through our breeding program and that heightened yield advantage is reflected in our financial performance and our market share.</p>
          <p>This will be the most difficult executional challenge as we face, re-energize competitors servicing different market segments with a multiplicity of pricing strategies and product offerings around the world. The height from the hearts and minds of growers has never been fearsome.</p>
          <p>As a result the necessity has never been greater to break through the bank loans &#x2013; and quarter. So that the farmers directly experience innovation and the means recurrence innovations will bring them on their farm.</p>
          <p>Carl has alluded to some of things that we are pursuing for our customers in 2010 and we'll be sharing more with you our November Investor Meeting.</p>
          <p>So, if we demonstrate the same level of growth returns on investments outside the U.S. as we have here, we believe that we can grow our international world crop business by another 70% by 2012.</p>
          <p>As we show on Slide 20, by 2012, growers in Brazil and Argentina will be experiencing the yield boost and on farm productivity to a double stack of Roundup and YieldGard Corn Borer provided this to U.S. growers for nearly decade as shown on slide 21.</p>
          <p>With some market share of 41% in Brazil and 49% in Argentina, the base of positive farm over tons from our germplasm borrowed stripes to be in the U.S launched the waves of innovation on farms here in the last ten years.</p>
          <p>As we tried to pass through 2012, we're entering a period of significant growth in our seeds and traits. We will invest for that growth as Carl referenced for 2010 but it will be prudent investment with SG&amp;A as a percent of sales in the mid to high teen and the R&amp;D as a percent of sales in that historical 10% range.</p>
          <p>On an absolute basis, our gross profit growth should be suspend. We'll benefit from that leverage but we won't sharp the tools that our sales people need to reach our customers nor will we sharp change the innovation investment needed to bring our budgeting pipeline to the farmer's field.</p>
          <p>This is repeated on slide 22, that we expect to launch roughly one new product every year for the next seven years and we'll ensure farmers to experience that value first hand with launch sizes that well out if it is anything that we saw in the first 10 years as a seeds and traits company.</p>
          <p>So, I would ramp up by reiterating our commitment that ROC should convert to operating cash and that we will continue to recover our value through a combination of investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.</p>
          <p>By the time that we complete 2012, we look the potential for ROC target in range of what we achieved in 2009. As we can do so, clearly based on the strength of our seeds and traits business, we being the top profile on an ROC basis of the companies in the S&amp;P 100 today.</p>
          <p>So in close, even as we reposition the business in 2010, we remain on track to deliver our commitment to more than double the gross profit that we delivered in 2007.</p>
          <p>This was an aggressive commitment when we made it two years ago; it's even more so getting the volatility on Roundup we managed across the life of this five year plant. Give us a value that is created by the innovation embedded on our seeds that drives this growth.</p>
          <p>As it was in 2007, as it is today and as it will be in 2012. The past from 2009 to 2012 is a challenging one but it's durable one. Success is now hands and it's up to us to execute against this customer focus strategy to deliver on these commitments. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Scarlet now for your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have a two part question. One is on corn and one is on soy. In the trait acres that you were kind enough to provide us, the U.S. YieldGard Cotton Borer trades go from about 42 million last year to 36 million this year versus 39 also in 2007. Can you talk about why that is? And secondly in soy, in your Ready 2 Yield soybeans, is that premium product priced at a premium to your key competitors Y series soybeans or is it priced equivalently to the Y series soybeans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff thanks for the two questions. I may be talk about beans and ask Carl to say a few words on corn. We priced our own Ready 2 Yield against the incremental yield that we deliver.</p>
          <p>So we're not pricing against competitor offerings. We're pricing against the new visuals that we deliver on farm and that's the deal that we have for the grower. And if we are successful in delivering those incremental visuals, then it's going to be a significant product. That's been our pricing philosophy. And then Carl on the YieldGard acres.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's a reflection of the fact that the Pioneer has been a licensee of our YieldGard trade, but they've also been converting the portfolio over to Herbicide. So that's basically a mirror trade as they've been substituting a YieldGard out of the portfolio for the Herbicide.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning PJ.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I hear your point about high returns the grower gets from SmartStax. But the growth is much less profitable this year according to many studies. So what are the implications of that on seed pricing on the existing portfolio for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we, so thanks for your question I may be starting off. Carl will make a few points as well. So I'd look at two ends of our portfolio, PJ, one end is --</p>
          <p>on 200 bushel per acre corn and a 10% yield improvement. And if you take last weeks corn price, its 3.5 bucks, that's 20 brand new bushels at $3.5 to $70 of value and that $70 of value hangs three acres in a bag more or less is $200 of brand new value.</p>
          <p>So, whether its last weeks prices $3.5 or today's price of $4, or the doom and gloom price of $1.95, there's a very positive economic return at that fag end of the portfolio. And then the other end, and let me ask Carl to talk you through this with some of our -- I always talked about race horse season and thoroughbreds and the other end there are -- seed offering this year for the first time. We're looking at work horse season. And may be, you can say a few words the work horse is current.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, a couple of quick points P.J. So, first of all, I understand the question, but if you think about producer regardless of whether corn is two bucks or four bucks, it's all about output, because they stand to benefit the business by minimizing costs per unit produced and the way you do that is to maximize output. So, it's a huge point.</p>
          <p>As long as we can demonstrate a fair and positive return on that incremental investment, that's a choice that increasingly the producer will make. And while there is no correlation overtime of the adoption of our technology, commodity price basically for that reason. But to the extent that farmers want a broader choice of price points across the portfolio.</p>
          <p>As Hugh pointed out, we're providing that for 2010. So, if a farmer wants a proven hybrid or work horse that they've had on their farm before, they have the option to buy that basically, at the same reward price then they did in 2009. And at the other end of the spectrum, if they want the absolute highest yielding potential that the SmartStax hybrid represents, they can make that choice as well.</p>
          <p>So, we'll provide broader choice across our entire portfolio, so our customers don't have to seek that choice in a competitive platform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just to clarify, so 8 to 10% price increase that you had announced? That's a combination of, all of these products put together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, P.J. that's all in blended price across the portfolio and that pricing is reflected in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just add to that, the work horse seeds would be flat priced, year-on-year. So, we've introduced that concept this year for the first time and that concept is also baked in our guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions on soybeans. You'd indicated in the press release that you saw higher than expected returns in soybeans and I see the American Seed shares slipped a little bit, I was just wondering if you could comment on whether those are related or independent.</p>
          <p>And then looking ahead to next year, what would your expectation for share be given the higher acreage for Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we anticipate in this coming year, our ambition is a one -- two point share increase and we see Roundup, Ready 2 Yield carry in a fair piece of the wallet and if we're successful in delivering these yield increments. So that change is the slope for the curve, I think Kevin, and may be Carl, any comments on your side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think it was just within in the competitive range Kevin. And I think as you said, we would expect to grow across the portfolio, one to two points this year. Relative to the second part of your question around the return rate on beans, that was definitely an anomaly and what happened was given the nature of the year, farmers literally didn't know, they wanted to plant corn, but didn't know if they'd be able to, so they double ordered for corn and beans to ensure that if they couldn't get their corn in, at least they'd be able to secure the bean varieties, that they wanted to. And so, they did get corn in albeit late. Which then allowed the beans to come back and that's what increased the return rate year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A quick follow up if I may on Argentina. Your main competitor, I think outlined a weak or two ago, some pretty ambitious expectations for share gains there. You've shown this morning you expect a 3% increase in corn, in Argentina, this year. Can you comment on what is driving that with -- who might be losing share with these large gains. And what you would expect for the next season there please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think piece in Argentina has going to be head-to-head between the two companies Kevin. And we feel pretty good about our technology line up there, we've been using Double Stack up, we'll see how it goes.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning gentlemen and to Scarlett. The -- Carl you mentioned your outlook for the various quarters of fiscal 2010 and obviously the first quarter materially down year-over-year. Is that predominately coming from the Roundup area and what has been the reaction of farmers to your lowering the price of Roundup? Are you seeing the expected volume pick up that you would have anticipated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your assumption Frank was right. Virtually, the total decline is related to the Roundup business or say conversely the big spike that we saw last few years was the run up on Roundup.</p>
          <p>And if you think about first quarter 2009, that would have been the high watermark for basically Roundup and it began to decline from there slight to basic we are coming off of. Relative to how farmers receiving the price, it's being received well but the season is just getting going.</p>
          <p>So we're just starting the selling process in Latin America and a little bit North America but it's really OES.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning just wanted to touch on your philosophy on pricing once more. As you think about if market shares starts to shift against you, how do you weigh the disciplined approach on pricing against adverse market share shift? And at what point would you adjust your market share but your pricing strategy to reflect that the grower's field are not getting the value from the corn that you think you're getting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, it's a big question and we won't spend quite a bit time in November talking about, that's some of the additional probes that we're looking next year. If you look at it simplistically, I think what we're seeing is, the margins of customers that have tried our technology, who are loyal supporters and who embrace the technology because of the &#x2013; we see and that is one group. And then there is another group who will have still to try and are still on their edges. And I think our job as you look at 10, 11 and 12 and I tell when we talk about 10, we talk about 10, 11, 12 its all on the same sense for us. Because I think what we need to do intend is we need to drive adoption with our second group.</p>
          <p>And we need to let them enjoy the benefits of the first group have in that. That's for your point I think there less price of philosophy is more than a chance to participate and the technology I don't know if you want to add for that Carl.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah you have to have a balanced approach to it because if you think about our existing customer base, those by the we're at 70% last triples year we'll be at 75 this year, which is bumping right up against the 80% max as they can plan on farm. And that's why we're so bullish on SmartStax because clearly there is demand for our existing customers, to plan a more valuable product and upgrading that base from more valuable products that provides immediate margin list for the business and quite frankly the greatest driver of near term growth.</p>
          <p>That said, you've got to continue to acquire new customers, so, you can continue that growth trend and increasingly with our share growth over the last few years, we're getting in to the loyal customers, of our leading competitor and we have to get that travel &#x2013; to continue to secure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from Don Carson of UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Question on slide six on your U.S. corns, I know at one point you had expected the -- to be up, almost two and ASI up one and might as we're saying as -- licensees slipped to bit two. What do you attribute the lower than expected gains in market share to, is it a performance issue or distribution issue and I know you are going to have SmartStax next year and the next few years that will help it on market share.</p>
          <p>But I'm wondering is your -- I know in the past, you've expressed the goal of a 45% U.S. corn seed share by 2012, is that still a valid share target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Don thanks for your question. I think I actually that the question leads more on as to how do you feel the '10 and how did '09 go, I think it may be our lease -- let me interpret in that way. So, I'm disappointed in '09, because our goal was one, two share points of growth and that's our stated goal for this coming year. But I think early on in '09, we laid out a triangle and said we were going to optimize not just our share, but we were going to look at penetration of technology that Carl talked about the ramp that we saw in triples. And I feel very good about and also about our pricing, and increased pricing 25% to reflect the value that we were delivered on farm.</p>
          <p>So, whereas we didn't grow share, we had very strong pricing success and spectacular technology penetration success inside our brands.</p>
          <p>So as I look at 10 and maybe I'll ask Carl to say a few words on this, why do I think 10 is different? If you look at 10 or 11 and 12, the new technologies that we're bringing are under Ready 2 Yield and soybeans, SmartStax and cotton. I think represent a competitive fracture point because they are going to lift about one more time in terms of performance that we deliver on farm regardless of commodity prices. And that distances us from competition.</p>
          <p>The competition has been ferocious this year and we've seen a lot of price discount and the same one other point to those, we calculated divisionalisation and we've talked about -- point of view of setting our Roundup business to Carl's point when he talked about restructuring, we refocus onto an even greater level of focus on our sales team and our seed business is and I think that's the of what we've done from a divisionalization point of view and then the last one is again Carl's point on these cover breads. So we've introduced the concept for 5 to 10% of hybrid line off. We were flat priced in those farmers don't want to look at the technology or taken a slower approach in adopting it.</p>
          <p>We've got a bunch of cover breads and that they can wrap cover breads for the 2010 season and that's why I think 10 is going to have a different field than 9 and Carl if -.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you pointed out, I mean SmartStax is a binary trader event. I mean it's no longer my triple is better than your triple. You do have 5% refuge or you don't. And we do think that, that's a game changer in getting farmers experience with that trade. We think can help reinvigorate our share growth again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carl, do you think it's a distribution issue at all, I mean DEKALB, run through dealers, ASI is largely directing and your competitors revamped your direct to grow our sales force. Do you see any disadvantages, or you're rethinking that the DEKALB distribution approach?</p>

          <p>Yeah Don, as we talked before, every distribution channel has benefits and has short comings. The benefit we gained from the DEKALB is the broadest distribution coverage, but it is a non-exclusive channel, I mean we have to get their hearts and minds focused on seed as opposed to say fertilizers and other things.</p>
          <p>And that's one of the reasons why we refocused our organization, so that, when you're working with those dealers, you're doing nothing other than talking about seed, you get them energized to go to farm. The other thing is to is, we do have our direct ASI channel for the marketplace and that is served us very well and as we've talked about, before the limitation of a single channel of the market place is, it limits your ability to capture share on farm. We've done a research and it's been well documented. I mean it's about how we multiple channels. We can been actually compete for a higher share of farm. So that said, we like our DEKALB channel, what we have to do is when you are coming to the market with this many game changing technologies over this time period. We really have to help our channel and our own sales people get up to seed on communicating this value to the farm. But, that's a challenge we've got regardless of channel.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bob Koort of the Goldman Sachs Group Incorporated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let me follow-up to that Carl. You guys had advertised going into the 2009 season having a nein or 10% yield advantage into DEKALB and we did see some static market share. I recognized revenue deduction is key, but it seems like SmartStax is a similar yield benefit, so why would not run in some of the same competitive pressure or at least for license from the farmers maybe to adopt a higher price point technology. And then secondly around SmartStax, it seems may be you've hit a wall here in terms of adopters of technology or at least in the short run. And I think your goal on SmartStax is basically double what you're selling in triples today.</p>
          <p>So, can you give me a timeframe on when you might get to that goal or what is it that you can push those guys over the edge that want to buy the workhorse and don't want to buy the novel technology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So again the first differentiation or the suggestion that I'd make is our existing customer base in potential new customers. Within our existing customer base, those if you think about the DEKALB, those are farmers that place absolute premium on yields. And in that environment, our existing customers bought more higher valuable products from us in 2009 at a 25% higher price than they did a year before. Because they get the value of our technologies provide to them because they've seen it.</p>
          <p>And so as we think about the growth of our franchise, we have to acquire new customers because at some point in time, you're going to maximize your penetration, your existing customer base and not only your penetration but of your most valuable products, since we have to acquire new customers and basically sell them, sell them those new products as well.</p>
          <p>The thing about SmartStax is, we've said that the market opportunity is 60 million acres of potential, which is what we'll compete for, but increasingly again, it's going to be showing non-DEKALB, non-American Seeds customers. The value of the SmartStax can bring them on farm, versus the alternative Double or Triple that they're planning today. I mean that's going to be the task, and again, that's why we've refocused our sales organization to get after that task.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to enquire. What the impact Brazilian farmer profitability, you'll have on your -- the soybean margins? I think there is expectations for record crop next year and seems like farmers are already kind of struggling with profitability this year at current prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, I think that that's the operating environment in Brazil, pretty continually, I think the biggest impact that it has is it contains the extension of the planted acreage down this is generally what we see happens. But from a pricing standpoint, within our Brazilian bean business, we really don't see this current economic environment having an adverse effect on us.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carl, may be you could walk us through temporarily give some winter production cost this year on both corn and soy related to SmartStax and Roundup too.</p>
          <p>It might be helpful, if you could put some dollar figures around that. It will help us understand how much would recur on a go forward basis and if that's something we should anticipate as you commercialize all the new products in the pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I'll start Vincent and then perhaps turn it over Hugh for some thoughts as well. Kind of in reverse order, this is what we would expect to see, as we continue to bring things like De Ruiter forward.</p>
          <p>If you think about our customer base that places an absolute premium on yield, our commitment to them is to get them these high yielding products as quickly as we possibly can. When we do that, we create more value for them.</p>
          <p>We can share in that value and of course that ultimately creates value for our owners and so, I kind of think about it as an investment to pull that MPV curve forward and it's one that -- it just makes me kind of sense and I think that we'll continue to replicate as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was just going to reiterate the De Ruiter. So, I think it took people by surprise this year on the magnitude that one of production and the impact of that.</p>
          <p>We spent a lot of time to talking about it. That's why '10 is slingshot year because the conventional way of doing this is you would spread it over two years.</p>
          <p>We plant a little bit in '10 and then with a little bit more in '11 and we go prime time in '12. So we are taking that cost. The farmer doesn't see that cost penalty. So we still deliver SmartStax on farm.</p>
          <p>We eat that cost of sales, but the competition sees that penalty because, they face a wall at very early stage. So by accelerating production and doing that when at a piece that really increases the competitors separation but as it is a little bit ahead had one this year. I think to the future, you shouldn't judge it today, but if go on to 2012, 2013 and drought continues to perform the way we're seeing it in trials this year. I would guess, we'd be making that call one more time.</p>
          <p>So I don't think this is episodic, I think, we'll build a link to, I think as you look forward, we'll continue to do this where we see this kind of magnitude of performance get up and we'll deliver them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Vince, in order of magnitude, if you look upon -- on like a unit of corn, our winter production is about twice as expensive as producing domestically. So, it's really expensive and on beans it's even more punitive, because if you think about putting a bag on an airplane and flying it home, the plane doesn't care whether it's hauling beans, a unit, a quarter, per acre or basically a unit of corn that plants 2.5 acres.</p>
          <p>And so that's why, it doesn't take a lot of units of winter production beans to have a really extraordinary impact on the cause line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess may just as a follow up. Can you give us any sense of, sort of, from a, how much quicker relative to prior trade launches, you could be sort of no longer profession constrained because of this choice to having to do two years of winter production in one year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of ways to think about it, is we've said it from standing start to no biological constraints, it's plus or minus four years, but relative to the ramp up that we're doing on SmartStax right now. A good way to think about it, is due in three years, we'll have as many acres of SmartStax as we had Triple's last years. And so, we're actually ramping that up pretty quickly and that's intuitive because that's immediate 15% expansion on your existing customer base, creates that opportunity pretty quickly for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And do you mind just, give us a correct sense of what that would be for Roundup too, as well in year three.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably the same, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's the key on why this is a slingshot year, because we nail this in '10, it puts us in such a great position in '11 and '12.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. If I look at -- I think it's Slide 14 here, you -- it looks like there is a much larger reduction in SG&amp;A on the seeds and genomic side than there is an the Ag productivity side. And can you just flush that out, a little bit please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I head the call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yeah, a large portion and so, if you take a step back and look what we did across the enterprise, dramatic reductions in direct SG&amp;A in our Roundup division besides that to what it's going to be going forward.</p>
          <p>A tremendous amount of portfolio cleanup in the seeds -- our vegetable seed business. And then, corporate restructuring as well, so we will call supporting functions. Now, that was all that the worker heavy lifting that was done and then when we turn around and we got the appropriate allocations back to the businesses.</p>
          <p>We used to be 50-50 of our overhead allocated to our seeds and traits and our Roundup division. It's now 80-20 to the seeds and traits, side of the business. And so that's why it's just proportionally benefiting from the work that we've just done.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two parts; Hugh, I wasn't clear on one of your answers. Were you implying that, it was the pricing that lead to some disappointing market share in corn, meaning flat. And, how has your market share been doing in the holding's foundation seed area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'll let Carl say a few words and hold them. But I -- we are used to finding things open the dust samples at the end of this year, looking back at nine, the weird front of nine, for I think all companies as we all ended up about last. There wasn't really much shift between companies.</p>
          <p>Your second question on holdings, I think the shift that we saw is where our licensees had been acquired or rented. But in terms of real organic growth, the industry was flat across the board this year.</p>
          <p>So in a world of flatness, I feel really good, because we priced to the value that we deliver and that was a tough call, but it was the right thing to do given the technologies that have come inline. And we increased our technology penetration in a difficult market.</p>
          <p>But I think if you, and it's always hard to do this, because the day has never really lead up, but if you look across the board this year. I think you'll see a world of flat share, pretty much across the competing companies. And then Carl on Holdmans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Relative to Holdmans, I mean, one of our competitors introduced a pro-access offering for that channel. Some of them have been acquired, as well. So that channel's been contracting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what's your share there, roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably just below 20%. Now, once you subtract that out this company that have been border those companies to choose to join a pro-access channel.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Hugh, on page 18, you talked about how the 3 billion increase in gross profit for seeds and genomics, is in kind of three buckets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You addressed two of those buckets, but you didn't address the third one, which I think is other row crops. It seems like a pretty ambitious goal to get $1 billion extra in gross profit from that bottom slice of the part, could you talk about that a bit please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah it's Casale, our germplasm improvements are on better than the year, and it's the funny piece because we, we're spending $0.50 to $1 on biotech and that gives us all the AF time and there's about $0.50 to $1 goes in our breeding. And our breeding is kind of a slipper because, breeding keep improving every year and if you look at it, real rough numbers than the U.S. business, how it gets, we see a problem and our entire germplasm every 4 or 5 years.</p>
          <p>So, the line of the hybrids that we have today, will be completely absolutely in the next 4 or 5 seasons and as we continue to drive that germplasm improvement to that $0.50 investment, we're seeing increased performance on farm when we place to the volume line increased performance and that bucket and I think, you're right, its an untold story and that's one that never gets much</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thanks very much and I think what we are few minutes over twelve. I will run up and I'll wrap beginning by thanking you for your questions this morning. I guess in my closure, I'd go back and underscore the four points that we've made several times today. One, that our success is absolutely linked in the farmer's success. Two, our commitments are only as good as our ability to deliver new value on farm and that's how it will be measured. Three, our growth has to be funded but it will be funded presently and four, that the value that we create has to be shared with the farmer customers worldwide and with our owners. So in a short month's time, we will be meeting with many of you in North Carolina and will lay out our plans at that time through 2012 with a peak into the middle of the next decade.</p>
          <p>We believe today as we did in the forward 2007 that the growth in this company is an absolutely directly correlated to the value of our seeds and traits on farm. So, we look forward to have new joiners as we reiterate our commitment of more than doubling the total company gross profit over in 12 over the 2007 base.</p>
          <p>So, let me close by a thanking you today for your time, your support and your participation. Thank you.</p>
