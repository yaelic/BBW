          <p>Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call of Bayer AG for Investors and Analysts on the 29 of October 2008. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Kirsten. Good afternoon everybody, and welcome also, on behalf of my colleagues, to our call. During this call, we will review our Q3 financial results that were released earlier today. With us on the call today are our CEO, Werner Wenning; our CFO, Klaus K&#xFC;hn; and the CEOs from our subgroups, Arthur Higgins from HealthCare; Friedrich Berschauer from CropScience; and Patrick Thomas from MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Mr. Wenning for his presentation, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking wording which governs our call. Thank you. Mr. Wenning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen good afternoon and may I also welcome you to our telephone conference. Since our last conference call, and even, since we last told some of you, at our "Meet Management" conference at the end of September, the world around us has changed quite a lot. The crisis on the capital markets has depressed stocks the world over, and unfortunately, Bayer has been no exception. That is obviously a matter of great regret to us, and on behalf of the entire Board, I would like to thank you all, our investors, for their continued confidence in Bayer. Of course, nobody is in a position to make firm predictions as to the effects of the financial crises will continue to have in the coming weeks and months, but I am sure, the general uncertainty will continue. In this situation, the main purpose of our conference call today is to give you as much confidence as possible as far as Bayer is concerned. So, we have broken with the tradition and given you financial guidance for 2009 straight away, along with the Q3 results. We believe it's quite confident guidance, and we also believe that our confidence is well founded.</p>
          <p>Our HealthCare and CropScience businesses continue to perform strongly. HealthCare experienced its best quarter, in terms of sales, since the acquisition of Schering, and CropScience generated the highest third quarter sales during the last five years. Despite mounting cyclical pressure at MaterialScience, Bayer continued on the successful path of growth in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We are confirming our previous guidance for the full year 2008, despite the difficult environment. We are confident that we can continue to improve underlying EBITDA in 2009. Of course, we remain committed and do not give up on our 22% EBITDA margin target for 2009. But, we have to remain cautious in these times of uncertainty and watch and next months with care.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we are in good financial health, and we have no need of any refinancing at the present time. The fundamental drivers from our life science businesses are intact, and our innovation pipeline holds significant promise. We confirm our dividend policy, and are planning to pay out between 30 and 40% of core earnings per share, as dividend. Or, to put it in a nutshell, we are in really good shape and well able to master the challenges facing us.</p>
          <p>Let's now briefly review our Q3 numbers. The changes we'll be talking about are all adjusted for portfolio and currency effects unless I say otherwise. In the quarter, we generated sales of &#x20AC;2.7 billion that translates to an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Higher selling prices and higher volumes contributed roughly 2.5% each to the increase. Underlying EBITDA declined by 4%, mainly due to higher raw material costs and negative currency effects. These two effects together accounted for approximately &#x20AC;340 million in the quarter. In other words, with last year's exchange rates, we would have comfortably exceeded 2007 earnings level.</p>
          <p>Core earnings per share advanced 5% to $00.85. The performance of our subgroups was mixed in the quarter. HealthCare experienced its strongest quarter, in terms of sales, since the acquisition of Schering. Overall, sales grew by 6%. The increase was driven by both the Pharma and the Consumer Health businesses. Our key products recorded a strong performance, the YAZ family of products advanced 15%, driven by strong growth in Europe and higher sales in the U.S. despite, generic competition of Yasmin in the U.S. Mirena sales grew 17%. Overall, our women's health business advanced almost 11%. With YAZ now being launched in Europe, the approval of Qlaira in Europe and our excellent life cycle opportunities, we remain confident for continued growth of this franchise.</p>
          <p>Betaferon and Kogenate sales were both up 15%, and Nexavar continued its strong growth with sales up 63%. Our Consumer business also reported a strong quarter with OTC plus 5, Diabetes Care up 11 and Animal Health up 8%. The majority of our key brands showed a very strong performance, helped by price increases, that were implemented towards the end of the quarter. Underlying EBITDA of HealthCare gained almost 7% on higher sales and realized synergies. These two factors, more than compensated for currency effect, and the investments we made in marketing and sales, to prepare for the launches of Xarelto and YAZ in Europe, and drive our business in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2008, we continue to expect all divisions to grow with or above the market, after adjusting for currency changes. We aim to improve our EBITDA margin before special items toward 27%.</p>
          <p>Our CropScience business remains on track for record performance this year. Sales advanced by 14% in the quarter, driven by higher volumes and higher prices. Selling prices increased 5% in the period. We are particularly pleased that our new products continue to perform strongly. During the first nine months, new products sales advanced by almost 44%, driving profitability and mix improvements. In Crop Protection, the strongest growth in the quarter was achieved in Latin America, where business was up 37%. Sales in Brazil increased by 53%.</p>
          <p>Our North American business expanded by 17%, driven by herbicides. In Asia/Pacific, sales rose 16%. Sales in Europe were only slightly higher, due to a low start to the autumn season. The Bio Science business also showed an encouraging improvement, with sales up 21% driven by our cotton and vegetable seeds.  Environmental Science recorded an increase of 7%.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA of CropScience advanced by 24% to 207 million, boosted by higher volumes and higher prices which overcompensated negative effect from currencies.  We expect the generally positive market environment for our CropScience business to continue in the fourth quarter. Against this background, we continue to believe that we can increase sales by well over 10% on a currency and portfolio adjusted basis and improve the EBITDA margin before special items to about 25%.</p>
          <p>Business definitely became tougher towards the middle of the third quarter at Bayer MaterialScience, the situation being aggravated by shortfalls due to the ban on shipments in China, around the Olympics and temporary shutdowns at our plants in Texas after Hurricane Ike.  Overall, sales are basically flat year-on-year.  5% lower volumes were more or less compensated by higher selling prices.  Underlying EBITDA of the subgroup of 255 million, significantly short of expectations.  The business was hit by roughly 230 million in higher raw material cost which we couldn't compensate through higher prices.  The transport ban in China and the hurricane in Texas weren't particularly helpful to earnings either.</p>
          <p>Volume declines, due to softer demand from key customer industry, also had the impact.  We currently don't foresee any short-term improvement here. On the contrary, very significant further downside risks.  We thus believe the subgroup's earnings will continue to decline in Q4 compared to the third quarter, and therefore expect EBITDA, before special items for the full year 2008, to come in well below the 2007 figure.  However, we anticipate that we will again achieve a good, value-creating earnings level.</p>
          <p>We continue to capture strong growth in the emerging markets.  In the so-called BRIC countries, we expanded our business by 15% to 1.1 billion.  It is worth noting that we became the number one international healthcare company in China, growing at more than 40% in the quarter.  Declining CropScience and weaker MaterialScience sales, meant business in China, increased only slightly overall.</p>
          <p>MaterialScience business was affected by a slow recovery of the Chinese market after the Olympics, and CropScience at the low price pressure in rise.</p>
          <p>Gross cash flow in the third quarter was slightly above the prior year period, at nearly &#x20AC;1.2 billion.  However, net cash flow declined by 24% due to a smaller decline in working capital than in the prior year quarter.  This is an unsatisfactory development and corrective action is underway.  Net debt was 13.7 billion at the end of September, up 0.4 billion from the previous quarter.  The appreciation of our major financing policies had an effect of around &#x20AC;500 million and at positions about 400 million.</p>
          <p>The Group balance sheet is healthy and we are fortunate enough not to have short-term refinancing needs.  In the first half of 2009, we have two maturing bonds totaling 2.1 billion which we intend to pay down from our free operating cash flow.  The convertible bond of 2.3 billion, which also matures in 2009, does not have to be refinanced because it will be redeemed in shares.</p>
          <p>Pre-M&amp;A activity, we thus expect net debt to be down significantly towards the end of 2009.  A syndicated credit facility in the amount of 3.2 billion serves as backup for commercial paper program as well as for general corporate purposes.  This facility matures in March 2012 and is currently undrawn.  Our commercial paper program is also unused at the moment.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the performance generated through the first nine months allows us to confirm our 2008 outlook.  We are targeting sales growth of more than 5% to approximately 33 billion, higher underlying EBITDA and improved margins.  In light of the portfolio realignment carried out in recent years, we are confident about the Group's future development.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we confirm our target of an EBITDA margin before special items for HealthCare and CropScience in the region of 28% and 25% respectively.  We expect MaterialScience to report lower EBITDA before special items than in 2008.  However, for the Bayer Group as a whole, we plan a further improvement in EBIDTA before special items.  We hope that with this outlook we are able to provide some confidence in the continued upward trends at Bayer.  We will of course narrow our 2009 guidance when we publish our 2008 annual report.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Now, we will be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you ladies and gentlemen.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Sachin Jain of Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  Thanks for taking my questions.  Three questions. The first one is just on FX. Some of your '09 margin targets have been in place for a while and we've seen significant FX moves in that time.  Just wondered if you could let us know what FX rates those targets are based on and whether, and to what extent, spot represents upside first targets?  And second question next, I was just wondering on update on uptake in liver cancer and in particular any differences you are seeing in the U.S. versus rest of the world in uptake in the different sales trajectories in the territories?  And then the final question just on net debt. Given where you are at this stage, I just wondering if you could update us on the targets for the year end. I think, in the second quarter, you said below 12.2. Just wondering whether that was still possible?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank very much for your question.  The first and second question in regard to currency and net debt will be answered by Klaus K&#xFC;hn and the second question takes Arthur Higgins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sachin, your first question relating to the tax rates.  We are currently estimating that our vested rate for 2009 and that's our current, let's say simulation's based on, will be 145, although you know it's quite fluctuating.  The dollar, by the way, amounts for roughly 50% of our overall exposure.  With regard to the sensitivities, we provided that there's some sensitivities for one quarter, for Q4. And with that, basically, on a quarterly basis, 1% change in the basket would mean roughly &#x20AC;50 million in sales and roughly &#x20AC;15 million in clean EBITDA.  So that provides you with some sensitivity for the quarter, so you might let's say extrapolate that a little bit for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net debt.  It is &#x2013; we are currently, we closed the quarter at 13.7.  I think there is some uncertainty about the net debt at the end.  What I can tell you is that we anticipate that our free operating cash flow, we are working that that will be above the free operating cash flow of Q4.  On top of that, but we have to recognize that that includes &#x2013; that we will include our working capital to some degree, but you have to recognize on top that roughly we will spend 300 million in cash injection in our pension plans.  That is one aspect which I mentioned also I think at the last quarterly meeting.  And then we have to take into account the uncertainty about the currencies, because we have, as we should have it, we have some financing in main currencies like U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and renminbi and here you can assume that roughly 1% interchange of these three currencies affects the net debt position roughly by &#x20AC;60 million, six-zero million Euros.  Was that roughly what you asked for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's perfect, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin regarding Nexavar we are clearly very pleased with the strong performance in HCC liver cancer both in the U.S. and globally.  If you look, however, at our performance in the U.S., it's a little behind global performance and we have measures in place.  Overall, Nexavar is doing very well in HCC and as you know we have a clear window of opportunity as the only approved therapy for liver cancer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Paul Mann of Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, just a couple of questions.  You mentioned that your costs in MaterialScience have been affected by &#x20AC;230 million due to &#x2013; I'm guessing the benzene and oil prices which peaked during the summer.  If you were to have used spot rates for those costs, what sort of effect would you have &#x2013; what sort of effect would you have witnessed then, given the prices have come back quite significantly since then?  And second is on Xarelto, perhaps you could just comment on any initial market trends in the developing &#x2013; in regions where you've launched it, that would be useful. And also an update on U.S. approval process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start with MaterialScience, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the question is a good one Paul, because, of course when raw material prices are rising we always win on the contract prices, when they're falling we tend to lose.  If you look across the cycle, of course, on average these contract prices pretty much average and trend the spot prices.  Your question was more particularly directed at quarter three.  During quarter three, we saw no significant reduction in any of the main raw materials that we are consuming.  And just to give you an idea of the break back of that 230 million taken, let's say at a full year rate; the full year effective will be approximately &#x20AC;550 million.  Propylene oxide is round about 200 of that, 100 of it is in energy and about 250 in aromatics which includes benzene and toluene.  So, you can see that it's not just an aromatic story that accounts just over or just under half of the total.  And what we are seeing quarter-on-quarter is that in quarter four we will see the first part of release coming in as the spot prices have dropped during October, that will give us contract price reductions properly around about November and they will find their way through to the EBITDA in quarter one next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then Xarelto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul.  We have now launched in main markets, the key markets, probably key markets in Canada, Germany, and the U.K., but it's very early days Paul to get specific, but I will tell you the anecdotal feedback is very good.  However, again I would like to remind everybody that this is not a major indication for Xarelto.  The importance clearly in prevention is establishing the foundation which we believe will give us a leadership position in the chronic indication.  So, answer to the point, initial feedback is excellent.</p>
          <p>Regarding the approval status in the U.S., no surprise if you have Paul, I think everybody was probably aware that we weren't going to get priority review in the U.S.  I think that's very consistent with the current environment that exists with the FDA.  We will have an outcome again to be expected another surprise and that will take place in March of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  And perhaps just one extra question, following on from the currency question earlier, is there any reason why we shouldn't expect the trends we saw in 2008 to follow through into 2009 if rates were to move back to say the 2006 levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in general, but I have to admit I don't have any, I mean it depends also a little bit on the underlying exposure, all that might change.  So if we have changes in volume and so on and input prices, that changes the net exposures we have.  So there is some uncertainty in that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Our next question comes from Richard Vosser of JP Morgan.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks for taking my question, it's Richard Vosser here from JP Morgan.  One question on the HealthCare trends in spending and specifically the R&amp;D budget left to be spent this year and fourth quarter.  Last year there was a significant drop off in pharma profitability in the fourth quarter.  Really trying to get a handle on whether we should expect a similar drop off in underlying profitability this year?  And second question is on Yasmin, I just wondered if you could comment on whether there was significant stockings for Yasmin's launch or rather the YAZ's launch in Europe in the numbers for the third quarter and whether you could give us a breakdown of the YAZ and Yasmin in the U.S.?  And then thirdly just on Kogenate just to look at the timing of shipments to CSL and whether the &#x2013; the numbers are getting quite lumpy across the quarters and I was just wondering whether the third quarter had significant shipments to CSL and what we might expect for the fourth quarter?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  All three questions are directed to HealthCare, Arthur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Richard in terms of our spending &#x2013; let me again just remind everybody that we traditionally have heavier spending in the fourth quarter, but that's traditionally and that's very much inline with other competitors that we face in the marketplace.  That's more traditionally in our consumer business.  However, this year we will experience some additional expenses in respect to the further rollout of Xarelto and the continued rollout of YAZ, but, overall, for our pharmaceutical business in answer to your question, I would see improvement probably quarter-over-quarter in underlying profitability in our pharma business in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Yasmin, let's take the easier question first.  I think very limited stocking effect in YAZ in Europe &#x2013; in the rollouts and in Europe.  And let me &#x2013; your question then related to the split of the Yasmin family in the third quarter of our total sales of 308 million, 130 million of those came from the U.S.  That's for the Yasmin family which includes Yasmin, YAZ and Yasminelle.</p>
          <p>On your question about the lumpiness of Kogenate, we have limited ability to influence when CSL decides to order product from us. I think the most important thing Richard is that we remain obviously very much in our guidance for the full year, which was 8 to 10% growth for the Kogenate family, which is Kogenate plus CSL.  I realize that this is not ideal but again they order what they feel they need and we have no say as to when those orders are placed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so, sorry to just clarify, you said 10% growth for the full year that's in constant currency?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Hello, hi, thanks for taking the questions.  One on CropScience and one on MaterialScience please.  CropScience obviously another strong number, but one weak spot was Europe. I just wonder if you could comment exactly what's going on there, you said a slow start I wonder if you could elaborate on that?  Thanks.  Second question on MaterialScience is really on cost and/or capacity. Obviously you are pretty proactive anyway with your 300 million program, what can you do as it looks as though it is highly likely now demand gets worse before it gets better. What are the remedial actions you can put in place?  Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>CropScience we have a slow start into the season. Here we are talking about the herbicide season, which is a very important business for us in Europe.  And if you know the better situation for example in Europe &#x2013; U.K. it was very, very late harvest of the cereals and the weather conditions for applying insecticide has been lousy so far, so it's the only reason.  Overall we are, there are no fundamental changes in the business in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew your questions really about contingency measures, a lot of those already in place as you might expect.  We're looking at accelerating the 300 million program and certainly to-date we are on track to do slightly better than that this year.  I think the target is 140 million for this year and we expect to be slightly ahead of that.</p>
          <p>On the polycarbonates business we put the business into a cash optimization mode rather than driving the EBITDA. And that means there are some fairly significant initiative taking place in working capital, although I appreciate that can have a negative impact on EBITDA because of fixed cost coming out of the stock.  But generally we believe it's the right thing for the team to be motivated by a cash improvement program rather than chasing after breakeven margins.  And the final thing we've been looking at. Particularly in polycarbonates, is capacity optimization. And we have been mothballing and idling some of our units around the world to try and balance slightly better supply and demand as we see it, given the relatively flat conditions in the potential for worsening positions.  We have contingency plans in place for capacity optimization for next year if demand slides further. And we also currently have a total freeze on any business travel that relates to not visiting customers and all the traditional freezes on not using external resources and so on.  So, cost optimization, cash optimization in polycarbonates particularly and then capacity optimization around the whole business.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I add one comment, Andrew of course we are discussing with not only BMS, we are discussing with all type of groups about possible contingent measures, contingency measures for next year.  So, but what I said during my presentation, first of all we would stick to our targets of course. And secondly we would like to watch a little bit what will happen over the next couple of weeks and months.  But contingency and to have a contingency plan, that's prepared. It's a challenge not only for BMS; it's a challenge for the whole Bayer team.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon from London, I've got three questions as well.  Starting with Betaseron, 15.2% growth in the quarter, 15.6 for nine months, you've been telling us we should go back to the 7 to 9%.  Could you just split against may be between volume and price and again the trends U.S. outside Europe, and why it is not slowing down?  And could you also quantify the help from the markup &#x2013; the absence of a markup to Novartis Cairo that I think has kicked in this quarter.  If you could give us an &#x2013; dimensionalize the magnitude of how that had helped the margin?  That's the first block.</p>
          <p>And the second question coming back to Andrew's CropScience question. You had 5% price increase I think across Crop Protection; you had 1% growth in Europe.  Can we therefore conclude that volumes were down 4% and next to the weather and late harvest situation how are the price negotiations going with the French distributors? Are they resisting the price increases or are they going through?  That's the second question.</p>
          <p>The third question is a financial one, the depreciation and amortization for the quarter of 602 million compares to a run rate 650 for the first half.  Just wondering why it was so unusually low and if you could split out the purchase amortization from the Schering acquisition for the quarter, that would be helpful?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with Betaseron Arthur and then CropScience, Europe and volumes and France.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all Thomas thanks for pointing out the very pleasing performance of Betaseron in the quarter and for reminding me that my full year guidance was a little cautious.  Clearly, we are going to do better than the guidance we had for the year for Betaseron of 7 to 9%, probably more in the range of 10 to 12%.  Looking at the impact of pricing, basically the way to look at that Thomas is that we're really only getting effective price increases in the U.S.  The U.S. accounts for about a third of our market.  The U.S. is growing 15%.  The rest of the world is growing 15%.  You can assume that basically all of the growth in the U.S. is coming from price and we're getting very little growth from price outside of the U.S.  So, I hope that's helpful.  Regarding Novartis, the royalties do not change until October.  So, there was no impact on the third quarter in respect to just royalties to Novartis.  We will enjoy that benefit in the fourth quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in CropScience. CropScience again the European business seems to have all decided again just revisit related fundamental personal change.  The operations in terms of price increases, during our call last quarter I talked about our negotiation with our French organization, with our customers because we <mark type="inaudible" />.  We are targeting price increases in France for the month or so in the range of 3, more 5%. And we are now in the end phase of this negotiation and we are confident that we can implement these price increases.  This is of key importance because the prices in France will set the tone of course for the price level in Europe next year.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Thomas, the reason why we had some lower amortization in the third quarter was what you already mentioned in the investor brief, that we had the amortization adjustment of 30 million with regard to the YAZ product family, which was taken in the first quarter was reversed.  So, that has no EBITDA in fact but has reduced the overall amortization in the third quarter.  And for the fourth quarter we expect again let's say an amortization rate here in the range at about 230, may be to 240 million from the Schering acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  First question again on the currencies, but specifically on CropScience, could you elaborate a little bit about the Brazilian Real and whether this is impacting your business or all of your business in Brazil is based on U.S. dollar?  And then on MaterialScience I've heard that the TDI market becomes soft basically everywhere in Europe, the U.S. and in Asia and there is also in Asia a rapid decline in prices.  Could you comment on this, because as far as I know it is the highest margin probably you have in polyurethanes?  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brazil first of all as Mr. Wenning pointed out our Brazilian business is doing very well in the third quarter, and it's presently also running very well.  You are aware of the currency situations overall in the present situation keeping the commodity prices in our mind, the currency situation is more open it's basically helping. And as long as this remains at this level we are very pleased with, we'll be very pleased with the performance in Brazil this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and MaterialScience pricing in Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think Andreas you were particularly referring to TDI, at quarter three volumes are down year-on-year primarily caused by the shipping issue in China, which took out a fairly large amount of the volume movement. And behind that is of course one of the pricing effects, because the volumes were very strongly down on a quarter-on-quarter basis sequentially.  Prices are actually up year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter globally.</p>
          <p>Let's just look into each region. In the European region prices are still at a relatively high level and are not showing significant signs of softening, although volumes appear to be reducing. In the North Americas, the pricing is still holding at the current levels although the volumes have reduced slightly more significantly. What is happening there is producers are reducing some of their output and players have announced some output reduction.</p>
          <p>In Asia the situation is probably the key if you look at global TDI pricing, because prior to the Olympics, knowing that there was going to be a shipping ban there was a lot of pre-stocking of TDI in the distribution channels. Of course that was not particularly helpful during the Olympics because during the Olympics there was a shipment ban.  So, those stock levels stayed throughout the Olympics and have been released into the market following the Olympic transportation ban. So, at the moment there is a significant oversupply into the regional market of TDI, particularly from stock positions that were built with traders before the Olympics. That's what's caused the rapid decline in TDI price in Asia and particularly in China. So, I think that's the overall picture.</p>
          <p>What may happen in the future, just to give some feeling of supply and demand balance, supply and demand is still relatively tight in TDI and the underlying growth rates we've seen historically run at around about 4% is the long-term growth rate. It's clear that that rate has come down in the last quarter and it is difficult to judge whether it will stay down or whether it will rebound after the Olympics. It's very important that the Chinese market would rebound get back to anything near that 4% growth rate. At the moment, I don't believe that will happen and I think there are signs that there is a slightly longer term weakness in the TDI market in Asia. But, at the moment in North America and Europe, pricing levels are relatively stable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. Florent Cespedes, Exane BNP Paribas. First of all, could you confirm that the Yasmin sales ex-U.S. were flattish in Q3 versus Q2 and if there is any explanation there? And also could we have an update on the Phase II of Kogenate the limiting version? And last point, could you give us your view on the products across the HealthCare portfolio, which were exposed to economic slowdown and why you believe that some of them may offer better resilience? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Arthur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Florent, when you look at the Yasmin business I would say that the U.S. &#x2013; you have to remember that we have been switching Yasmin to Yasminelle, and now we are switching to YAZ.  So you've really got to look at the performance of the total family that is our intention to move Yasmin to both YAZ and Yasminelle. And in the quarter if you look at outside of, if you look at the YAZ family outside of the U.S. it grew 21%. So I think rather than looking at an individual component you've got to look at the total family. So the total family grew 21% and I wouldn't focus on Yasmin as we are converting that to Yasminelle and YAZ. As to the Phase II Liposomal study, all I can say at this stage is that it continues to progress well. There's no specific update I can give you, but that we're encouraged by enrollment and the study progress.</p>
          <p>As to our consumer business and how that could be impacted by any economic downturn, I think as you saw we had a very strong third quarter in our consumer business. So, to date we've seen little, if any, impact on any of our consumer businesses, be that animal health, be that diabetes care, or be that our OTC business. However, as you would expect, we continue to monitor the situation carefully.  We are aware that particularly in the U.S. in the OTC segment that there is, and has been for recent months, a significant increase in own label usage. We've also heard from IMS that there is some slowing in both prescription and any businesses that require co-payments, so that may have an impact on our diabetes care business. And some information from veterinary clinics said there has been a slowdown in foot traffic, but the bottom line is as we speak our brands remain very, very strong and are holding up pretty well.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so thank you good afternoon. I have two question one on CropScience the other on MaterialScience. First on CropScience, could you give us some color about the current inventories level that you see down the chain in crop protection and if you see any risk here? And the second question on MaterialScience, you provided us with a guidance in absolute terms regarding EBITDA next year to decline. If you take into account the lower contract price to that is expected to follow in line with lower raw material cost and the weaker euro, it should help your margin, but on the other hand you should have some negative impact from volumes. How do you consider, overall, the balance between pluses and minuses on your margin next year in BMS? Is it fair to assume that the margin would come lower than this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first inventories, Klaus, then BMS.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Inventories in the channel really good news. We have very, very solid information that inventories are really low, this gives us a good start into 2009; very clear information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>BMS, also, inventories and performance next year, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, certainly there is no doubt, Matthias, that there are high inventory levels in several of our segments. We also see a reduction in a lot of our customers' stock holding as they have difficult access to credit lines. If we talk about the overall margin guidance for next year in very broad terms, clearly we're operating in some cyclical markets and although there's a sort of normal economic downswing approaching the present financial crisis probably adds an extra downside risk to that.</p>
          <p>We anticipate a more difficult market next year for BMS and that's why we are guiding to reports on underlying EBITDA below this year. If you look within that bridge then you would &#x2013; I agree, expect to see raw material pricing lower. We're guiding at the moment the team on a $90 per barrel oil price and currency at 145 for the full year as an average. That will be compensated or the benefit of that will be compensated by lower volumes clearly and also potentially lower prices as we see the growth rates reduce and some over capacity in some of our segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just quickly follow up on that do you expect lower prices to have an impact on your margins or do you expect this to be in line with the decline in raw materials and energy prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I &#x2013; Matthias, I know what's behind your question because certainly there is a modeling view that you can model this business on constant margins. I actually would subscribe to a view, and it's a personal view, that on the way up the margins grow and on the way down the margins shrink, but that's sort of hysteresis effect it's relatively difficult to forecast because it's actually back to supply and demand balances by each product.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why you're optimistic for that? And on the CropScience side, given the falls in grain prices, what gives you optimism that there won't be some sort of demand disruption given lower farming income next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, perhaps we will start, Andrew, with working capital, our working capital assumption, Klaus K&#xFC;hn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew if you look at our working capital I think the main, let's say, if you look at the change compared to previous year, we had an increase of roughly 300 million if you look at working capital excluding the other working capital and here we are looking at the accumulation as we were talking about inventories and that's what we aim to reduce in the fourth quarter and there is a reason for that CropScience is producing more because we anticipate higher demands. We had in China the MDI plan.  And we also have to admit that within the integration of Schering Pharma we are still in the integration phase for closing and combining production type.  So, we hope to improve there and have also activities there, but usually on the inventories there is no, let's say, real quick fix, but our ambition is to regain that what we &#x2013; part of what we have lost here in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Qlaira, Arthur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew we have a very clear positioning between YAZ and Qlaira; Qlaira is the first oral contraceptive to have what we describe as a body identical estrogen or close to body identical estrogen.  So we'll be conveying a very natural product here.  The other thing that we are looking at with Qlaira &#x2013; is developing an indication for prolonged and frequent menstrual bleeding which we call DUB; DUB would enable us to position Qlaira for the slightly older OC patients where YAZ with its benefits on acne and moods being positioned for the younger OC patients, okay?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>And CropScience demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, demand in commodity prices, first of all the overall fundamentals driving commodity prices are basically unchanged, that the demand is really there. There was a very recent U.S. daily report demonstrating that everybody is expecting low levels at the end of the crop season in terms of the stock so these results are positive and the present commodity prices are still on an attractive level.  That level which really stimulates the farmers to invest into modern technology including of course innovation, competition and products.  We also need to keep in mind that other factors are important for example mineral, oil and energy prices which are clearly down.  Another important factor, fertilizer prices, they are significantly down which is very good for the farmers of course and also the price of farmland basically is going down, so that are overall positive factors.  So, commodity prices at present level still stimulate farmers to invest and that are the main reasons why we are so confident that business next year will be in good shape.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Neil Tyler with JP Morgan.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon.  And a couple of questions please, firstly back to FX, I wonder if you could give us an idea year-to-date of how that's impacted the HealthCare business, what the net EBITDA negative and what the FX is on the HealthCare business?</p>
          <p>And secondly on CropScience, you mentioned that you are confident of 3 to 5% price increase and yet, sort of splitting hairs, but the margin guidance for next year is flat on this.  So on what basis would the top line have to decline for you to miss your 25% EBITDA margin forecast for 2009, what would be the delta on volumes for that to be at risk?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, working capital, you mentioned that there are some measures in place; I wonder if you could provide some sort of guidance on what you are targeting in terms of working capital ratios for the full year?  And then finally on MaterialScience you mentioned, Patrick, the cash optimization strategy at the moment, how long can that continue for, and presumably that means that relative to your previous comments on a trough margin that the EBITDA margin can fall below that for a period of time, but &#x2013; and how long can you maintain the business under that management strategy before having to think of alternative plans?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay let's start with your question in regard to the impact on currency on EBITDA level of HealthCare, K&#xFC;hn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Neil for the third quarter we have an impact on HealthCare in currency of roughly 60 billion on EBITDA minus 60 million and roughly 0.6 margin points and year-to-date that would roughly mean 230 million minus 0.5 margin points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you continue the answer on working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to guidance on working capital, as I said we want to improve let's say working capital over and beyond what we did in the fourth quarter of last year.  We have let's say, our ratios or terms are more in terms of days.  And as I said to you we call them, let's say, cash conversion cycle days and so we have roughly 147 days at the end of 2007, we are currently well beyond that.  We are currently more, about 160 days and our ambition is roughly to get back to the level at the end of 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again CropScience, the guidance again for 2009 prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far, and as I told you we are confident in terms of the business 2009, 25% EBITDA margin target should be clearly achievable that you know our key payables, one is of course commodity price as we talked about.  The other one we never should forget is the weather situation and of course currency, you mentioned this as well.  Of course, if the U.S. dollar would remain to be strong, it would help us significantly.  And on the downside, the possible downside or possible risk is of course the financial crisis which could theoretically have an impact, but overall we believe if there will be an impact it would be limited because the financial situation of the farmers overall is very good one. They earned a lot of money based on high commodity prices this year so overall they are in good shape. So, that are the main drivers and presently to give a different guidance I think makes not a lot of sense, but that are the main drivers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, how long we are able to optimize our cash in BMS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess Neil the best way of looking at it is in two parts working capital optimization.  In the third quarter, we changed direction slightly in working capital due to two reasons, firstly on stocks we started at the new MDI facility in China which added considerably to our inventories and also we started to see first signs of recession in terms of working capital as our DSO started to slip.  That's typically where we see the first impact of the slowdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we currently have crisis teams in each part of the world working on pulling in DSOs and currently we only have 2% late payments outstanding, for example, in Europe at the moment.  So, we have a lot of space there to improve.  Our overall working capital to sales level is about 20% and for a business of this type I would expect it to be below 20% and that is a journey that may take a period of anything up to 2 or 3 years to achieve.  But I think there's still room for significant improvement.</p>
          <p>The second part of the question is really to do with the capital expenditure line, because as you know this business typically grows significantly above GDP and if we are no longer in that position for a period of time then we have to be able to adjust our capital expenditure. And our plan at the moment would be to reduce our capital expenditure over the next one, two, three years, more to a level related to depreciation, although that still allows us to complete our project in China.  So, we are into a rationing stage on CapEx to match the slower growth expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Christian Faitz of Oppenheim.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my question again, both on MaterialScience and CropScience.  First of all, in MaterialScience, can you confirm that, like we hear from other chemical companies but clearly also from your customer industries that the past few weeks have sharply deteriorated in terms of business climate and what does this mean for you going forward, I mean, I have recognized your 2009 guidance and everything, but can you talk a little bit more in detail, particularly about your situation in China?</p>
          <p>Second, CropScience, I was wondering about two aspects; first of all, you seem to have grown slightly slower than one of your big competitors, is one of the reasons in Latin America for example, the additional cautiousness regarding credit financing on the pharma side, is there any update from four weeks ago when you had the Investor Day, four weeks, and you stated it's nothing.  So, is there any update on financing issues both in North and Latin America?</p>
          <p>And my final question on CropScience is wheat blast, the fungus which affects wheat, the seeds should be becoming much more prominent in Latin America these days, is that a big opportunity for your fungicide business?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's start first with BMS, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Christian, if you look at quarter three, we saw, as you commented, I think a volume reduction of about minus 5%, which is about a 140 million in sales terms. 85 million of that 140 was actually co-product sales that we did not make.  That's in bisphenol A and in styrene monomer.  The fundamental reason to that is we just didn't want to make those sales, because they are unattractive, when the raw material costs are high and the demand for bisphenol A and styrene monomer was low.  We then had a hit of around about 30 million sales around hurricane Ike and about 13 million in terms of the Olympics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean that's all understood, I understand the Olympics and the Oktoberfest phenomena and whatever, but I am talking about the last couple of weeks actually, which means going into Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Yeah, the reason we are giving that background was really to say in quarter three we hadn't seen significant business downturn, the fundamental growth was still there.  You're right in the last few weeks we've seen declining volumes and declining demand. That's a mixture of stock reduction, as I described earlier, due to working capital constraints among some of our customers.  But it's also fundamentals, for example, maybe 20 to 25% of our business is driven by the automotive industry.  A significant 21% of our business is driven by the construction industry.  So, when you see announcements that the U.S. automotive industry is down 30%, we clearly feel that.  And if you take a couple of specifics, around about 40% of the world's automotive seating is made using products from biomaterial science.  So, when you see a decline in the automotive industry which is severe then we obviously feel that decline.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we've actually seen some growth in insulation demand, in North America for example, where the very high energy prices push people to invest in high quality insulation.  So it's still a slightly mixed picture, it's still material substitution going on which drives slightly higher growth rates compared to other polymers. But, overall the basic industries, as you're suggesting, over the last few weeks are suffering quite severe declines.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CropScience, credit terms, so far we have not changed our credit terms in Latin America or North America.  In terms of Latin America we are watching the situation carefully but so far no change.  Your second question in terms of wheat blast, we are fully aware of the situation, of course we tested our fungicides and some of them, specifically one, shows an excellent efficacy in terms of this disease.  So, if market would develop, we would be prepared, but to give you now any indication in terms of a possible business, it's too early, it would be just speculation, but we would be prepared and we are prepared.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Just quickly going back to the topic of price increases on consumer health, what's the underlying growth looking at pre-buying prior to the price increase and the price increases in Q3, do you have an underlying number?  Also on prices in the pharma division obviously Betaseron has seen quite a bit in the U.S. any other big price increases in the portfolio?  Then lastly on synergies, where are we and what's still to come, going forward?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Michael.  Regarding the price increases, you are referring to the price increases in our consumer business in the third quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These were predominantly in the US.  They were planned price increases; of course a number of key brands, in the range of 3 to 5%, Michael.  They clearly had an impact in the quarter.  It's difficult for us to estimate that, but what I can tell you is, we are still looking to, our consumer business is growing above the respective markets in the fourth quarter.  So, maybe the third quarter was a little stronger than expected as a result of the price increases, but the underlying demand in consumer remains very strong.</p>

          <p>Synergies, we again remain on target to realize 80% of our synergies before the end of this year and your question on pharma, terms of other, yeah we are on track to realize 80% as I said.  And on pharma, you're asking other price increases, we took a, if I'm looking, nothing really significant apart from some Betaferon prices in the U.S., trying to see what else I have here.  YAZ effective, that's basically it Michael.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  First question is also on Bayer HealthCare, Nexavar more specific obviously we see growth coming down in the United States, there is more competition I believe in the kidney area.  From your point of view, you said you're taking some measurements, I would be interested to what measurements and in addition obviously as liver is a small indication in U.S., could you foresee that Nexavar could start a decline in the United States over the next quarter in terms of sales?</p>
          <p>And second question is for Mr. K&#xFC;hn on the Schering pay out and you have this escrow account with 751 million and you wrote in you Q3 report that you're going to pay out 695 million to the Schering shareholders, so that means the rest is still some shares you have to buy later or does it mean you have 50 million saved, or something like that?</p>
          <p>And, third question is, regarding consumer care Aspirin, Aspirin is developing relatively flattish, it's obviously an old brand.  Is that now kind of peaking here or do you still have so to say some product changes in mind which would still bring that product to further growing here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with Nexavar and your Aspirin question, Arthur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think we've still in the third quarter enjoyed close to 20% increase in mix of our currency adjusted year-over-year.  So, when I talk about room for improvement, that room for improvement has been measured against the fact that in the rest of the world we grew, maybe 1%.  So I have no concerns about Nexavar not showing quarter year-over-year growth in the U.S. What I am obviously looking at is to see whether we can take some of the learnings from outside of the U.S. where, as I mentioned, we are growing maybe 1% year-over-year and apply those to the U.S.  I think in particular we want to expand our field force reach from simply oncology into other physicians who treat liver cancer.</p>
          <p>Your question on total Aspirin, again I think if you look at across pharma you see, currency adjusted we're up 6% so, for, as you say, if I can use the word kindly, one of our mature brands 6% growth, and mature being over 100 years old, to be growing at 6% currency adjusted I think is a tremendous achievement.  And yes, we do intend to introduce new presentations and new campaigns to ensure the brand remains fresh.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well we have paid all the remaining obligations towards the Schering shareholders in early October and there was some amount still remaining, some roughly 50 million in restricted cash and that relates to all our, let's say already accrued for SDC cases, which is where the payments still have to be done.</p>

And secondly, you mentioned that the marketing costs for Nexavar were high; do you mean it's higher than second quarter or previous quarters or can you elaborate on where those marketing costs are allocating different geographic regions?</p>

          <p>Yeah, yeah, Jessica, let me just get the information on Japan for you, in the third quarter; our Japanese sales were &#x20AC;8 million.  You were asking about higher expenses, that really reflects the fact that we are rolling out the product we just launched here in Japan.  We continue to get approval of HCC indication in different parts of the world.  And as we mentioned the brand in the quarter grew 61%.  So, we hope you want to make sure what we're investing appropriately behind the brand.</p>
