          <p>Good morning and welcome everyone to FEMSA's Third Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, management may discuss certain forward-looking statements concerning FEMSA's future performance and should be considered as good faith estimates made by the company. These forward-looking statements reflect management expectations and are based upon currently available data. Actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties, which may materially impact the company's actual performance.</p>
          <p>At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Javier Astaburuaga, FEMSA's CFO. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to FEMSA's third quarter 2012 results earnings conference call. Juan Fonseca and Jose Castro are with us today as well as always.</p>
          <p>As is customary in our calls, today we will focus on the consolidated figures for FEMSA and on FEMSA Comercio's results, since many of you probably had the opportunity to participate in Coca-Cola's FEMSA's conference call yesterday. As you have also no doubt seen our detailed results, we will use this opportunity to focus on the highlights and main trends on our businesses.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned in our release, during the third quarter, we saw both our corporations perform well. While Coca-Cola FEMSA experienced some margin pressure earlier in the year, in Q3 they were able to capitalize on stable volumes, solid pricing and improving raw materials and foreign exchange dynamics. That led to achieve double-digit operating income growth for the business.</p>
          <p>For its part, FEMSA Comercio maintained its brisk pace and also posted double-digit operating income growth on the back of consistent balance, same-store sales growth and an ever improving level of execution.</p>
          <p>As you know, at the end of March, we reported our 2011 quarterly and full-year financial information under IFRS, this to facilitate comparability. If you have any questions about these changes, please get in touch with Juan on our Investor Relations team, who will be glad to follow up.</p>
          <p>In terms of our perception of the environment and the drivers for consumption, particularly in our key Mexico market, we continue to see encouraging trends that are consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Manufacturing activity and GDP growth remained healthy, and consumer confidence is near recent highs, while unemployment is under control.</p>
          <p>Inflation has continued to trend gradually higher, inching towards 5%, making it the one divergent variable. However, the overall economic environment in Mexico is positive and it should continue this way for the remainder of the year and perhaps beyond.</p>
          <p>Looking briefly at the macro environment in other markets where we operate. The standouts regarding GDP are Colombia and Venezuela. All of them posting mid-single digit growth, in sharp contrast with Brazil and Argentina, where growth is almost zero. In terms of inflation, Argentina, Venezuela continued to show levels in the double digits, particularly related to labor, freight and transportation costs.</p>
          <p>Moving on to discuss our consolidated quarterly numbers, total revenues increased 18% and income from operations grew 24%. On an organic basis, this is excluding the integration of the beverage operations of Grupo Tampico, CIMSA and FOQUE, total revenues and income from operations increased also a healthy 12% and 18%, respectively. For the third quarter, the line labeled participation in Heineken results represents FEMSA's 20% participation in Heineken's third quarter net income, which was reported yesterday, using the average exchange rate for the euro during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Net income increased 21%. As we explained in our press release, this increase reflects growth in FEMSA's income from operations, and incorporates the variation in FEMSA's 20% participation in Heineken's third quarter net income versus the figure reported for the third quarter last year.</p>
          <p>These factors more than compensated for a swing from a significant foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2011 to now a foreign exchange loss in the third quarter of 2012. This driven largely by the effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso on the U.S. dollar denominated component of our cash position in the third quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate was 30.4% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of our cash position, during the third quarter, we went from having basically zero net cash levels at the end of June to a consolidated net cash position of Ps. 3.1 billion at the end of September reflecting cash generation at both of our core businesses basically.</p>
          <p>And moving on to discuss our operations, I'm beginning with FEMSA Comercio, we opened 178 net new stores during the third quarter reaching 1,019 total new net stores openings for the last 12 months. This number is in line with our expectations which as I mentioned last quarter are to surpass a 1000 net new stores for the year representing a level of store growth which our current system is well-equipped to manage.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased 16% during the quarter. Same-store sales were up again approaching a healthy 8% reflecting improvements in both average ticket and traffic. Our average ticket rose slightly above 4% aided by price increases taken in the first quarter by several of our suppliers for important categories, and our traffic increased slightly below 4%, continuing to reflect progress in our management of category and purchase allocation mix, and the continuous fine-tuning of our value proposition within the store.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, the gross margin expanded 70 basis points, again driven mainly by a positive mix shift due to the growth of higher margin categories, and a more effective collaboration and execution with our key supplier partners, including our achievement of certain sales objectives with some of these partners and the corresponding benefit accrued to us. Additionally, we continue to have a more efficient use of promotion-related marketing resources and a better execution of our strategy of segmented pricing across markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating margin, this quarter FEMSA Comercio posted an expansion of 50 basis points, even in the phase of incremental expenses relating to among other things, the continued strengthening of FEMSA's Comercio organizational structure and the development of specialized distribution routes aim at enabling our preferred food initiatives.</p>
          <p>Also as is always the case, the rapid pace of store openings put some pressure on the selling expenses line, as new stores generated expenses from day one, while revenues take a while to get up speed. Even the FEMSA Comercio results are still running above our restricted medium-term expectations of mid-single digits same-store sales growth and 10 to 20 basis points of expansion per year is likely that our full year results will come in ahead of plan. However, as we've stated before this should not signal a change in our medium-term expectations for next year and beyond.</p>
          <p>And finally, moving to Coca-Cola FEMSA. Revenues for the quarter increased 20% versus the comparable period of 2011, as a result of double-digit total revenue growth in each division and the integration of our new territories in Mexico.</p>
          <p>On an organic basis, revenues for the quarter increased 10%, operating income increased 27%, driven by double-digit operating income growth in each division and including as well the integration of the new territories in Mexico.</p>
          <p>While on an organic basis, operating income increased 18% compared to the third quarter of 2011, reflecting improvement in raw material and some foreign exchange dynamics as I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>If you are unable to participate in the conference call yesterday of Coca-Cola FEMSA, you can always access a replay of the webcast for additional details on the results.</p>
          <p>Finally, in terms of more strategic developments, a brief note just saying that we have made a good progress in our analysis of the opportunity we face in the Philippines, and the process continues to move in the right direction.</p>
          <p>As H&#xE9;ctor Trevi&#xF1;o mentioned during his call yesterday, we expect to make a decision before year-end on this matter.</p>
          <p>And so we are once more in the final stretch of a year that has brought us a combination of opportunities and challenges and we are excited to approach the final couple of months of 2012 with strong momentum across our business units and across our market.</p>
          <p>And with that I'd like now to open the call for questions. Operator, please?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The question-and-answer session will begin at this time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your question will be taken in the order that it is received. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question at a time in order to allow for the maximum number of callers to ask their questions, and one moment while we assemble the queue.</p>
          <p>And we will go to Alan Alanis with JPMorgan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much. Hi, everyone. Hi, Javier. I have a question regarding the CapEx of OXXO. I mean we're seeing the year-to-date base growing around to 13% in the quarter, actually a little bit faster; around 14%, yet the number of stores, while openings will likely be smaller this year than last year.</p>
          <p>So two questions, I mean where is this CapEx being redirected if it's not store openings, Javier, is this &#x2013; I mean what's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:46) in terms of your greenfield initiatives for fast food and so on? And the second question would be, how do you see the annual base of openings in the next two to three years or the next one to three years for OXXO? That would be my question for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure, Alan, hi. The CapEx as the proportion of sales has been relatively stable between 5% to 6% both involving remodulation of the store base, but more driven by the opening of stores. And as you are mentioning, even though we are opening less, we are investing a little bit more. This has a lot to do with the opening of distribution centers. In the year, we're basically going to open a couple of those. Also we've invested during the year on a center for prepared food in Northwestern Mexico as well. And the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:45) is spending or investing behind the store base in terms of remodulation it's also increasing as the store base gets a little bit older. This is not a significant amount, yet, but it's also, I would say, having an influence in the growth of the CapEx.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but all in all, little bit also related to some of these efforts that I mentioned in my opening remarks about building a specialized distribution route system to precisely take care of prepared food initiatives which is still in the early stages, but again that requires some investing ahead of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:25) development of the category. So those will be my comments on the CapEx.</p>
          <p>And on the base of opening new stores as I mentioned as well, we feel pretty comfortable that the right balance in terms of the number of stores that we feel comfortable with opening year-in, year-out is around 1,000. Any number between 1,000 and 1,100 is the right number we think for the kind of organization that we have put in place to do that. Well, at the same time, we continue to develop the value proposition within the stores which, as you can imagine <mark type="ph" /> and now (13:00) brings a lot of complicity into the process of opening new stores. So, 1,000 to 1,100 new openings for the next two to three years is a number that we still feel comfortable with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's useful. And if I may, I mean I am getting that you have almost $800 million of cash at the FEMSA level, yesterday Coca-Cola FEMSA cash that's net cash. What's the latest or any update in terms of the thinking in terms of how you will deploy capital going forward? I guess that's a more strategic question, Javier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it hasn't changed really that much. We think we're very well &#x2013; I'd say positioned after spending some months on developing some opportunities as I have been mentioning on the front of some opportunities in &#x2013; what we call small box format around FEMSA Comercio and some other opportunities around our logistic business as well.</p>
          <p>And we also have some other potential uses of cash. We feel confident that having had these liquid position for the last couple of years, we might now get into a timeframe which we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to allocate that capital in ideas that are pretty much aligned with the strategy of the business as we've been reviewing this every quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question is also on OXXO, you've been delivering very good same-store sales growth high single-digits for the last several quarters. Just curious to get your impression as we start to think about next year. How sustainable this type of growth rate is and if you could also just talk about the components of this growth, it seems like it's been pretty balanced between store traffic and also ticket sales. So just curious to get any trends there as far as how behavior has changed or stay the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Lauren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This has been a very good year, I should say for OXXO. If you look at the performance of the different categories speaking a little bit about categories we have, let's say everything, a little bit of everything. So categories which are softening a little bit because of consumer dynamics as well as emerging categories which have been very favorable to the gross margin performance because we have been able to again grow those categories, which we're able to capture a little bit more margin. So, the balance between traffic and I would say, ticket is really a reflection of again bringing to the stores with the knowledge that we are continuously get from consumer needs and trying to satisfy <mark type="ph" /> those in the (16:00) best, a more convenient way.</p>
          <p>We feel confident that the efforts that we have in place, will, I would say be enough to, I'm not sure if to match this year's performance or at least to continue in a positive trend, we think we still have a number of initiatives that we feel confident, will still bring more people into the store, because we're again expanding a number of &#x2013; I would say both products and services all across the country. Talking about financial services on one side, all the way to food offering, prepared food offering to the other, as well as continue efforts on again bringing innovation to the stores, which we are a preferred partner for a lot of our most important suppliers. So, the combination a little bit of bringing innovation, new services, solutions for consumers to take advantage of their three minute stop in an OXXO, we feel confident that again that we will be able to bring more people and to make them buy a little bit more stuff or solve some of their needs.</p>
          <p>And again, as I'm saying, the long-term objective for same-store sales is, I would say to continue to grow &#x2013; I would say, hopefully above the general retail market in Mexico that we have been able to do so in the past years very successfully.</p>
          <p>So all-in-all, my take would be a positive. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:32) that some of the efforts that we're putting in place are more complex than other, so its easier to design and test a proof-of-concept for a new product or solution than to roll it out close to now 11,000 stores all across the country. So, we still think we have a lot of opportunity in order to improve our speed to execution of new initiatives and that would hopefully sometime translate to even a more stronger same-store sales. But for the time being we think that the business is performing extremely well and we feel confident that we will continue to do so going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's helpful. And if I can also ask, I'm not sure, I just missed in your comments when you talked about margin expansion at OXXO. Did you mention that you're trending ahead for this year, and I don't know if you made comments for next year, but just curious about &#x2013; I know you've provided some longer terms guidance on margin improvement, if that's still intact as we think about next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. My comment was that on this year, we are definitely going to be above our long-term expectation, which is a modest expansion 10, maybe 20 basis points at the EBIT line. This year definitely, <mark type="ph" /> resolves (18:51) up to September makes us very, very confident that we're going to well surpass that long-term strategic intent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And for next year, that 10 to 20, is still the guidance?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Javier. Just have two quick questions. First, is there anything that you can comment on &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> we're seeing (19:27) from many of the grocery retailers in Mexico that price competition is intensifying both in perishables as well as in couple of categories that <mark type="ph" /> I get (19:39) do not compete at all with OXXO. But, I wanted to ask within perishables would you be able to comment at all on how do you feel about this price gaps and I guess you close these trends quite closely you track them quite closely.</p>
          <p>Would you be able to mention how do you feel with respect to more price aggressiveness from this retailers and whether to the extent that you can comment your strategy would be to continue differentiating by adding new categories and value-added services to the store, or do you foresee any events in which you will or you maybe already did lower prices in these categories that do overlap with a large box retailers in Mexico that would be my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Antonio. We're really not very active in this category at all and this is not one of the category that people have in their minds when they are thinking about OXXO or a need to be satisfied. We are more kind of a last resource or short trip to the store to buy some perishable that we were left out and we are in a hurry to really use it for supper or dinner whatever. So we have been following a little bit the dynamics on the category, but as I'm telling you, this is not an important one for us, at least so far. So, I really do not have a point of view, again, on how intensive this degree of competition is turning out.</p>
          <p>We are still very much focused again on building a very well, I would say, diversified category, consumption, location kind of outlet an OXXO should be. So, perishables play a very, very little role in very, very few even stores, we don't have that really wide, nationwide kind of offering on this category. So we are very, very tactical and selective on participating in this category. We have much more stronger efforts in things that I mentioned already, which is expanding the lines of services that we provide to customers, both general services and financial services, through relationships with now Bancomer and Banamex all across our 10,000 stores.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we are going to be bringing new banks also into the picture and also, on our offering on prepared food, which is, I would say, starting to develop very well, at least in the stores in which we have this capability of offering prepared food in a much more broader offering and with a much, I would say, wider variety that the one we had only couple of years ago. So, those would be my remarks here Antonio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Secondly, if I may, just wanted to ask very quickly. Is it reasonable, would you say, to assume that the cash balance that you have denominated in dollars will remain in dollars between now and whenever you have some strategic decision regarding probably the Philippines or some other M&amp;A transaction, or is there any event in which you could, given the trend that the peso is having, reduce those dollar holdings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we still feel comfortable with the currency mix we have on our cash balances. We build that, I would say, at very, very reasonable exchange rates below Ps. 12, a little bit more than a year ago. So we feel confident that, as I said a little while ago, that having the cash balances with the currency mix as of today is pretty consistent with our view on the potential use of that resource going forward, and that we feel confident that we will be able to allocate that cash into good opportunities for FEMSA to continue creating value. So, we don't have anything in our minds in changing things as they are today, Antonio.</p>

          <p>And we'll move to the next question from Lore Serra with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask one quick question and one broader question. The quick question is, can you just give us your updated timetable for the rollout of prepared foods in OXXO?</p>
          <p>And the more broad one is, you know yesterday on the call with KOF, H&#xE9;ctor talked about how you would think about the Philippines as a beachhead for KOF to expand in Asia, because of KOF's deep bench and desire to expand. And I'm going to ask this question, it's going to sound like I'm asking about Philippines, but I'm really not. I'm just trying to understand how investors, or how we should think about how you find good return opportunities in Asia, given that my perception is that margins are substantially below where you are in your current operations in KOF, so as you think about investing in Asia and, like I said Philippines is part of that but not really the whole thing, what compensates for the lower margins to make good return opportunities &#x2013; well, potentially good return opportunities, because you haven't invested there yet in Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Lore. On the first one, as I mentioned, I mean rolling out, I would, say a new product innovation which is barcoded and you can just scan it because here it is very easy for us to do. Really the complexity involving having the ability to prepare food and distribute to the stores on a daily basis &#x2013; store-in and store-out and manage waste and the likes, I mean, I'm just referring you to a very maybe easy answer out of your question which is, it's going to be a long-term initiative. It took us a number of years really to roll out the coffee initiative, and making coffee seems very easy for all of us early in the morning even though we're a little bit sleepy, but doing it the way consumers want it, which is fresh, hot and affordable, it's not that easy.</p>
          <p>So, this is a process that's going to take a long time. That's my answer. We don't really provide a framework for, not even on a yearly basis, but I'm telling you this is a multiyear effort in order to develop the capabilities outside of the store, the transportation abilities to the store and then the execution within the store, it's going to be a multiyear effort. We feel confident about again and the early signs that we have, but it's going to take a long time to develop this, but we think this is a category which is so underdeveloped within the, I would vision of the store of the future we have, that this is a great potential for the business, but it's going to take a long time to do it.</p>
          <p>The second one, I think the one word answer would be growth, and by growth I mean profitable growth. We're looking at a region which has a lot of similarities to some of the Latin American economies in the 1970s and 1980s. By definition, I'm speaking about long-term returns. This is a region of the world in which we think our capabilities have a good fit of what is required to develop a much more developed and complex portfolio to execute in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>As I said, a number of years in Latin America and you might also have the impression of having a very narrow availability of packaging and products. We think that in Asia, there is a very, very big opportunity in taking advantage of emerging economies with more people with purchasing power, and the Philippines particularly have a very, very solid start point in terms of the likeliness for people for soft drinks with carbonated, and for the Coca-Cola brand for sure.</p>
          <p>So, all-in-all, I am just saying, we think we have the right set of capabilities. This is a growing region with emerging affordability of people. And we do our act well, in terms again of segmenting the market the proper way, through the different stages of development of the market, combining in an intelligent way, returnable glass and returnable plate, PET as well as one ways. And both working on the personal servings as well as the multi-serve kind of occasions, and that's the kind of future we ambition for Asia and we want to be part of that experience.</p>

          <p>And we will go again to Gabriel Lima with Morgan Stanley &#x2013; I am sorry, with Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Can you hear me now, Javier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Much better. Thank you, Gabriel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry about that. So I just had a follow-up question on the very first question regarding the cash use. You mentioned that you are looking to other formats, but you also mentioned the logistic business, so I just want to better clarify what you mean when you're looking to opportunity in the logistics business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, we have a fairly large business within FEMSA, we don't speak much about that, but this is north of $500 million, a lot of that is being served to our internal needs in Coca-Cola FEMSA. We also provide freight services for Heineken as well. But I would say more than 50% of what we do is to third parties and we have a very nice business, which is very well-run, and this is the largest one in Mexico in terms of private fleets and managing third-party fleets as well for some customers. And we think we have an opportunity to expand a little bit. This is not, I would say again, big investments maybe for the company, but we think we have some opportunity to expand a little bit the lines of services that we are providing there. And basically here and maybe Brazil &#x2013; here in Mexico I mean. And that's the kind of opportunity that I mentioned in terms of logistic <mark type="ph" /> activities (31:23).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's interesting. And can you share with us the level of returns and profitability that you have in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think those are business, which are as I said, I mean these are not the core businesses. What I can share with you is that these businesses performed well ahead of their cost of capital. So we feel confident about putting some little bit more capital into them. But again, these are not the core businesses that we communicate with the market for FEMSA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I've got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel confident that these are very well-run businesses. We don't talk too much about this, but these are businesses which are benchmarked against the best of its class in the region, both in the logistics one as well as in the commercial refrigeration equipment business, which we have a fairly large business as well, which is &#x2013; as a matter of fact, the biggest one in the Americas. But even though we don't talk too much about those, you just saw that we just disposed the third business which was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:38) the chemical one that we've said we will in the first two, three years. But these logistic business as well as the commercial refrigeration equipment, our businesses we &#x2013; which we think sits very fine, very nicely within the environment on the capabilities of FEMSA. And again these are even though smaller as compared with the rest of the other one.</p>
          <p>We think there are opportunities and we would like to start from those opportunities that's why we are exploring and trying to develop opportunities to grow not only organically. But also in a very, very moderate way I should say that and reinforce that. We would also like to do some non-organic stuff in this business as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very interesting. And still on the cash used, Javier, you mentioned in the last call you are looking in opportunities in Brazil regarding outsource, so do you have any update on that on any thought on what kind of format you would come to Brazil, you said it will be through a JV or by yourself or any update is helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only update is, we continue to look at the retail landscape. We continue to look at potential opportunities. And as I said in the past we would love to be in Brazil somehow sometime but we don't have really a clear blueprint that tells that in a certain quarter we should be there doing something. So it's still in the stages of understanding better the market than trying to assess priorities in terms of what would be the best way to sometime being present in Brazil in retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Javier. Congrats on the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take the next question from Alex Robarts with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi, everybody. Yes, I had two questions, I guess first of all just thinking about the services component right of OXXO sales, the financial services piece seems to be accelerating it looks like Banamex was included in the portfolio during the third quarter. You mentioned I guess there will be some other banks getting, yet to be included. I mean you gave us a nice overview of prepared foods. I mean obviously banking service is not like the barcoded type of concept and it's more like the multiyear project thing.</p>
          <p>Can you kind of give us a view kind of some comments on where you stand in the banking service initiative, the related economics and kind of, do we expect this to perhaps overtake the other services over time to really being kind of the main source of service related revenue. So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>I guess the second one has to relates to Heineken, I mean it looks like we are coming to the end of the year. I mean April is when you have the choice or option to start selling the Heineken shares. And I am not sure how much comment you could give us around this, but should we think about the Philippine transaction if it happens, kind of changing the way you view your ownership of the Heineken shares and any thoughts around that option to sell those shares as it comes in April would be very helpful? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Alex. Hi. First on the services piece, this is kind of a two function product it's I mean, it should be a business by itself, which it is, complexity regarding the capability to really provide even though the narrow services that we provide to consumer, customers in our stores on financial services. It requires a lot of training for people and of course we are certified and evaluated by authorities in Mexico.</p>
          <p>So it's not as &#x2013; I would say it something different from the food prepared kind of category, but it also, it evolves a high degree of complexity again, because as you know retail has a long &#x2013; I mean a very high turnaround of people, so you have to have permanent effort to keep training people about, again how solving consumer when they are trying to make a deposits or payment of the services whatever. But it's an important category as well to again bring people into the store, was they are doing something financial related do something and buying a coke or a beer or a snack.</p>
          <p>So it is a category which is same and both these objectives of building margin which is I would say good enough for us to see it as a category in which we would like to keep doing some efforts, but at the same time, this is not necessarily the category that is going to move the needle. And as a matter of fact there is no one single category that's moves the needle for options. So we need to work in a number of initiatives and financial service is, is just one of them. This is not something that again has a ramp up <mark type="ph" /> card (38:24) which is very, very short. It might not be as long at least with the scope of services that we have decide to provide as a fast-food offering, but anyway it takes sometime to keep on bringing new banks, but of course we're starting with the big ones and then I would say the effect of the late entrance wouldn't be as important as the early entrance. So those will be my comments on the financial service question.</p>
          <p>And on the second one, we have said these and these is still our thinking, this is both as an investor FEMSA and as Directors in the Board of Heineken, we really need to have the long-term view for the company.</p>
          <p>So our decisions regarding again our recommendations to the Board and our decisions regarding our holding in the shares have a lot to do with how these investments for FEMSA will play out in the medium to long-term.</p>
          <p>There are some dates starting next year, which follows its shows the remainder that we'll need to continue to assess the perspectives of the business going forward to make sure that we still make the right decisions for our shareholders, which in the past, I mean, in the last two and a half years the decision that we made we think was a proper one in terms of again changing our investment mode in the beer business by exchanging our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:04) subsidiary into this 20% participation in Heineken. But to tell you the truth, we feel confident that the performance of the business over the last two and a half years, in which we have been invested in Heineken, have been very good.</p>
          <p>The market performance has been extremely well we think. I mean if you look at share price these days as compared when we made the exchange or the merge, we feel confident. So, the balance sheet of the company is as you know well or levered, both Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA as well. So, the Philippines is really not a factor. It's starting point as I mentioned Lore, in her question, also remember those that it's a starting point for what we might like to have as a broader participation in the <mark type="ph" /> Southeast (40:59) Asian market. So, my, again, statement here would be &#x2013; we need to look at these as &#x2013; again, the investment in Heineken is for the long-term for FEMSA, still has the characteristics and this is a permanent effort that is done on a permanent basis.</p>
          <p>And the fact that next year we start to have some flexibility to start disposing some of those shares, really doesn't translate into a critical day for us to either make a decision or have a big announcement to the market, do not expect that at all. This is a process that has to be very thoughtful and that it has to be very careful and I'm sure you can appreciate that we &#x2013; I mean we really do not, we really cannot share a lot of, again what our decision regarding our investment in this company would look like because we think its in the best interest of our shareholders to be very careful about what we decide, what we say and what we do about these in time.</p>
          <p>So we will still &#x2013; we have done in the past determine our decisions on the potential return of our investment in Heineken going forward. But as I said, what I can tell you is looking backwards, we feel very, very good about the decisions we have made in the past and we hope that you have confidence that we will do the same going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Thank you. And just one clarification, Javier, sorry, on the financial services, I mean on the banking services, is the goal to kind of roll it out really would all &#x2013; I mean all across the stores nationally or might you think about just kind of trying to get to certain penetration levels in certain regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a full &#x2013; it's a nationwide effort. The line of services which today as I said it's been narrow that the intention is to deploy that towards the store base. Going forward, we might evolve into a more segmented approach, but so far it's really a very nationwide effort, all services present in all source.</p>
