          <p>Okay, good morning. Welcome back, everyone, to a still quite cold and snowy Stockholm. We will present to you our Quarterly Report and our Full-Year Figures for 2009. We will have the familiar format where we will start with Lars Nyberg, our CEO and President. After that, we will have a presentation of the financials by Mr. Per-Arne Blomquist, our CFO. And after that, we will take your Q&amp;A, both here from the floor and from the press &#x2013; or the conference call.</p>
          <p>So without any further delay, I give the word to Lars, welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andreas. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. We had a pretty good fourth quarter, which made the year I think very strong, which I'm very proud of. We had flat sales that typically wouldn't be something I would be proud of, but in 2009 I am. I don't think there are too many companies that could say they had flat revenues in 2009. When I refer to flat revenues, of course, I talk in local currency, in Swedish kronor. It has increased because of the weakness of the Swedish kronor.</p>
          <p>Even more proud of course I'm of the record high EBITDA level that we achieved. During 2009, we improved the margins quite substantially. And we were very focused on cash flow, as we told you, when we started 2009 and that's certainly paid off. We increased the cash flow by 50%, more than SEK 17 billion. All of this is very much driven actually by our cost actions that we started more than two years ago, you might recall, very much focused in Sweden and Finland, but you could also see in 2009 that we were very careful with cost increases in Eurasia. This program, as I said, has been going on for two years.</p>
          <p>Over the years, we have talked about cost reduction at TeliaSonera but we haven't actually delivered any substantial cost reduction. The trend has been reversed. We have increased cost every year 6 or 7%. That trend has now broken, which I think is a very good sign and it's a credit to my colleagues and everybody who works in this company. You will see in the outlook for 2010 that we now expect the cost to be flat in '10 over '09.</p>
          <p>What makes me even more proud is actually the combination of these numbers I just shared with you, and this. We measure employee commitment score on an annual basis, started back in 2004 and in the last two years we have gone from 60% commitment to 68% of the people saying they're committed to our company. The blue dot that you see up there is actually when we include Eurasia. We have never measured them until this year. And typically, Eurasia is a little bit higher in scores like this, but they wouldn't be like they're here, TeliaSonera Eurasia is at 88% which is unbelievable. But forget Eurasia for a second, I'm extremely proud that we &#x2013; during two years of cost reduction, changing the processing, talking about performance and consequence management, we do get these kind reactions from our people. TeliaSonera being a services company, all companies are of course dependent on their people, but a service company particularly is dependent on the people being committed to change. And I think this is a confirmation that our employees thinks that we're on the right track.</p>
          <p>So, if I pick something that comes to my mind when I talk about 2009 positive things, I have to start with broadband obviously. Broadband has done a dramatic improvement in '09 over '08. And here I show the improved cash flow, but the profit looks the same. Something that you might not have thought about too much, but Mobility Sweden has done a tremendous job in '09. We increased the revenue in local currency in Swedish kronor by about 6%. And that proves to me that we can improve and grow even in a mature market. Sweden is clearly a mature market and we are clearly the leader.</p>
          <p>Something that is negative, but also positive is the third slide there. Yes, we have had problems like everybody else in the Baltic States. The business is down by 15 to 30% depending on which market you talk about, but look at the development of the EBITDA margin. You have to be impressed by our colleagues in those markets, that they were able to maintain an EBITDA margin when they lose something like 20 to 30% of their revenue; fantastic work in my opinion.</p>
          <p>Also Eurasia, the year was pretty eventful. Yes, we maintained or even improved our already high profit levels. We typically talk about 50% EBITDA margin in Eurasia. We defended mostly our market positions, that's important because we are typically number one. In Uzbekistan, we were number three when we started, we are now number two which we achieved during the mid of last year. And clearly, we are having the ambition to go for the number one position as we move forward. We are building out the networks both in Uzbekistan, more coverage, more capacity, and of course also in Nepal, which is going to be our next growth market I believe.</p>
          <p>You are familiar with the agreement we made with the Altimo from Alfa Group about the Turkcell and the MegaFon. Nothing has changed. I said then and I can repeat today that the value of that agreement lies in the execution of it, and nothing has changed in my mind on our probability to execute it. It will take we said then two years, and I think still it will take two years.</p>
          <p>Very happy with Eurasia, I'm particularly happy with the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we grew Eurasia by 3.6%, and in the fourth quarter we nearly doubled that. That's a good sign. I hope that trend would continue because Eurasia is a growth engine for TeliaSonera. Those of you who were on the Capital Markets Day remember that I talked about bandwidth, the appetite for bandwidth being unlimited. We truly believe that consumers as well as businesses &#x2013; companies have a demand for bandwidth that is unlimited. You will eat as much bandwidth as you get, as long as the cost is roughly the same.</p>
          <p>So, the challenge for us is we need to invest in bandwidth, whether it is in the mobile network or it's in the fixed network. Here I show of course the mobile network. We were very proud in December to be the first operator in the world to introduce, although on a limited scale, the 4G in the centre of Stockholm and Oslo. Our plan for 2010 now is to build that out. In Sweden, we will go to 25 cities. We were awarded a 4G license in Finland and there is an auction in the first half of this year for Denmark, and clearly we are &#x2013; we have of course the ambition to be active and to introduce this kind of technology, which in practice will give you 10 times the speed compared to 3G, because we believe the appetite for bandwidth is unlimited.</p>
          <p>We did introduce a pricing scheme in the spring of last year, for those of you who don't remember that, but we actually put a cap at 3 gigabyte per month. If you pass that, very few do, but if you pass that then you either have to pay a little bit more or you get slower speed till the next month. Most of the competitors follow that and I think that the whole industry will have to adopt a model where we have some sort of control over the volume of traffic in our network. I'm absolutely sure that we will be able to like the Moore's law double the capacity every 18 months at the same cost as a principle, but we need to control with speed the traffic volume growth and that we can do via pricing.</p>
          <p>Broadband, we had a strong growth in IP-based services. This is the future. The classic telecom is fading away and we need to move the broadband business to be all IP-based reasonably quickly. And you can here see that we have had growth and success both in IPTV and video-on-demand. In Sweden, we are now I think the biggest video rental organization or company. And we grew the IP-based revenues by 21%. Roughly 37, 38% of our broadband revenue is now based on IP technology.</p>
          <p>If you want to be a player long-term in this industry and if you believe that the appetite for bandwidth is unlimited, you have to invest. And the question is when do you invest? The group management and the Board has decided that we think it's time to invest cautiously this year. We hope, believe that the economy might turn in the second half of this year, if not at least in '11. We don't believe in a double dip or we are betting on not having a double dip. So we will increase our CapEx in 2010 compared to '09. And of course, the areas are Mobility Services, the 4G build-out I just talked about, increases our coverage in 3G both in Finland and in Denmark.</p>
          <p>Yes, we will build out selectively fiber, and I will come back to that with some more details in a minute. I told you about the rollout in Nepal and Uzbekistan in Eurasia. The biggest criticism we get from our employees when we talk about the employee commitment score is actually our processes and our &#x2013; and the tools that we provide for our employees. We need to invest in that. That is mainly IP-based investments.</p>
          <p>Talk about fiber; this picture shows how the split of the CapEx for broadband looked in '09 and how it will look in '10. And as you can see, the most &#x2013; the first and most important is the blue piece, which is the classic telecom, is going down. It has to go down. We reallocate that money to the new technology, which is IP-based and fiber. And on top of that, we put more money before fiber.</p>
          <p>I would like to say one thing when it comes to Sweden. There is discussion about regulation on fiber. Fundamentally I don't think it's necessary, because I think we have changed our positions somewhat in TeliaSonera in the last two years. We like traffic in our network, regardless we generate that traffic. The more traffic we get to our network, the better it is for our company and for our shareholders. So, I welcome any other operator who would like to use our networks for serving their customers. However, the pricing needs to be in a way that I can feel reasonably assured that our shareholders will get the return on the investment. So, if we would get a regulation where prices will be uncertain or maybe even decided by some bureaucrats, I will not invest or we will not invest. This is a very important issue for us. We have these plans assuming that if there is a regulation, which as I said I don't think it's necessary, but if it is &#x2013; there's a regulation, that that regulation for sure does not hinder us to get the return on investment. We think we can add about 190,000 households that we pass that we could offer fiber connection to, so we would reach about a 0.5 million in Sweden and more than 400,000 in Finland.</p>
          <p>Yes, so we are investing in the future. You can see in the left-hand side that in '10, we will go slightly below 15% of sales compared to the 12.8 that we had in '09. And again, we do this not for the year 2010, but we do it for the year '11, '12, and '13 and '14 and so on. We are so successful that we &#x2013; at the same time that we raised the CapEx the Board has decided to increase the dividend by 25% to 2.25, that's the suggestion to the shareholder meeting. We also changed the &#x2013; or they also changed the policy. Our policy was to at least give 40% of the profit to the shareholders, has now changed to at least 50%. Why do we do this? Well, we compete for investors like we compete for customers in the marketplace. The industry typically has a yield of about 5.5%. With 1.80 we were below 4, and at least with this decision we are getting closer to the average of the industry and makes us more compelling to invest in for investors.</p>
          <p>Finally the outlook, somewhat higher sales and we can argue what somewhat means, don't ask me because I don't know, but it certainly doesn't mean a lot, but somewhat. And I think that's a positive sign. As I said, we are cautiously optimistic about the marketplace. The trend in Eurasia, I described to you, in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter is a positive sign. Our performance in Mobility Sweden is a positive sign. In the Baltics, we are still having...</p>

          <p>Is it in the local currency?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, always local currency. We only talk about local currencies because we never know about the kronor.</p>
          <p>As I said, the addressable cost we took down dramatically in the past two years. We intend to maintain that level during '10, and because of the math, then of course the margin should improve somewhat if the two other ones are true. And as I said, the CapEx will be somewhat below 15%, clearly a sign of confidence, clearly a sign of commitment for this company long-term, which I feel very comfortable with.</p>
          <p>Per-Arne?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. I was advised by Cecilia not to say that this is a quarter of more of the same, so I don't say that. But it was still a very, very good quarter. What you could see here is that we continued to improve and increase our margins. We still have a strong cash flow, and this is done by the fact that we have taken down the cost also in the fourth quarter by roughly 10 or 11%.</p>
          <p>Net sales continue to be rather flattish compared to last year. And as also was raised here, we are always looking at the underlying development on our sales. You can see why. We started 2009 with a weakening of the Swedish krona. We sort of built up a higher reported topline than we actually had. Now, on the contrary we have a stronger Swedish krona, which means that what is reported is not as bad as it looks like. So that is why we always look at this, and I should advise you also to continue to do that with other operators in this region as well, we will still just look at the underlying business what it shows.</p>
          <p>And for the full year, and we already talked about this, 109 billion in net sales, which means that we were rather flattish. We came out with 11% more in EBITDA and we actually succeeded to increase our EBITDA margin with close to 2% units. And given the strong cash flow that we generated, we have also continued to have a very, very strong balance sheet, 1.3 in net-debt-to-EBITDA.</p>
          <p>And that also means that if you look at the outlook that we talked about and we've revised it slightly in the middle of 2009, we came out with net sales slightly below 2008 as we said. We were below the addressable cost base with close to 7%, also rather good improvement. We exceeded the margin level of 2008, as I said, we're close to 2% units. CapEx-to-sales ratio 12.8, we said 13 to 14, and this was also &#x2013; we expected to have some cost for licenses in the fourth quarter and we said if they do not come we will be on the low range of the 13 to 14. And we also said that we should back-end load our CapEx, we said that very early in 2009 and that was what we did. So, if you look at the figures you could see that we had higher CapEx-to-sales ratio in 2009 that we had in 2008. Number of employees, somewhat below 30,000, and we ended up with 29,700. So, we have delivered upon what we have said and I think we are very proud of that.</p>
          <p>We are also proud of the cost that we'd talked about. We'd talked many times about this in different quarterly reports. And we also stated that when we started this journey early 2009 or already in 2008, we said that we will attack the structural cost. You could see here on the figures that our cost, the personnel costs are down in the fourth quarter with 12%. So the IT cost, marketing downward 18. Have we stopped to market ourselves, now you could see here we still market ourselves pretty heavily. But we have been much tougher in the prioritization of our marketing activities and that has also paid off. Other cost is then downward 10 to 13% and you could also see the year-end figure downward 7. Sweden and Finland have made a tremendous effort in taking down the cost, especially within broadband. So overall, they are downward 9% on a whole year basis and for the quarter 11%, so you can see more or less the same pattern when it comes to personnel cost and also other cost.</p>
          <p>Turning down into the different business areas, I think I'm very pleased to say that we have seen the recovery of the margin in Mobility. If you look at the margin today, for the fourth quarter roughly 30% compared to 27 last year or in 2008, means that they are back on track roughly at 29%. However, we have a very different structure in this business area with growth in Sweden 5, 6% during the year and 6.4 in the last quarter. We are growing in Spain.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, if you take the Nordic area, Denmark and Finland downward 1 to 4%, Norway downward 10% very much affected by interconnection fees, and the Baltics continued to be downward 15, 16, up to 25%. And as also Lars said, I think we should give our colleagues very much credit that they have actually defended more in the Baltic areas. With such a big fall on topline, I think they have made a tremendous good job. It's also worth nothing here that Spain was improving the results. They were previously at 300 million loss in the Q3 were down at 200, now they're down to 150. So we're moving in the right direction. We still reiterate our forecast that we should be EBITDA positive in the fourth quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Broadband Services has also made a tremendous job on the cost side. Cash flow almost tripled in the fourth quarter and this is very much impacted by the cost, which were downward more than 20% in the fourth quarter. Finland and Sweden have been able to increase their margins with 10% units. And I think that's a very, very good sign with the job what they have done. Of course they have a concern on topline. It's still going down and that is a challenge for this year, to make sure that we start to get growth also in this area. But so far I think that the job that I has been on the cost, that has been very, very good.</p>
          <p>In Eurasia we continue to see high margins, we also see higher growth. Lars said about coming up to 7% compared to 3% and it's good to see that Kazakhstan is returning, we see growth in Tajikistan and we see also growth in Uzbekistan. Nepal adding on quite a lot of customers and we do this with sustained capability on the profit side. EBITDA is still at 50%. Here we have also to look, as you saw up there on the second page that the currency impact is pretty big. So be careful when you look at these figures going forward, which have a lot of things in the currency.</p>
          <p>We back-end loaded the CapEx during 2009 and I think that if you look at the future, now talking about lower than 15%, is more or less back to the level that we had in 2008. I would, however, claim that we have been working very much with our internal teams when it comes to how to approve CapEx. So, I'm more confident today when we look at the CapEx what we actually invest in then I was, let's say, a year, a year-and-a-half ago. And you could also see the split here among the different business areas, roughly one-third goes into the different business areas in CapEx also in 2009.</p>
          <p>The combination of better results and lower CapEx has generated a very good cash flow, we have said that. That also gives us a very solid financial position with net-debt-to-EBITDA of roughly 1.3, which is down from roughly 1.6, a bit more than a year ago. We have a very good debt maturity schedule. If you look here, the coming 5, 6 years we need to refund roughly 6 to 8 billion every year, which is not very much with a company of TeliaSonera's size. We were able to raise funds in November. We made a Eurobond of roughly &#x20AC;600 million. Order book was close to 5 billion. 12 years money, we paid 475 for the coupon, 480 all-in. That's a very, very good price and this shows also the sign or our ability to get funds from the market to a very, very good price. And we still continue to look at that to see if there are opportunities to fund ourselves long-term. We will do that when the time and the price is right.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, this also means that we have a proposal for the Board of Directors to increase the dividend to SEK 2.25, 25% up. We also revised the dividend policy to say that the ordinary dividends will be at least 50% of net income. And we will also go with a proposal to the AGM over the purchase of roughly 10% of outstanding shares. This is the things that we need to have to manage our capital base and also capital structures. I will stop there.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are ready to take your questions. We will start with a few questions from the audience present here and then we will take a few questions from the conference call. But we start from the floor, Stefan please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Start with some questions regarding the fiber investments, you say that you will await some regulatory clearance on this fiber investments. Does this mean that you will wait to deploy this investment until you have a clear message from the regulator, and does this mean that this fiber deployment, sort of the risk is that this will be postponed further out in, say, 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I will not wait. We will continue roll out. We just increase the speed a little bit, but I actually don't expect the regulation to in the end be a big problem for us. And I certainly hope for Sweden it won't be because there aren't too many players who have the muscle to invest this kind of money. We have the muscle, we are willing to invest it because we believe it's a good thing for our shareholders. But I am saying, if the regulation in the end would turn out to, for instance, be very unclear on how you can price your service, then the whole discussion on the investment will change here because we talk about quite a big sum of money that I need to feel reasonably sure that we have the prices in the marketplace that yields a return for our shareholders, but we will not wait, we are going now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking a little bit ahead into the future, it's still quite a low percentage of Swedish households that will pass with fiber investments. Should we expect similar kind of investments going forward? And what sort of is a level that you want to reach in terms of number of households?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Of course, we will continue to invest in '11 and '12 and '13 in our network. I mean fundamentally, we are telecoms operator and I believe the appetite for bandwidth is unlimited. So, our challenge is to continue to invest in bandwidth. The good news is I think the prices, the cost will go down or the capacity will go up for the same cost, that's the more slow I was referring to before. I think you should read the word selectively. We are investing in fiber selectively. So, we will pick the places where we invest in fiber and it will not be a rollout like the copper rollout a 100 years ago, that won't happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I have a question to Per-Arne. Regarding the cost structure that you showed on page 19 regarding the cost base in Sweden and Finland, can you elaborate or explain a little bit what's included in other cost, which was down significantly this quarter? And is this a sustainable improvement or is this more of a one-time item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have in other cost is, it's rents, it's sort of all other activities that's not included in the marketing and personnel cost, which means there's quite a lot. And what we are doing here, we're trying to stay sort of in our corners and then what is sustainable, I know this is very much up to how we decide to continue in the cost side and that will be decided upon how our topline is growing. But of course, we could sustain that. It is not that we have sort of tried to stop all activities. If you look &#x2013; especially if you look at the marketing, even though it's downward 18%, we still market ourselves. But I think the most important thing is that we have taken down the structural cost when it comes to personnel.</p>

          <p>It's a tool in the toolbox. There is a &#x2013; we have a slight complication because we have two big owners, Swedish and the Finnish state, who has at least said directionally they want to sell or lower their ownership. And if we were to buy stock over the stock market and not they participating, they actually would increase their ownership. So that's a complication. We'll see if we can find a solution for that. But I personally, and I think the management and I think the Board too, we feel stock buyback is a good way of distributing results to our shareholders. I actually like it better than one-time dividends, because the shareholders and everybody else seems to forget that they got the dividend. They do remember the 85 kronor they paid for the share and then they forget all the one-time payment. So, I prefer to buy back stock and get the stock price up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can I also ask you, on your CapEx-to-sales levels now, how long do you expect that you will stay on a higher CapEx-to-sales level, because Eurasia once growth starts to slow and your investments there are finished, do you expect to come down in a couple of years time and what would then be your CapEx-to-sales rate?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we give you, compared to earlier days, fairly detailed projections for this year. We don't start giving you projections for next year. But in general terms, I think the 12.8 we had last year was on the low-end side of an average over 10 years and I think if you go to close to 15 is probably on the high-end side of an average over 10 years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we used to have said is that over time something between 10 to 15 might be reasonable. I do not believe that it should be well below 10%, which is sometime stated in the <mark type="inaudible" />. I can't really see how you should be able to do that, given the investment needs that you have in this industry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also maybe one final question on marketing spend, which you said was down 18%. How much of this do you think is related to lower activity overall due to the economic recession and how much do you think is a sort of active decision by you and that can be sustained even if marketing picks up overall in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's a combination. I mean, some of these are active decisions that we have made and it's different from market to market as well. I think we have perhaps lower activity in Finland, it was higher in Sweden. So it's &#x2013; I think it's a combination of these things. And of course if the market turns up, we would have higher market activities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I think we should critically look at our marketing cost, maybe little more critically than we have historically had done because it's not only a question of how much we invest, it's also the value of it. And I want to see also some new messages than just the product and the price. I think we can do more and I think we're preparing for that.</p>

          <p>Thanks. A bit on the topline side, Eurasia when you look at the sequential improvement in organic growth, how do you see this trend progressing into 2010? I mean, obviously it's encouraging, but do you see an acceleration, is this cyclical recovery more than a structural one or is it anything happening in the marketplace that we should be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I sort of touched up on it in my initial comments. I am encouraged that the growth rate increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. That's clearly a positive sign in my book. And I would say I am cautiously optimistic that, that wasn't a one quarter thing. I have some hopes that they will return to high growth rates in 2010 than in '09, but I can't be sure and it's very much dependent on different markets there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, these are emerging markets. So this is new subscribers, I mean you take the extreme, Nepal, we've gone from something like 16% penetration to 19 or whatever it is now. In other markets, we are getting closer to the 100%, but you have to be careful when you look at penetration numbers in Eurasia because we count SIM cards and they have &#x2013; some people have six SIM cards. But it's mainly driven by a higher penetration in the marketplace, very different from the mature markets in the Baltic and Nordic.</p>

          <p>We will come back to questions on the floor. But in the meantime, we have quite a number of questions on the conference call. So operator, can we please have the first question from the conference call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>The first question comes from Mr. Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux. Two questions please. Firstly, the improvement in the EBITDA margin you expect for 2010, is that mainly driven by lower losses in Spain?</p>
          <p>My second question relates to Swedish mobile broadband, I believe pricing has improved somewhat as Lars alluded to in his initial remarks. Is it possible to elaborate a bit on what you are seeing among your mobile broadband subscribers as has been reflected in an improvement in ARPU for these users? And can you probably tell us a bit how much sort of mobile data now makes up of your revenues and the kind of growth rates you are seeing there? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start &#x2013; this is Lars, if I start, the EBITDA improvement, it's sort of mathematic, if you do get growth on the topline and the costs are stable, you will have improved margin. So &#x2013; but of course, Spain is a contributor. We have predicted that Spain will be at breakeven in the fourth quarter of this year and if that happen which &#x2013; better, then of course that will help us. On the detailed issues on ARPU, I have to look at Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take that one. On mobile broadband, Peter Kurt, you were referring to that the pricing environment was becoming a little bit better. And I think that we can subscribe to that comment, the free offers that has been in the market the previous year have been less frequent this year and out of the 6% revenue growth that we see in Swedish Mobile at least a third comes from growth in mobile data. So, quite an amount coming from increased usage in data.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, we'll take another question from the conference call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Tim Boddy from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my question. I've got a couple of questions. First of all, about the returns on your investments in fiber, obviously the regulatory situation is somewhat unclear. But beyond the regulatory outlook, what are the key factors that you are relying on to achieve returns, presumably close to the group's current level of returns from the fiber? Are you anticipating market share gain, are you anticipating significant ARPU enhancement, etcetera?</p>
          <p>My second question is really just around the situation at MegaCell. Obviously, there has been a statement from the government indicating some disease with, I guess, Altimo being in a situation of controlling two of the operators and I suppose particularly for Telia the questions around the dividend distribution from MegaFon, is that completely tied to the resolution of MegaCell or could we see dividends from MegaFon sooner than a likely lengthy process as a result of what's happening in MegaCell? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I never heard about the company called MegaCell, but if you're talking about MegaFon and Turkcell, and I think your questions were about MegaFon, I don't think anything has changed. Yes, there are discussions and people have opinions. We have not together with Altimo even applied for a permission in Russia yet, because we have said and agreed with Altimo that we should put priority on resolving the issues in Turkcell first. And I said before, the proof in this agreement is delivering what we have said publicly what we want to achieve. I don't feel more optimistic or more pessimistic about our chances to accomplish this today than I did when I &#x2013; when we announced the deal. Nothing has changed for me. It's a long process. It's a complicated process. But I have some degree of confidence that it will happen. It will be really good if it happens for our shareholders because it will increase control and liquidity which has been our ambition from the start. What's the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was about returns on fiber?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. I think the key issue on the fiber investment is actually the number of people who say, yes please, I would like to have fiber connection, is that 10%, 50%, or 85% makes a huge difference in the calculation. So, you pass a house or an apartment, how many of those people you pass say, yes, I'd like to have this service. I think that's the most crucial and we make some assumptions there, which I will not share with you obviously. And one of the things that we want to monitor is exactly how many are actually behind the service. Then the ARPU is the other one that drives.</p>
          <p>If you look &#x2013; if you skip the technology called fiber, if you start talking about broadband or fixed network, if you can get customer to move from a voice fixed network customer to become a triple-play customer, the ARPU of course goes up dramatically, although margin on some of those services is lower than it is on fixed voice only. But I think it's absolutely a sustainable model and the investment in fiber I think will give us good return over time. The thing to monitor, the thing to look for is how many people do actually sign up for it as a percentage of the people we pass.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Just on the MegaFon dividend, is that then intrinsically tied to the outcome?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I mean the MegaFon dividend is an issue for the MegaFon Board and all players are on that Board. It seems logical for me that all should want to have a dividend, but over the years there's always someone who says, I don't want a dividend for whatever reason. Now we have SEK 17 billion overall of cash flow this year. We're not particularly in desperate need of that cash, but we're clearly interested to get a regular dividend for MegaFon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Tim. We'll take one more question from the conference call before taking some questions from the floor. So operator, one more question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Ulrich Rathe from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In your guidance for 2010, you're talking very much about the addressable cost base. Could you give us sort of some sense of direction on the non-addressable part of the cost base so that we can gauge how much of the revenue upside might actually fall through to EBITDA? It's more a directional question. I suppose you don't want to sort of guide specifically that.</p>
          <p>The second question is sort of tied into the previous one on the returns on fiber. I was just wondering taking a step back how you actually think about this. Do you consider investments in LTE, investments in fiber as almost like a replacement cost to have a growing concern and therefore they are not so standalone projects with an NPV or do you consider them specific projects that you essentially sort of judge by with an investment budget calculation on NPV and then decide what return you want to make a decision whether you go or not? So in other words, this is more driven sort of by the overall competitive environment and your need to stay in business or do you consider them incremental investments, which are discretionary to the degree that you can derive a return? I was just sort of wondering how you think that in the big picture. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second one, and you won't be happy with this answer because a little bit of both. Clearly, we are guided by the conviction that we have that the appetite for bandwidth is unlimited. Also by the fact that our strategy is to be a telecoms operator, that's what we're good at. Maybe it doesn't sound very innovative, but that's what we have decided to be, we'll continue to be a good world-class telecom operator.</p>
          <p>If you believe in those two statements or you agree with these two statements, then there is no discussion that as such a company, we have to invest in expanding the bandwidth to our customers. And we expanded both in the mobile network as well as in the fixed network. Then I said selectively in fiber. We cannot do a rollout in fiber like we did in the copper years and years ago. So, we will invest as the demand picks up.</p>
          <p>And another issue is going to be what kind of content is going to be distributed over these networks. And that's why we invested in IPTV a couple of years ago because I think TV and particularly when we get HDTV I think that's going to be a big portion of the traffic in the net. But lots of other service will be there too. So, yes, I think it's strategically absolutely important. That does not mean we invest and don't really care about the return on the investment. We do care. But of course, we are maybe willing to take a little bit bigger risk than we would otherwise if it wasn't strategic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question was more related to, I'd say, our gross margin, how that will develop during the year. And we'll remind you to say that &#x2013; remember that every year more or less we start with a negative starting point with new regulatory issues that takes down the gross margin perhaps 5, 6, 8, 900 million. And what we try to do is to offset that with better sourcing and also lower prices. So, I think that to just sustain the gross margin is an achievement as such. Do not expect that to be a big driver. I mean we try to keep the addressable cost rather flattish and then also the gross margin flattish. But that's a challenge as such.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we will continue to perhaps not as heavily back-end load as we did in 2009, but it will be very much based on performance as well. So we're not <mark type="inaudible" /> we will be cautious, especially when it comes to Eurasia to see that things are moving in the right direction. Fiber is a bit more tricky, but also if you have decided to go for it you have to go for it, but I think we will continue to be cautious because we have more than just fiber. We will be cautious there as well, so not front-end load everything.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the margin on Mobility Sweden. Yes, I think the management in Mobility Sweden has been very focused on doing a good job in the marketplace to start with. I think having that kind of growth rate compared to our competitors is pretty damn good. At the same time, I'm pushing hard for kind of call that pushing hard for be careful, be cautious with the COGS, be cautious with the addressable cost because we want to make that margin wider if we can. To be realistic, I don't think we can see a significant improvement of the margins. I think that will be a bit na&#xEF;ve to think that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. A couple of questions please. Firstly on Swedish Mobile, it seemed to me the service revenue growth was a little more stable in Q3 with a strong growth in data offsetting voice. It has just nudged down a little in Q4, right. The data growth is still strong, but the voice pressure perhaps a little higher. Do we think that mobile data growth can continue to fully offset voice in 2010? Should we expect by the end of the year we'll still see a positive service revenue?</p>
          <p>And then my second point, it is very good to listen to a management team talk so openly I think about the whole bandwidth issue and the need to correctly or to better price that. I just wondered on whole issue of CapEx and CapEx per unit capacity, CapEx per megabyte, let's say, whether you expect the decline in that trend to continue versus last year or whether you think the decline can even accelerate that you get an even cheaper rate on how much your network capacity is costing? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars. Let me take the last question, because this is a crucial question for our company. If you believe the appetite for bandwidth is unlimited, it will only be unlimited if the cost is sort of flattish, and the cost, the price for the bandwidth can only be flattish if the cost for the equipment goes down or stays stable and the bandwidth doubles, that's the Moore's law principle. If that doesn't work, then we will not be able to provide the bandwidth that the consumer would like to have because we will have to double the price for double the bandwidth, and nobody is going to pay double the price for double the bandwidth.</p>
          <p>I am absolutely convinced based on historical data in the IT industry, but also what we have seen in the last year and a half, prices are coming down because of technology and if we get this more lower kind of environment where you get double the capacity, let's say, every 18 months or every two years at the same cost. If that happens and that is happening, then we will be able to provide or give the satisfaction to the unlimited demand for, or appetite, for bandwidth. This is something that I think all of you who are involved in this industry should be looking at very carefully and follow. We do, because I think this is the key to our industry's growth and becoming a really exciting industry.</p>

          <p>Yes I think the mobile data will continue to grow, but I also think that we still have a rather high portion of voice going over to fixed line and we would probably see some sort of increase also on the voice from the mobile side.

          <p>Thank you, David. We take another question from the conference call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Soomit Datta from New Street Research. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there, I've got couple of questions please. The first is, again going back to fiber, I might have missed this, but could you say when you expect to hear more definitively on the regulatory situation in Sweden please? And then on fiber also, just more specifically looking at the ARPU issue, would you expect within the broadband product people to pay more for higher speed, specifically going forward when they are available? That's on fiber.</p>
          <p>And then just another question on the fixed business, the external revenue trend seemed to get a little bit worse in Q4 versus if you look at the year-over-year comparables, can you maybe sort of help us understand what's happening in the Swedish fixed business and is it sort of continuing fixed mobile substitution, which is the main driver of that? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I start with the regulatory discussions, I hope and expect that we will have some clarity on this issue in the first half of this year. I don't know, I don't run that process, but I &#x2013; that's what we expect. What's the other one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>ARPU on fiber.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, clearly as I said before, the most important thing is that we get our fixed voice customer to become a triple-play customer because that drives ARPU dramatically. And fiber is a necessity I think for the future because of this unlimited appetite for bandwidth. Will people pay more for higher bandwidth? Yes, a little bit, but not a lot. Certainly not double bandwidth, double price, absolutely not. But of course, if I can offer you 1 gigabit per second in your home, will you pay something more than compared to 8 megabit per second? Yes, you will, and I think you're prepared to do that. But that's not the key to the business model. The key to the business model is this Moore's law that I was talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your third question regarding weakness in external sales and fixed, Soomit. Yes, it was a little bit weaker in the third quarter but it was very much in line with what you saw in Q1 and Q2. And if you look at the performance indicators that I know that you're looking closely at like line loss and broadband ARPU, you will see that it was very, very similar throughout the year. So, there is no change in the competitive landscape in Sweden fixed.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you hear me now? Okay. I have a question regarding the money that you received as a settlement from Turkcell and MegaFon this quarter. I was wondering exactly what that money relates to and also little bit of the timing of that money because as I understand that nothing has closed, so why are you paid now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, we received about $50 million, something like that. That was part of the deal with Altimo. I thought it was a good clause in the contract.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a very good clause, but given that they still don't have the Cukurova shares...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, listen, we've decided to become partners with Altimo. We have a fairly long road to go. We have told you what the end game is, what we want to achieve this new company. And there are a number of steps that I won't go into, and one of the steps was taken and that was a payment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will there be any more money if there are any more hurdles met?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Maybe I can't remember now, but it's not so important whether $50 million is paid out. I think it's a sign of the partnership. I think it's a sign of we have a solid agreement that we both respect. The most important thing is to achieve what we said we will achieve. I said it before, the value of the Altimo agreement is to achieve what we agreed to try to achieve. When we achieve regulatory approvals in Russia, in Turkey, if we get the whole of the control of Turkcell via those shares, then we have created value, whether $50 million comes to us or not is not really relevant in my opinion, but it's a sign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But given that when those shares will be delivered, there could potentially be another payment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, don't think that there's going to come hundreds of millions of dollars from the sky. That's not where the value is going to be created. First of all, there is not going to be any money of that kind as far as I remember. The value is that Altimo and TeliaSonera share the control then of Turkcell and share the control of MegaFon. That's the ambition that we have via this new company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just looking at the development in the Baltics where all countries showed at least compared to my numbers some weakness and especially Lithuania was weaker than we expected. And this trend was also seen in Tele2's reporting. Can you say anything about the development in Lithuania? Why is this happening this late in the economic cycle and what should we expect going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what to expect going forward is, first of all, no, we haven't seen a sort of rebound in the economy, number one. That is still an open issue. And then we have had some, let's say, competition on prices in Lithuania the last two quarters and that might affect. I don't know if we have any more to kind of add to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think this is a macroeconomic situation that we don't manage or even have any influence on.

You lose a quarter of revenue; if you maintain the EBITDA margin percentage you're doing a darn good job, I would like to say.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'd just like to come back to the cost development forecast for 2010. Within that flat development, do you see that cost in the growing part of the business, i.e.,  Eurasia will be higher to drive that growth, and costs in the mature markets in Finland to be flat or to be lower compared to 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's simple. If you want flat costs in the company and somebody increases cost then somebody has to decrease cost. It's all mathematics. And yes, I think we are going to increase cost in Eurasia, which means that some other places will have to come down. I don't think it's big numbers, I won't say that. You shouldn't speculate in new lay-off programs, that's not on the program. But in mature markets, we have to be extremely careful with the cost.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Additional question on CapEx. In relation to the Q4 guidance, was there still the 4G licenses in Finland and potentially Denmark. Finland half-time then was at a very small nominal value. In the guidance for 2010, I presume that you are factoring in license payments for Denmark. Are there any other licenses that you believe will be up for auction in 2010 included in your about 15% guidance?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I'll hopefully keep it reasonably brief. I was just hoping to understand a little bit more the quite strong margin improvement that you had in Finland compared to a year ago. Can you maybe just give us a sense of how that breaks down between better cost control and less competition, just at a high level? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually both, margins are up substantially in both fixed and in mobile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that basically, I mean we've taken out quite a number of people here. So that is the first part. Then of course I think that they have been a bit cautious on the marketing side as well. So, I think these are the two major factors that have improved the margin.</p>

          <p>We take the final question from the conference call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final question comes from Mr. Andrew Lee from Citi. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'll try my luck with this question, but you mentioned an aspiration to get towards a sector dividend yield of 5.5%. So the question is what can get you to that yield over the next year, and do you think that's possible? Can you sort out the ownership issues to allow buyback this year? If not, would you consider a special dividend instead just for this year even though I heard you mention you favor buyback in principle, or could the ordinary dividend payout get to enough to generate a 5.5% yield?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I wonder if you could just make a brief comment on where Swedish mobile competition is, how it's developing? Tele2 is pushing for growth, Telenor at least tells us that it's trying to turn the business around. Do you see any significant change in Swedish mobile competition through 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I hope nothing changes in Swedish mobile in 2010. I like the 2009 results. But of course we have fierce competitors, so we have to be on the alert side. I feel great confidence in the management team. I know they're very enthusiastic and very happy. So, we'll see. I hope we can deliver the same kind of results in '10 as we did in '09.</p>
          <p>When it comes to this dividend, I don't want to say much more than I already said. I think the Board has taken this decision to increase the dividend, the ordinary dividend. The 25% is a great first step. Hopefully, there will be other steps later on, but I'm not going to speculate in that. Of course, it's dependent on our results and our cash generating ability. And I said very clearly that I prefer, and I think the Board supports that, the stock buyback compared to one-time dividend, and I don't want to speculate when what can happen. First of all, it's not my decision, it's the Board's decision. And I think the Board has showed a very clear sign of wanting to improve the yield for TeliaSonera, making us in a more attractive company to invest in.</p>
