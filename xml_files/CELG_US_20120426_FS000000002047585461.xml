        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review the results of the first quarter and our outlook for the full year. 2012 is a year of multiple important milestones with the potential to transform Celgene. I'll share with you our significant progress toward achieving these milestones and advancing key programs.</p>
          <p>Before I review these major inflection points let me provide my perspective on our financial results. The first quarter results demonstrated strong annual growth of 17% in product sales, and 30% growth in non-GAAP earnings.</p>
          <p>These financial results were at the low end of our expectations. Our global businesses had a slower than anticipated January. Importantly though, across geographies, positive momentum built during February and March and this trajectory is continuing into April. This positive momentum was partially offset by some end of quarter customer inventory reductions, primarily in the United States.</p>
          <p>Given our current trajectory and outlook for the full year, we are reaffirming our 2012 guidance of 15% revenue and 25% earnings per share growth. Our teams are focused and well positioned to achieve these targets. And Jackie and Mark will provide greater detail in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our key strategic initiatives designed to enhance our growth well into the future. Maximizing REVLIMID's full potential is an important growth driver for 2012 and beyond. During the quarter, we advanced a number of initiatives positioning REVLIMID for continued strong growth. In February, we submitted our REVLIMID marketing application for del 5q MDS in Europe, with the potential for a regulatory decision by year end. And in terms of our newly diagnosed multiple myeloma application in Europe, we submitted our responses to the 180-day questions and are on track for a CHMP recommendation by the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>The benefits of growth from geographic expansion are quite clear. And progress has been achieved during the quarter in advancing our relapsed/refractory myeloma applications in Mexico, Brazil and China. All with the potential for regulatory or reimbursement action during the year.</p>
          <p>Myeloma is an important growth driver for REVLIMID and we are equally committed to realizing its full potential to benefit patients across other hematological malignancies. The REVLIMID program in the lymphomas and leukemia are progressing rapidly. We've completed the accrual in our special protocol assessment mantle cell lymphoma trial and are planning for a regulatory submission within the next 9 to 12 months. Based on positive results in our DCL-001 REVLIMID relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma study, we're advancing into the Phase III portion of the trial. We also continue to accrue patients in our other two Phase III lymphoma studies in DLBCL maintenance and follicular lymphoma.</p>
          <p>In chronic lymphocytic leukemia we expect to complete enrollment in our Phase III first line study in elderly patients by yearend. With the addition of AVL-292 from the Avila acquisition we're accelerating combination studies with this Btk inhibitor and REVLIMID CLL and lymphomas.</p>
          <p>One of our most important achievements of the past few months is the submission to the FDA of our new drug application for pomalidomide, our next generation immunomodulatory therapy for heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients. This submission is a major step forward in broadening our product portfolio and strengthening our myeloma franchise.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're accelerating our regulatory progress in Europe. We're on track to submit our marketing application during this quarter. As the potential impact of this product on both myeloma patients and Celgene is significant, we'll update you on our progress navigating the regulatory processes including acceptance of filings and the type and timing of reviews. I should note that our international Phase III multiple myeloma study, MM-003 is expected to complete accrual later this quarter. Additionally, during this quarter we completed accrual of our Phase III myelofibrosis study, MF-002 and are initiating a Phase II pomalidomide study in systemic sclerosis.</p>
          <p>Our hematology/oncology portfolio was also strengthened by clinical and regulatory progress achieved with ABRAXANE. Our supplemental new drug application for ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer has been filed with the FDA and has an October PDUFA date.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we completed enrollment in the Phase III ABRAXANE trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The trial enrolled over 800 patients and will answer the question whether the addition of ABRAXANE to gemcitabine meaningfully improves overall survival. If the data are consistent with Phase II filings, and we'll know that in the next nine to 12 months, we believe that ABRAXANE would have a transformative impact on the treatment of the disease. I should also note that we'll see Phase III data in melanoma for ABRAXANE in the coming three to four months. Excellent progress.</p>
          <p>Apremilast holds the promise of a new therapeutic franchise for Celgene. There is a major market opportunity for a safe and effective orally available therapy for the over 3 million patients in the United States and Europe suffering from psoriatic arthritis and moderate to severe psoriasis, the initial indications in our registration program. As we've reported, our five Phase III studies have been fully accrued and pivotal data are targeted on all the studies by year end. The initial data readout will begin with psoriatic arthritis this summer. Assuming positive data, we plan on initial regulatory submissions early next year.</p>
          <p>Speaking of Phase III trials, based on the data presented last fall at the American College of Rheumatology meeting, we've recently initiated the Apremilast Phase III study in ankylosing spondylitis, AS-001. I should also point out that within the next few weeks we expect to provide top-line data on our Phase IIb rheumatoid arthritis study. Assuming a positive outcome we're preparing to initiate our Phase III program as soon as possible. 2012 is a year of significant data flow and great promise for Apremilast.</p>
          <p>We also made progress advancing our deep and diverse mid stage pipeline as well. We have seven additional novel products in clinical development, spanning hematology, oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases that provide new platforms for delivering therapies to patients with serious unmet medical needs. We look forward to communicating about these programs as they advance in development.</p>
          <p>We have a leadership position in epigenetics, a therapeutic class in which we market two of the four approved oncology products, VIDAZA and ISTODAX. This morning we announced a strategic collaboration with Epizyme, a leader in the discovery and development of compounds inhibiting a new class of epigenetic enzymes, a mechanistic and therapeutic category that we increasingly believe will have broad potential in a wide range of malignancies.</p>
          <p>We have an active epigenetics development program and are advancing CC-486, oral azacitidine into a Phase III registration study in lower risk MDS by the end of this year. And based upon new data discussed at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in early April, we will begin trials in multiple solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer later this year.</p>
          <p>All in all, we have made significant progress this quarter. We're committed to further strengthening our capabilities to innovate and deliver novel therapies to patients worldwide. We are leveraging our leadership position in hematology and expanding into oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases. We look forward to updating you with the outcomes of the many important inflection points that are expected throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the call over to Jackie to review our financial results.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Celgene produced good year over year financial results for Q1 2012, though we were at the low end of our internal estimates for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our year over year revenue growth was 15%, and net product sales growth was higher at 17%. This growth was volume-driven and allowed us to produce faster EPS growth of 30%. Sequentially, product revenues were flat and EPS grew 3% and I will speak more about this in a moment.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit margin improved by 230 basis points year over year, and 70 basis points sequentially. Our business model is performing as it should and we will continue to see that over the course of the year. We also added some incremental value with financial drivers as we bought back 2.35 million shares for $170 million during the quarter and we are now delivering a lower tax rate than last year.</p>
          <p>In keeping with our philosophy to continuously invest for the future while producing good short-term performance, we made a lot of progress with our late stage pipeline projects, entered a new collaboration agreement with Epizyme and closed on the Avila transaction making the $350 million upfront payment.</p>
          <p>We are producing very solid growth on a larger and larger base. Our annual guidance for solid top line percentage growth in 2012 that would be slower than prior years, given the larger base, the trajectory for VIDAZA in the U.S., post loss of exclusivity, where we are today with growth following launches in major markets like Japan and moving into the second year of comps after the Abraxis acquisition.</p>
          <p>However, beyond that overall expected trend, Q1 was also impacted by lower inventory levels, primarily in the U.S. across all products, and partly driven by the merger of two large pharmaceutical benefits management companies, but also in Japan as a result of their March fiscal year end. Our estimates for this global impact range from about $30 million to $35 million, with a significant amount of that impacting REVLIMID and the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our year over year growth was good, despite this inventory headwind and the quality of our growth is very good. As a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our annual guidance. Speaking to the quality of the growth, 80% of the quarter's growth came from volume and the other 20% from price. This was driven by product sales growth of 17%, higher than the 15% overall revenue growth as we saw declines in our royalty income.</p>
          <p>The Celgene business model is performing as expected, and our P&amp;L dynamic is strong. As a result, year over year EPS growth of 30% far outpaced revenue growth and was comparable to the same period one year ago. About 70% of the year over year increase in EPS came from growth in operating income. In addition, we continued to add incremental value with financial drivers that will provide sustainable benefits in the future. The good performance at the operating profit level resulted in an improvement in margin to 46.2%. This margin improved both on a year over year and on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>With respect to individual product revenues and year over year performance, REVLIMID demonstrated good growth of 17%, with similar increases in both the U.S. and international. VIDAZA continues to solidify its position in international markets with 23% growth there, and the product grew 14% globally.</p>
          <p>ABRAXANE started the year well and we are seeing good uptake of the product in international markets. During Q1 the U.S. market experienced complete resolution of the generic paclitaxel shortages we saw in the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, Q1 sequential growth in the U.S. is negatively impacted each year by a relatively larger portion of the Medicare coverage gap expense occurring in the quarter versus other quarters. This year that sequential impact was about $9 million for REVLIMID and $13 million in total.</p>
          <p>In addition, for all products, the sequential growth from Q4 2011 to Q1 2012 in the U.S. was impacted by inventory reductions and we also saw lower inventories in Japan. I already mentioned that we estimate the global impact of that inventory effect at about $30 million to $35 million, and we think about $20 million of that relates to REVLIMID. Mark will cover the commercial dynamics for the products in just a moment.</p>
          <p>A quick look back at our history of quarterly revenues for both total revenues and REVLIMID revenues shows that Q1 of any given year is often the slowest sequential growth quarter, and we have also experienced phases of very rapid growth followed by short periods of slightly slower growth before we embark on another strong leg of growth. This was particularly evident in the second half of 2008 and entering 2009. We now see that we experienced a similar pattern in late 2011 and entering 2012. This being said, as you will hear from Mark, all of the commercial metrics for REVLIMID were very positive at the end of Q1 and we feel quite good about the prospects for Q2 as we have started this quarter strong and for the full year and that is reflected in the affirmation of our guidance.</p>
          <p>Our P&amp;L is performing extremely well. We are on track to achieve our full year guidance across all line items and we have already produced an improved operating profit margin in Q1. R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses are where we expected them to be. As a reminder, SG&amp;A expense is impacted by much higher patient assistance expense in Q1 than in other quarters of the year, and we expect to see SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenues decline over the course of the year to end the full year at about 21%.</p>
          <p>With respect to the effective tax rate, we are seeing a more favorable mix of earnings across geographies and we may end the year somewhat lower than our original guidance. We will give you an update on that later in the year. We do expect this lower rate to be sustainable on a go-forward basis. Again, all of the trends in our P&amp;L dynamic are tracking as we expected, with the usual impacts I referred to in Q1 in SG&amp;A expense.</p>
          <p>We had very good net cash from operations generation in the quarter, at just over $300 million. The amount of cash on our balance sheet declined somewhat versus yearend 2011, as we redeployed capital to buy back about 170 million of our own shares, make the $350 million upfront payment for Avila and pay down some of our short-term debt, including commercial paper of $250 million.</p>
          <p>Here we provide you with some information to better link our P&amp;L and balance sheet performance and you can see our return on invested capital history for the current trailing 12 months and the prior five years. With the green line in this chart you can see a continuously improving ROIC, that now stands at around 16%. We executed on the Abraxis acquisition in 2010 and held ROIC about flat during that time and then resumed our growth in returns in 2011 and are on track to produce higher returns in 2012.</p>
          <p>Full details of the ROIC calculation can be found in the reconciliation tables attached to our webcast slides. In those you will see we that have used the more conservative GAAP operating income as the starting point for this analysis, and gross as opposed to net debt in the invested capital base.</p>
          <p>To summarize, we reaffirm our original full year guidance for total revenues, REVLIMID revenues and EPS, with top line growth of 15%, global REVLIMID growth of 19%, and EPS growth of 25% at the midpoints of the ranges. Our Q1 performance was solid and we finished the quarter strong. The Celgene business model is delivering on all of the important operating and financial metrics and is allowing us to produce good short-term results while continuing to invest for our future growth.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Mark.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. While we are pleased to report that our year on year first quarter total net product sales grew by 17%, it is clear that sequential quarterly sales growth was below our expectations. For the next several minutes, I'd like to add my perspective to these results, to our expectations for expanded market opportunities from new indications and pomalidomide and to highlight some of the emerging new clinical data expected to shape the value proposition of our products.</p>
          <p>First quarter 2012 global REVLIMID sales were $861 million, an increase of 17% compared with 2011. This year on year result demonstrates strong quality growth over a period of time when Celgene, our customers, and our patients managed the uncertainty created by the regulatory and market focus on second primary malignancies.</p>
          <p>In Q1 2012, several well understood product performance metrics and conditions contributed to flat quarter on quarter product sales growth. Jackie discussed the negative impact global inventory variances and the Medicare Part D coverage gap expense had on our sales results, my comments will focus on the key metrics that best describe product performance.</p>
          <p>Across our core markets, January REVLIMID sales were down compared with December but grew through the balance of the quarter. In the United States, Q1 new patient starts increased by 13% compared with the fourth quarter. This positive change represents the second highest sequential quarterly growth in new patient starts since the REVLIMID launch in 2006, and a record quarter for the most new patient starts.</p>
          <p>This jump in REVLIMID new patient demand translated into a first quarter market share trend that increased by approximately four points over the quarter, to an overall myeloma market share of approximately 56%. Please remember that the reimbursed use of REVLIMID for myeloma in Europe is limited to previously treated patients. In Q1, our four major markets in Europe realized an approximately two point improvement in second line myeloma market share. This growth increased total REVLIMID share in this segment to approximately 54%.</p>
          <p>These promising Q1 trends have continued into the second quarter. We constantly measure duration of therapy and this important indicator of REVLIMID growth improved in Q1. Importantly, the peer-reviewed publications that we expect will fully characterize the benefit of continuous treatment with REVLIMID in myeloma, either as induction and maintenance, or as maintenance following autologous stem cell transplantation are expected to be published in the month of May. We anticipate that the availability of the full results of MM-015, and the CALGB and IFM studies will provide additional clarity on the optimal use of REVLIMID for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.</p>
          <p>Our integrated clinical, regulatory and commercial plan designed maximize the full potential of REVLIMID is just beginning to produce the promise of this product. Pivotal Phase II and III trials in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are maturing such that we expect new commercial opportunities this year, but more importantly, significant opportunities over the next five years.</p>
          <p>Approval of the pending newly diagnosed and maintenance marketing application in Europe will add incremental sales to 2012 with billion dollar potential per year over time. Approval of the pending MDS del 5q market application will provide reimbursed access for patients in Europe for REVLIMID in this well recognized standard of care status for low risk MDS. Securing regulatory approvals for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in new markets will add significant commercial opportunities to repeat the launch of REVLIMID in all planned indications. Our model is well established, it's leveraged and we are executing.</p>
          <p>We submitted the pomalidomide NDA in early April and are advancing our commercial plans to launch this important new therapy in the U.S. and Europe. The current pomalidomide clinical profile demonstrates broad utility for patients regardless of the number or type of prior anti-myeloma therapies. The Phase III program that will fully develop the potential of pomalidomide in multiple myeloma includes the ongoing international study MM-003, the MM-005 Phase I, II study combining pomalidomide and dexamethasone with bortezomib, the special protocol assessment Phase III study MM-007, and we plan to introduce expanded access programs in the U.S. and Europe following acceptance of our regulatory submissions. Regulatory and commercial plans are now in development to support what we expect will be positive results from the Phase III myelofibrosis study, MF-002.</p>
          <p>Turning to VIDAZA, first quarter 2012 VIDAZA sales were $186 million, sequential quarterly sales were essentially flat with year on year growth of 14%. Sequential sales in the United States decreased to $74 million, but continued to reflect the consistent quarter by quarter strong market share and VIDAZA demand trends. International sales of VIDAZA, particularly in the recent launch markets of Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Spain, grew 23% year on year and 9% over the fourth quarter. The lack of a generic entrant in the U.S., our commercial launch momentum in new markets and our focus on improved duration of therapy should return VIDAZA to positive quarterly growth.</p>
          <p>Our early Q2 trends for VIDAZA are strong. Multiple strategies to leverage our global MDS franchise continue to be developed. VIDAZA and REVLIMID are being advanced in a series of clinical studies in high risk MDS and AML. The initiation of the Phase III study of CC-486, oral azacitidine in low risk MDS, is on track for the fourth quarter. Other trials in development will seek to define this novel agent's role in maintenance therapy for acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
          <p>First quarter sales of ABRAXANE were $104 million, representing strong year on year growth of 41%. We are encouraged by the improving contribution international launches are making to ABRAXANE total sales. Sequential quarterly international sales and year on year sales increased significantly. Year on year U.S. sales grew 30%, but the full restocking of generic paclitaxel negatively impacted ABRAXANE inventory levels and use outside of metastatic breast cancer late in the fourth quarter and throughout the first quarter.</p>
          <p>With a current quarterly base of more than $100 million and multiple opportunities for growth this year, we look to the execution of the clinical and regulatory program goals established in breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer to create new therapeutic and commercial opportunities. Adding indications from our pivotal studies in non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer should ensure that ABRAXANE will become one of the billion dollar brands in our cancer portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our scientific presence at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting will be meaningful for the quantity, but more important the quality of the data we expect to be presented. We are currently aware of approximately 50 abstracts that have been submitted. We are most interested in the Phase II study reporting data on the combination of REVLIMID and dexamethasone combined with carfilzomib, the RCD regimen, in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, pomalidomide Phase II data in the important segment of patients refractory to REVLIMID, the very first randomized study and data on the combination of REVLIMID plus rituximab in recurrent follicular lymphoma, more data from studies testing REVLIMID and VIDAZA in MDS and AML, the full presentation of the ABRAXANE plus Avastin data from the CALGB breast cancer trial, plus new ABRAXANE data in operable pancreatic cancer and updated results from our ABRAXANE pivotal Phase III trial in non-small cell lung cancer.</p>
          <p>Our internal research team has now successfully advanced CC-223, our dual TOR kinase inhibitor into Phase I with the first oral presentation of its clinical profile expected during ASCO.</p>
          <p>In summary, we are very proud of our year on year total net product sales performance. In addition, the leading indicators of performance for our products such as new patient starts, market share, and duration of therapy, are on track and we are confident we will achieve our full year targets. We expect to realize the commercial benefit of significant new market opportunities throughout 2012, and we are completely focused on executing and delivering on our commercial plan.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and I'd like to turn the call back to Bob.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Mark. And thanks, Jackie. We've covered a lot of ground this morning. Although we had some early challenges in the quarter, our current trajectory is positive and momentum strong. We're energized by our progress to date, advancing key programs across our hematology, oncology and immune-inflammatory franchises and we're focused on our near term objectives which position us to achieve multiple clinical and regulatory milestones throughout the remainder of the year. 2012 will be a transformational year for Celgene.</p>

So with respect to the inventory impact, I highlighted the total at $30 million to $35 million globally for all products of which we think REVLIMID was about $20 million or so globally, with around $15 million of that being in the U.S. And the balance mostly in Japan related to the March fiscal year end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Geoff, the other component of that is that we do have obviously multiple markets around the world now where we're in various stages of maturing, some early, some a little bit later. And I think those other markets in combination make up the balance of what Jackie just presented.</p>
          <p>Geoff, can I just ask you to clarify &#x2013; to restate the second part of your question. I want to be sure I understood it well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so if you assume European approval, I would say third quarter, you're right into sort of the vacation season and this is for first line REVLIMID in myeloma, obviously, I'm assuming that it's going to take maybe six months, nine months to get full reimbursement throughout the big five. But do you &#x2013; would you now see, for example, the impact of that label skewed to say maybe mid 2013 as opposed to early 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, really thank you for the detail. I wanted to be sure it was clear. First, the expected positive outcome of the CHMP review we think will be a big lift in the current market. So the incremental we see this year would be confidence in the brand moving to first line. That would be the market statement.</p>
          <p>Market by market, though, the difference between when we launch REVLIMID in the relapsed/refractory setting across Europe is we had to really build our plans, market by market from a zero base. Today we have of course a fully integrated global team focused on market access. So we've built and have in the queue the value proposition dossiers that would be ready to engage much earlier post-approval.</p>
          <p>Having said that, it will be a month by month, quarter by quarter process as you know to get reimbursement. So our focus would be on the early opportunity markets in a priority order, and yet still seek reimbursement in parallel across these markets. So is it going to be a Q1 to Q2 to Q3 effect in Europe? Certainly. But we're looking to front load to the best of our ability, broad reimbursement for newly diagnosed myeloma in the major European markets.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. So first question is just on U.S., on U.S. REVLIMID. I wanted to get a sense of just as we put the pieces together, given the price increase late last year. I realize it was a slow January, but can you help us think about how much unit growth you saw quarter over quarter, even if we take out the inventory in terms of end market unit growth? Would love to get a better sense of kind of how that looked for the full quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Marshall, thanks for the question. So these variables, of course, happen in the quarter on a bit of a gated month by month. But, we're looking at what we think now in an absolute comparison unit growth in the mid single-digits. But again, as we got into the second part of the quarter, we saw acceleration. So I think it's in absolute terms about mid single-digits, but we're encouraged, as we've said, about what we saw through March and into the early part of April.</p>

We're obviously in the late stages of the review, and we're now into the last couple of months, hopefully, by the end of the quarter have the CHMP recommendation. So again, we're engaged in a very active dialogue and so I think until the results are clear, we'll see. But we're well positioned and we're focused on the right issues, and we've got strong data, and we'll be discussing that over the coming weeks.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Thanks for all the transparency on the quarter. Very helpful. Number one, will you be &#x2013; on the MM-020 trial, will you be waiting for mature survival data before stopping that, even if PFS has a profound early separation? And number two, would you be willing to give us the actual durations of therapy in the quarter in the U.S. and in Europe? And then the third is have you gotten a request yet for an oral argument in front of the CHMP? And if not, is that something that you would disclose, or is that not something you'd disclose? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, hi, it's Mark. So on MM-020, this is of course a very, very important study for us and to really, really, I think, solidify ultimately the REV/Dex, proposition in myeloma regardless of age or intent to transplant. The way we've approached this is that the planned statistical analysis of course will lead to various points in time where the event rate on things like survival, like progression free survival, would lead to independent review. And depending on the results, that review would either by ethical reasons stay un-blind, or in the case of survival, if things are trending the right way, the recommendation could be to remain unblinded until survival.</p>
          <p>We really don't have a choice in the matter, but our view would be given the complexity of the comparison to melphalan, MPT, the optimal would be that the first look would include at least the strong trend of survival, if not a complete analysis of OF.</p>
          <p>The second part about duration, what I can say is that duration continues to improve and when one looks at the dynamic first in Europe, the duration gain that we saw in the more recent quarter was quite positive. In the U.S., of course, we have a much more mature base of patients, and so while duration continues to improve, we're looking at the combination of the different cohorts. We call them short runners, six to 10 months on therapy. And then those very long runners where you get out to two years plus the therapy, to understand if it's still accelerating as we expected.</p>
          <p>So I think generally speaking we're satisfied where duration is at. But as I said in my comments earlier, the publication of the three papers that speak to duration in multiple settings for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the context of second primary malignancies, we believe is very important confidence building information to make sure duration stays on track now and in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the third question, I think I'm always cautious about discussing specific regulatory issues in between actual action &#x2013; public action dates because you have a conversation one day and then something changes the next week and you don't have the same forum providing some of that issue, plus I don't think anybody wants to negatively impact relationships with regulators. But specifically to your question about the oral explanation, we have not been asked to appear for oral explanation, though we are prepared if that were to happen in the next couple of weeks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It's actually <mark type="ph" /> Nabib (38:51) substituting in for Robyn. I think you mentioned that the increase in quarter over quarter new patients on REVLIMID was pretty robust, I think as robust as you've seen in many years. What drove this increase? Was it because Q4 new patients was soft?</p>
          <p>And a question on Apremilast. If you're looking at Enbrel and Humira, these products continue to grow despite the competition; what kind of data do you think would be competitive as we approach the data readout? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Mark Alles, so on the point that you're making, the comparable base of patients in Q4 or the second half of last year and how robust Q1 new patient starts were, I appreciate the question. We became aware of the relationship more acutely around getting new patient starts back on a strong growth trend towards, let's say the latter part of Q3 into Q4. We were not declining but the growth rate was a little bit less than we expected.</p>
          <p>So there is a little bit, a very small amount of that slightly lower base I'd say in Q4 coming into Q1. But it is so insignificant that we didn't call it out. However, we were aware and our commercial organization around the world, but in particular in the U.S., became very focused again on creating demand while still dealing with some of the questions clinically about overall treatment in the face of second primary malignancies. So that relationship is important but we see it clearly, and no matter how we look at the quarter over quarter on new patients, this is an all-time record.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Apremilast issues, we're obviously very near term to getting the important data, starting again in the next few weeks for the controlled Phase II data in rheumatoid arthritis which is very important for us to see if we're going to have a potential to go down a registration path there. And obviously the summer beginning the psoriatic arthritis data and then late in the year on the psoriasis.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the data itself, it's obviously a very competitive market, it's an incredibly exciting market opportunity for us to have an oral therapy that so far has the kind of side effect profile that ideally positions it in the marketplace, and I think on the efficacy side or the activity side, it's going to be very important for us to be able to distinguish it in its own right on that activity side and looking at it both from TNF naive patients and TNF pretreated patients. And so we're optimistic it's going to be a very competitive on all aspects. And the reality of it is the data is in 2012. So we're not going to wait long to have to make those judgments and see how we can maximize the opportunity here. But on &#x2013; where we see today, it's a tremendous opportunity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Jackie, on the inventory changes, would we expect that to rebound in Q2, or are these now with the PBM merger that you mentioned sort of reset at a new lower level and we just don't &#x2013; won't see the same decline in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I can tell you is that I think the most important thing is that we are not counting on a rebound with respect to how we're looking at delivering on the full year guidance, and that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of affirming that guidance.</p>
          <p>I really can't tell you whether this is the new normal or not. What we can say is that we saw inventory levels in the U.S. that are at the lowest that we've ever seen. Maybe the channel is becoming more efficient and some of that is permanent. Maybe some of it comes back, but we're not counting on it to come back in terms of delivering our guidance. Let's see how it plays out in Q2.</p>

          <p>If I could ask a second question of Mark on MM-020. Just on the timing, there's been some speculation about when we may see the results. Is this still a potential 2012 event and if not, when would be the next interim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Eric, thanks for the question. I think potential is the operative word. It certainly on an event basis has the potential. I think the way we would think about it is the longer we wait to see the results, the more likely we get an overall un-blinding against all primary and secondary end points, such that the clear proposition of the product comes out first time with the un-blinding. So the timing, unlikely this year. Very likely in 2013. But it's hard to know. It's one of these event-driven studies and I'll just say it again, the longer we wait, the more positive we think about the data.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. On pomalidomide, I'm just wondering would it be logistically possible in your view for the FDA to accept the application I guess they would let you know in early May, and then perhaps &#x2013; or early June, rather &#x2013; and then perhaps schedule you for ODAC Panel on June 20 or 21? I see that the register reflects a panel for carfilzomib in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and I'm just wondering if there's still a potential that you see for the FDA to review both drugs together?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, obviously we can't speak for the FDA, but by having the application in now we're in a good position that the data has been very rigorously analyzed and presented. So again, we haven't even passed the date for the submission to turn into a filing and for the FDA to notify us on the priority status of the review. But I do think, based on the size of the trial and the completeness of the analysis, that again, we can't speak for the FDA and we have no insight into this, but we'll be prepared to move very expeditiously in any review. If there's an opportunity to review it more quickly, we'll be prepared and be very supportive of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. The first question I just had was on the U.S. filing for front line. I just wanted to know as to when you expect, what the gating factors still are. And do you expect that once you actually get the label in the U.S., I know the drug is used quite broadly off label, but if there's room for acceleration once you get the label in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think Sapna &#x2013; it's Bob. Clearly getting the European filing completed and getting that recommendation and move forward with that is the first priority. And that's what we're focused on. And that will occur before we submit in the U.S., and make sure data is the right maturity for the U.S. regulators. So I think we're moving forward as appropriately as we can.</p>
          <p>And I think that any label expansion is always an opportunity to impact on the commercial opportunity for us. We obviously have a strong position and Mark will add in a second his perspective. So positive label expansion is a good thing. It's not critical in the U.S. But it'd certainly be on the margin a positive.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. Two quick questions. First, I'm wondering how much the U.S. adoption of REVLIMID maybe has been impacted by lingering second primary malignancy concerns and I guess I'm wondering if you saw any change in use patterns once the label was updated last month, perhaps with physicians reassured of the FDA's conclusion of their safety review?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on VIDAZA, just wondering how far out your level of visibility here is in terms of potential generic entry as we're now into the year wondering what your guidance now presumes in terms of how long you'll be able to maintain VIDAZA revenues in the U.S. before a generic entry? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, we obviously follow the VIDAZA situation very closely but we don't have any access to any information that would be any different than anybody in the public domain as to the timing of that. We continue to support VIDAZA actively in the U.S., and obviously has great international presence. And as you've heard, there is some very encouraging epigenetic work being done and presented at the American &#x2013; at the AACR meeting early this month, about the potential for VIDAZA and ultimately for us, oral azacitidine in a number of areas of malignancy solid tumors so that's an important development area for us. But as far as the generic specifically goes, we don't have any more clarity than is available in the public domain.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, thanks for the question about SPMs. You're asking an umbrella question about its impact. Let me start with the past year. There is no question that in the hematology circles, academic meetings, patient advocacy, et cetera, that this was a finding and an outcome that people really focused on and wanted to understand. Interestingly, third party evidence like the NCCN guidelines, et cetera, were not changed at all in the face of this concern, but as you point out the label was just updated.</p>
          <p>There is no doubt that in certain markets there was an acute measurable impact from the emergence of second primary malignancies and we've talked about France historically. Qualitatively around the world, and I think to a certain extent in the U.S., we do think that some of what could be considered a little slower growth has to be related to the emergence and now what we believe is the full characterization of the benefit-risk profile on this question.</p>
          <p>Once again, the full publication of the three papers that really led to the question should really help to put this issue more in the rearview mirror of everyone, academic physicians, community physicians, but more importantly inform patient advocacy and patients around the world that the benefit-risk profile is well understood and it's far better to get treated continuously than it is to not continue and then have progression of myeloma.</p>

          <p>Thank you for taking the question. It's <mark type="ph" /> Alexey (50:55) on for Geoff. I just got two quick questions. First is could you give us some guidance of how we should think about a change in the amount of rebates that you will be paying between now and 2014 when the donut hole will be closing and probably the share will increase? And then the second quick question is how should we think about the size of potential opportunity beyond multiple myeloma for REVLIMID in NHL, CLL, MDS, if you could kind of qualify that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the rebate or the closing of the donut hole, the &#x2013; our responsibility as a branded pharmaceutical company on the Part D Medicare coverage gap, is &#x2013; will be unchanged going forward unless the legislation is changed. And that's obviously an issue that if the Supreme Court were to overturn the legislation, the Affordable Care Act, that that aspect of providing assistance to patients would have to be changed and figured out. But if the law is ruled constitutional and the Congress doesn't change it, we don't anticipate any change in our obligation in terms of any coverage and change to those rebates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the question of the market opportunity beyond myeloma, we are, as Bob and I pointed out earlier, we are extremely encouraged by the maturity, the maturing of our CLL and NHL program. Just to put this in context, rituximab is the most commonly used product in leukemia and lymphoma and global sales of this product are in the $6 billion range.</p>
          <p>So when we think about the combination of Rituxan with REVLIMID, which will be featured at ASCO in follicular lymphoma, that we plan to file the mantle cell application with the FDA later this year from our study MCL-001, that we have ongoing maintenance trials in both follicular and especially diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for patients with high risk disease. The opportunity for REVLIMID over the next five to six years in lymphoma is multi billion.</p>
          <p>In CLL, we have particular segmentation in the elderly population with single agent REVLIMID, and then combination strategies and maintenance strategies in patients who have been previously treated. So this also represents another billion dollar or so opportunity, just from CLL. So the next three, four, five years we'll see new data, new indications and a ramp-up of this product across these diseases.</p>

          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I think you mentioned that some of the most important data for REVLIMID would be newly diagnosed data in combination with carfilzomib. And I wanted to better understand your perspective on that because we've already seen some Velcade/REV/Dex combination data. So do you think this carfilzomib data is going to augment your market share? Do you think that bodes well for pomalidomide? I just want to better understand that.</p>
          <p>And then Jackie, if you could comment on France. You have mentioned that that's been sluggish since the SPM stuff came out. Has that rebounded? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rachel. It's Mark. On the carfilzomib piece, thanks for calling that out. One of the interesting things about the development of REVLIMID in myeloma that you understand very well is that it has become the backbone of all myeloma clinical trials that we're aware of, regardless of the novel agent in development. In this case carfilzomib. Our interest is because, as you know, the pivotal Phase III trials RCD versus RD in relapsed/refractory myeloma, the ASPIRE trial is fully accrued.</p>
          <p>What we don't have, at least I don't have, is awareness of does that regimen look like or perform like the other proteasome inhibitor combination that you pointed out, in combination with REV/Dex. So we would look to that regimen to see if the response rates are similar. More importantly, I think, is the side effect profile equal to or better what we see with REV/Dex and bortezomib. So it really does look at the landscape. No matter how one looks at these combinations, improving the therapeutic profile of REV/Dex in a triplet like this would be something that would improve the prospects of our product over time.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Rachel, just to your second question on France. As we've mentioned before, that market was sequentially down in Q2, then stable in Q3. And Q4 is how we would characterize it essentially and then starting to grow again in Q1. So the plan that we have internally for the French market has growth in it, as we move into this year and we're essentially on track with that plan. That being said, that market is not yet back to the trajectory that it was on before in terms of duration and share and other things like that. But it is back on growth track and over time hopefully we'll catch back up to where we were in terms of trajectory before.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Joel Sendek from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Thanks a lot. I had a question on Apremilast. So if you get all these studies between here and the end of the year, I'm wondering, you kind of suggested you're going to wait for all the data prior to deciding the regulatory strategy. I'm wondering if one or two of the studies are particularly compelling, you might be able to accelerate a filing on the basis of what you see, so is that possible at all? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, Joel, I apologize. I wasn't clear enough. We're going to get psoriatic arthritis data beginning in the summer, and the moderate to severe psoriasis pivotal's not towards the end of the year and hopefully by January or so, but certainly our goal is the end of the year. But we're not waiting for all that data to begin the filing. The fact that our target is to begin regulatory submissions at the beginning of 2013 when we'll only have just either just getting the final psoriasis data or maybe not even having all the final psoriasis data and begin the psoriatic arthritis filing submission process, again, assuming the data is positive and supportive of that.</p>
          <p>So we're going to be moving forward on multiple fronts in sequence or in parallel, depending on what's available when. And we'll obviously begin in the U.S. and then begin international filings as appropriately as quickly thereafter as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joel, one thing you might have heard us say before, so we will file for PSA first in the U.S., psoriasis second, there are two different indications that go to two different departments. In Europe because it's the same department and just given the timing on that, they will likely go together in Europe. But that's after the first U.S. filings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you can imagine, based on the data, what's the best indication for us to go for, not just from a regulatory point of view, but from a reimbursement and a market access and a marketing strategy, because this will be a very important market opportunity that needs to have a very specific marketing strategy in these kind of markets. So the opportunity is very significant, the plans have to be very appropriate for reimbursement, pricing, and regulatory issues market by market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. And then just real quickly on REVLIMID. When will we get the Phase III NHL data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the lymphoma program, the NHL program is as I said, gated. The very first opportunity would be the mantle cell submission late this year. And then I think we would be looking a little bit further out for the results of some of the other studies. As everyone knows, these are patients who do quite well in response rates. So the effect on &#x2013; with REVLIMID would take a little bit longer. In our model we have data flow coming in 2013 through 2015, from the Phase III program. So the order, much like we just talked about Apremilast,</p>
          <p>really depends upon the different histologies, segments of the population, and then of course events but a continuous flow of data beginning end of this year, through 2013 and really through the next maybe five to six years. That's before we add more to it based on opportunity.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citi. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking my question, really appreciate it. So I have two questions. One, it's for Jackie and Mark, actually both of them. So just help us understand a little bit. I mean it sounds like there was about a $9 million headwind from Medicare rebates and about $30 million to $35 million due to inventory. So it looks like demand was closer to $905 million, if you just kind of &#x2013; $900 million to $905 million. So the first question, is that sort of &#x2013; do you agree that? Is that sort of how we should look at the transition into Q2? And then secondly, you're not changing the guidance. You're starting sort of $29 million or so below consensus. So I'm just trying to understand, what else are you seeing on a global basis that gives you a lot of confidence in the outlook ahead? And I'm trying to get a sense kind of how to think about where we're going to end up at the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Yaron. Let me start. So just to be very clear on the numbers. Again, we estimate that the impact of the change in the number of days of inventory from 12/31/2011 to 3/31/2012, globally to be about $30 million to $35 million. Okay? And we thought that we ended 2011 at a level that was in line with historical norms that we saw, so the end of the first quarter of 2012 was lower. As I said before, we don't know if some of that is the new normal or not. Some of it's probably not. So just to be clear about that.</p>
          <p>When we look at the coverage gap expense, so the $9 million sequential impact that I talked about for REVLIMID, equates to $13 million of expense in the first quarter of 2012. Okay? And then the overall as I said was &#x2013; the sequential change was $13 million, the total expense was $16 million. So again Q1 2012 coverage gap only expense for REVLIMID was $13 million, which is $9 million higher than Q4.</p>
          <p>The inventory impact for REVLIMID out of that $30 million to $35 million, we estimate to be about $20 million or so. So those two REVLIMID sequential differences are $20 million and $9 million. From Q4 to Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; Yaron, this is Mark &#x2013; the other demand component is in a quarter patients are coming in in bolus pieces, whether it's at the beginning, the middle or the end. What we've seen in the second half of Q1, small amounts of time, but encouraging new patient starts. Really back ended to the quarter, with what's happening in early April, we're comfortable with that.</p>
          <p>Also remember that we have a lot of markets around the world that are in different stages of launch phases. So for example, Jackie pointed out Japan, and its impact in the quarter. We have a renewed outlook for Japan coming out of Q1 despite the variance that Jackie spoke to, where the underlying performance is stronger.</p>
          <p>Let me give you the example of that one variable. So everyone knows that every year in the April timeframe, the Japanese government looks across the pharmaceutical industry and will look to net out all discounts in the market, all rebates in the market, and will reset pricing and reimbursement at that lower level. Lenalidomide, REVLIMID was fortunate that we don't discount, of course, our list prices is our price, and we were not exposed to any reduction in reimbursement in April in Japan. This is one example, such that in the model for the performance of Japan this year, that is a modest upside. And there are many items like that, that contribute over, under to our reaffirmation of guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe &#x2013; that's very useful but, Jackie, just for you, just so I'm clear or we're clear. You mentioned there's a $20 million quarter to quarter headwind related to inventory and not $30 million to $35 million? I'm just trying &#x2013; I'm trying to understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yaron, what we said was the global impact across all products of inventory, so for total Celgene revenues, we estimate that to be $30 million to $35 million. Of which the global impact for REVLIMID only is about $20 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I'm sorry, so it looks like that's going to be &#x2013; so let's say $890 million was the real demand, then, minus the &#x2013; including the inventory and the rebates. So is that how we should think about it? Is $890 million is really the level of demand as we enter Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the math that I think we can all do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll just say it this way. Because on the call we're not going to calculate all the different numbers. What we can say is there's certainly a range, Yaron, that you're speaking to that on a demand basis is probably fairly accurate. The exact number we could debate for a while but we're in the range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But also just to reiterate what Jackie earlier said. Is that on that inventory front, we don't &#x2013; we're not using that to affirm our guidance. And we don't know when that &#x2013; if and when it will rebound or not. So it may be the new normal, it may not be. So I think you have to be careful that putting it in in one quarter or not is we just &#x2013; so I think that was the point that Jackie made.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just wanted to ask maybe a detailed question here on ABRAXANE. Kind of struck by the ex-U.S. number. Can you maybe talk a little bit &#x2013; I know you guys have been in the process of re-launching it in ex-U.S. especially in Europe, but can you maybe tell us what specifically happened in the quarter for that kind of &#x2013; for the big number that you had there? And also maybe give some color around the generic paclitaxel impact. Has it all worked its way through sort of rebasing ABRAXANE demand, or do you expect maybe more impact? And if I can sneak one more question in, do you guys ever plan on breaking Japan out for REVLIMID? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start real quickly and then pass it to Mark. I think we've talked over a couple quarters about &#x2013; and I think we've used the word choppiness in the ABRAXANE international totals, just because of the different stages of launch there. When we started rolling out in Europe you get a little bit of pipeline fill and then we've got &#x2013; we use distributors in a few places, so you get irregular order patterns there. And I think what we said is that for a little while, for ABRAXANE total international, you would see that number move around because of those different issues and the fact that we're still in a very modest base. And we certainly saw that from Q3 to Q4. I think what we start to see now in Q1 is a little bit of smoothing out of some of those effects, and as the launches start to fully in different countries be in place and that continues to roll forward, I think it's pretty safe to say that the total international ABRAXANE base is something around that number that we saw in the first quarter. And we're probably not going to see these $20 million to $12 million type of movements anymore but there still will be a little bit of a erratic pattern in that as we continue that. But again, I think that $20 million to $25 million per quarter base number that we saw for total international ABRAXANE is probably a pretty good way to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, thank you. Just to follow that point, in Japan, our partner is Taiho, they recently filed the ABRAXANE product for gastric cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. So back to Jackie's point about choppiness, not only do you have the buying pattern but you also have the potential that this brand could grow in Japan off of these new indications.</p>
          <p>In Europe I think it's very important to call out that a year ago this time we made the business decision to establish a dedicated oncology presence in Europe, similar to the U.S. The difference is that in the U.S. ABRAXANE launched, and was commercialized for several years; where in Europe, despite an approval, it was never actually launched or commercialized in any meaningful way.</p>
          <p>What we've realized year on year in the quarter is our focus in Europe on core markets, and our alignment with a lot of the breast cancer key opinion leaders across key markets has translated into market penetration and adoption that we're pleasantly surprised by. We look to expand that from here, in particular because we're setting ourselves up for multiple launches with, for example, the pancreatic indication, which we think in Europe is going to be quite important, like the rest of the world, but we've recently looked at plans in Europe and the pancreatic market and are quite encouraged about what the potential is there.</p>
          <p>So I think we're in this window where we're getting beneficial effects year on year and it will continue in the quarter from Europe. The other choppiness Jackie already spoke to, but the real window is as we get new data and these markets expand for ABRAXANE, we see this brand becoming a meaningful top line contributor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the generic paclitaxel, I think we feel like we've seen that fully washed out now. The supply was essentially returned to normalcy in the U.S. in Q1, and that was a last half of last year impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, this is Nick standing in for Jim. A couple of questions. The first one is you mentioned the publications on the three front line REVLIMID trials. I'm wondering, do you know is an editorial being written to go with those trials? And if so who is writing it?</p>
          <p>And then a couple of pipeline questions. First one on ABRAXANE, obviously melanoma and pancreas cancer are tough tumors and I know that you've been beefing up the science around SPARC. Is there a plan to validate SPARC as a biomarker in these trials if the overall data, the ITT data does not support or is not as positive as you want?</p>
          <p>And then last one, on the DLC-001 trial, we believe that trial was trying to show a benefit in the ABC phenotype of lymphoma which obviously has a high unmet medical need. Since you've now expanded that into Phase III, is it focused now on ABC or on all comers? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks for the questions. On the publication front, our awareness is very, very superficial about the timing but we're very sure of what we said in March. We have no information whatsoever about editorials or not. We know that it is customary for publications of this importance to be accompanied by editorials but we don't have specific knowledge one way or the other.</p>
          <p>With respect to then the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma environment, I know that Bob mentioned that before, but I'll just make the observation that REVLIMID's activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has been validated across the general population through our Phase II program. And this initial program is demonstrating, we think, good evidence that there is a difference by phenotype, and we want to exploit that difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think as we move into the Phase III trial we're optimistic that at ASH we'll be able to have some of this data available to look at the overall marketplace as Mark mentioned and the differentiated opportunities in the GCB, non-GCB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then any comments on SPARC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; Bob, go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; both the melanoma and the pancreatic studies were both initiated, the Phase III studies, prior to our acquiring Abraxis, so those studies are well along and obviously completed enrollment. Going forward, we have as you mentioned, significant work going on with major centers that focus on this research. The ability to validate a specific biomarker for a regulatory purpose or a marketing opportunity is still not clear but it's something that we have a lot of interest in and we're advancing over these coming months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the shorter version of how we would look at it is SPARC seems to be perhaps more important in pancreatic cancer, where that study will allow for a more complete exploration of this as a biomarker, but I think as Bob said, we're in different positions in the other disease categories. So I think pancreatic cancer is an area that we would really seek to determine that as a direct factor for benefit.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Nick had asked my question about lymphoma. But as long as you've let me jump in here, let me ask about sort of longer term strategy. With regard to lymphoma, I'm just looking at what you guys are doing from a business development standpoint with Avila back in March and now with Epizyme. I'm just wondering are you guys thinking on a longer term basis that most of your indications, whether it be lymphoma and myeloma, et cetera, are going to be with an all oral drug combination or do you still think that the best way forward is going to be with being on the back of antibodies like rituximab?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the questions &#x2013; Mark. I mean, this is a very important question you're asking. I think even though it was not your original question. Lymphoma is an area of still high unmet medical need. Particularly in the subsets. One of the things that we are, as I said, very anxious to see at ASCO is validation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, so called ADCC. Because I think our view long-term is that the combination of REVLIMID and oral therapy, with an anti-CD 20 play, in this case rituximab or a biosimilar over time. What we could see happen is we would get rid of CHOP or the traditional chemotherapy that is usually the base for Rituxan based therapy. So if I look longer term, it would that be an immunomodulatory drug with a monoclonal antibody targeting in this case CD-20, would be the play that would get rid of finally these toxic very old chemotherapies and improve not only response rates and other outcomes, but really get rid of toxicity. So I think that's the play.</p>

          <p>Okay, then does Btk fit into that, and when might we see first trials of the Avila Btk inhibitor?</p>

          <p>We're moving very quickly on that front and we're working, we've approved internally a clinical development plan already. And we're initiating trials and the combination's certainly going to be underway in 2012.</p>

          <p>Operator I think we've got time for one more question and <mark type="ph" /> Robbie (1:17:37), I didn't mean to be cute. I think all the dynamics that Mark highlighted today with respect to the potential for continued share gains in the U.S. and what we're seeing in terms of the dynamics there, what we think is going to happen with the publications and all the rest put us in a very good place in multiple myeloma in the U.S. for 2013 and 2014 and beyond, so just to make sure that we clarify that.</p>
          <p>And operator, if we could have one more question, please.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks for taking my question and extending the call. One of your near term events here is ABRAXANE Phase III data in metastatic melanoma. This is a rapidly changing therapeutic category. So if successful, where do you think that ABRAXANE would fit into this treatment paradigm? What kind of data do you think it would take to become a highly attractive competitor in that category? Just trying to get a sense for how you view that opportunity. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Hi, Matt, it's Mark. And of course and Bob, Jackie should jump in as well. You actually positioned it nicely. Finally after decades, metastatic melanoma has the BRAF inhibitor and the ipilimumab from BMS. So in back-to-back years we have survival in this disease. What we think is important with ABRAXANE is that it could become the base chemotherapy for patients who are either in a combination approach, or one could even imagine for certain subsets, maybe it's now a three-drug combination versus two.</p>
          <p>So I think the first important step is the readout of the data. We internally have gated it to say if we achieve PSS with a trend to OS we have one strategy. If we achieve PSS and overall survival, we of course would accelerate our regulatory strategy around that. But no matter what, what you're describe something high academic interest in ABRAXANE beating dacarbazine much like ipilimumab and the BRAF inhibitor did and on that basis, the combination studies would go forward.</p>
