          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Zurich's Full Year 2009 Results Presentation. I would first draw your attention to the slide. Slide two, disclaimer and then go on to just give you the agenda for the day, which will be presentation from CEO, Martin Senn followed by presentation by the CFO, Dieter Wemmer and then the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>So, without further ado, I'd ask Martin Senn to give his presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Malcolm. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, here in the room; good morning, ladies and gentlemen, on the call; and also good morning to colleagues. I do welcome you to 2009 year-end results announcements and this is, as you all know, my first opportunity as Zurich's Chief Executive Officer to address you. And I must tell you I'm pretty excited about the opportunity to do that and I'm very excited about the strong sets of results we're going to discuss today.</p>
          <p>At the outset though I must also stress and I would like to acknowledge that this impressive performance is occurred and has occurred under the leadership of Jim Schiro and I want to publicly pay tribute to the eight years of committed service he gave to this great company, and as each of you know, Jim brought a true passion and excitement and the focus into Zurich and has left a true spirit back with all of us here. And it's not only just the seven years of profitability he has brought into that firm but also his confidence and his pride that do mark today the Zurich spirit.</p>
          <p>And another legacy Jim left was an institutional commitment to operational excellence and financial discipline. And that is very much rooted in our culture, in fact it is nearly &#x2013; it nearly became the culture. And I want to &#x2013; also want to say that Jim throughout these years for all of us became not just a sort of a symbol of a great leader, he became a friend, and more important we all have high respect for him for his leadership or maybe the more important for &#x2013; more important for his personality, because he also is a great person. And some times we miss him.</p>
          <p>So, today as we emerge from one of the most challenging financial markets in generations, our continued success is sticking to those core principle and it is what allows me to present to you such a strong set of 2009 results. Our business operating profit rose 8% to $5.6 billion. Our net income rose 6% to $3.2 billion driven by the sustained operating performances across all our businesses. General Insurance improved its combined ratio, Global Life increased its new business value, and Farmers enhanced its margins even further. And in addition shareholder equity climbed 34% to $29.7 billion. And these results allowed us to drive a 17.2% business operating profit return on equity, once again exceeding our targets.</p>
          <p>As importantly they also put Zurich in one of the strongest financial positions it has ever enjoyed and will enable us to react quickly to any opportunities that emerge in a market upturn as well as to withstand any pressures that may arise from any further market corrections. The strength of these numbers rest in the operating performances of our various businesses, so let's look a little closer at their respective results.</p>
          <p>In General Insurance profitability continues to be our primary focus. Through the combination of successful reductions, disciplined underwriting, portfolio management, and a below average catastrophe season we were able to achieve a business operating profit of $3.4 billion and this despite lower investment yields, decreased volumes attributable to both the economic environment and the lost business we could not provide because it did not meet our rigorous underwriting standards.</p>
          <p>In terms of issues we see, I would highlight the challenges we continue to face in our motor book of business in Italy and in the U.K. And these high loss trends, affecting all players in those markets, have eroded EGI's loss ratio and expected profitability. We do &#x2013; we have already taken significant reductions as well as other appropriate measures and anticipate market &#x2013; marked improvements in those businesses in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>On the positive side results in our commercial business have held up well in a very competitive environment from our Global Corporates division. In Global Life we grew at an impressive pace by maintaining strong profitability and new business margin. In particular, our bank distribution, private banking, and corporate life and pension pillars drove strong organic growth, while we continued to make significant structural change in the business. And this demonstrates the power and the efficiency of our strategy to globalize the business and to industrialize our business model.</p>
          <p>At Farmers business operating profits jumped 10% reflecting not just the successful integration of 21st Century but also continued expense management as well as increased profitability from Farmers Re following the increased quota share arrangements.</p>
          <p>In our non core businesses, which now include also our banking activities, we improved profitability, but still showed a $290 million loss for the whole year. This result is attributable primarily to increased loan-loss provisions in banking and increases in certain life reserves outweighing positive market movements in Centre and other run off businesses.</p>
          <p>Taken together and considered within the context of the global recession, we are very proud of these results as they signal the inherent strengths of our global businesses. Strengths that range from the proven discipline to price risk appropriately, to the ability to integrate new acquisitions, to the capability of finding new ways to grow despite the distractions in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>But perhaps the most impressive indicator of how deep these strengths run is our ability from all these markets &#x2013; is our ability to emerge from all these market turmoil with one of the most solid balance sheets we have ever enjoyed. An economic solvency margin of 136% and Regulatory Solvency I margin of 198% are not accidents. They are the result of a deliberate strategy to protect our balance sheet from the unpredictability of the external environment.</p>
          <p>Remember, the promise we sell to our customers is based on the integrity of our balance sheet and we take this promise very, very seriously. But customers are not our only stakeholder, and as a result we must balance the security we provide them with a long-term value we offer to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And this is why we are so pleased to be able to announce that the board will be recommending a CHF 16 per share dividend at our March 30 Annual General Meeting. At a yield of 7.1% and a payout ratio of 66%, this dividend proposal is squarely inline with our shareholder oriented capital management strategy and returns us to the levels of shareholder value we generated prior to the economic crisis. However, we will not undertake a share buyback in 2010, preferring instead to return value to our shareholders through the dividends, and this obviously will enable us to maintain our strong capital position in the future.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally, this attractive dividend proposal reflects the board's confidence in the strengths of Zurich's strategy and in the sustainability of its results. That confidence is well placed for today Zurich stands in a very strong position. Our balance sheet is healthy, with both sides of the ledger sheet reflecting a profound appreciation for the risks we take.</p>
          <p>Our geographic and market mix is diverse. We are pursuing the right strategies with a proven ability to execute. Our focus on growth is balanced with our commitment to profitability. We enjoy a strong reputation and we enjoy a growing brand presence. And our people are among the most qualified in our sector.</p>
          <p>Although this being true, we still do face challenges. We need to anticipate better and react quicker. We need to find ways to grow smarter and drive even greater efficiencies in our operating models. We need to understand more intimately the risks our customers face. And we need to engage our people more fully in what Zurich is and what it can become. And those are the expectations the board has set for my team and for myself. And they are &#x2013; what I have been focusing on in these early days and I will continue to focus on in the months and in the years to come.</p>
          <p>I do bring to these challenges a broad range of international experiences that give me an awareness of what change means in different cultures. And I think I have a deep appreciation for risks with an understanding of the discipline it takes to systematically harness its potential for upside gain.</p>
          <p>I do approach issues with a deep-rooted respect for the power of transparency, openness, and candour. And most important as well I believe that values matter. I am very sensitive to the valid interests of our multiple stakeholders. And in all of this I take an approach to leadership that focuses on people and recognizes that it's the decisions and the actions taken by its people that determines a firm's success.</p>
          <p>It is fortunate for us and it's fortunate for Zurich that we have a proven winning strategy and that we can ask ourselves difficult questions from a position of strengths. So you should expect continuity in our strategy going forward. We will continue to treat operational and financial discipline as our core principles. I mentioned before this part of the culture as we have developed. And we will continue to pursue profitable growth and operational transformation as our pathways to future success.</p>
          <p>Insurance is a long-term business, and we need to make our decisions accordingly, recognizing the need to drive long-term shareholder value by staying sensitive to the increasing expectations of society more generally. The strong results we're announcing today are a reflection of how seriously we take these commitments. And over the next several months, I look forward to sharing with you some of the answers to the tough questions I will be asking.</p>
          <p>In closing, let me just highlight the core themes of our 2009 full-year results. By proactively driving expense and market actions we generated solid operating performances across our core businesses. We continue to benefit from a sophisticated approach to risk. Our capital position remains solid and is strong &#x2013; solid like a rock. Our reputation and brand recognition continue to grow, and our very attractive, highly competitive dividend proposal stands as a testament to our confidence in the future.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And now I would like to ask my colleague Dieter Wemmer, Chief Financial Officer for the group, to give us a more detailed review of our financial results. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you Martin and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with a little warning. I might speak a few minutes longer than in previous quarters. We have added two slides to the presentation to where we hope it helps your understanding of what the company is doing and will be doing in future.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter continues the earnings recovery based on actually our sustained operating performance. So, I am starting off on page 10 with warnings with the financial numbers. If we look on slide 10 and go to the upper chart first, the core operating business performed consistently through 2009, particularly bearing in mind the one-off benefit in the third quarter from debt unlocking in the U.S Life business and the profit from the buyback of the hybrid debt. Together, this gave the third quarter a benefit of about $300 million.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, the core operating profit was 1.4 billion and non-core recovered well to $143 million profit. Our aim with the non-core businesses has been to take action to bring future results back into a medium-term positive run rate and this has been achieved in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at the graph at the bottom of the slide, you can see the after-tax operating profit or BOP after-tax per quarters as the bars track against the net income after tax. The first quarter 2008 on the left shows the pattern we have seen in many quarters previously. Net income after tax slightly higher than business operating profit after tax because of small but consistent net realized gains. The dip into the end of 2008 and into 2009 shows that the financial crisis had its effect on net income after tax. But you can see the continuing recovery in the quarterly numbers. In addition, you can see that the historic pattern is reemerging of net income after tax very near or in future slightly above the operating profit after tax as the effect of the capital market crisis recedes.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to General Insurance. General Insurance has in 2009 delivered strong operating performance based on a significantly improved underwriting result. This is a direct result of our focus on pricing discipline and expense management. We set out to increase rates to counter falling investment yields using a differentiated approach and to control expenses. We have achieved it.</p>
          <p>Looking at the top line development, we have seen a reduction in gross within premium by 4% year-over-year in local currency. Net written premium is also down by 4%. We have been buying less reinsurance. In 2010 we will employ some more of our surplus capital at our required hurdle rates by increasing our participation and net retentions on our current book of business. The main factors behind the premium decrease continue to include firstly our maintained underwriting discipline where we are still not prepared to write business below our profitability hurdles as well as our differentiated approach to rate changes.</p>
          <p>Secondly, increased rates, 3.3% year-over-year while at the same time keeping overall retention rates at comparably high levels. Thirdly, we clearly have to recognize the impact from the reduced economic activity in many markets and as a result the volumes of our insured exposures have come down in particular in North America.</p>
          <p>Looking at the individual business divisions, although Global Corporate shrank the top line by 1% in local currency, we achieved rate increases across the book as well as targeted growth in selected markets like European financial lines as well as our expansion into Asia Pacific and Middle East.</p>
          <p>North America Commercial on the other hand continues to be heavily affected by reduced demand for insurance capacity in some of its key business segments. In particular, construction and automotive dealers accounted for about half of the reduction. We have, however, largely maintained our customer base and have achieved growth in certain areas including our global and national strategic broker channels. Europe General Insurance reduced premium slightly in local currency even though we have successfully increased rates in most markets. This was driven by our personal lines business due to a very competitive environment as well as underwriting actions taken to counter issues in our motor portfolio mainly in the U.K. and Italy. At the same time, our Commercial lines business managed to maintain volumes.</p>
          <p>International markets achieved a local currency growth of 3% during the year with Latin America growing by 17% based on both organic growth and through the acquisition of Minas Brasil end of 2008. In Asia Pacific the underlying growth rate was 7%, but partially offset by the transfer of business to Global Corporate. In all, this resulted in a 1% increase in operating profit in local currency with the improved underwriting result already having absorbed, lower premium volumes compensating the drop in investment results.</p>
          <p>Another achievement is that our operating margins both gross and net have increased year-over-year in a difficult environment. I will now go through the key profit drivers in detail starting with the rate change monitor. As mentioned, General Insurance rates are up by 3.3%, a marginal improvement compared to the nine months. This is a great achievement in a market where many players focus solely on share and shows that our margin protection efforts through differentiated rate increases are successful. If you dive into the details, we see that the distribution of these rate increases across the different portfolios have changed in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Rate increases on our Corporate and Commercial lines in North America have moderated in the last quarter. This should not come as a surprise as our dedicated rate initiatives were started in the last quarter 2008 and in North America these increases start to compound as I will explain in a minute.</p>
          <p>This, however, more than offset by European General Insurance where the rate increases have accelerated compared to the nine months. At the same time, Global Corporate in Europe and international markets achieved similar rate increases to those at the nine months. The reason for the higher level of rate increases in Europe is twofold. Firstly, we are gaining traction in our push for higher rates in our Commercial segment. Secondly, we have the market-wide motor portfolio deterioration seen in certain countries. The push for additional rate in personal lines forms the part of the mitigating actions taking to counter these hat-tricks. In Italy, we are in addition canceling distribution contracts and restricting premium discounts for agents failing to meet our required return expectations. In the U.K., we also have a dedicated claims management strategy in place to offsets the negative effects from claims farming activities in the market. Also, we recently announced that we will increase personal lines motor rate in the U.K. by up to additional 20% starting in March.</p>
          <p>Let's now see at the rate changes from another angle. We showed this slide at our nine months presentation. To repeat, the graph shows a simplified view of policies renewing in each quarter over a two-year period, that is, policies that renewed in Q1 2008 average experienced a rate reduction of 2.4% and then in the following year 2009 a 2.1 rate increase. By taking a two-year perspective, this special block of policies experienced an effective rate decrease of 0.4%.</p>
          <p>Obviously, this simplification does not account for lapses and new business in each period but provides an overview of our response to cost drivers like inflation, interest rates and changes in frequency. We have observed that new business pricing is in an area where the overall market appears less disciplined. Once again, I want to highlight that we apply the same pricing discipline and methodology based on technical price for both new and renewed business. As you remember, the compounded rate increases have developed favorably over the first three quarters, although we saw the highest rate change in the second quarter of 2009. This trend has continued in the fourth quarter which means that the compounded rate increases is two percentage points higher quarter-on-quarter at 4.9%. This means that our market-leading push in defense of margins continues unabated.</p>
          <p>Rate increases are still needed to cover claims trends as well as lower yields. This, however, only provides a written view, but does not tell us how these rate changes are earned through the bottom line. So, let's have a closer look and that is slide number 14.</p>
          <p>If you look at the written rate changes over 2008 and '09, you can see that the negative rates written in 2008 vastly earned through in 2009. This has initially offset the positive impact from rate increases achieved in the fourth quarter 2008 and after. The red line in the graph represents an estimate of how cumulative written rate earned in over time. As you can see, the 2009 year-to-date earned impact for the full year makes up just a bit more than 1% which leaves the majority of the written rate change still unearned. This in turn means that a major part of the 2009 rate actions will be earned in 2010.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have good news on the underlying performance of our General Insurance book of business where we can report an improvement in the underlying loss ratio of 0.4 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Looking at this in more detail, we can see a number of very interesting points. Firstly, our North American business, North America Commercial and Global Corporate in North America drove through a 1.5 percentage point improvement in the underlying loss ratio and this in a very competitive marketplace.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you look at our Corporate and Commercial business in Europe, we see an even better situation with the underlying loss ratio improving 2.5 percentage points. And thirdly, European Personal lines were adversely affected by the performance of our motor books in the U.K., Italy and Russia. Without this we would have delivered a stable underlying loss ratio in Europe Personal lines; all in a very competitive marketplace.</p>
          <p>So why have we seen these improvements even though rates have not fully earned through. The answer lies in our differentiated approach to rate increases which means that we apply higher rate increases for the less profitable segments of each individual portfolio. This resulted in a much lower retention in these segments and through the higher lapse rates the average profitability of the portfolio improved.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, we have 2009 rate increases still to earn through in 2010 and we have a better quality and price book of business. Both factors support our expectation of sustainability of earnings.</p>
          <p>So, now, let's move to the loss ratio in more detail. Overall the reported loss ratio improved 1.6 points to 70.9% year-on-year, which can be fully explained by the benign catastrophe experience this year. Large losses increased somewhat during the year, but still within a reasonable range. On the other hand, you can see that we have not reported any major catastrophes in 2009. Looking at the development of prior year reserves I remind you of the charges we took for asbestos in the second and third quarter of a total net $200 million. The total gain from prior year development was just over 1 billion which means the fourth quarter added just $500 million. In all, this resulted in the improved underlying loss ratio which I explained and discussed already before.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to the expense ratio development on slide 16. The 0.4 percentage point increase in expense ratio is not driven by the volume reductions. The increase is instead driven by higher levels of commission based on changes in business mix as well as a modified approach to broker remuneration. As a result, the commission ratio increased by 0.3 percentage points year-over-year. At the same time, our disciplined expense management kept our other technical expenses in line with declining volumes. The reasons behind the largely flat ratio for other technical expenses are the achievement of our lead-to-market expense saving program where General Insurance contributed about $250 million. Included in the underwriting expenses are the ongoing investment we make in profitable growth and operational transformation. Those examples include our Middle East expansion and our integrated product unit in North America.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a closer look at the loss reserve levels. In 2009, we saw our results grow by 2% net of currency effect. The reason for this increase is additional business taken on to the Group's book through the increased quota share reinsurance agreement with the Farmers Exchanges. On a like-for-like basis, the reserve levels remain flat underlying that our reserving conservatism remains unchanged. Looking at claims payments excluding the effect from the growth of the Farmers Re quota share, the increases are due to higher loss loads on European motor and reserve.</p>
          <p>With this, let's now look at the Life business. The strategy which Global Life has been following is evident in the excellent results of 2009. These results are remarkable both in absolute terms and relative to the performance of the sector. All six pillars are now fully operational and contributing to our growth targets. In conjunction with this we have been developing global propositions and our operational hub strategy. Global Life reported 28% growth in local currency in gross written premium, policy fees and deposits.</p>
          <p>This growth along with the focus on in-force management drove the policyholder net inflow to a positive $5.4 billion for the year. The increase in new business volume of 19% in local currency reflects strong growth in Spain benefiting not only from the effect of the business acquired last year but also from strong organic growth of 76%. We also achieved 44% local currency growth in Latin America from individual and corporate protection and savings products. In the U.K., we achieved local currency premium growth of 6% with more long-term savings and bank distribution deals. In Ireland, we continue to gain market share reaching 15% in a market that has declined by over 25%. This growth balanced reductions in emerging markets in Asia and slightly lower sales in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The new business margin at 21.3% reflects both, our ability to hold expenses flat as we invest in our strategy and industrialize our operating model as well as the effects of a shift in product mix to protection and long-term savings in response to changing market conditions. The growth and sustained margin resulted in a new business value of 782 million, up 9% in local currency. This strong value was driven by volume growth in Spain and Latin America, as already mentioned before, but also by our new operating unit in Luxembourg and from improved margins in the U.K. Lower interest rates benefited the U.S. and Australia, but adversely affected Switzerland and Germany.</p>
          <p>The embedded value operating earnings which are now fully compliant with the CFO Forum's MCEV principles were 1.9 billion representing an operating EV return of 14.9% for the year. The operating earnings benefited from the strong new business performance as well as impact of the change to full MCEV principles. Focused management of expenses and the in-force business led to a positive operating variance overall.</p>
          <p>I will discuss the business operating profit of the segment in a minute when taking you through our profit by source analysis. But now, let's spend a few moments on the details on the Global Life new business by distribution channel. Bank Distribution was the main growth driver growing 55%, primarily in Spain where the new business acquired continued to perform well. In addition, the U.K. business grew from the sale of newly introduced investment product through our banking partners.</p>
          <p>The Private Banking Client Solution achieved sales of $186 million from a standing start through the new private banking hub in Luxembourg. Sales were generated in the U.K. and Italy contributing almost $2 billion of new assets under management. The Corporate Life &amp; Pension pillar grew 60% in local currency driven by strong sales of protection business to international groups leveraging relationships of our Global Corporate business and from local protection sold in Ireland, Latin America and U.K. The IFA/Broker pillar increased by 11% in local currency despite difficult market conditions. We had good growth in Italy and in the U.K., the later as a result of successful pension sales. These were partially offset by weaker unit-linked growth elsewhere, especially in Germany.</p>
          <p>For both, our Asian and International/Expat pillar, most operations continue to achieve growth. However, as already mentioned last quarter, our Hong Kong business, both domestic and International/Expat was significantly affected by a fall in consumer appetite in unit-linked products, although we saw a small improving trend in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to slide number 20 and to profit by source analysis. As communicated at the Global Life Investor Day last May, we have been developing the profit by source analysis internally to better assess and drive our Life business operating profit. I would like to take you through the operating result with a focus on the three key insurance margins of expense, risk and investment. The Global Life business operating profit of 1.5 billion decreased by 1% in dollar terms but increased 5% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Overall, the underlying run rate of the business has remained strong with the new business trend reduced despite the strong new business growth. The reported business operating profit has benefited from a higher level of one-off compared to the prior year, which amounted to a number of about $260 million, unchanged from the level at nine months. The expense margin has increased 49% in local currency benefiting from lower new business trend, underlying expenses being held flat year-over-year, as well as a one-off benefit from the debt unlocking as reported before.</p>
          <p>This was offset by reduced fund-based fees due to the lower average stock market level and reduced non-fund-based fees, primarily due to lower premium levels in Germany and Switzerland compared to the year before.</p>
          <p>Thanks to strong policyholder inflows and market recovery assets under management are higher at the end of 2009. Therefore, we are off to a promising start in 2010 certainly as far as fund-based fees are concerned. The risk margin has improved 9% in local currency driven by favorable experience, less external reinsurance costs and the growth in risk volumes as a result of strong protection sales which I have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>The investment margin has improved 10% in local currency as a result of the slightly lower return on shareholder assets more than compensated by an increased investment margin over guarantees and other policyholder participation. Other profits have decreased mainly due to the inclusion of one-off benefit from reinsurance of non-core annuities in the year before. The interest, depreciation, amortization and non-controlling interests have increased primarily due to a full-year impact of the acquisitions that occurred in the third quarter 2008. You can find more details in the appendix regarding the profit by source results.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to our third business segment, Farmers. Again, Farmers has produced a high quality set of results which combine growth, profitability and expense control. Let's start with the Management company. The margin on gross earned premium is up over prior year to an excellent 7.2% as we continue to manage our expenses through various initiatives. Operating profit increased by 10% or $124 million driven by these expense initiatives as well as a higher top line at the Exchanges driven by the acquired 21st Century business. In the first six months since acquisition, 21st Century added over 210 million to management fees, over 80 million to operating profit at the Management company level as well as 1.1 billion of premium at the Exchange level.</p>
          <p>The other effect of the deal is that the increased quota share we have taken which gave a BOP benefit of additional 43 million at Farmers Re in the second half of '09. I will update you on the integration focus in a minute and you can find more financial information on 21st Century in the appendix of this presentation.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Farmers Re, Farmers Re gross within premium are up by $3.2 billion over prior year as a result of increased quota share with the Exchanges in two steps; from 5 to 25% in late 2008 and in turn to 37.5%, as well as benefiting from growth in the Exchanges' top line. In light of the strong solvency position at the Exchanges, this quota share has been reduced to 35% with the effect of end of December 2009. As a result of the growth in premium and investment income, operating profit increased to $228 million at the Farmers Re level.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a short look at the Exchanges. The Exchanges, which we manage but do not own, have maintained the strong growth track record which started back in 2006. Gross written premium increased 5.4% largely as a result of the acquisition of 21st Century in the second half. Excluding the acquisition and the small business transfer from North America Commercial, the Exchanges top line has reduced by 2.1% overall in a contracting market driven by the auto book as a result of the difficult economic environment in the U.S. and competitive pressure.</p>
          <p>The adjusted combined ratio is 91.3%, 7.1 percentage points better than a year ago, 4.3 are due to lower catastrophe experience and the balance is driven by price increases earnings through as well as improving loss trends mainly in the auto book. As I have already alluded to, net surplus increased by $575 million and the surplus ratio rose to 43%, putting the Exchanges in a very comfortable surplus position.</p>
          <p>Now, let me update you on the acquisition of 21st Century more specifically. Our 21st Century acquisition has been included in these results for six months. As you can see, 21st Century wrote over $2.4 billion of premium for the full year 2009. An ever increasing proportion is from the direction channel as agency auto is being folded in the Exchanges Foremost plant. As a result of negative residual effect of legacy brand issues and a challenging U.S. economy, direct premiums have experienced a downward trend, however, at a decreasing rate. It is very encouraging to see that monthly renewal retention rates are bouncing back to levels close to 82%. Still, higher retentions are not sufficient to offset lower new business. However, we are also seeing positive signs here. The new business application in November and December '09 and also January 2010 are higher than in the same months the year before. 21st Century's combined ratio has seen some minor uptick in Q4 driven by seasonal and one-off effects.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that the acquisition remains on track to achieve earnings per share accretion in year one because of the integration synergies we have achieved. Annual run rate savings in the Management company amounts to $45 million while savings in the Exchanges will contribute to their profitability and surplus as well as to the underwriting results of the quota share. We are running a state of the art integration process. 55 out of 65 AIG transition services have been closed off on or ahead of schedule. The remaining 10 will be closed off by the end of the first quarter 2010. Further consolidation into Farmers' operations continues as scheduled in 2010 and will include areas such as data center, IT application and claims operations. In summary, the integration is really well on track.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the other operating and non-core businesses to complete the run through of the businesses. Other operating businesses include net head office expenses, external debt costs and some sample foreign currency gains and losses, the result &#x2013; and the results for alternative investments. As we reported at the third quarter, there was a gain of $200 million from buying back subordinated debt over the summer. The non-core businesses segment had a loss for the year of 290 million. It made a profit of 143 million in the fourth quarter when we have seen benefits of the further recovery in the financial markets in the quarter and from increase in commutation gains in a number of our run-off businesses.</p>
          <p>All parts of non-core businesses made a profit in the quarter with the exception of the banking business where we further increased loan provisions in Ireland and in the U.K. by 50 million overall in response to new information on a few specific loans. While the non-core business segment is relatively sensitive to extreme capital market volatility in the absent of large market correction, we believe these businesses are back in a stable position and expect them to revert to running off at a small profit over time. We have taken additional hedging actions to protect the U.S. Life business in run-off against falling markets. We are investigating changing the hedge structure to potentially a full dynamic hedge to reduce future hedging costs. This could potentially warrant a different accounting treatment of that block of business with the usual restatement consequences in accordance with IFRS 9.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the performance of our Group investments on page &#x2013; slide 24 for the audience on the phone. Net investment income decreased by 14% in dollar terms and 9% in local currency driven by lower dividends on equities and reinvestments at lower interest rates. Net capital losses through P&amp;L were $1.4 billion for the full year and 0.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Positive mark-to-market adjustments in the last quarter were offset by some impairment on bonds, equities and mortgage loans, as I mentioned, as well as the mark-to-market losses on risk reduction hedges of about 50 million. You can find as usually the details in the appendix.</p>
          <p>Net investment returns through P&amp;L was a positive 3.2% for the 2009, slightly up compared to 2008. Changes in unrealized losses on investments included in equity were a positive 5.7 billion for the full year and a negative 0.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Although equities and asset-backed bonds have posted gains in the last quarter, government bonds lost about 0.7 billion as yields increased in the last weeks of the year. As a result, total investment return for the full year 2009 amounted to a strong 6.3% compared to 1% in 2008. Throughout 2009 the key principles of Zurich's disciplined investment approach remain unchanged and as always, you can find further details around our investment portfolio in the further slides. Our equity exposure is well controlled and amounts now to 2.9% at the end of December taking into account our hedging program which protects about 16% of the equity exposure.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at our shareholders' equity development. Shareholders' equity at $29.7 billion, a new historic high, is $7.6 billion up on the 2008 year-end number. Most of the increase, as you can see on the slide, increase arose in the second and third quarter. The increase of 1.2 billion in the fourth quarter was largely driven by the net income of 1.1 billion while further or other movements were fairly small.</p>
          <p>Now, let's summarize our capital position on slide 26. Solvency ratio grew due to retained earnings during the fourth quarter as asset and liability values remained relatively stable. Our solvency run ratio is very healthy at 198% after accruing for the dividend which reduces the ratio by 17%. Solvency II remains a hot topic for the industry. Quite clearly, there is much uncertainty on the details and we are taking our full part in the industry discussion. However, as a Group we are subject to the Swiss Solvency Test. This is well into its pilot phase and we are very comfortable with our estimated SST ratio.</p>
          <p>I spoke last quarter about the expected developments on transferring more business to our EU-based General Insurance carrier. We have achieved the transfer of the business in Spain, Italy and Portugal through our timetable for January 1, 2010. The main block of business is still to be transferred as our German business which we expect to move across later this year. This will result in a single EU company with a broad branch structure and with a gross written premium of about $15 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our internal economic solvency model at the bottom of the chart. This has remained stable through the quarter and after accruing for the dividend and the 2010 expected growth requirements, is at 136%. As we indicated in November and as Martin has already said, we do not intend to restart the share buyback program in the near future. While capital markets remain uncertain, there is value for all stakeholders in a strong solvency level. Our caution on this surplus position is in respect to potential external factors which we cannot control. Although things are different when we look at the factors we can control such as our sustainability of earnings, this is why our positive attitude shown in the dividend proposal is not in conflict with our caution on preserving the strength of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So, with this, let's look at our dividend proposal. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. We aim to pay a competitive sustainable dividend bearing in mind the mid-term outlook. We believe this dividend fulfills these criteria. We have proposed a dividend of CHF16 which reestablish the pattern of our 2007 dividend. The reduction we took in our 2008 dividend was in light of the grim environment at that time. We do not set dividends based on payout ratios or yields. But in either measure we belief this is a highly competitive dividend. Our intention is to pay a dividend which is sustainable over the medium term and which therefore reflects our confidence in sustainable earnings and our expectation for future growth opportunities. We will continue to run our capital management on these principles and look forward to being in a strong position and being able to take advantage of any economic upturn as they arise.</p>
          <p>Looking at the book value per share in Swiss francs on the top left hand corner of the chart, the book value increased 25% in the year to CHF209 while still being below the year-end level of 2007 of 229, but the dollar lost about 7% against the franc and the sterling about 24% compared to year-end 2007 and therefore, CHF209 is a really strong number.</p>
          <p>In summary, our operating businesses remain sound with a good performance in difficult markets, achieving selected growth in those area where we have been able to grow profitably. We have succeeded in managing the underwriting challenge in Commercial lines through 2009 as evidenced by the rate increases we have achieved. In the same way, for 2010, we will continue to address the challenges in European Personal lines.</p>
          <p>As a result, our balanced risk management has allowed us to continue to perform at solid levels of profitability through the recent market conditions. The capital base and solvency have been considerably strengthened during 2009 not only by the recovery in the investment market but by our approach to risk and by actions we have taken over the last five quarters.</p>
          <p>As Martin pointed out earlier, we continue to invest in the brand which has a growing presence in the market increasing our competitive position. We will continue to manage our business aiming to deliver consistent high-quality earnings with growth. This puts us in a strong position to be able to react quickly to any market condition which arise.</p>
          <p>So, now, let's move to Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Benoit P&#xE9;trarque, Kepler. In U.K., Italy and Russia, you had higher costs related to the recession or are these structural change which will also continue going forward? And while to Farmers, when will the treaty go back to normal level? Do you have the timeline for this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May be before Dieter gives some more details, particularly on the second question, on U.K. and Russia. In the U.K. as you know, the motor business as such has an issue and combined ratio for the industry now around 120 due to different factors. And we have started with price action and will continue throughout this year with price action to respond to this change in the marketplace and there we are pretty optimistic as we have shown in other countries that we will get to the profitability levels in line with our own expectations.</p>
          <p>Russia is a bit different clearly. Russia had more severe I think recession to face than other countries even than the U.K. with a high dependency of our activities well in the motor business, the setback there to a certain extent is structural. We are equally confident like in the U.K. that through price action and management action to get the Russian operation in line with our original business plan when we did the acquisition at that time of NASTA as the company was called prior to the rebranding into Zurich. And maybe on Farmers, maybe you want to add Dieter on that question, if there is a need though and delegate more on Farmers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say motor line problem in these three European markets not called structural but I think these are market wide issues. And I think as we see a lot of opportunities here to move forward and also push through rate increases as we see that our competitors are feeling sustained pressure and that should really help us to turn it around. The Farmers Re quota share, we went down to 35% starting &#x2013; end of December, and we are reviewing this quota share every six months and with Farmers Exchanges surplus ratio further developing in the direction as shown here, we expect that it will reduce further quickly here.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question. Paul, yeah, please Paul Goodhind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's is Paul Goodhind from Redburn Partners. On the non-life side a few questions please. On the U.S. initially, could you talk about the gap between your pricing and the market pricing? It appears quite wide still. You're raising prices by 3% and the market is down by four to five based on the various surveys that one can look at; that's a big gap that one thinks can't be sustained for much longer.</p>
          <p>Either you have to come down to the market or the market sees an improvement or your share carries on falling, which it seems to be, because I think the volumes have actually accelerated their decline in the fourth quarter. Looks as though they're down 13% I think Q4 standalone, which is a bit higher than the decline in the first nine months. What's going on there? You can give some extra detail there would be great.</p>
          <p>And on the European side are we seeing in Italy a broadly based upturn in the market? Is there now real discipline across the marketplace? And what's happening into January, if you can give a bit more visibility there?</p>
          <p>And on Germany, you're showing sort of rates up 6%, but I guess the volumes written were very low in the fourth quarter so what's more relevant is what's happening in January. And the important renewal season, can you shed some light on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, that is a long list of questions. So let &#x2013; let me start with my home country that is always the closest to me. You are right the first quarter in Germany is always fairly light in motor renewal, because it is a market where January 1 is really the key date of the year. And the 6% is very much driven from rating actions we took in the direct channel, which has also more spreads than renewals over the year than the agent business, which is really Jan 1.</p>
          <p>So I would not expect a 6% increase for the Jan 1 renewals. But if you look at our combined ratio in Germany, I think we are holding up very steady and I think we have kept the difference to also to larger competitors in a very positive way. So, therefore, I think we are all not really concerned about our development in Germany.</p>
          <p>In Italy, I think we see now really tractions in our rate increase and portfolio adjustments starting really visible in November and December. And I think it will also continue in January. I think the whole market has recognized that they need to do something and what we can &#x2013; and therefore that helps also to look at the U.S. question. I think our rate activities were very much driven by the fact that we recognized very soon after the Lehman failure what impact it has on the long or mid-term outlook to interest rates, and we reacted very quickly, because we anticipated that interest rates will fall away. And that has really happened, and most of our competitors still believe interest rates are high. And they have to face reality at some point sooner or later, which should then actually also support the direction of rates we have taken already.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. you are right if you read the broker surveys they are all showing this sharp decline in rates, but brokers are actually not distinguishing between rates and premium. So when a customer has 10% less revenues and therefore the policy is 10% smaller, the broker says, oh premium is down 10%, but that is of course an unchanged rate. So, therefore, we should really distinguish between the precise measurement. And if you look at other high quality carriers in the U.S. what they have reported over the last couple of weeks, I think on the renewal rates, they are saying similar things as we are. I think the big difference between the others and us is the discipline on new business. It is very easy to be disciplined or let's say it is not very easy but it is easier to be disciplined on renewal business than on new business. And that I think makes a difference in our strategy in the U.S. at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Good morning my name is Daniel Zulauf. I'm from Basler Zeitung. I have a few questions. I was wondering whether Mr. Senn could give us an example showing where the company did not anticipate well, it did not react quickly enough in the past, an example which tells me how you want to change that.</p>
          <p>And second question is, does the board ask you to turn the company into growth mode? I mean you have been shrinking on the &#x2013; in terms of premium in the past and you are mentioning that the board wants you to produce smarter ways of growing the company.</p>
          <p>The third question is, are you willing to tell us something on your compensation package?</p>
          <p>And the last question is maybe on the &#x2013; on the dollar which you are using as a currency to present your results. I remember when you introduced the dollar as a reporting currency the situation was different. You were, as far as I remember, focusing American investors. The American stock market was at the time an important &#x2013; probably another different role than today. And I was wondering also your major competitor was American and I was wondering whether this is a thing you are considering, maybe one could imagine, to change the reporting currency into euros or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Mr. Zulauf &#x2013; also quite a few questions, so I'll try to go through in a systematic way. An example to find where he fundamentally could have done better given the crisis he faced, I fortunately don't have. And I must tell you looking back now if you would have told me three years ago what is going to happen with regards to economic environment and the financial meltdown we have seen, I would have not believed that Zurich is coming out as strong it is today.</p>
          <p>And during &#x2013; so that means we entered the crisis very well in terms of our philosophy, in terms of our strategy, in terms of how we have positioned the investment portfolio relative to liabilities risk adjusted. And during the whole crisis there was not one single moment within the Group Executive Committee and we had a few sleepless nights because we were working, but we had not one single moment where we had the feeling that we have to panic or whether we had to pull our feet onto the brakes. We took the feet off the gas pedal as we always do when it gets a bit blurry out there, right. But we never had to fully brake.</p>
          <p>There was a very organic, systematic approach and in the first quarter you remember us end of last year we had an economic solvency margin of 95 &#x2013; 98 and that's where we took the foot off the gas pedal and recovered with an economic solvency to 136 as we report now. Very comfortable. I wouldn't see what we could have done better. Maybe in the non-core businesses with the benefit of hindsight one could have been a bit faster, no doubt about it. But in the context of the overall firm, I think, the team and all of our employees did a marvelous job.</p>
          <p>Now second question was about the expectation on the board and the growth, and I want to make a differentiation here on what you have said that I alluded a bit in to a feeling that we're not growing. I must say that in Life business we have seen that we have an outstanding growth a great new business margin, new business values probably the best in the industry as it stands. APE growth 12%, difficult to expect more than that given the market environment. Farmers has shown a fantastic growth and what you're referring to is probably less growth in our General Insurance business Dieter has been alluding to, and there we take an approach on really making sure that we are managing the portfolio not just for top line growth but eventually and ultimately for profitability.</p>
          <p>And that's what we will continue doing. And Jim has always made the point, and that's as well part of our sort of culture, we want to grow profitable. We're not compromising profits just for top line growth, very important; that's not going to change. Compensation, we will with, as we always do, with the board of directors' will with the compensation report, publish compensation for board, for the Group Executive Committee member, and they will also publish the highest paid compensation package. I would assume it's mine but let's see what the board decides. And then you will have to respect if &#x2013; you will have to respect it's transparency.</p>
          <p>I wish all of us get more, okay, because that would mean all of us work better, all of us work harder, eventually work as a team, and I look very much forward to this report as well; I just don't know it yet. And it's going to be based on our performance, our performance we show to our shareholders, it's based on the performance we actually show to all of our stakeholders and not just the shareholders.</p>
          <p>And to give you an example here, last year when we took &#x2013; or the year before when we took dividend down to 11%, that was tough for our shareholders. We didn't feel good about it. We had a global salary freeze in place, the same time we froze salaries for all people. In an environment where the company was profitable, in an environment where many of our competitors lost money and decreased salaries, that didn't give a good feeling to our employees. So, I needed a lot of hand holding, a lot of explanation, but that's how we manage the firm. So, we celebrate together and at times we suffer together.</p>
          <p>And on the last question on reporting currency, I think Dieter has maybe some more detail. Let me just make one point, I think the dollar as a reporting currency has its pros and the cons as any other currency has. If you decide to release it in say Swiss franc on the Swiss market and obviously the Swiss franc as the underlying currency and we report it in other currency that's a time space question. The fundamental importance is that we are with our global business in Life and in General Insurance that deal very well diversified from a revenue flow point of view in generating revenue and income and obviously matching expenses against that across the organization in all the major currency regimes and that fundamentally is a very good position to be in, and therefore the dependency on currency fluctuations is a bit less important than when you would just have one stream of income or expenses in a given currency. Well I think Dieter you might want to give a bit more flavor to that last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the 10 &#x2013; more than 10 years ago the choice of the U.S. dollar was driven by the fact that we had really two-thirds of our revenue and our businesses in U.S. dollar and therefore that was a driver for the decision, not the competition or anything else. Actually that is now not anymore the case. So, in revenue terms, U.S. dollar is now below 50%. Probably actually if I look at the profit line, we earn now much more in our U.S. businesses than we ever did 10 years ago.</p>
          <p>But &#x2013; so therefore you can always argue what is the right currency. It is still the case the case that U.S. dollar is still our largest currency in our overall book, and therefore a change has &#x2013; actually has not yield any benefits to us. I think it is &#x2013; it would distort the historic presentation of the number. Everybody has started from scratch. All the analysts have to redo their spreadsheets, so we don't want to create this additional workload for them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have &#x2013; we have a lot of people wanting to call on the phone, but Michael would you like to ask a question? Could you make it less than a four or five part question, if possible please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try and restrict it to two questions, it's Michael here from Cheuvreux. The first question is on the price increases that you have pushed through in 2008 and 2009. You mentioned that a certain amount of this price increases are going to come through in 2010. In terms of the technicality how this works? You also mentioned that part of this is needed to counteract where there is claims inflation and a lower interest environments. My question would be what kind of expectation should we have of the price increases have an impact on the combined ratio in 2010?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on maybe a broader subject in terms of capital management, but I will try and formulate it in a different way. Could you maybe help us to give us an understanding what kind of retained earnings you require in order to drive your business forward in terms of the organic growth that you are envisaging and that you are budgeting for and also maybe in terms of some increases on risk on the balance sheet, for example, just so we have an idea what we can expect going forward in terms of sustainable dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start with the second question and what we want to stress is clearly that &#x2013; I think Dieter has mentioned that with regards to the dividend policy is that it's our ambition moving forward to pay an attractive dividend, to pay competitive dividend and I think with this dividend proposal we achieved that. He has also mentioned that we're not making that subject to the yield level on the dividend and we're not making it subject to the payout ratio, but it's got to be seen in the context of the overall capital management and with that the proposal we make now if we stand to that is probably a reflection of the strengths we feel the company is in. It is a reflection of anticipating potential setbacks moving forward. It's a reflection of our belief that we're going to continue to have stronger earning power within our core businesses, and it's clearly our ambition to continue on that path to make sure that we will have sustainable dividend policy in place in order to have our shareholders participating in our success.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure if I understood your question right, changes on the risks we take on the balance sheet, I think that's always subject to the process we have in a disciplined manner within the firm in looking on where do we get the biggest bang for the buck, so to speak, for the capital we bring into play. And that is not static, that's dynamic. And it's not only covering the insurance business; it's covering as well the asset side of the balance sheet and looking on how do we want to change the pattern on the risks we take on assets.</p>
          <p>As a principle I must say that before we think on changing the risk on our balance sheet on the asset side, i.e. try to generate more investment risk or investment returns or have investment risk, we are looking really on how we could grow the business on the insurance side and before we substantially or think even about increasing risk the risk on the asset side, we'd rather consider giving it back to the shareholder. Because if we start putting risk in our balance sheet on the investment side, we start losing the focus we have so well employed in the past by really managing assets against liabilities on a risk-adjusted basis, and we will not deviate from this very basic core principle. Then I think there was the...</p>

          <p>Michael, yeah, we are probably not starting a combined ratio forecast now, but as I have indicated the earnings potential from the rate increases is still fairly big compared to what is already in the 2009 numbers, so there is a &#x2013; clearly a positive element coming from it, and we have seen &#x2013; actually when I look at claims inflation 2009, the claims inflation is very much limited to the areas of personal lines motor because you can call, if you want, what we see in U.K. and Russia, claims inflation. It is not the usual sort of inflation. It is very specific one because in the U.K. this farming activities is where professional service providers have found a new area of growth, which is actually getting involved in claims process and drives the claims cost up; that is mainly law firms, rental car companies, and other providers, so that is a special form of claims inflation. But when we exclude this one, claims inflation overall was very light in 2009. And the indications are that general claims inflation, according to our experts, will stay similarly light in the &#x2013; at least in the beginning of 2010 we are not seeing any immediate changes in it.</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, everyone. Thank you very much. Just two questions I think please. The first one is, are you still happy with the way you look at the economic capital model, by which I mean I understand the short-term desire to have a bigger buffer than the long-term target, but are you still happy with the longer term target of 10 to 20% buffer?</p>
          <p>And also are you still happy with the way that model is constructed in terms of it being the policyholder view, in other words including senior debt. Given the way the regulatory winds are blowing, would it maybe best to look at it more of an ongoing concern basis?</p>
          <p>And then the second thing is on reserves &#x2013; mostly I think half of the release for the year came during the fourth quarter. Was there anything specific driving that or was that just of an annual review kind of effect? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Spencer, this is Martin speaking. Just leading into the question more fundamentally on that you have been alluding to the question on solvency, and I must stress that we have done a lot with regards to how to position ourselves and how to look at the solvency, at solvency management in the context of Solvency II, but also in the context of Swiss Solvency Test. And the fact is that the &#x2013; I think for the last five, six years we have been adhering to the Swiss Solvency Test and looking at &#x2013; we're still in the pilot phase. It's not in force yet as such, but in the pilot phase, and we feel very comfortable about meeting the standards of the Swiss Solvency Test, which we think is as it stands pretty equal to the requirements moving forward of Solvency II.</p>
          <p>So, we're taking an active part in the industry discussions with regulators, politicians on the Solvency II proposal and how to move forward from here and how do develop that. And we support a market move to economic solvency test. We believe that system should be principal based, and we also and I should stress that be a part of the process to ensure that any huge calibration in the models given particularly Solvency II is going to be reasonable and pragmatic. And maybe Dieter wants to add with regards to the current positioning on our economic solvency and the system use as such.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me &#x2013; thank you, Martin. Let me first actually add two comments on the use of our model and how we like it. First of all, it did not include a pro-cyclical measurement for investment risk. So that was certainly actually a very good tool to get through the crisis, because I think also under Solvency II and SST you can argue that this model might actually aim at more pro-cyclicality and then you have really discussed whether this is really a good model.</p>
          <p>And for our General Insurance business the calibration and details of the model are maybe actually of second priority. The most important thing is are you using your model on a day-to-day basis, and I think that has been established in particular in our General Insurance business over the last years very strongly. I think when you read the Oliver Wyman report, which got published last week in the Financial Times, you see actually also the result of it what Zurich achieved on a risk-adjusted basis over the last five years and the use of some model is actually the key. Yes, on all this calibration questions, you can have long debates and comparison with the Solvency II or SST, but that is not actually changing your risk behavior in a way it should.</p>
          <p>So, the calibration, are we happy with our 110 to 120 long-term, I think so. I wouldn't see a need to change the long-term perspective, but certainly I see a need to stay away from this number for the time being because we need at the moment the flexibility. As we said before, we believe that our capital base can cover the volatilities which the economic outlook still bears for all of us and will help us that we can continue with our operating results.</p>
          <p>On the reserve movements, no, actually it was a normal quarter from the review process, no special annual review. Actually the third quarter was actually already on a quite high level, but where the positive news got consumed a little bit of the asbestos' increase, which made &#x2013; was mainly in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So I think it was a normal quarterly development. Having said that, we are not saying it is every quarter the same number. I would really remind everybody that this process has some randomness in it. We let the people work through a regular, well controlled bottom up process and what is the outcome is the outcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could we have the next question then, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Brian Shea from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just had two -- it's probably quite boring questions. First of all, the other segment has been running at roughly in 800 million loss on an underlying basis for the past two years. So an awfully difficult segment to forecast. I just wonder, Dieter, if that would be a good number for us to use going forward. Are there any unusual influences we need to be aware of as we set our forecast?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I appreciate how you don't connect the dividend to the payout ratio. That is a typical way that external guys like me look at it. And one thing I guess that could help support a higher payout ratio is the earnings you get from Farmers Management Services. I suppose it only works though if those earnings are fully dividendable up to the parent. And I just wanted to ask that how fungible the earnings are at Farmers Management Services up to the parent, and if you actually do consider that as you set the dividend policy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Brian that two questions, which I would not consider fully boring, so maybe you should work on your questions. So the dividend from Farmers is actually -- or the results from Farmers are from, our perspective, fully fungible. And we have a high payout of after-tax profits. And that is I think certainly one of the reasons as this makes in our overall BOP number almost 20% or even a bit more that we can be very confident about corporate cash flows.</p>
          <p>And we are still not planning to move to a payout ratio. I think the company did this also 10 years ago, and I think we are much better off with the way we handle it. And if you look at our dividend level, it has reached a really good level as we as a management team and also our Board is thinking about it. And if we continue in this direction, I think everybody should be satisfied with the outcome.</p>
          <p>As a segment run rates, I think that is probably a reasonable good number because in the end, the run rates could be easily calculated. It is the headquarter expenses and it is our total interest expense, which are the two key drivers for the run rate number. Where the headquarter expenses have some volatility and that is the timing and the size of our funding expenses, which are included in our headquarter expenses. So that is the only more volatile part in the number, so rest is pretty stable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">

          <p>The next from the phone is from Mr. James Quin, Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes. How are you? I have two questions, please. I'm just wondering how you would characterize current commercial claims frequency trends. Certainly, I think Travelers was suggesting that claims trends have been running at very benign levels, perhaps, more benign than might have been expected. I'm just wondering if that is also the case yourselves and what you might attribute that to. And also whether that is linked to the fact that you're still getting quite high levels of reserve releases on the 2004, 2005 and 2006 years, which are presumably pretty well seasoned by now.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is actually just on the new Life disclosures on slide 49, which are very neutral, no question what to do with them, but I guess one question I would have on this is your Life AUM is up 12% in constant currency year-on-year. Now how would you see that impacting on these disclosures, which you've given us now of the Life BOP. So exactly what was the sort of sensitivity of your Life BOP to that coming into 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I guess I'd take the questions. The claims trend on commercial claims, I think, that we had in the U.S. some areas where we had a positive trend in frequency. But overall, it's pretty stable. And I assume that Travelers probably referred mainly to the workers' comp line of business, where indeed frequency for commercial, larger commercial was positive. And we would not see changes there.</p>
          <p>What is driving this? I think there are two drivers there were some changes in legislation, which helped already over the last years to exclude some of the small claims. Therefore we have seen lower frequencies. And additionally, I think also people are concerned about their jobs and therefore maybe come even on days to the jobs, where they stayed home before.</p>
          <p>That is linked to our reserve releases. Actually, when you look at our U.S. reserve movements, we have kept the U.S. reserves still pretty stable. We are not participating in the U.S. industries rush to release reserves from earlier years. And that is one of the reasons why we feel that we have a stable conservative approach to this point.</p>
          <p>The last question on new Life disclosure and assets under management, well, certainly the assets under management is one of the driver for our fund-based fees. But sensitivities, I think that would be a longer story and would require probably a more detailed drill down into our expense operating margin. And I think we will work on this detail and then see that we have it in a way that we can disclose it to everybody later. But actually, when you go into the appendix, you at least find some additional information broken down by country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true although if we kind of work out sensitivity, I'm not quite sure what we can use it for. But, obviously, it's a step in right direction. But coming back to the commercial claims, I mean I think Travelers weren't just talking about U.S. and obviously they're already in the U.S. but I think they are talking about commercial claims trends more generally. And that was a sort of broader question across your whole commercial book rather really than just the U.S?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Whole commercial book, we see it's more or less flat in frequency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that flat versus what you'd expected or flat versus 2009 and '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did not expect frequency changes, where we got, as I said, the positive surprises was probably more on lower claims inflation versus expected, and that is certainly, of course also helping the reserve movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we've got time for two more short questions. There is one hand up over there, if we could.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Stefan Sch&#xFC;rmann from Vontobel. I have two questions. First one is on your new money. Where do you invest currently your new money, and in terms of asset mix, I think, quite important and quite a challenging one? And the second one in terms of ALM, could you maybe update us on the duration gap you have maybe in terms of Life and Non-Life segments if it wasn't changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stefan. And let me just start with the ALM question. As a principle I want to stress that we are looking to always match the balance sheet. In tendency we are though rather long on the Life book and then rather short on the GI book. Overall, I would think we are pretty much matched at this very moment. It has not changed. In fact, it actually has, we even have linked situations since we have an option link since we have reported the third quarter results. So rather a bit longer on the asset side, but fundamentally no big change for your assumptions. I think the GI, General Insurance if you need some numbers it's duration of 3.4 versus Life liability of 7.1 with an overall asset duration of about five, 5.3, 5.4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>New money?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure I understood the first question on the new money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Allocation of new money?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the investment side, the allocation of new money, nothing changing in terms of the principles we apply. I think at this moment, we're going to continue to keep the strategic asset allocation fairly stable. And risky assets not to be increased. I think the risk we took on assets from end of the year versus the middle of the year has rather decreased. We're potentially looking to decrease hedge fund to a certain extent. We got some learnings out of exposing hedge funds, particularly the liquidity part of that. And we are going to continue to keep a very high quality on the credit portfolio with an unchanged overall allocation within fixed income. At this point, I see no reason why to change to equity allocation.</p>
          <p>Dieter has mentioned that after hedges at 2.8% and we feel pretty comfortable about this allocation. And again, it is really reflecting the nature of liabilities and is really giving us the right risk mix between risks on the asset side of the balance sheet and the risks on the liability side of the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to add, relatively speaking, compared to competition, Dieter has been mentioning that we anticipated lower interest rates already a while ago. And that's really where now the duration play comes well in because we have many, many years that we can endure lower interest rates before it really starts affecting us in a significant way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we have time for one more question. So there was a hand up here forward. Would you still like to ask a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one question to Mr. Wemmer. You have mentioned the CFO Forum. Which impact or influence do you expect to diminish the pro-cyclical's consideration in this risk-based capital and solvency requirements -- regulatory requirements discussions on the European stage and international stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much for this question. I think the first challenge for the industry is to get the Solvency II requirements to a reasonable level. And I think that is probably, in particular for the EU based companies that is a real concern. I am very sure that through the process we have still ahead of us, there will be a good outcome of this discussion, but it will require actually work on many details as it's a current proposal, which has been made by this European regulatory body called CIOPS and that has been now bought to be back in line with reasonable capital requirements because when you look back over the last years, the insurance industry actually came through the crisis quite well. And the politicians, I am sure are not planning to put an industry in the crisis mode, which is actually doing fairly well, which would end up with higher premium rates for the customers, and how do you explain this to retail customers in the EU now that they have to pay more for the same as before without any real reason. And that will I think consume as a whole discussion about Solvency II probably for the next 12 months.</p>

          <p>Okay. So I think we have to bring this to a close. We've overrun. I apologize those people on the phone, who didn't get to ask questions. I know there are a number still in the queue, but we have overrun the time. So I just like to hand over to Martin to make his closing remarks.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Malcolm, and thank you very much everyone on the call and here in the room for coming and engaging with us. I must say this is the first time I have been participating as a CEO. In these discussions, I have been ever since I've joined Zurich back in 2006, obviously engaged. It's a bit of a different feeling to be quite honest. But given the strengths of Zurich, it's a good feeling. And I hope that you share with us a strong commitment on how effectively we run the firm, and I think as well you hope or I hope at least you feel the confidence on how we think we are positioned and that we also share with you that we have an ability to generate value for all our stakeholders, not only now but also in moving forward.</p>
          <p>This is a great time to be engaged with Zurich. I think for all our employees, it's a great time, definite for me, and I look forward together with my colleagues and my team to generate continued value for all our stakeholders and I also look forward for active dialog and a critical dialog moving forward with all of you. Be challenging, be fair, I think that's great faces today as we started. And thank you very much for that. All the best and safe travel back.</p>
