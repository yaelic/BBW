          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Volkswagen AG's yearly (sic) [half-yearly] financial report, January to June 2012 conference call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christine Ritz, Head of Group Investor Relations for Volkswagen AG. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volkswagen's conference call on the results for the period January to June 2012 based on the ad hoc and the half-yearly report we published this morning. Joining me today on this call are Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management Volkswagen AG, responsible for Finance and Controlling, and the Member of the Board of Management Volkswagen AG, responsible for Group Sales and Marketing, Christian Klingler.</p>
          <p>As usual you can follow the webcast and download the chart from our website at www.volkswagenag.com/ir. Questions can be sent by email or called in. After the presentation, we will take questions first from analysts and then those from journalists. Let me now pass you over to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and allow me to add my warm welcome to those of you joining this call today. I am happy to be able to report to you today that the positive start we saw in the first quarter has continued in the second quarter despite an increasingly difficult economic environment particularly here in Europe.</p>
          <p>In the first six months of 2012, the Volkswagen Group delivered 4.6 million vehicles to customers across our car and truck divisions, an increase of over 10% showing the strength of our brands and our globalization strategy.</p>
          <p>The volume increase, including the consolidation of MAN, drove sales revenue up to &#x20AC;95.4 billion, and operating profit to &#x20AC;6.5 billion. Profit before tax increased to more &#x20AC;10 billion for the first six months, benefiting from a higher financial result, in particular from strong earnings at our equity accounted investments, in particular, in China as well as from a further positive &#x20AC;2.6 billion improvement in the measurement of the put/call rights we hold in Porsche.</p>
          <p>Automotive net liquidity ended the first-half at close to &#x20AC;15 billion, down just over &#x20AC;2 billion on the year-end as we continued to invest in new product and plants and also in trucks.</p>
          <p>Allow me now to hand you over to Mr. Klingler, who will take you through our sales performance in difficult market conditions during the first six months. Mr. Klingler, over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to the conference call from me also. This chart shows half-yearly growth of the world car market and Group deliveries to customers in comparison to the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>Market growth is observed in most regions around the world, and especially in Asia. The exception is Western Europe, where the eurozone debt price has to led to heavy contractions in the markets, such as Italy, France, Portugal, and Greece. While markets such as Germany still report some growth, an elevated level of market risk exists across the whole region. Negative developments streaming from Euro are affecting consumer confidence around the globe, and in particular the economies which export to the region. In spite of this, in the first-half of 2012, we see growth in major markets such as China, Russia, and North America. However, even this positive development has upticked increasing risk, which we continue to closely monitor.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the chart of the car market performance in direct comparison to the Volkswagen Group in the first-half of 2012 on a regional basis. As you can see, the Volkswagen Group has outperformed the market in every region. However, our worldwide market share has grown by only 0.1% due to the change of the market mix.</p>
          <p>Western Europe, a region with our strongest sales performance, has declined further, whereas regions, where our market share is lower, for example North America, have grown. The Western European market declined by 7%, although the Volkswagen Group recorded a decline of just 2.2%.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, major markets in the region suffered significant reductions amid a weak economic background. In particular, the Portuguese and Greek markets contracted by over 40% against the first-half of 2011, and Italy and France were down by 20% and 15%, respectively.</p>
          <p>While the current European crisis remains unresolved, there is considerable further risk to the car market volumes. Strong market headwinds continue, such as record high unemployment in Southern Europe, plus weak consumer sentiment across the region. Austerity measures like the recent Spanish VAT increase further constrained these markets.</p>
          <p>The situation is placing the whole automotive industry under considerable pressure. Competition has intensified significantly, which places particular strain on manufacturers which focus on smaller vehicles and Southern Europe. We closely monitor the situation in each market. The potential impact for the car market and our business from further shocks to the financial systems of sovereign balance sheets is substantial. While it's unlikely, the eurozone collapse scenario will heavily impact the entire global economy. The impact on our business would be severe, considerably worse than in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now we will take a look at the performance of the individual brands of the Group. In the first half of 2012, nearly all of our volume brands achieved an increase in terms of sales, and for the Group, total deliveries to customers exceeded last year's level by more than 10%. Volkswagen passenger car deliveries were up by an impressive 10.2% to nearly 2.8 million cars, driven by a robust sales record and strong demand in China, the U.S., Russia, and Germany.</p>
          <p>Audi deliveries rose by 12.3% compared to last year to 733,000 cars, being very successful in China, the U.S., Germany, and Russia. &#x160;KODA expanded deliveries up to 493,000 cars, mainly due to the strong demand in Russia, China, and India. SEAT suffered from the weak Western European markets, whereas Bentley has managed to expand deliveries. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles increased deliveries by 3.7% with strong demand in Germany, Russia, and in Australia.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to take a look at the situation of the different Commercial Vehicle brands of the Volkswagen Group. The global market for heavy trucks declined 8%, in particular South America declined with 12%, mainly in Brazil, showing worsening economic and financing conditions. In addition, the Brazilian market followed the changeover to Euro V engines and uncertainty of the customers with regards to the availability of low-sulfur diesel and that requires no additives. Western Europe declined by 5% also feeling the effects of the euro crisis.</p>
          <p>With the main focus on Europe and South America, Scania and MAN clearly felt the impact of these declining markets with a decrease of truck and buses deliveries in the first-half of the year 2012 of 20.5% for Scania and 9.6% for MAN.</p>
          <p>The results of Scania in Brazil were nearly in line with the heavy duty subsegment development, especially as Scania moved early to Euro V engines while others still had Euro III trucks in stock.</p>
          <p>In Europe, OEMs also were selling trucks from stock with heavy discounts. Scania already reduced production in 2011 and could avoid similar actions. While also impacted in Brazil, MAN was able to compensate for the shrink in market in Europe, for example with a high growth in Russia. Underlying service and power engineering where we are represented by MAN grew by 3% and reached &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>Let us now take a look at a few highlights on some of our new models, which will provide a good base for our sales performance in the coming months. The Volkswagen GTI Convertible is the most powerful Golf Convertible ever and offers unlimited driving pleasure with high-driving dynamics and feeling of freedom. Shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March, the Volkswagen Golf GTI Convertible was introduced on the markets last month.</p>
          <p>The SEAT Mii Doors is the car where compact charisma meets practical city living. It combines a Sporty Mediterranean design with more function and roominess and more comfort. This year's Mini 4-Doors was shown at the Geneva Motor Show and hit the road this May.</p>
          <p>The Audi A8 Hybrid is the world's most efficient luxury class hybrid sedan, and also the only European full hybrid in its segment. Efficiency on a grand scale. The Audi A8 Hybrid had its world premiere at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt last year and it was introduced in the markets last month.</p>
          <p>The MAN TGX made in Brazil is synonymous of excellent performance at a high level of comfort produced at the MAN Latin America plant in Resende, it meets the requirements of the growth markets in Central and South America using the best German technology. The MAN TGX had its market premier in Brazil this April.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Klingler. Now let's return to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch for some more details on the key elements of our financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first six months of 2012, sales revenue increased to &#x20AC;95.4 billion; that's up 22.6%. Excluding the first-time consolidation of MAN, revenue increased an impressive 12.6%. Focusing at first on our car and light commercial vehicles business, higher volume contributed &#x20AC;5.7 billion to the improvement. Pricing was a positive &#x20AC;0.3 billion, demonstrating our resilience in light of tough market conditions, while mix, including both product and country mix, contributed &#x20AC;2.1 billion to our performance. In difficult times, high-quality well-equipped cars are still in demand.</p>
          <p>Currency, mainly the U.S. dollar was positive at &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Our truck, bus and power engineering activities made a positive contribution to sales revenue of &#x20AC;7.2 billion, thanks to the first-time consolidation of MAN.</p>
          <p>And finally, sales revenue from our Financial Services division was up just under &#x20AC;1.2 billion bringing the total sales revenue to &#x20AC;95.4 billion for the first-half.</p>
          <p>The increase in sales revenue was one of the key factors behind the improvement in the operating profit, which increased from &#x20AC;6.1 billion to &#x20AC;6.5 billion in the first six months. As I reported on the Q1 call, the lower percentage growth in operating profit versus the percentage increase in sales revenue is in particular due to a significant purchase price accounting charge relating to the inclusion of MAN.</p>
          <p>Focusing on cars and light commercial vehicles, first, volume together with price and mix effects came to a total positive of &#x20AC;0.8 billion. Currency, after hedging, was a positive &#x20AC;0.5 billion. Our continued discipline with regards to our product costs resulted in an improvement of &#x20AC;0.9 billion. Fixed-cost s and depreciation increased by &#x20AC;1.4 billion, reflecting the growth in our production base as well as MQB-related costs as we renew our model portfolio.</p>
          <p>As highlighted earlier, the consolidation of MAN triggered a significant  PPA chart. When combined with the difficult market conditions in the truck and bus sector, which reduced the underlying earnings of MAN, as well as at Scania, the Group operating result was lowered by &#x20AC;0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And finally, earnings from Financial Services were up just over &#x20AC;100 million. In total, the operating result at &#x20AC;6.5 billion was up 6.7% on the first-half of 2011.</p>
          <p>With this new chart, we would like to spend a little more time on the important contribution made by our divisions, and to focus on the fulfillments from our equity-accounted investments. The Automotive Division, comprising our car, commercial vehicle and power engineering interest, increased profits before tax by &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>In addition to the operating result improvement previously outlined, positive developments in the financial results also played a key role. In the first-half, mainly through our investments in China and indirectly in Porsche AG, the equity-accounted result increased by just over 50%, of which our Chinese joint ventures contributed a pro rata operating profit of &#x20AC;1.8 billion. The other financial result includes a further appreciation of &#x20AC;2.6 billion in the value of our put/call rights, of which &#x20AC;2 billion related to Q2 alone, with respect to the indirect holding in Porsche AG, mainly driven by lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Switching now to our Financial Services Division, which also includes the financial services' activities of Porsche Holding Salzburg, MAN, and, of course, Scania. Let's take a look at some of the key metrics. Sales revenue increased by 14% to &#x20AC;9.6 billion in the first-half, again reflecting further volume growth. Operating profit grew by 22% to &#x20AC;731 million. Consequently, profit before tax for the entire Group increased 36% to &#x20AC;10.1 billion for the first-half.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the financial performance of our brands. For the first six months the Volkswagen passenger car earnings were &#x20AC;2.2 billion, up slightly on the prior period despite the upfront costs for MQB. Audi increased its earnings to &#x20AC;2.9 billion, maintaining an 11.5% margin. &#x160;&#x160;KODA recorded a solid result of &#x20AC;449 million, SEAT was able to slightly reduce its losses despite the difficult home market.</p>
          <p>Bentley reported a &#x20AC;57 million profit versus a small loss in the same period last year. And our light commercial vehicles brand, in a tightening market, was able to improve profit slightly to &#x20AC;242 million.</p>
          <p>Scania booked an operating result of &#x20AC;477 million, utilizing its extensive dealership servicing activities to partially offset the decline in sales. MAN, also impacted by the declining Brazilian and European markets, is included for the first time in H1 reporting a positive &#x20AC;354 million before purchase price accounting.</p>
          <p>The other line includes the elimination of inter-company sales, earnings of Porsche Holding Salzburg, as well as PPA charges. For the first-half charges amounting to close to &#x20AC;800 million for PPA have been booked within the operating results. PPA is expected to increase significantly in the second-half close to &#x20AC;2 billion for the full year with the inclusion of further charges relating to the integration of Porsche.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to cash flow in the Automotive division. Operating cash flow reduced from &#x20AC;8.4 billion to &#x20AC;6.8 billion, with the key driver being the movement in working capital, which in part reflects the inclusion of MAN, while the growth of our Group was an additional factor.</p>
          <p>Stock levels increased by &#x20AC;1.8 billion and are at a level that supports our sales network chain through the upcoming model changeovers, especially with regard to the new Golf. Investing cash flow reduced from &#x20AC;6.5 billion to &#x20AC;4.8 billion, reflecting in particular the purchase of Porsche Holding Salzburg in March 2011. Excluding equity investments, cash flow in investing activities rose to &#x20AC;4.4 billion from &#x20AC;3.2 billion, reflecting upfront investments in our factories, in particular with regards to MQB and the renewal of our product portfolio.</p>
          <p>The CapEx ratio came in at 4%. For the full year, this is likely to rise above 6%, reflecting our continued investments in new products within the usual seasonality pattern. Staying with the Automotive division, net liquidity at the end of the first-half was &#x20AC;14.9 billion, down just over &#x20AC;2 billion on the year-end 2011. This reflects not only the &#x20AC;1.7 billion outflow in dividends paid to shareholders of Volkswagen as well as to the minority shareholders in Scania and MAN, but also the significant investments in our future I just outlined on the previous slide.</p>
          <p>In addition, in Q1, MAN invested &#x20AC;150 million in India to buyout their joint venture partner as well as concluding the transaction relating to Ferrostaal for &#x20AC;350 million.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we invested a further &#x20AC;0.7 billion in MAN for a total of &#x20AC;2.1 billion year-to-date, thus increasing our stake to 75.03% of the voting rights and 73.57% of the share capital. As we announced on July 4, we expect to complete the creation of the integrated automotive group with Porsche shortly. We are, with regards to the expected closing on August 1, in the final stages and we expect to achieve the closing next week.</p>
          <p>The expected impact on net liquidity is around &#x20AC;7 billion, being a combination of the consideration of around &#x20AC;4.46 billion cash plus one share, and the absorption of the negative net liquidity of Porsche AG expected to be around minus &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, before leaving the topic of net liquidity, just to mention that we completed the takeover of Ducati last week. The acquisition of this excellence technology-leading premium motorcycle manufacturer will lead to the outflow of approximately &#x20AC;750 million in the third quarter. We are confident that our liquidity together with strong cash generation will provide sufficient flexibility to execute our strategic plan irrespective of fluctuations in the capital market.</p>
          <p>And so to conclude my presentation today, let me now turn to our outlook statement, which you can read in full in our half-yearly report. While we expect continued growth in the global car market and in the remainder of the year, the pace of growth is expected to slacken. For the full year, we are anticipating a decline in the Western European market, although the German market is expected to come in at the same level as last year.</p>
          <p>We expect the global car markets for the total market for trucks and buses to lose momentum and the chance of a decline below the level of 2011 cannot be ruled out. Our key group strength is our unique brand portfolio and the accompanying management model which underpins it. We will built on this with the inclusion of Porsche, which we hope to complete next week.</p>
          <p>Sales revenue is expected to exceed the level of 2011 results, in part due to the consolidation of MAN. The expected contribution in full of Porsche automotive business will have a relatively slight impact on revenue due to consolidation effects. The earnings contribution from MAN will be limited due to the PPA write-downs. High initial PPA is also expected to largely offset Porsche's contribution to the operating profit this year.</p>
          <p>In summary, we aim to match the operating results achieved in 2011 with the result of &#x20AC;6.5 billion in the first-half. This indicates a lower result for the second-half, reflecting the increasingly tough market conditions here in Europe and slowing growth elsewhere. MQB effects in the second-half will also have an impact as we launch the next generation of the Golf and other key models.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our strong balance sheet, our improving cost structure, together with high flexibility and production plus our leading-edge and technology and a strengthening product portfolio while not forgetting the addition of the iconic Porsche brand in just a few days' time leads us to consider ourselves well prepared for the challenges ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. As we move now into the Q&amp;A section of our call, can I please ask you to limit yourself to just two questions to allow everybody a chance within the time available. So let's now start with the questions of analysts. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will take our first question from Michael Tyndall from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Mike Tyndall from Barclays. As it happens, I have two questions. The first one just relates to cash. If I am not wrong, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, you suggested when you announced the Porsche transaction that your minimum cash level is now &#x20AC;10 billion in order to keep the rating agencies happy, and if I look what you finished the quarter with, &#x20AC;15 billion, and the &#x20AC;7 billion basically going out for Porsche and a further &#x20AC;750 million for Ducati, it seems to me as if you're going to fall below that &#x20AC;10 billion. So I am just wondering whether perhaps I've got the &#x20AC;10 billion wrong or perhaps you are very optimistic about cash inflow in the quarter ahead.</p>
          <p>And then the second question, sorry, might feel a bit convoluted, but if I look at slide number 11, in fact 10 and 11 in combination, volume mix and price on my numbers was &#x20AC;3.3 billion contribution to revenues in the second quarter, but only a &#x20AC;0.1 billion contribution to EBIT, and within that price was &#x20AC;0.3 billion, so if I assume that price dropped straight down, then one of the other two or both of the other two are negative. And I'm just wondering if you could help me understand how a positive volume or a positive mix could actually turn out to be a negative for EBIT? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Michael. So you have two questions for us. The first question relates to our cash or our net liquidity, what we think is the right level for our needs and for our business. You're assuming or referring to a figure of &#x20AC;10 billion of net liquidity as a basis for our business that is still the case, or what should be the right figure you should think of for the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>And the next question refers to our slides 10 and 11, where you want to know how volume mix price actually then turns out to the EBIT and how is the other comparison between the first quarter and the second quarter. So if you can give him some more details how this development can be explained?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the first topic in terms of net liquidity, it's very clear whenever we talk about medium-term targets, it's clearly something which is not met every day, so to say. And first of all it's very clear the integration of Porsche will erase bad effects given, first of all, the money outflow; secondly, the integration of negative net liquidity of the operating Porsche company, &#x20AC;7 billion. So if we historically deal with this issue, we were historically always saying the Group needs some &#x20AC;5 billion net liquidity. We've stepped up this number to some &#x20AC;7 billion to &#x20AC;8 billion as being absolutely sufficient to deal with operating challenges and refinancing challenges. And I said and I still believe that this is the right target medium-term as the Group continues to grow quite significantly. We also see this moving from 2012 to 2013 that we should target on a net liquidity number of &#x20AC;10 billion.</p>
          <p>To the second question in terms of the ratio between the volume respectively mix effect and price produced relative to EBIT development, it is first of all that in order to do an appropriate comparison, it's absolutely necessary to eliminate the PPA charge, because otherwise that's putting too much water into the wine. No, taking a thorough elimination at this point, one would find out that comparing the performance the Group has turned out within the first-half with 2011, would show a picture where, in relative terms, operating profit to sales revenue in the first-half of 2012 on the basis of an elimination of the PPA charge would come pretty close to the numbers we have shown up with in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Horst Schneider from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello it's Horst Schneider from HSBC. Two questions, and the first one relates to hedging and currency gains. Could you maybe update us, what is your current level of hedging, particularly speaking for the dollar, and what is your open exposure then for 2013 and which level of positive currency gains can we expect in H2? Will it be on the same magnitude as in H1?</p>
          <p>Then the second question relates to your guidance. So you maintain your guidance, you say you aim to achieve the 2011 operating profit level. So that assumes in my view that you want to achieve an operating profit of around about &#x20AC;5 billion in H2, so a sequential downturn of more than &#x20AC;1 billion in H2 versus H1. So I want to know, is the guidance that you give realistic guidance or would you call the guidance rather conservative? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Horst. So you have two questions for us. So the first one relates to hedging and currency gains if you can give &#x2013; if we can give some more information about the current level of hedging, especially with regards to the dollar and our exposure also for 2013. And if we can quantify the currency gains we probably expect in the second-half of this year.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is relating to our outlook. If we can, if we can be more precise of what is the outlook for the second-half, is it a realistic guidance or a more conservative one. So if we can give here maybe some more information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To the first question on hedging, first of all. As you were able to recognize in the walk-down of operating profit for the first-half, we were able to book a positive contribution coming from exchange rates, including hedging. Now clearly, I think you are well aware that by principal, the policy of Volkswagen is a very conservative one, which means we're highly hedged short-term and then, of course, in the future, the hedge rates move down somewhat, which essentially means to look at the second-half of 2012, the open position is a little bit higher than the one in the first-half.</p>
          <p>Now clearly what I have to state here if relevance is taken to the overall profitability, it's not only the dollar influencing the picture, we have a very significant basket of currencies where hedging is either not really possible or is just too expensive. So it depends on quite a number of currencies which can have a quite important influence.</p>
          <p>From what we can say from today's point of view, if we take the whole basket together it should create another positive contribution in the second-half of 2012. It would be a little bit premature to say on whether this would be more or less relative to the amounts stated in the first-half of 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of the guidance for 2012, clearly we we're always guiding for a somewhat weak third quarter for the obvious reasons that we are just in the middle of a massive model changeover of very significant changes in a number of production sites, and this clearly means that the P&amp;L in the third quarter will be specifically hit by these effects. That's fully being taken into consideration when we established our guidance and so far I can say we are fully on track in terms of the actual performance relative to that path.</p>
          <p>What I probably should also add at this point, is, again, that Porsche is not going to contribute even on the basis of the full consolidation, which we will do starting from August 1, will not contribute any significant amounts to the operating profit in 2012 for the obvious reasons that there is a very significant PPA charge to be taken, and in a similar way also MAN in a two-fold consideration won PPA charge secondly the operating performance being somewhat under pressure at MAN. So this is not going to be any significant contribution to our operating performance in the second-half.</p>
          <p>Again, in a nutshell we confirm that our goal for the operating profit in 2012 is to match the 2011 level, and there everything is being taken under consideration and we can say from today's point of view, we are fully on track.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Referring back to chart number 11 and the walkthrough on the operating profit, the fixed-cost  fund start-up costs seem to have risen by &#x20AC;0.8 billion in the second quarter versus &#x20AC;0.6 billion in the first quarter. You mentioned that you had some product cost but also MQB. Has the MQB element actually accelerated in the second quarter? And also could you comment on are you suggesting as well that the cost specifically related to the Golf 7 launch are going to be taken in Q3 or will they be falling in Q4? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Steven, for your question. So you are referring again to chart number 11 and you would like to have a little bit more information about the fixed-cost , the amount of fixed-cost s and start-up costs, and if we can provide some detail if the MQB charge was in Q2 higher than in Q1, and how this possible MQB cost will develop then in the second-half, if that is accelerated in the second-half. And also with regard to the launch costs, how we see that in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, if there is any difference to be expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on that side, clearly what we have to expect and that's currently happening is an acceleration of costs coming up by all the changes to be done in production manufacturing sites and also by the launch of new models, that's what is pictured out looking at the numbers of the second quarter, and we definitely will see a peak number in Q3 and still with a significant number in Q4, but the peak is expected to happen in Q3.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I have one question on trucks, regarding the lower earnings in trucks and especially the MAN profit warning. Do you think long-term you need to have on the trucks that exposure to the U.S. market that once had to be more diversified geographically on the other side to have more leverage on the fixed-cost  and R&amp;D cost in trucks? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Daniel, so you asked one question with regard to trucks and the MAN performance there, and if that means that we need maybe a bigger exposure to the U.S. market actually then to have a certain leverage on fixed-cost  and R&amp;D cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in order to deal with the most actual situation in the truck and bus business, I think first of all it's fundamentally related to the economic framework, which, of course, is somewhat more pronounced in certain regions compared to other regions. It clearly shows that the efficiency has to be improved, and that's why we feel very much confirmed with our fundamental ideas to form an integrated truck group specifically tailored to make use of significant synergies available.</p>
          <p>It's clear that in the very short-term it's mainly on the purchasing side with some maybe R&amp;D effects, but a little bit medium-, longer-term-looking, it clearly will have a meaning for all the functions and it definitely seems to work with common modules and the like. So a number of items which will clearly have a major impact on the cost side. I think the initiative is taken, you're well aware that starting September 1 there will be some management changes, and looking at the whole situation, I only can say we're clearly executing a certain program and there is no reason just to hold back on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. So my first question is on net sales, which are up 13% in the second quarter, if we treated for Volkswagen China sales, which are not consolidated, they are up 10%. But on the other hand, when you look at your analysis of sales revenue, page 10 of the presentation, the volume impact is &#x20AC;2 billion, so it's like 5% year-over-year versus the 10% I mentioned earlier. So could you like please explain the difference?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on the drop-through of revenues to EBI. So I'm coming back on the question which was asked earlier by one of my colleagues. So you are saying that PPA was a bit negative in the second quarter, but I would have expected PPA in volumes and mix and price to be only caused by Porsche Holding Salzburg, and the main sources of PPA to be MAN and Scania. So can you please like elaborate a little bit on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you very much. So we have two questions, first the development of our sales in the Group, and then of our China business and how this then transfers to the sales revenue development, if we can explain here that the difference in the percentages. And the second question is again how the revenue development then actually has to be seen in the EBIT line, and if you can explain a little bit or give some more details with regard to the PPA chart, if that it's just Porsche Holding Salzburg or how is that split up on probably MAN and Scania?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I make first some comments on the sales side in a general way before &#x2013; afterwards we talk about the numbers in detail. It is very clear that the first six months of the year in terms of market have been developed differently as you know and that we've announced as well. So we have a Western European market which has declined and which has even increased in this declining momentum over the last few months. We have China, which has lost some momentum, but in the passenger car perspective, still has a positive growth. You have seen that the U.S. is going up positively in general market conditions.</p>
          <p>We have seen in Brazil some effects due to the IPI, which is a tax which has been changed end of May and has given a rebound to this market which was negatively affected as well. And we have in India a smaller growth than it was normally forecasted. Russia is still staying dynamic. So the market conditions are &#x2013; if you want different per regions where you are, and this market condition, of course, we are playing, so the first effect on that is the mix of the markets.</p>
          <p>The next one clearly is that we have launched our new small family, which has an impact on numbers but is well in turn over our revenues per car, because these are the entry models, if you want, into our brands, and have immediately a change of mix as well due to the revenues. So I think that gives you a small feeling about how it's running. In general we need to be clear that the European market stays a concern and that we believe that over the next few months or even over the next period of a certain time, it will continue to be pretty complicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the walk-down on development of sales revenue, first of all, just to make sure that we have the right understanding. In the &#x20AC;5.7 billion contribution of volume and then price and mix, it's clear that the Chinese joint ventures and their volume are not included, because we consolidate the Chinese joint ventures only in the equity lines, so within the financial result.</p>
          <p>And if we eliminate China from that, it is just a 5.7% improvement compared with the basis, which fits pretty much then to the development on the EBIT line, specifically, as I said before, if the PPA charge is eliminated. Now the PPA charge we were talking about before is somewhat more than &#x20AC;800 million for the first-half, and it only has to do to a little extent with the Porsche Holding Salzburg, the major effect coming from MAN and Scania at this point.</p>
          <p>So in this way I think on a clean basis, we can say that the volume development feeds pretty nicely through to the EBIT line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon, and apologies because I clearly haven't slept enough or something, I'm being stupid. But just to relate back to this issue of the profit bridge. The drop-through in the second quarter, as Mike pointed out, &#x20AC;3.3 billion revenue, &#x20AC;100 million on EBIT. As you've just pointed out, the impact from Porsche Salzburg from PPA was relatively small, and the PPA Porsche Salzburg was in for the full second quarter last year anyway. So I'm not following how adjusting for PPA in that element of the profit bridge, which, after all, excludes the truck business, why does that mean &#x2013; how is that impacting &#x2013; because even adjusting for PPA, I don't understand why we &#x2013; we're still not looking at the &#x20AC;3.3 billion revenue dropping through to a &#x20AC;100 million profit? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you, Charles. So this question, actually we had that already, that is again an explanation of the profit bridge and how we can explain there.

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. So two questions. Firstly, just on the change in provisions in the quarter, I'm sure you've got a lot of questions on this today, but it seems on the face of it to be a reduction versus the first quarter of around &#x20AC;570 million. Am I right to understand that's a payment of work bonuses and that's a balance sheet and cash flow movement, or has that had any impact on the P&amp;L at all? has that been a provision release into the earnings stream at all. So I was wondering if you could confirm that, as my first question.</p>
          <p>And just on the second question, something more general, just on your perspectives on the European market and, again, certain of your peers <mark type="ph" /> interestingly (51:58) today accusing Volkswagen of sparking a price war in Europe. I wondered if you could just share your perspectives on what's going on in the European environment, how aggressive VW is being on pricing, if at all, and what you think needs to happen or might happen in terms of capacity reduction in Europe and why Volkswagen seems to be against a coordinated approach to that that Fiat in particular is calling for? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Stuart. So you have two questions. So we start with the question I guess for Mr. Klingler, you want to have actually our impression or our expectation for the European markets, how we see there the pricing environment and the situation in Europe at the moment and how that could develop. And the second question refers to provisions. You are referring to the &#x20AC;570 million change in other provisioning, so where does that come from and is there any P&amp;L effect from this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I start first with the market in general, then we come to the pricing. It is very normal that the customers do have the, let's say, impression over the actual economic situation. So if you are in Spain, for example, and you are below 27 years old and you are not living in Madrid or in Barcelona, the probability of unemployment rate is more than I would guess 70%.</p>
          <p>So we cannot deny, that's just an example, that the European debt crisis is out there and that it is really touching the customers. Of course, this is for end customers as well as for the fleet customers. For the fleet customers, you've heard as well during several calls, several information that for, for example, for the smaller companies, it's getting a little bit more complicated to get financing done, so they have a little bit more issues to get the cars or the trucks on their balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So the debt crisis is out there if you like it or if you don't like it, and it touches differently the countries. So Spain is certainly known, Portugal is certainly known, Greece is certainly known, Italy now is very much touched as well, as we can see in the contraction of the market. So the market is going down heavily this year. We believe that will continue because as well the austerity measures of the governments, because it's not only one, have touched the population and particularly the car  as an item to get more tax into the pocket of the governments. So there have been changes in nearly all of our countries in Europe in increasing taxes on cars.</p>
          <p>So basically what I wanted to say, the general conditions are complicated, the general situations are tough and I stick to two examples, the Spanish market we believe will be on a record low since probably 30 years, and probably not far away, Italy will be as well on this kind of very low situation.</p>
          <p>So if you are now a manufacturer being prioritized in the southern countries, of course, you get even more pressure because these are your home markets. And then if you are more concentrated on smaller cars, as well you have even the same situation increasing the pressures.</p>
          <p>I think that is important to understand as a general remark. As you have seen as well the results of some of our competitors and some of them pretty strongly, I would say, influenced by the conditions.</p>
          <p>If we now come to pricing, it's pretty clear that under these conditions, the pricing situation is getting more under tension. We do not have the feeling that we are particularly aggressive, by the way, this is as well not &#x2013; the data is what we have, and we're always happy if some of the competitors believe that we are the most aggressive, seeing their results and seeing our results or something should be a bit contradictory, because if we were more aggressive than Fiat probably, as an example, our results should be worse than them. And this is not the case. As the consequence we do not believe that we are <mark type="ph" /> in them (56:24).</p>
          <p>So now if we come to the pricing in general, we are not the most aggressive in the markets. Of course, we play in a competitive environment, and, of course, we need to be positioned, but over the last months we see that our pricing situation has been reasonably okay, but, of course, we see over the next months to come continuous pressure on the pricing level.</p>
          <p>So this will have an impact. How strong it will be, we shall see. It all depends on the market conditions in general and the circumstances which I have described.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the question on the provisions released, this is only to confirm that this is related to the cash-out and pay-out of bonuses for employees, so there is no P&amp;L effect coming out of this, and by the way I should also say that, of course, there were also new provisions booked in the first half.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. This is Fraser Hill from Bank of America. I just wanted to come back to this drop-through dynamic, and maybe just look at it a different way. Specifically for Audi, if I look at just divisional reporting, obviously we had well over a &#x20AC;1 billion increase in the revenue line in the second quarter, &#x20AC;1.5 billion in fact and pretty much flat operating profit. So just wondering if you could talk us through the dynamic there, why has there been such a lack of operational gearing? And maybe give us a little bit more detail on how pricing has affected Audi or whether that's been much more cost dynamic during the second quarter?</p>
          <p>My second question would be on MAN. You state in the release today that you're looking to increase your stake further depending on market conditions. I just wondered if you could talk about that in relation to potentially proposing a domination agreement. Would that be purely through a domination agreement or would you continue to buy shares in the market? And in terms of your ambitions for an integrated truck group, you don't mention your shareholding in Scania and I'm just wondering why you might not be looking to increase your stake further there, if you can maybe give us a bit more color on your stake-holding in Scania? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Fraser. So you have two questions. The first one refers to the performance of Audi, if we can explain the development in the first quarter versus the second quarter, is there a lack of operational gearing or do we have to face a certain effect coming from pricing for Audi, can we explain that? And the second question refers to our shareholding in MAN and Scania, if we can give there an update about our plans, if we do intend to increase our shareholdings in those two truck companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all on the Audi side, very clearly speaking with an operating return on sales of 11.5%, it's been a quite, in our view, positive result, which comes very close to the performance achieved in the first half of last year. And in that sense, as you're well aware, our medium-term target is to stay in a band of between 8% and 10% in terms of the relative operating margin. And that in itself demonstrates that we are operating pretty much on the upper end. So no claim about the operating performance at Audi.</p>
          <p>On MAN, we are not aware of a statement given we would increase the stake. I think since quite a while we have a clear position, which is that we're keeping all options open and we definitely said that also includes a domination agreement.</p>

Just two questions, the one thing is on China, maybe you can elaborate a bit on the Chinese development, the earnings increased in the second quarter to roughly &#x20AC;1400 per vehicle, and that leads to a very high, significantly high margin, and maybe you can give us a glance on what you are expecting for the next months to come here from the margin perspective.</p>
          <p>And the other question is on the Porsche impacts after August 1. You indicated a one-off item of about &#x20AC;9 billion coming in fiscal year 2012. Here my question is, would the &#x20AC;2 billion revaluation in options, is this going against these &#x20AC;9 billions, so that we have to add this or recalculate the &#x20AC;7 billion, or is included in the &#x20AC;9 billion? And maybe you can also say something about the tax rate in the second quarter, if that was also related to the Porsche stake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Frank. So these are two-and-a-half questions, I would say. The first question is about China, if we can give a little bit more insight of how the development was in China, with regard also to earnings, margin development and how &#x2013; what is our expectation for the next months.</p>
          <p>The second question refers to the valuation of the put/call options we have seen in the second quarter, and if this &#x20AC;2 billion on top we published today, if that also has an impact on our valuation then for the current stake after the consolidation of Porsche AG. So you are referring then to the statement we made at the beginning of July, and if this number, you were referring to the &#x20AC;9 billion, if that stands as it is or if that will change again. And you would be happy to have an explanation why the tax rate in the second quarter was so low, if that is also the reason of the valuation of the put/call option. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So one after the other. First of all China, margin and profit development very positive, without any doubt. It's just in line with the comments we made in terms of the still-positive market development. Maybe at this point, what we should say very openly is that while there is a lot of talk in terms of cooling down in China, this is very relative, because still the car market continues to grow. Yes, of course, on a slower path compared to previous years, but I think that was widely expected, and it's still quite obviously a successful business model, what we are operating there.</p>
          <p>Now looking forward, it's very clear, as Mr. Klingler already pointed out, China is part of the global economy. There will be some effects certainly also with the relevance on the car market, but we are relatively optimistic for the second half that we will then at the end of the year 2012 be able to say that this was another successful year in China.</p>
          <p>Medium-term-looking, it is more a fundamental point than anything else, the question is on whether the biggest car market in the world can really continue in such a positive way or whether it will then take a few characteristics of other more developed markets in the world, and in that sense, of course, what we are trying to do is do the best we can in terms of improving our competitiveness and that's clearly more easier to be done if you are the leading OEM in China.</p>
          <p>So on the Porsche, what's going to happen after August 1, now we said in the press conference when we are talking about this event, that we will have to book another positive contribution to the financial result of around &#x20AC;9 billion. We clearly stated that that was on the basis of valuation parameters of the end of March. Then in the meantime there was another slip in interest rates, which had two effects; first of all, the valuation of the Porsche put and call options on Volkswagen's side came in with another very positive contribution to the financial result of the first half, and then clearly if at August 1, the parameters of June 30 would remain the same, we would look at then, instead of &#x20AC;9 billion on positive contribution for the second half of our financial results, of &#x20AC;11 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me say very clearly, there are &#x20AC;2 billion on top of formerly &#x20AC;9 billion, but not &#x20AC;11 billion on top of &#x20AC;9 billion, that would be wrong. On the tax rate stated, the playing rules in IFRS accounting is that we have to apply during the business year, the planned tax rate for the full year, and clearly there are a number of non-taxable elements in our plan for the full year 2012, it brings down the tax rate to very low levels. That is the fundamental reason, and, of course, it has to do with the Porsche consolidation.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our next question comes from Rabih Freiha from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, thank you for taking my question. Rabih Freiha from Exane. My question is regarding the MQB. So obviously going forward, the deployment is going to improve your production efficiency. I assume that it should free up capacity and lower the utilization rate in your European plants. If so, since demand is a continuing to fall in Europe, what do you intend to do? Are you going to proceed with any restructuring? How do you intend to address this? Thank you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. So the question refers to the MQB and actually the savings in productivity, and if that means that we have capacity available in Europe and what do we do if demand falls in the next &#x2013; in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me first of all confirm that we are fully on track with our MQB model toolkit introduction. So while not really surprising, in the last few months we have vastly talked about the negative impact in terms of ramp-up cost, installation cost, CapEx and the like. Of course, we are very much looking forward to then appreciate the advantages coming out of the MQB modular toolkit and I reiterate that we are fully on track with the installation.</p>
          <p>So very clearly the MQB system will offer very significant productivity gains, which we will enjoy once we have succeeded in ramping up the volume to a certain level. But this is anyway absolutely necessary, because we currently operate our plants with a very high utilization rate. When we applied international standards for capacity utilization, we were clearly more than just at full use of our capacity. So this is clearly needed, first of all, of course, to incorporate additional volume and secondly also to normalize the situation into one or the other situation.</p>
          <p>In other words speaking, currently the situation is such that if we look at time accounts then there is a significant number of employees who have their time accounts pretty much full. We have, in addition to our employees, a significant number of temporary workers still heavily employed, and, of course, if we needed to go any further, there is a big number of variance in terms of shift models and the like. Nothing of such is currently under consideration, I am only saying the MQB modular toolkit will also contribute to something which is a very valuable asset, which is flexibility.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jos&#xE9; Asumendi from Baader Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Just coming back to the profit bridge and the product cost. I was just wondering if you could please maybe  elaborate a little bit more around this category and what are the dynamics that move this cost savings? And also is there a chance for product cost to accelerate in the second-half, offsetting to a larger extent the incremental fixed-cost ? Or maybe  in other words, can we expect the net impact from product cost and fixed-cost  would not be substantially different in the second-half versus the first-half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Jose. So your question refers to the product cost, our savings we achieved in the first-half and what do we expect in the rest of the year, what are the dynamics for those cost savings and will they be offset or in which relation to the development of the fixed-cost .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all, if you look back then, I  intend to say almost traditionally, after the first-half we receive, by systems, so to say, a positive impact on that side because a number of contracts renewed and then being effective with suppliers would kick-in only then. So that's a more principle point. Of course, as we all know with the introduction of new model tool kits, we more or less started to gain from the beginning.</p>
          <p>But it's clear this is not going to have an overwhelming effect on the cost performance in the second-half. So what we can state at this point is that, of course, also related to the situation of clearly fierce competition, the markets being much more challenging than ever before, our aim is, of course, to improve the cost position as much as possible.</p>
          <p>Now this is supported to some extent by the most recent developments also, for example, under raw material side, where, with a few exceptions, rubber, for example, being one of these exceptions, the playing ground is more positive than what we had expected. So there is good potential also in that area. And, of course, another element is the improvement in the overall productivity.</p>
          <p>So we think from today's point of view, we should be able in the full year 2012 to significantly beat the number of cost savings of 2011. But we also clearly have to expect the fixed-cost  side of the business going further up on how these two elements relate to each other is something where we need a little bit more evidence going forward.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, it's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. I have a question relating to the situation in Brazil, not on the truck side, more on the passenger car side. From some competitors like Ford, we're seeing some pretty grim profitability numbers coming out of Brazil. Can you give us some idea of what's going on in that market at the moment, also in terms of pricing and profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Christian. So your question is about Brazil, especially the passenger car market if we can give you some more information on the situation with regard to pricing and profitability, what development do we see there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the Brazilian market in 2012 started a little bit more shaky as the general situation, economically spoken, has seen a lower development on the PAP  as originally forecast. So we talk about a cross rate which is between 2% and 2.5%, and if you compare that to a cross rate of the years before, which were between, let's say, 3.5%, 4% to 6%, that shows already some of the evidence.</p>
          <p>On the other side, what was seen as well is that some tax changes have been given, and therefore some the positive schemes like this IPI reduction, which has already existed in the years before, not in the whole years but in several part of the years, these positive effects haven't been there.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, as we have reported several times, the competitive environment in Brazil is increasing. We see more and more competitors coming into the country with their own plants, and we see as well that these competitors have to been taken serious.</p>
          <p>Then we have seen changes in the imports duty regulations, which had some impact on the markets, started, more or less, end of last year, giving essentially for import outside of, let's take it, make it a little bit easy, out of South America pretty hard to try to get imported into Brazil.</p>
          <p>So a lot of situations which show as well that the competitive pressure is existing. On the other side, we have prepared to launch of a new goal. The new goal is now, by the way, I think it was posted yesterday, our launch event. So we are now fully online. And we see as well the IPI change, which was announced in the end of May, has had an immediate positive effect on the total market. And I am happy to say that we have been taking as well here a lead in that development.</p>
          <p>Maybe just to add one thing, the financial situation of the end customers in Brazil used to be, let's say, much more easy at certain times than it is today, because the interest rates have gone up and delinquency rate as well for the banks have gone up.</p>
          <p>So maybe you remember about three months ago, the banks have &#x2013; the national bank has reduced interest rates, but the banks have not reduced the interest rates, because we said, we are not ready for this due to the delinquency rates, which has grown now to 6%, 7%, 8%. That means for the customer, of course, financing is very important, if we don't get to better results, it's more complicated to buying car.</p>
          <p>So the pricing situation now for us was, in the period of the last six months, pretty reasonable. We have not been disappointed concerning that, but we have to admit that the situation is, as it was and as it will be, very competitive.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, thanks for taking my question. I have a question regarding the profit walk-down in the first-half; and then the second, in the first quarter, we have a &#x20AC;1.4 billion negative number given for the fixed-cost s, launch costs aggregate and fixed running negatively in the first quarter. Could you give us any details of what are the biggest parts in them, and especially what is the amount of depreciation and amortization increase in these two figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. Albrecht, so we have the question which refers to the amount of fixed-cost  and start-up costs of v1.4 billion in the first-half, and if we can give here more details what are the biggest parts in there, and what is actually the amount of depreciation and amortization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's about 40% is amortization and depreciation and of the remainder, roughly 50% is MQB.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up, please, on Mr. P&#xF6;tsch's remark on plant utilization. Can you maybe  give us an indication on the average utilization rate of your plants across Europe currently, and assuming obviously that you are operating profitably in Europe, what sort of profitability level are we talking about here? Is this like a solid profit level or just about a break-even level? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Christoph. So you had the question about our capacity utilization, if we can give there &#x2013; or if we can give you a precise number for what is the average rate across Europe, and what is &#x2013; if we can give more guidance with regard to our profitability in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our internal calculation, the average plant utilization level is more than 90%. As I said before, applying international standards it is even more. And we can confirm that the profit level is solid in Europe. And if I may add this opportunity to just come back to the question of one of the analysts before. That was on the evolution of operating profit in the second quarter compared with the first quarter in terms of effects coming either from volume mix or price, and this is to say that in the second quarter the operating result is effected by negative mixed effect due to the weakness in the South and partly Western Europe, and, of course, also in terms of product mix by the introduction of the new Hub model, which sells at let's say at the entrance level of the model range of Volkswagen.</p>

Clearly the last few months for Suzuki have not been very fun, your investment there doesn't seem to be nearly successful as it was in the past.
