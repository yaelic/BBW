        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am going to present the Q1 figures of our Group. There's 4 divisions, including the development of their businesses.</p>
          <p>I'll begin with Slide 4. Total revenues were &#x20AC;2.1 billion, an increase of 13% from third compared to a year ago. Reduction costs were significantly better than last year in Chemicals as we leave the crisis behind us. That is reflected in the gross margins. SG&amp;A rose by 12%. Included in this is a provision for the transaction costs for Millipore of around &#x20AC;24 million and termination costs of 23 million for a project at Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>The high growth in research and development costs is partly due to a low base in Q1 2009. The revenues increased at a faster rate than costs overall. We saw a 26% increase of the core operating result and a core return on sales of 21% of the 19% last year.</p>
          <p>Slide 5 shows the absence of exceptional items during the first quarter. The financial result includes fees of &#x20AC;10 million related to the financing of the Millipore acquisition. Though the level 10% increase of finance is not due to a higher interest or an extension of our financing, it's also not due to currency losses. Indeed, we made a small currency gain.</p>
          <p>Our underlying tax rate of 24%, the same as our reported tax rate, is in-line with our targeted tax rate. The core EPS of &#x20AC;1.45 improved by 26% compared to the year-ago quarter. The underlying free cash flow as shown on Slide 6 reached &#x20AC;207 million, an increase of &#x20AC;43 million, mainly due to the increased profit after tax and lower CapEx. Working capital rose to higher sales. Accounts receivables burst the cash flow with &#x20AC;197 million; a reflection of higher sales and co-hospital payments in Spain and Greece.</p>
          <p>Key balance sheet data for the Group are on Slide 7. Comparing the figures to December 31, 2009, the main difference stems from a 3.2 million Eurobond issue in March 2010. Net financial debt were &#x20AC;82 million versus &#x20AC;260 million at the end of the year. The figure excludes pensions and pensions funding, a measure that we have started last year, and which is disclosed as a separate line on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Slide 8 gives an update for the Millipore acquisition. The transaction will be financed through, as I mentioned, &#x20AC;3.2 billion Eurobonds and &#x20AC;1 billion bid financing and 2 billion cash. The initial loan to fund the transaction was transformed into a syndicated loan in the remaining amount of &#x20AC;1 billion just recently.</p>
          <p>Overall, we reached good conditions for the financing of the Millipore acquisition. The process is on track, and we've planned the transaction to close in the second half of this year. We cleared already the U.S. antitrust and are making progress with our European filing. A special shareholder meeting will take place on June 3.</p>
          <p>I now turn to the first quarter development in the businesses starting with Merck Serono on Slide 9. We posted a 7% increase in revenue compared to the year-ago quarter. Sales grew by 10% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion, mainly driven by increase in sales to the U.S. wholesale. Our rate subsidiary, EMD Serono, is the process of converting to a new computer system due in April. And shipments of roughly &#x20AC;50 million were pushed forward into Q1. Consequently, Q2 will have less U.S. sales through this phasing effect. The royalty and commission income on the other side declined by 25% due to expiring patents and certain regions, in particular referring to Puregon and Enbrel.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin rose only by 4.5% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion at the quarter under review, as production costs included startup expenses for the new large scale biotech production center in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Total marketing and selling expenses were almost flat. The 24% jump in commission and royalty expenses is driven mainly by commissions and here by the Rebif U.S. sales and higher Erbitux sales in Japan. At Serono, research and development costs were 304 million, 12% increase compared to the first quarter in 2009, but in-line with subsequent quarters in 2009. The repeated exceeding of 20% of revenues is due to the high number of late-stage clinical trials, and therefore also expected for the full year.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 visualizes this development and shows the leap from Q1 to Q2 following a decision of ours not to out-license new projects, but to finance all projects by ourselves in order to keep the benefits. We already mentioned termination costs for our Merck Serono project of &#x20AC;23 million charged to the operating result; refer to the R763 Aurora kinase inhibitor program for cancer compound, which Serono had licensed in, in 2005 and we returned to our licensor, Rigel, end of February. All this made the core operating result drop by 2% to &#x20AC;316 million.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to summarize Pages 11 to 15. Growth rates of Rebif fertility and endocrinology are affected by the aforementioned phasing effect in the U.S. Erbitux 19% growth, however, is genuine. As to Cladribine, I'm afraid we have nothing new to say. We continue to work with the FDA to resubmit our application as soon as possible. Other than that, I can only repeat that we presented new data of our CLARITY study at the American Academy of Neurology 2 weeks ago. The same, nothing new to say, goes for Stimuvax, where the suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction situation continues, and the Stimuvax clinical program remains temporarily suspended. I would like to find out that no news also means no bad news. Erbitux has been approved by Japan's authority for the use of first-line treatment of colorectal cancer and KRAS wild-type patients. That's good news.</p>
          <p>Turning to Consumer Health Care, which starts on Slide 16, we generated revenues of &#x20AC;108 million. A flat development compared to the year-ago quarter. Our plan to focus on strategic brands as reflected in the sales share of these products, have increased from 53 to now 55%. Marketing and selling rose by 6.7% as we continued to invest into our strategy of focusing on strategic brands. The operating result declined by 81% to &#x20AC;1.5 million.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows &#x2013; 17 shows our Health Care sales by health theme and that we are on growth path with our strategic brands.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 is next. The recovery of our Liquid Crystal business continued. We have certainly surprised everybody with this development and not least ourselves. Positive development is mainly due to the overall market environment, which is very favorable and strongly supporting our new technology. And of course within this, the growing demand of our PS-VA technology, which is fast gaining market share among the different technologies. And looking at the result, a good capacity utilization at lower cost per unit helped to complete the picture.</p>
          <p>Revenues, therefore, jumped 82% to &#x20AC;239 million from &#x20AC;131 million in the year-ago quarter, which was the worst quarter during last year's crisis. Plus the gross margins increase nearly tripled to &#x20AC;163 million. Significant in reduction of production cost per unit contributed to this effect. In addition, we improved our capacity utilization, as already mentioned. Our operating result rebounded to &#x20AC;112 million from the very low level of &#x20AC;30 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Returns on sales improved accordingly to nearly 47%, coming from a very low 9.7%. If we look at the development of sales and operating result over a longer period on Page 19, it strikes that the first quarter of 2010 looks strikingly similar to Q3 2008. This indicates that we are really out of the trough for good. Key financials of Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals are shown on Slide 20. Total revenues of &#x20AC;346 million were 13% above last year due to a good performance of all subdivisions.</p>
          <p>Pigment sales were especially high compared to last year, as demand in both the automotive and cosmetics industries improved. The operating result more than doubled to &#x20AC;55 million at an ROS of more than 15%, 16% to be precise, compared to 18% for the pervious year. Our normal expectation would be an ROS between 10 and 15%.</p>
          <p>On the following chart, I want to give you the guidance and a better understanding on how the guidance comes together. Just the guidance itself; the guidance is mainly unchanged. We have reflected the astonishing performance of Liquid Crystals in the division itself where we rose the guidance related to revenue from 5 to 10% to 15 to 20%; and the operating result growth from 15 to 25% to 60 to 70%, which is I think quite a jump.</p>
          <p>We have, therefore, reflected this contribution to the total, increasing the operating result guidance growth from 5 to 15% from previously 3 to 13%. The Liquid Crystal ROS guidance is now therefore 40 to 45%, though it's slightly below the first quarter, 47%. But I think it is still a remarkable increase from the previous guidance, which was more in the 35% area.</p>
          <p>On the next page, which is Page 22, we try to highlight the guidance of Merck Serono, which has been met with surprise and a lack of understanding how we come to it when comparing the core operating result with and without what we called one-offs. A lot of our investors have taken the name one-off literally and have deducted a given amount, which the correct amount is 186, which we gave on this page, should be non-reoccurring because they are one-offs. The problem with Merck is that we have one-offs every year, only they are different one-offs. In order to avoid confusion in the future, we will not call them one-offs, but important influences on the result.</p>
          <p>So if we eliminate in the first column from our core operating result as reported for the whole year 2009, which is 1 billion and a bit, we add the 186, we come to &#x20AC;1.188 billion turnover. The guidance for 2010 is 102. It was plus plus &#x2013; 0.2 plus 10%. So the guidance is between 1 billion and 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>If we assume that no so-called one-offs will occur in 2010, then this guidance means a reduction, a decline in the core operating result between minus 7 and minus 16%. And this was the incredulity that our guidance met. So I would like to point out the contributing factors which make this decline a probability. First, we have a decline in our royalty income. As you have seen in the first quarter royalties declined by 25%, and this is not a unique occurrence. This is the reflection of patent, especially for Enbrel and Puregon expiring in certain countries. And, therefore, the basis for our license income is shrinking.</p>
          <p>Our partners increased their turnover so the shrinkage is mitigated. But on &#x2013; in the whole, the royalty income will shrink. And this has an exacerbated effect on the bottom line because the only costs that are connected with royalty income are sub-license, so passing on royalty income to our sub-license contributors. And this is about 30%. So our royalty income has a 70% ROS. And if this is missing, then this has an exacerbated effect on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>We also have the startups cost for our biotech production center in Vevey. We have already mentioned that we have in the first quarter the first influence by contributing to a not-so-good picture in the production costs at first glance. And this will go on. In fact, we are now starting with start-up costs in the form of training of the team. And there will be other cost types being added. So the run &#x2013; run in costs, the start-up costs will increase over time.</p>
          <p>Further in the marketing and selling line, we will have commissions. The line that we have now separated in our report. So if you look at the quarterly report, not at the presentation, you will see that in the P&amp;L, we have a separate line called Commission and Royalty Expenses. These relate to the co-promotions in the U.S. and in Japan, and they will increase. They will increase at a higher rate than our other costs. So again, an exacerbated influence on our bottom line. And then for the last time I will use the name, we have further so-called one-offs. So we have further important influences on the bottom line. And we have already one this quarter to the tune of &#x20AC;25 million; as I mentioned the termination of our project with Rigel. And the final influence, our R&amp;D costs will increase at a faster rate than the top line.</p>
          <p>So all this explains the guidance. And since the guidance for Merck Serono is unchanged, this explains the guidance of February, as well as the April guidance. And I do apologize for the confusion which I caused by not pointing out these influencing factors when I gave the guidance the first time.</p>
          <p>When we have a closer look at the future important influences, then it is necessary to take a look at our concept surrounding exceptionals. In the past, we had in the line exceptionals significant amounts, which were of a certain uniqueness. We have made the experience, especially after the acquisition of Serono and the need to have impairment tests yearly for very high intangible assets; that what we think occurs only once may occur actually twice in sequence. And we had this, this year. So what we thought, maybe had thought in 2008 as unique, by repetition in 2009 turned out be not unique.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we are going to abandon the criteria on uniqueness. And we will stick to the significant amount so that we don't have every small amount in exceptionals, but only a small number of issues. But we will only put to exceptionals things that relate to abandoned business.</p>
          <p>So the uniqueness, if it is unique but relates to current business, will be posted to other operating expenses in future and will be part of the operating result and not part of the exceptionals. And we have tried to highlight this by revisiting the exceptionals of 2008. So this is for illustrative purposes only.</p>
          <p>We had in 2008 an impairment of the intangibles relating to Raptiva because we thought that this product was on the way out after the serious side effects. We wrote off the whole intangible. This activity was finished, so it was abandoned business, and therefore, it was correctly to be posted in exceptionals.</p>
          <p>The impairment of Enbrel was repeated in 2009, so we were at the time already wrong to assume a uniqueness. At the moment with a new criteria, abandoned within this; we haven't abandoned this license deal. So it should have been in the operating result, and it is in the operating result with 39 million in 2009, as you may remember, and has been joined by another impairment related to Puregon, lifting these items to over 70 million in the operating result, contributing to the important effects in 2009.</p>
          <p>Lexigen, however, a company that we bought 1998, and most of the products that we had bought with it were unfortunately being deleted. This is something that belongs to the past, and this impairment of this remaining goodwill belongs to the past. So the 41.7 that correctly in the exceptional line. We also had to abandon our Saizen application for AIDS wasting. And, therefore, the 20 million also correctly in the exceptional line. Not so impairment of financial assets if this financial asset relates to an ongoing activity. The impairment of this financial asset was our stake in ZymoGenetics. We still have a co-operation with ZymoGenetics via Atacicept. One of the results of this co-operation is one of our hope areas. So this in future will be in the operating result.</p>
          <p>Restructurings; restructurings really happen all the time. We thought sales of the sales force may be something special. This will go in the operating result in future. And as you can see, it has gone to 6.4 into the 2009 operating result.</p>
          <p>The restructuring in the U.S. is operating result because it doesn't relate to a business that has been abandoned. It is related to wrong structure because we have over-manning in our U.S. operation should &#x2013; would be operating result in the new concept. However, the restructure in Brazil relates to our Natural Product business, which we have abandoned. And this will also be in future under exceptionals, and we have actually posted it in 2009 the excess of the provision that we did for this exit, a profit of 12 million in exceptions in 2009.</p>
          <p>So this is a bit &#x2013; a long-winded explanation. But I am under the impression that the concept of exceptional compared with &#x2013; the name I won't give it anymore &#x2013; so with the important effects has been not as clear as I would have liked to be. And I wanted to spend this time with your permission on that issue.</p>
          <p>And something that is not really a burning issue at the moment but has been also a reason for surprise and questions at our last call at our conference in February is our dividend policy. Our dividend policy has and will be that we are going to pay a 30 to 40% dividend of accumulated profit after tax. And we have done that so far since 1995. And this, of course, has reduced the value of this aspect as a guidance.</p>
          <p>We also had an eye on the dividend yield, where we had said that 2% over an average of 3 years we consider good. But it was something that was in the background; it was not at the center of our dividend policy. The 3 to 40% payout ratio of accumulated profit after tax will stay, but we will use a 3-year average, what will make this measure more meaningful. We will use the dividend yield as a more prominent factor and how we will use this, and what the target will be, rather than we consider  this good, a real target that will &#x2013; is still to be determined and will be in place at the next dividend payment. And I will inform you in good time before that.</p>
          <p>What we couldn't really mention at the last call &#x2013; and I'd ask your understanding for that &#x2013; is that we had the Millipore acquisition in mind, and that we had a target and &#x2013; which was also a future part, official part of the dividend policy; we have to protect the liquidity. And liquidity is under threat this year from 2 angles. One angle is the free cash flow itself. We have a lot of provisions on the balance sheet that relate to litigation and where settlements are around the corner. And these provisions, although they will not hit the profit statement, they will cause a pressure on the free cash flow as we pay on the provisions; as we pay out.</p>
          <p>And that will put pressure on our free cash flow this year, and we will have pressure from our high debt following the Millipore acquisition. And therefore, in-line with the depleted profit after tax, we cut the dividend. Some investors have already told after the publication of the Millipore acquisition that they now understand the cut. But I think there are more to it than this &#x2013; just this aspect.</p>
          <p>And like in 2008, where we disregarded the depleted profit after tax because of the high exceptionals; high exceptionals that deplete the profit after tax may be left out of the calculation in a given year. And I hope that by shifting more of the important FX, which don't relate to abandoned businesses, will also contribute to a smaller exceptional line. So this was a technical explanation of &#x2013; as I said, a bit long-winded, but this is the disadvantage that the finance guy does the presentation.</p>
          <p>That concludes my presentation and explanations, and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not sure what the problem is. Well I'll go ahead anyway. Thank you for taking the question. Two &#x2013; 2 questions, please. Firstly, I spoke to Markus a little bit on this earlier, but I just need a little bit more clarification in terms of the Erbitux progression going from fourth quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010. So you posted 187 and 192, and obviously Japan is growing strongly. If I assume that Japan is up for this quarter on the fourth quarter, then it looks like to me that sales of Erbitux in Europe are flat or down. Perhaps you clarify that for me and just explain if I'm missing something? But that's what the math would seem to suggest, and I didn't quite understand why that should not be the case?</p>
          <p>And then secondly &#x2013; and this is a tough question, but I'm going to try anyway. Obviously, the MS market is evolving rapidly depending on the outcome of Gilenia and also Cladribine or Mylinax, I guess, before the name changed. Do you have any sense of where you're modeling the evolution of your MS sales? And I'm talking about lumping together Rebif and Cladribine in aggregate. What kind of modeling in your base case are you anticipating, if you could share that with us on, let's say a 5-year outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This type of question remains unanswered. We are not sharing our modeling with the public. And I don't think it's a good idea to do that because models change so often and so dramatically because they are models. They are treated theoretical things that I don't &#x2013; it makes much sense. The Erbitux development; Europe rose by 5.6%. And I think the development overall, besides being slightly seasonal, confirms that without further indications we are now reaching a plateau with Erbitux.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions, gentlemen. The first question is on the Liquid Crystals. In the Annual Report, you say that you expect a stable development of the operating result in 2011 for the division. And following today's increase of the guidance, is this comment remain valid? And, therefore, do we have to forecast a stabilization in 2011 at the 2010 level with an operating margins slightly above 40%? Is that something possible?  The second question is with regards to Merck Serono. Is it still possible to expect the fighting in the U.S. of Cladribine by the end of this year?  And the last question is on the corporate, can you please give us an update of the timing of the Millipore acquisition and especially the closing?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me make a general remark to the outlook in the Annual Report. The outlook in the Annual Report is a Germans' facility, which is governed by German law. And it is not to compared with a guidance that we give to investors in quarterly reports or on earnings calls.</p>
          <p>We had, had no guidance at all and no such report for 2009. We are forced by law to give a 2-year expectation. If this law wouldn't exist, we wouldn't have given anything for 2011. But unfortunately, the law forces us to say something. So we said something as meaningless as possible. So for your purposes, please ignore any outlook in the Annual Report beyond the one-year horizon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe &#x2013; excuse me, but do you think that the 40% operating level for this &#x2013; the margin is sustainable with other long term or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't tell you at the moment. We are surprised ourselves how strong we progress with our new technology. And we have little visibility on how fast the whole pack will follow the leaders in this development, which has been supported by the 3D hype. And we also don't know how long the 3D hype will last. So I cannot tell you whether the 40% will be sustainable also in 2011. And that is in-line with our policy not to guide beyond the end of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So the MS filing, we are in negotiations with the FDA about the refuse to file decide the &#x2013; the decision. And as I said, this decision is going on, and we have no news there that we can share with you because these are ongoing discussions. They are new feedbacks sort of weekly, and we can't covert this into publication. And I ask your understanding for that.</p>
          <p>The Millipore closing we expect still in the second half. I would now say early second half since we have already cleared the U.S. hurdles on antitrust. We know that the shareholders' meeting will be on 3rd June. We have no indication that we face any opposition there. And so the only open point is the European antitrust process, which we think should really be over early in the third quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one question on guidance. If I look how much the Liquid Crystals guidance has gone up, that's adding around &#x20AC;100 million of cooperating results of the guidance that you issued at the start of the year. If, however, I look how much the Group guidance has gone up, that's adding about &#x20AC;25 million. So it seems somewhere between Liquid Crystals and the Group, we've lost 75. Now I realize that guiding is not always terribly precise, but I wonder if there's anything particularly driving that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if you look at the whole Group, you have also to look at Merck Serono. And if you look &#x2013; included in the first quarter of the Group is not only an exaggerated turnover of Merck Serono but also an exaggerated profit. And you have to make adjustments for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But presuming that nets out over the year because isn't simply more you ship in Q1, less you ship in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true. But if you say, well I have now &#x2013; if I have a guidance from a certain standpoint now, then you should detect it and have it &#x2013; another judgment on the Merck Serono guidance, which is then accumulated in total company guide. I think that was your question. You saw a certain discrepancy between the part Liquid Crystals, and assuming the rest would be stable in the guidance. But we are guiding a frame, and there is movement within the frame.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it seems to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you ask is that a bold guidance or is this a cautious guidance? I can confirm what I think is your underlying question, is that the cautious guidance? Yes, it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of more questions on guidance, if I could. I just wanted to check in, and a follow-up to the last question whether at higher corporate and other expenses may account for the difference? I noticed it was slightly higher this quarter related to some Millipore charges you've taken in that line. Do we expect further charges within that line going forward?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just a follow-up on your commentary on cautiousness. And I was just wondering if you could give a view on the outlook for the Cyclical divisions, Liquid Crystals and PLS for Liquid Crystals? Guidance implies EBIT around 370 for the year. I think you've done 110 this quarter, have implied in a conference call this morning 110 for the second quarter, which therefore also implies a substantial ffall &#x2013; in the second half; just any color there? And similarly for PLS, you've achieved almost half of your full-year guidance in the first quarter?</p>
          <p>And then a final question on Merck Serono. Just wonder if you could break out &#x2013; if you're willing to break out of the 7 to 16% decline guiding for this year? How much is related to the increase in commission expenses and royal income decline, which seemed to be an ongoing trend? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I can't really break down the guidance in its integral parts because then, it wouldn't be a guidance anymore, really. We need to stick to the corridor. And I don't have the crystal ball, so I need to have some leeway. So I can't really break than down, and I'm sorry about that.</p>
          <p>As far as Millipore costs are concerned, the provisions that we made in the first quarter covers also action costs that are in fees for the different advisors. So I don't expect more transaction costs in this and the remainder of the year. And please remember that this hits the profit and loss statement is a new effect, previously that was included in the purchase price. And the new standard of IFRS says we have to recognize that as expenses straight away.</p>
          <p>If we look at the guidance or the implication of the guidance for the next 3 quarters compared with quarter one. Yes, it is true that we think that the first quarter is exceptionally high, and we have seen that in previous first quarters. Not last year, but in years before that. So it's not unusual that the first quarter is really very excellent compared with the rest of the quarters.</p>
          <p>I don't see a cyclical development, but we are still cautious about the economy sort of starting to climb at a steeper angle. On the contrary, we think it's possible that some little stutter may set in. Also, it may just be that there is a run up to the event where championship in Liquid Crystals; maybe there is a very exaggerated hype with the 3D application. And therefore as I've said, some caution is in order when it comes to the remaining 3 quarters.</p>
          <p>I don't think that we, by guiding very cautiously on our PLS business, we are doing the business injustice. Because remember in there is the Pigment business, which is very dependent on cars and automotive. And I don't think that we have seen the final state of the automotive industry just yet.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Merck Serono, we see that &#x2013; things that we have expected to a certain extent coming in during the period of uncertainty when governments spend a lot of money to salvage certain industries; they would recur to the pharma industry. But now we see to a great extent the health systems around the world trying to take recourse to the pharma industry. And we expect that they will be successful, if not to the extent they would like to, but there will be a certain success. And therefore, caution toward the effects of rebates or other price reductions and measures is in order.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions. A number, if I may. The &#x20AC;50 million incremental sales booked in the U.S. Can you just confirm that your normal payments away to Pfizer have already been made on that 50 million?  And can you give us some indication on how much profit fell to the bottom line from that in the first quarter? If I could move on to dividends, you highlighted exceptional charges may be excluded from your calculation in the future. Can you confirm that while in the past you've excluded exceptional positives when you've calculated the dividend as I recall, but exceptional negatives have tended to lead to a dividend reduction? Can you confirm that both positive and negative exceptionals may be left out in the future?</p>
          <p>On Millipore, can you just give us an update on whether or not you've yet managed to secure the Millipore management? One notable issue when you announced the transaction was that you hadn't spoken to them and weren't sure whether or not they would be joining the combined group. Can you give us an update on whether that management team will be joining you?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I know that Dr. Schnee isn't in the call. But if I can paraphrase him on Cladribine from the full-year results, he said something along the lines of he was absolutely convinced that Cladribine would make it onto the U.S. market at some time in the future. I realize you aren't going to give us very much of an update from the FDA. But if he were on the call, do you think he would remain confident &#x2013; as confident given the conversations that you've have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can confirm that the Pfizer commission has been deducted from the 50% &#x2013; 50 million shift. I cannot exactly tell you how much the profit line of the 50 million is because it's a question of allocation. And the allocation we haven't made, and I don't think it's worthwhile to make. So I think if you assume that the products in question don't have very high manufacturing costs, you should assume that a high amount of that hits directly the bottom line.</p>
          <p>The exceptional, I think the dividend and the exceptionals; I think that is an important question, and I should have related to that early on, so I am grateful for this opportunity to complete my explanation. Actually, we have taken into consideration positive and negative exceptionals. In 2007, we had a huge profit of the sale of generics. And we have excluded this from the dividend; we have given a dividend of &#x20AC;1.20, which in our opinion related &#x2013; it was a jump of $0.30 from 0.90 to &#x20AC;1.20, which reflected at the time the earning power of the combined group.</p>
          <p>And in addition, following the Serono acquisition, right? It was in the same year. In addition, we have given a bonus of &#x20AC;2 reflecting just the huge amount of the generics profit, which has no relation to profit after tax because the profit after tax was 3.5 billion. And the &#x20AC;2 weren't anywhere near 30 to 40% of that, quite frankly.</p>
          <p>So this bonus is always detached from the profit after tax line. So that was a &#x2013; neglecting the positive influence but reflecting it into a bonus. In 2008 we had 400 million negative exceptionals, and we increased the dividend from 1.20 to 1.50. So we completely neglected the 400 million exceptionals. We saw a record-operating result, and we said we can't combine a record-operating result with a cut in a dividend. And therefore, we just neglected the 400 million completely. So this is the answer for the past. If there is high exceptional and the operating result is fine, than we will neglect the exceptionals.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, if there is a high exceptional, we will neglect this but reflect it in a bonus if the profit is higher now. In future, then it stays the same. So the exception that we might or that we will disregard exceptional income or expenses from time-to-time refers to both sides, positive and negative.</p>
          <p>The Millipore retention exercise. Unfortunately, I cannot give you a precise number of people who stay and people who don't. But I can tell you that the people who have signaled that they will stay meet our expectation and that we are satisfied with the retention rate that we foresee.</p>
          <p>As far as my colleague, Elmar Schnee and his optimism is concerned, I can't confirm that his optimism is the same that was in mid-February.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I would like to try to get somewhat insights into the dynamics of what's really going on Liquid Crystals. When I saw these numbers this morning and your guidance increase, my first thought was, gee, you must have had much better pricing power than I thought. And I went back to what was said at the full-year results conference call.</p>
          <p>And you said there are several times there will be first-in-pricing pressure, as in indicating that pricing would be a negative effect this year, and now it seems to be a positive effect. So I'm just wondering whether you could tell us what really happened in March that changed this outlook so dramatically?</p>
          <p>And it could also not only your pricing effect. It could be a mixed effect since you referred several times to success of PS-VA and then the 3D stuff. And actually I don't really know whether we're talking about 2 different things. This is 3D &#x2013; the Crystals are going to the 3D things, are these also PS-VA, or is this something different?</p>
          <p>And I've asked you before whether there's any chance you could give us any indication how large proportion PS-VA really is from your business? And given that it seems to be the key driver, I have to ask that question again. And if you don't want to give us exact figures, could you just tell us roughly a ballpark figure, whether that's in the 10% or more like in the 50% range on that?</p>
          <p>And then I also have a question on &#x2013; I've read this morning on the tape that you said you haven't estimated the impact from the German health care reform. But I guess the question of how much of your current German portfolio is not covered by reference pricing is fairly straightforward to answer, so maybe you could give us that figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with LC. We have 2 things here. We have a normal, old business, which consist of VA, IPS and STN/TN. And we have a new technology which is PS-VA. And PS-VA is the same as 3D. The only thing is that PS-VA has a huge advantage in 3D because of the faster switching times. So the technologies are PS-VA, VA, IPS and TN. The price pressure on VA, IPS and TN is increasing while then decreasing because our competition isn't too pleased that we take market share away from them in the high end. And they're trying to get some back on the lower end, and they are successful in that because we are resisting to give in to the price pressure.</p>
          <p>But we have to always make concessions. As I said, one of our successes on the bottom line is further now again back to further improvement on manufacturing costs, and we always pass that on to our customers. So the price pressure is there. Our big advantage is the new technology. And in this new technology, we get enormous tailwind because not all, but some customers are switching towards PS-VA at a very fast rate. And we haven't anticipated that because this product is more expensive than the old product. Also, we have this tailwind from the 3D hype, which gives us another cross, to talk in soccer terms.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we will &#x2013; we are determined not to further break down the technologies in Liquid Crystals. On the contrary, I am afraid if I think about the future and the future segmentation of Merck, we will have Merck-Millipore, one segment of Chemicals, and another group the other segment of Chemicals. So there is a chance that Liquid Crystals will be joined by other chemicals and will be less transparent, and already bracing myself for a barrage of questions and suspicions that this is to hide away the term of decline of Liquid Crystals.</p>
          <p>And what I'm prepared to do is to go on to disclose separately Liquid Crystals so I've added special service to <mark type="inaudible" /> sales. But I'm not going to break Liquid Crystals down into technologies. And also not by way of ballpark area, which then will be relentlessly narrowed by you so that it becomes a concrete figure.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the German health market. And the German health market is not very important to us. And I'm finance. I'm not an industrial association, so I don't get involved in political discussions about health reform and health systems to try to recover the deficits. We will have worldwide to suffer from the defunctness of health systems all over the place. And Germany is just one of them and maybe a more difficult one to figure out. But we don't know what's going to happen. The announcements differ all the time, and it is for the industrial associations to do clever or less clever comments on that; I refrain.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I understand. But just coming back to &#x2013; I do understand why you don't want to give us a breakdown. And I'm really more trying to understand the dynamics. So taking everything together, what you've said, does that point to you, say, all of a sudden, in the last few weeks you have seen a much greater pick-up of PS-VA than you saw at the beginning of the year?  Is that what was surprising?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; the trend &#x2013; I mean when we said at the beginning of 2009, we don't know where Liquid Crystal is going to; we only see a price war and the grinding to a halt of the market. We didn't dare to hold that with PS-VA we would have such a success. We couldn't anticipate that our customers are just over-mooned &#x2013; over the moon about this technology. And that's now become clear. And we have just been &#x2013; like just seen that another customer has ordered PS-VA in non-trial quantities. And we are now more convinced that we will have more and more quantities in VA in the market, and that our competition is being boxed into the lower end of innovation.</p>

          <p>The base &#x2013; so I &#x2013; just to try to push you one step further. Based on your very last comment, I would now reckon that I also asked you the question about PS-VA last year. Now it appears to me the PS-VA last year was really, really, really in its infancy and you're really now seeing it taking off and right at the beginning of a new curve?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I apologize, but I'm just going to ask another question on PS-VA. I'm just wondering in terms of the applications that PS-VA is being used, and you mentioned 3D TVs. But I'm just wondering, is it something that's likely to be limited to the high-end, high-spec TVs? Or is it something that could take a broader market share in all LCD TV? My understanding is that the technology enables your customers to reduce the cost of manufacture, given that they have to use less backlights in the panel. So I am wondering if &#x2013; what we should expect? And have you got a feel for what eventually that technology could take in terms of a total market share for LCD TV?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a good recommendation to you. Why don't you go to our customers and say you're going to invest to them and ask them all the questions, what they are going to do with our PS-VA in the future, because they don't tell us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our yardstick is the order that's coming in. Your yardstick could be a real buoyant statement from our customers, what they are doing with the good technology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could I ask that maybe where your existing PS-VA customers are using the technology? Is it just the high-end TVs, the 3D TVs, or is it across the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's certainly not across the board, but I don't have an information where it starts and where it ended. We have always been stronger at the high end than and the low-end, and we didn't know whether demarcation was We are able to supply high-end to low-end except as black and white, which we don't &#x2013; are not so interested in. But we could also use PS-VA in every application if you want. So it's up to the customer to decide where he buys his stuff and what he's going to spend on it and where he wants to position himself on technology.</p>
          <p>We are satisfied that we are again far in the lead in innovation, and our interest now is to keep that lead. And once the competition follows suit, that we are already jumping into the next generation of even better technology. That's our strategy, and we don't care so much how long our customer take to follow the innovation and how far they go down the line in high-end, mid-end and low-end.</p>

          <p>Okay. That's great. Thanks. And could I just ask you to repeat the answer to Andrew's question on the amount of growth on the quarter-on-quarter basis for Erbitux coming from Japan versus Europe? Just sorry; I missed the answer?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi, thanks for taking my question, I've got two. The first is on Merck Serono and just as a general observation with the slowing Erbitux growth, you didn't get the lung cancer approval. Rebif clearly has some new competition coming. We've had a number of setbacks in the pipeline with Cladribine and maybe some delays with Stimuvax and Atacicept, too.</p>
          <p>I mean, do you sit back and look at this business now and really think that we need acquisitions here to boost R&amp;D productivity on future growth? And can the business still afford to do that after the acquisition of Millipore, that's my first question? My second question is just on PS-VA, just thinking back to the VA technology when we were told for several years that there were many patents that protected this and then suddenly, these were circumvented almost overnight, as it were. What are your internal planning assumptions regarding this potentially happening to this business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I don't think that the performances of Erbitux and Rebif are such that we have to visit big acquisitions to have the Merck Serono division. The Merck Serono division has had difficulties. We had some setbacks, setbacks are par for the course in innovative pharmaceutical business. So we stick to our statement that after the Millipore acquisition, acquisitions are not the theme of the day.</p>
          <p>With regard to VA and patent protection, I think your recollection of the past is quite correct. The advent of competition where and all of a sudden, the patent protection weren't as important as you implicate with your question. We have always said in chemicals to have a patent protection is a token that we are leading in innovation and it is a nice thing. It doesn't mean that we have the market for our own until the patent expires.</p>
          <p>There are VA patent which expire 2022 and the competition is already there with VA. And it did come all of a sudden. The first one was Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals in 2006, if I remember correctly, and then 2007, they were the first trial and we were always informing and always saying, these people will get around our patents before the expiration, please don't put so high value on the patent and its expiries.</p>
          <p>In Chemicals, these patents are just to prove that we are better than the others, nothing more, nothing less and the same here, we have patent protection. Again, we are at the moment alone on PS-VA, the competition is good in Liquid Crystals and they will get around our patents again before they expire. We don't know when that will be.</p>
          <p>We are not allowed to their laboratories and we don't &#x2013; are not in discussions with their scientists. But it is quite normal that with our additional margins, the competition will try to follow suit as soon as possible and the best thing that we can do, once they have succeeded to do so, that we are on our way to yet another improvement in technology and that's what we intend to do.</p>
          <p>So it's not that these people come all of a sudden. I say explicitly, right now, that they will come before these patents expire and they will creep in slowly. The first trials, they will have quality problems at the beginning as usual and then they will be there, maybe again at the lower end, but they will be there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. First of all on pigments, your product some growth in automotive and consumer end markets? Can you share with us the signals you get from both that markets for the next month? So is automotive just a short-term effect or will it decrease therefore throughout the year and the part of consumer demand, was it driven by new products? That is my first question. Second question on Merck Serono, so Rebif, new formulation filing and yes &#x2013; this is from the desk or is it still a point and can you give us an update on this many deeds of questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have that much visibility on our pigments business that we know how the different types of cost that carry our pigments will do in the future. I think it's just a general improvement in the chemical environment that has brought pigments as well as the other chemicals of Life Science and Performance Chemicals forward.</p>
          <p>It is the economy though and not a specific new product that we have with pigments that carries the development. We always there also have innovation, but there is not a single product &#x2013; nothing compared to PS-VA pigment that drove the growth and the profitability. As far as Rebif new formulation, I forgot to mention there's no news there. We are discussing with the FDA that they should approve it, but no news.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just two questions on Erbitux in Japan with the approval in first line colorectal. When are you planning to see sales come through for that? Are there any reimbursement discussions that need to happen before that, so that they can stop producing sales? And then secondly on PS-VA, can you give us any indication of the price differential between PS-VA and normal VA? I understand you won't give an exact number, perhaps a range, maybe teens or single-digits or something like that, just to give us some idea? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On PS-VA, no number, no idea, no ballpark area, no range. And as for Japan I don't think that we need a ramp up on there. We have the first line and we are starting to sell first line straight away.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question now from Holger Blum from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello, Holger Blum from Deutsche Bank. I wanted to follow up on the question with regard to the biotech production, you mentioned 2010 but longer term, how would you think about that plan impacting your P&amp;L? And also another, a bit more long-term view on the Pharma division. You mentioned in the past a core operating margin of 25% as a target when you were especially that level, when people thought that may be a disappointing guidance, because of the operation leverage and now you are below that, so do you think you can get there again in the coming years, without being specific or trying to nail you down on a year?</p>
          <p>And then a question on Liquid Crystals, on 3D TVs, I've heard that 3D TVs require three times the amount of Liquid Crystals compared to a normal TV, can you confirm that? And the final question on the PLS division, were there any one-offs in Q1? I'm just following up from the question because &#x2013; before, because it's already accounted for half of your full year target, so even more than what you had in Liquid Crystals when you upgraded the guidance. So maybe you can say a word there?</p>
          <p>And the final question from my side, on holding cost, taking your guidance it seems that you expect a run rate of about 30 million in the coming quarters for the remainder of the year, where it was 20 million in 2009? Is it just rounding errors in taking the guidance or is a more structural reason behind it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think I remember all the questions. The first question was, what about the startup costs? Startup costs looking forward will be with us until 2013, where we have the fully fledged production in Erbitux and we have not disclosed how much the manufacturing costs will be affected. This also depends on how we use the factory for Erbitux. Our previous assumption was including lung. That is now not happening. Also, this factory service is the Atacicept where we had to discontinue one indication, so it's really too early to give an indication on that.</p>
          <p>The second question was the core operating reserves. I put that in the end. The LC and 3D question, it is correct that 3D requires more Liquid Crystals than other technologies, but I have not present in my mind how much more and how much that would influence our performance. Then we have in PC that we will &#x2013; you were assuming are there one-offs in the remainder of the year that influence our bottom line guidance? No, the bottom line guidance is just part of our cautions. We don't anticipate in that guidance any important influences. You would do me a great favor if you also wouldn't use the one-off expression anymore. Then we have &#x2013; including two that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Another question was whether you had in Q1 some non-recurring benefits in the quarter, because it was obviously a very strong earnings performance or whether all of the factors was just normal business with high volumes and high capacity to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we had these special important effects on the negative side, but nothing on the positive side. And if you look at our line, other operating expenses, I mean, they are about 80 million more than last year and that is already a sign that it is all on the negative side and not on the positive side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So then the poor operating results with Merck Serono, I think we have always said when we were dreaming of 25% that, that was all the other limit &#x2013; upper limit. But this upper limit is now replaced by 20% and that is in line with our guidance this year of 17 to 20%. I think also the longer term, we should replace the 25% with 20%. And then there is something with PC was that answered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thanks for taking my questions. Yes, actually, they are around the multiple sclerosis. One is a general question around the dynamics of multiple sclerosis, my understanding is the usage rate of drugs generally in multiple sclerosis is not that high. There is quite a lot of patients who don't take drugs. So, what I'm getting at is, how do you think &#x2013; whether the market can take a new, obviously oral multiple sclerosis drug and how that impacts the current market as is? Essentially, is there enough space for that effect on current sales? And secondly, a question on Cladribine. Now we are waiting for a two-year extension study, safety study on Cladribine, making four years of safety in total. Do you think the regulator will be looking for this in terms of &#x2013; to get comfortable with the longer term safety of Cladribine? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it is true that many MS patients aren't treated for several reasons. One reason is the fear of injection and that is where the main field initially of the oral compounds are, but we can't &#x2013; I can't put a number on that. The second is Cladribine and how will that work in the further trials? We have an extended trial that is correct. How that will influence the current discussions of the FDA, I wouldn't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question was not just from the FDA, but for most regulators, do you get a sense that they will require four years of safety data before sort of getting very &#x2013; fully comfortable with the drug or do you-?</p>
