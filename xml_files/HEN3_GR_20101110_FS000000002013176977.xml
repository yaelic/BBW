        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our Q3 conference call.</p>
          <p>First I would like to focus on the market environment and the highlights of the third quarter 2010. Then Lothar Steinebach, our CFO, will provide you with the Q3 financials in detail. And after that, I'll comment on the outlook for 2010, and finally we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation, can be accessed via our website at henkel.com\ir (sic) [henkel.com/ir]. The presentation and discussion are conducted subject to this disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>Now let me get started. On the market environment and highlights of third quarter 2010, the global economy is further growing with an anticipated rate of approximately 3.5% GDP for 2010. We see Europe with a mixed growth rate. We see southern Europe being still very volatile, middle of Europe being somewhat stable, and we see Germany being very dynamic. In the U.S. we see a U.S economy with lower growth rates, and we see the emerging markets continue with strong growth rates, particularly Middle East and Asia. We've seen an overall strong expansion on the industrial sector, while the private consumption has developed on a more moderate level, particularly in Europe but also in the US.</p>
          <p>What where the highlights of the quarter we just closed? It was the fourth consecutive quarter with an adjusted EBIT margin above 12%, and for the first time, we surpassed 13% in one quarter. It also, looking back, gives us an average of above 12% for the past five quarters.</p>
          <p>Laundry &amp; Home Care came back a positive organic sales growth after negative development in the second quarter, but a positive in the first quarter. And we continue to see very strong performance of our Personal Care and Adhesive Technologies divisions. What was also good to see was consistent double-digit growth in our emerging market that has been the growth engine for our company. And we continue to have a very sharp eye by on the cost in our company.</p>
          <p>What are some of the concerns and challenges? There has been no change to the intense competitive environment in the HPC side. And as we alluded to after the second quarter in August, we continue to see a unsatisfactory development in North America. Since our second quarter, we have changed our management team, and are working diligently on putting a plan in place that would bring a business situation for our Fast Moving Consumer Goods business in U.S. back to a state which we would describe as satisfactory.</p>
          <p>On raw materials, we see two challenges. One is in the increase of pricing; and then second, which has deteriorated substantially in the last three to four months, has been shortages of certain raw materials that has been particularly an issue for our Adhesives division.</p>
          <p>But overall, a very, very strong third quarter 2010, and for the fifth quarter in a row, what we will call or describe as very strong performance. Now let me move to the different business divisions. Starting with Laundry &amp; Home Care. As I said before, we are back to positive organic sales growth, despite continuous price decreasing in the market due to strong competition, and a very high-level of promotion.</p>
          <p>What has been positive to see has been very high volume growth of up to 9% in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business, which means that we've gained market share. We continue to have double-digit growth rates and may not &#x2013; we see Western Europe with a considerable sales growth, and we've had a very, very strong German business in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We've had increase in EBIT partially due to a very strong top line, but also because we continue to have a focus on our structural costs. And both our Laundry &amp; Home Care business has been growing. At the same time, throughout the quarter, we've continued to introduce and implement successful innovations into the marketplace. So, overall it was a strong quarter, despite very intense competition. Compared to third quarter last year, it was slight decline; compared to second quarter this year, it was a growth, I'm speaking in terms of EBIT now.</p>
          <p>Cosmetics and Toiletries had very, very strong quarter again, with strong organic sales growth, high above the market, which gives us market share gains on record levels in all key countries and in most key segments. We continue to see double-digit growth in our emerging markets and we have record high EBIT and EBIT margin along with very high marketing investment. So the EBIT and EBIT margin has not come on the cost on our marketing investments, almost because of them, because we've had very high marketing spend also in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to push new product into the market and Gliss has been one, Taft another, but also the introduction of Right Guard deodorants in Western Europe and Eastern Europe has been a successful innovation in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So, in short, we've continued very strong performance in our Cosmetics and Toiletries business and I would say consistently because it's been on the goal for a long time now.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Adhesive Technologies had very strong organic sales growth, the highest sales growth in top line ever &#x2013; excuse me, top line ever, and all regions have been contributing to the sales growth. Emerging markets has been the primary driver with double-digit organic growth rates, but we have also seen very strong growth in our mature markets being Western Europe and North America, and we have record high EBIT with 13.8 and EBIT margin also in the quarter, despite increases in raw materials throughout the entire quarter.</p>
          <p>All business groups have been improving and we've also in this area been able to introduce new products into the market that have not only helped drive growth but also improve profitability.</p>
          <p>So we see the trend of the previous quarters continue and a very, very strong performance in our Adhesive Technologies division.</p>
          <p>So what does that mean in numbers? We grew our overall sales almost 0.5 billion from 3.5 to 3,961, 14% reported and 6.5% organic. Our adjusted gross margin went from 47.6 to 47.0, a decline of 60 basis points due to the increase in raw materials. Our adjusted EBIT grew by 25% and our adjusted EBIT margin grew by 130 basis points from 11.7 to 13, as I said in the beginning of the first quarter of 13% for Henkel.</p>
          <p>Our free cash flow went from 642 to 554, so a slight decline and our net working capital continued to improve from 10.3 to 7.8. So returning to the end position of last year. If I were to go through the different line times, I would describe the top line as being strong; the adjusted gross margin as being good under the circumstances, but of course it is a decline; a very strong performance in adjusted EBIT and margin; and still good and strong performance in free cash flow; and a continued good performance with the decline of 250 basis points in the net working capital. So, overall an extremely good quarter for Henkel as we're right here, a record quarter for this quarter we put into the books.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do now is to hand over to Lothar who will take you through the financials. I will then speak about the outlook, and as I said before, we'll then close with the Q&amp;As.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kasper.</p>
          <p>As usual, I will give you our perspective on facts and figure for Q3 2010. First, look at sales growth by business sector in particular of this year to organic sales growth. Our total company, total growth has been about 13% with the heavy influence from foreign exchange impact and organic growth of 6.5%. That is obviously composed of volume growth more than 8% and the negative 1.8 in terms of pricing.</p>
          <p>Now pricing has remained a challenge throughout the year. If you look at the figures for year-to-date, we're still at minus 1.8 for pricing, for total Henkel and 9.1 positive in terms of volume growth. We expect pricing to remain a challenge for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>First looking at Laundry &amp; Home Care, 3.4% organic growth, ongoing strong volume growth with 9%, that's a resumption of what we've been achieving in our best quarters in previous years. We're very happy to report that both Laundry &amp; Home Care have experienced positive growth. And all of that has been achieved in the face of intense competition. We have reported about the intensification of our competitive environment throughout the year. And obviously as input prices have been rising and the competitive pressure increasing, we see big impact on our pricing.</p>
          <p>We expect for the rest of the year, the negative impact from pricing to slowly bottom out, but we expect it still to be negative in Q4, and therefore for the full year it will remain negative. We've seen strong sales growth in particular in Eastern &#x2013; in Western Europe, and pretty much stable in Eastern Europe, because of the intense competitive environment. We've also seen strong organic sales growth, double digit in Middle East, North Africa. We are still not happy with our evolution in North America.</p>
          <p>Sales growth from our Personal Care division, 4.6 continuing our strong out performance of our effective markets, and that's again in the face of intensifying competition. It's mainly driven by retail business in particular, by our retail Hair Care business, which has continued to show a very strong organic sales growth performance. We've also experienced an excellent performance in emerging markets, continuing our double-digit growth in the emerging markets. We are also happy to report that we've experienced positive growth in our professional business, although on a much lower level than in our Hair Care retail.</p>
          <p>Pricing here again has been a challenge throughout the year for the full year-to-date figures were still slightly negative with the strong overcompensation by volume growth. We expect strong promotional pressure to continue throughout Q4 and therefore pricing to remain a challenge also in our Personal Care division. Looking at our Adhesive Technologies division, we have experienced throughout this year strong growth in very interesting segments of our business: Transport and Metal; Electronic; and General Industry, with the strongest growth. And at the same time, these are the segments in our business with the highest margins.</p>
          <p>We've seen both mature markets and emerging markets growing strongly, and we've seen the first quarter to resume positive pricing impact in 2010. So that then is composed of 9.3% volume growth and 0.4% pricing.</p>
          <p>Now for year-to-date, figures were still slightly negative on pricing, and we expect that to remain pretty much either negative or neutral for the full-year. Pricing will again remain a challenge. But we think it will be &#x2013; will remain positive in Q4. So overall, challenge but we're on a good way. In terms of regional, all regions have been growing, Asia-Pacific benefiting from the strong Adhesives recovery.</p>
          <p>We've seen the strong Adhesives growth in Asia Pacific in the high teens, and that includes even the mature countries as part of Asia Pacific. Looking at our emerging markets in total, Adhesive Technologies and Cosmetics/Toiletries with double-digit organic growth, that's now term growth in both divisions and Laundry  and Adhesives &#x2013; Laundry &amp; Home Care division negatively affected in particular by the price activities of our competitors, in particular in Eastern Europe. Adjusted operating earnings, EBIT by business sector: overall, total Henkel with 130 basis points improvement over the same period of last year, adjusted EBIT; similar strong performance in our year-to-date figure, ending up at 12.4 for year-to-date and 13.0 for Q3.</p>
          <p>Going into the detail, division, Laundry &amp; Home Care first was a negative of minus 40 basis points. We've seen higher raw material prices, which we have communicated throughout the year. We're now seeing the biggest impact in Q3. And we're seeing lower selling prices, which we have reported in organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>We could almost offset the negative impact of it compared to the same period of last year, but we had a very strong margin and we are close to reaching similarly strong margin in the face of the adverse environment. So margin remaining still on a pretty high level, much of that obviously driven through our cost-cutting measures.</p>
          <p>Personal Care. We've continued our path of profitable growth with significantly higher marketing investments. We have a margin improvement of 60 basis points and that has been helped to a great degree by our strict cost focus. All of this in the face of aggressive pricing actions of our peers or competitors, and we've been fighting back with pretty significant additional media investments in the year-to-date figure.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies. We have continued with our strong drive to improve our cost structure, thereby taking the full benefit of capacity utilization. The higher capacity utilization in Q3, almost 70% compared to Q3 of last year, which was around 60%. So that strong pickup in capacity utilization, strong pickup in industrial activity helping us to get the leverage of our operating environment.</p>
          <p>We've also seen the strong emphasis on the high margin segment and I alluded to that earlier, particularly Electronics and Transportation, but also General Industry.</p>
          <p>Looking at the gross margin, on an adjusted basis, we have a minus 60 basis points. That obviously has been driven by the significantly higher input costs, which we have reported throughout this year. And we've also seen the negative impact from the lower selling prices, in particular in our Laundry &amp; Home Care division, but also to some extent personal care.</p>
          <p>So volume leverage, which we have improved over the year-to-date figure and cost savings could not fully offset the higher input costs, and that therefore will remain the challenge for the next quarter.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, we've seen strong improvements in our position that's basically helping us to maintain and improve our margin. We have minus 70 basis points in marketing, selling and distribution, and that's not less investment in marketing, it's less cost in distribution.</p>
          <p>We've seen admin expenses minus 70 basis points, again the benefit of the actions that we have undertaken over the past two years improving our cost structure to a great extent. And we've also seen lower percentage of R&amp;D expenses to total sales helping us with 40 basis points; and finally the balance of net other operating income and charges was plus 20. So the total of our cost savings has greatly improved our cost structure and thereby helped us improve our operating earnings.</p>
          <p>Marketing, investments have remained stable, as I mentioned earlier, and increased in particular in our Personal Care division with distribution costs down. Admin expenses obviously decreased as a percentage of sales as the result of our usage increase due to usage of Shared Service Center.</p>
          <p>Reported adjusted EBIT for Q3 was basically two items: one-time gains; and restructuring charges. One-time gains 10 million. We had to release a provision for an unfavorable supplier contract, which we had undertaken same period of last year, so that's a one-time gain. And in terms of restructuring charges, that's basically normal restructuring, which we have undertaken and approved in Q3.</p>
          <p>Financial results improved over the same period of last year, minus 40 versus minus 37, driven by the lower level of net debt, and that will result in a slight adaptation of our full-year guidance to minus 170 for the financial results. Cash flow statement, the line item that stands out is our performance in net working capital, which has resulted as a consequence of the strong improvement in the ratio of a release of 34 million in terms of cash that's less than last year.</p>
          <p>Obviously we have been able to manage our substantially higher sales volume with less cash than otherwise would have been required. We hadn't been able to manage our ratios down. So therefore there's a positive impact on the change in net working capital, despite the much higher sales volume.</p>
          <p>Purchase of property, plant and equipment is minus 52 compared to the same period of last year. Full year guidance therefore will be adapted to minus 250 and there will be an impact carry over into next year, then minus 250. It's below guidance that we had given earlier, and therefore there's going to be some transfer into next year.</p>
          <p>That shows our development of net working capital, 7.8 compared to 10.3 in the same period of last year. We're also providing now some more transparency insight into the performance of our divisions, Laundry &amp; Home Care, which is now at 0.6 of sales, Cosmetics and Toiletries, which is at 4% of sales, and Adhesives, which is at 14% of sales. All of our divisions compare very favorably with our peers in their respective businesses. As far as we can tell, we are best in class compared to our peers in the respective businesses.</p>
          <p>Net debt, we're at a level of round about 2.8 billion, end of Q3. We're on our way to reach the targets that we've set for ourselves for the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>Now National Starch is almost over. We have experienced another amount of savings of 65 million in Q3. That will be then 245 for the full year, and we're raising our guidance for next year up 2-8 to 260.</p>
          <p>Few more items where we either adjust our guidance or else confirm our guidance. EBIT corporate, we were at 60 to 80, it will be more like 80 for the full year. Financial results, we're lowering our guidance to minus 170 from minus 180. Restructuring charges will be slightly higher than what we had guided earlier; it will be about 120, maybe 140.</p>
          <p>Tax rates remains at 26 to 27. Minorities again will be unchanged at about 30 million. CapEx, we're lowering our guidance from initially 350 now to 250, and there again we expect some carry over impact into next year.</p>
          <p>With that, I will hand over again to Kasper to provide the outlook for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lothar.</p>
          <p>We are looking at a stable growth in terms of GDP for 2010, stabilizing around the 3.5, 3.6% rate, but up consistently in outlook for the last 12 months. So a very solid growth environment in 2010, which we have also been benefiting from.</p>
          <p> If I look upon and say what are our expectations for 2010, for market growth, for Laundry &amp; Home Care and Cosmetics, we see a flat market, and for Adhesives, we see a market that is growing around 5%. And as we've been saying consistently our aspiration is to outperform our markets in terms of growth.</p>
          <p>When it comes to earnings, we are changing now that &#x2013; we are guiding now that our adjusted EBIT margin will be well above 12%. So we're starting to align our guidance and our margins around the targets that we have for 2012. And our adjusted EPS should be in the substantial improvement above 45%, so again a raise here also.</p>
          <p>The final outlook for 2011 we'll be giving in February as always, so I ask you today at the questions not to ask any questions. So you can ask the questions, but you won't get the answer before in February.</p>
          <p>What I do want to mention though is, and just spend a couple of seconds on the following, is our continued adaption of structures to market. Lothar mentioned that we're taking the guidance up for restructuring for this year, up to a range between 120 and 140, so that is an increase. What you will see also moving into next year is a number, which is also three digits.</p>
          <p>And basically what we're saying is, and what we've been saying consistently, we believe there are many more opportunities to become more competitive in our structures moving forward. And we will make sure that we take those opportunities on board and continue to work on improving the company.</p>
          <p>And while the global restructuring program &#x2013; or our global restructuring program, Global Excellence, is over, and as Lothar said, the integration of National Starch is also behind us. That does not mean that we do not see future opportunities for making us more competitive, and we will make use of those opportunities in 2011 and moving forward. So you should expect to continue to see us addressing cost opportunities and efficiency opportunities within the corporation.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to summarize it was the best quarter ever despite very tough competition. And also despite raw material price increases and constraints, we've seen a very strong performance across all business sectors and regions. And we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities that we communicated back in 2008 with a very firm focus in achieving our financial targets for 2012. These are the targets, and we're very committed to achieving those targets.</p>
          <p>And we're very committed also to do whatever takes to get there, i.e. make the business decision to make the company more competitive by 2012.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to close the formal presentation and go over to our Q&amp;A session. So thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Rorsted. Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Mark Christensen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Can I just ask a question on the raw material headwinds that you've been talking about at some length? I mean, clearly your margins today has proven a lot more resilient than what many of us might have thought. I'm wondering if that has something to do with timing i.e. perhaps the &#x2013; sort of the bulk of the headwind that we expected is yet to come. So my first question would be can you speak to us perhaps as to &#x2013; give some sort of word as to the phasing of the headwind, whether you see it accelerating strongly in the next few quarters or sort of maintaining a high level? That's question number one. Question number two, on pricing in Laundry, and I guess this is predominately in Western Europe, with input cost being so high and obviously we've had a lot of competition this year, promotions this year, where do you see the industry heading perhaps in the next couple of quarters? Do you think people will be sacrificing margins to maintain share? Do you think given the increasing costs that a bit more rationality might return? I don't know if you've got some sort of a view as to where you think that the sort of the industry might go in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. I will take the second question, and Lothar will the first question. So I'll start with the second on Laundry pricing in Europe. It's been a market that has been very, very competitive in the past 12 to 18 months. And what we are seeing is that, we've been able to "offset" some of the pricing due to significantly higher volumes. So what has maintained our competitive nature in the market is that we have been able to increase overall the volume by more than 9% or 9%.</p>
          <p>We expect that the pricing will be flattening out by the end of the year, and we would also expect that throughout or due to some times next year, we will start to see an increase in pricing. We're seeing increases in raw materials coming in. There is no indication that pricing will change in the fourth quarter. So it's going to be throughout next year that we'll start seeing a normalized pricing. We have not foregone any market share in 2010. We believe we've gained market share. So we have been offsetting the input costs by higher volumes on one side, and a very big focus on getting the structural costs further down. That will also be the focus moving forward. So we're very committed to remain competitive in the marketplace, also if that means taking our structural costs further down and we are and done so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark let me share a few observations on how we look at the phasing off the headwinds from raw. Now, we've communicated over time that because of the impact from inventory revaluation, there is a time delay between the increase in prices and the impact on our P&amp;L. And therefore with &#x2013; although prices had increased already in the previous quarters, the impact on our P&amp;L was tiny, and therefore almost invisible.</p>
          <p>Now from our perspective, it's pretty much that Q3, and that's been our communication all along, will be the first quarter where we see bigger impact from raw material price increases. And therefore we &#x2013; that's basically what we see, that's the impact for the time being that we'll see. That will remain, unless prices go down again, which we don't see, we'll be there. And therefore now the challenge for us will be now to again get into our cost structures, and do the pricing that is necessary in order to reflect the price inflation on the input side.</p>
          <p>So, basically our evaluation is that Q3 is the one quarter where we see the full impact already, but don't see or don't expect another strong wave of raw material price increases, not in the near future. And we'll obviously work towards getting the impact diminished over the time.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. Two questions from me. The first is on your innovation pipeline for 2011, how would you view the strength of that? Clearly, you're coming off quite a strong base particularly in your Cosmetic and Toiletry business this year? And the second question is on capacity utilization. I think you mentioned a number of 70% capacity utilization in your Adhesive business. Can you just remind us what the number was for Q2? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Eamonn, the first question is a bit subjective because you're asking us to evaluate whether the innovation pipeline will be successful or not. Our belief is that we have a strong innovation pipeline in 2011 lined up similar or better than the pipeline of 2010. But of course that is subjective thinking at this stage, at the end of the day, the consumer or our industrial customers will decide.</p>
          <p>But we've spent a lot of resources in continuing to develop our pipeline. And with the current state, we're quite comfortable that we have a very strong pipeline.</p>
          <p>But I will say this is of course a subjective opinion. At the end of the day our customers have to make the choice and will make that with the money when they vote. But we believe we have a strong pipeline also moving in to 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In regards to capacity utilization &#x2013; utilization rates that we had experienced in Q2 were 62%. Just to remind of how we look at capacity utilization, we have a target range of between 60 and 70%. That's basically what we've almost &#x2013; call almost full capacity utilization, because of the impact from changes in the portfolio and programs, there's not much that we can do in order to come to a much higher capacity utilization.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; the other element that is important here and that is raw material availability, and we've communicated consistently that this has been a challenge. So the capacity is more a problem in terms of our suppliers than our own capacity. In terms of getting access to raw materials, we've seen a lot of problems during the course of this year. We've always been able to manage our way around partially with higher expenses, because we've had to shift around materials from facility to facility. It's getting ever more difficult. That situation in particular in our packaging Adhesives business where it remains or it will be even more difficult to get the materials that we need, because in fact that capacity has been reduced as a result of the prices in the course of last year for some of our suppliers. And that therefore will remain the risk that we're looking at in Q4 and next year. So therefore our capacity is in good shape, we don't really have any particular problems there. But we remain hunting for raw materials in some particular areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And just to confirm, you did 70% in Q3. Am I right in saying you don't see much upside from that level going through the next number of years in terms of getting that up to 80%. Your target is 60 to 70, and you're right at the top of that range at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that does not include the building adhesives sector because that's an area where it's pretty fast to add capacity. That's basically an area where we move quick volumes. And it's not very difficult to add additional capacity.</p>
          <p>So in the areas that we're active in the particular adhesives the reactive adhesives sector, we still have capacity that is available. And we do obviously expect strong growth in the future. And given that story during the course of our Investor Day in Adhesives, that ongoing substitution process that we expect in particular in the reactive adhesives sector.</p>
          <p>So the 60 to 70% target range is without building adhesives.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. First of all, well done for the historical results.</p>
          <p>Secondly, two quick &#x2013; one on U.S. Laundry. I mean you've mentioned that you're not happy with the business, you've changed the management. I mean, what is the issue, and what do you think needs doing, and how long do you think it will take?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on your guidance on CapEx and restructuring. On restructuring, you're basically saying about 120 million per annum going forward. Is that what you're still in a way guiding to, despite lifting this year.</p>
          <p>And on CapEx, that's quite a big drop in the number which you were guiding for before. So if you're running at full capacity utilization already, and you're not spending more on CapEx, how are you effectively going to meet the increasing demands? So isn't CapEx meant really to be going up at this point in the cycle? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Harold, I'll take the first question and Lothar will take the remainder &#x2013; the second question &#x2013; the second one</p>
          <p>On the U.S. Laundry, if you were to oversimplify, <mark type="inaudible" /> market is growing, and we've been losing market share. So, some of it has been due to very strong market competition, there is no doubt. And some of it is also to our own doing, and that's why we've changed the management structure there.</p>
          <p>Right now with the new structure in place, we've put an action plan in place that will be reviewed by the Board, and will be executed according to that.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't disclose frankly what I'm going to do here, because I think that would be inappropriate, that's confidential information. The point though what I'm making is that we are aware of the problem. We've been very transparent also to the investors around the problem. We are dealing with it. And while it's going to be difficult, we're confident that we can turn the situation around. And when we do that, we will get another positive contribution from the North American business.</p>
          <p>And that will not happen within a quarter, that's very clear. Conversely it's also very clear that we're extremely committed to it. Both Lothar, Hans and I was in the U.S. in the past 30 days, and we're committed to turning that business around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now come back to the easy question on CapEx and restructurings.</p>
          <p>First of all, in terms of restructuring, we don't expect that we're going to have a run rate of 120 per annum going forward. We'll do another survey and intense investigation into our structures, and we expect that to basically be completed in the course of next year. So, we'll then communicate obviously a more realistic run rate, which used to be 50, 60 in the past. I'm sure we're going to get back to that level pretty soon.</p>
          <p>So this year and next year will be years of stronger efforts in keeping our structures adapted to the changing market environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, for this year, it's entirely a phasing question. It's always difficult to completely foresee whether the cash out for a particular investment will happen yet this year or will happen next year. So that's the one aspect.</p>
          <p>Basically we're right now at a rate of 350, and we won't be able to spend it completely this year, but therefore the amount will be increasing next year.</p>
          <p>Also you obviously correctly have referred to the need to provide the capacity that we need for the strong growth. And therefore we expect the normal rate of CapEx going forward to be higher than what we have experienced in the past two years.</p>
          <p>Now it will be substantially or structurally somewhat lower than in the past, because we've closed down a number of facilities, and therefore we don't need investments there any more. However we're going to have to invest in terms of following growth regions, particularly in building adhesive sector for example and other sectors in order to be able to benefit from the strong growth there. So CapEx as a run rate will be higher than in the past two years, that's very clear. And that's part of our program going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. Another question if I may on Laundry in the U.S. Maybe you can give us an update on Purex and especially Purex 3-in-1? If you could elaborate a bit on that progress?</p>
          <p>And the second is on capacity utilization again. Of course you had the seasonal peak, and we are going in to a seasonal let's say a lower season in Q4 and especially into Q1. Are you still committed to see higher levels of capacity utilization in those upcoming quarters than in previous quarters of last year?</p>
          <p>And my final question is a bit on Latin America, from a regional perspective, the margin progress there was a little bit held back. Is that just a temporary thing or should we read a little bit more into that, that you are investing there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start out with the Laundry question in the U.S. and your question as relates to 3-in-1.</p>
          <p>3-in-1 has found a stable market share position that's obviously 1.5 points and it's been trading very consistently around that since its introduction in May of last year. So we are now 18 months into the introduction of 3-in-1.</p>
          <p>And if you go to the U.S. stores, being Target, Wal-Mart, et cetera, it's a product that has the shelf space, it will be relaunched in the first quarter with a better packaging. So we're quite comfortable with that position and we don't expect that to change.</p>
          <p>The U.S. Laundry market has been exceptionally competitive starting two years ago with a very aggressive price move particularly from P&amp;G taking Tide from 7.50 to approximately 4 on promo. And at least, I was in the U.S. a month ago and seems like some of the promo activities are trying to scale back particularly on the high end and the market has &#x2013; I'm not saying normalized, because that's not the case. But I think it's gone away from its most aggressive position. So we are seeing a somewhat more normalized market in the U.S., but still a very aggressive, more aggressive than it was two years ago, it's probably less aggressive than it was a year ago. So I am not saying it's normalized, but it has improved slightly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to address the capacity utilization question, under normal circumstances, it will have to be lower in Q4. In particular since the industrial business tends to be with much less speed in Q4 as a result of the need for maintenance. And therefore our experience over many years has been that, industrial business is down in Q4 compared to the other quarters. So industrial activity will be down under normal circumstances, and therefore capacity utilization should also be down. Now if you look at our experience in 2009, we had a similar picture, high-capacity utilization comparatively in Q3 and then lower in Q4. We would expect the same or similar thing to happen in Q4. And then pick up again in Q1.</p>
          <p>Now, again there are some uncertainties around the economic evolution that we will be looking at Q1 and the other quarters of next year, and we'll communicate about it when we go into next year. However, again as a normal procedure we'll be at a lower level in Q4 and should then pick up again in Q1 and the other quarters of next year. Plus, additionally I think it is very important to note that growth rates in our business in particular Adhesives have been significantly higher than normal, in the first two quarters in particular, as a result of the downturn in 2009.</p>
          <p>So the comparison to 2009, with a very high growth rate, is obviously somewhat distorted by the downturn in 2009. And therefore growth rates will come back to the more normal levels in the next years. And we've communicated that and Kasper has alluded to that. We do expect growth in the Adhesive sector in the next year. Certainly we'll continue to outgrow our market but it's not going to be 20% or something of that nature.</p>
          <p>With respect to the margin in Latin America, actually we've seen improvement in the regional margin over the same period of last year. Therefore I'm a little puzzled about your question, it's improving from 8.1 to 9.7. And that's obviously has been driven by our Adhesive business, which has picked up even though it was not as much down in Latin America as we've communicated in the course of 2009. Latin America was the one region in the world which was least affected in particular in the industrial sector. Nevertheless we've made progress, and we've improved our margins.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah, okay, yeah. Okay, yes. We do &#x2013; in Latin American we still have businesses that are in growth mode in particular Laundry &amp; Home Care, which has a very limited presence in the Mexico and Guatemala. And therefore we're still in the investment mode there. We'll continue to invest in to our growth rather than trying to improve to get the same margin that we have in on average. And then similar Personal Care is in investment mode. We do have very competitive margins in our Adhesive business. So therefore it's no more than the situation that our businesses are in, in compared to other regions and other market positions that we hold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how long do you actually believe then in Latin America these investment modes will last? Is that for the coming years or is that coming quarters? Could you elaborate?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I just had a question on volume growth in Laundry, that sharp acceleration. Just trying to get a feel for what really drove that, it looks like it came predominantly from Western Europe and Germany. And are there any one-offs in that 9% growth figure which we should be aware of and might reverse in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then a second question on the lower admin costs, which I think is a 70 basis point benefit. Again can we just confirm that those are ongoing benefits and there are one-offs in there? And I guess if you could just remind us, give us a feeling for what those savings are, where are they coming from, what divisions, what geographies, that would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the volume side, we've had positive volume growth across all regions and pretty much across every quarter this year. So we've been &#x2013; we've just been very focused which we said all along and not losing market share.</p>
          <p>And that has been one of the drivers if you go and look upon some of the sub numbers that we don't disclose. But our development in Central and Eastern Europe was to maintain our market share.</p>
          <p>So we've had consistently high volume growth throughout the year. It was particularly high in the third quarter. But there is nothing particular besides the point that we are maintaining aggressive market position, because we want to make certain that we don't lose substantial market share in a very aggressive market where due to very aggressive market environment.</p>
          <p>And when you look through 2010, we've been able to grow and maintain our market share position in all key markets for our Laundry business, which has been key for us.</p>
          <p>So we've just been executing aggressively. There is no significant change to our strategy. Almost on the contrary, we've maintained a very high focus on market share, and we'll continue to do so also moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add one word of caution. There are no one-offs in our growth figures. However, we've always maintained that, because the HPC businesses are driven by actions and promotions, it's more appropriate to look at the longer-term horizon rather than looking at months or quarters, and then single out particular growth rates and try to see whether that's sustainable or not.</p>
          <p>In other words, a 9% volume growth is not the run rate that we would expect to continue for the next five quarters or so. So that would be unrealistic, because that's obviously a result of whatever we've done in the quarter, and the next quarter will be different to some extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It sounds like -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think we should be more concerned about either two quarters or three quarters or four quarters in terms of what is happening in that particular business.</p>
          <p>And if you look at it, we still see a significant volume growth. And if you look at our competitive environment, I'm sure you've noted that many of our peers have emphasized volume growth over organic sales growth or pricing. And that's therefore an activity or an environment in which we have to compete and maintain our market shares. So therefore volume growth over year-to-date figures has been fairly good, and that's the more realistic figure year-to-date, rather than just one quarter, without that calling a one-off.</p>
          <p>Admin costs, similar answer, there is no one-off in that particular figure. Therefore that's the level that we will be able to maintain.</p>
          <p>The result of what we have undertaken in the past 18 months, in particular &#x2013; we have reduced our structures by employing shared services. We've communicated about that several times. That's certainly something which we have undertaken in Western Europe and in North America. Much of what we've been doing in terms of establishing Shared Service Centers in Bratislava and Manila has been transferring the work that has been performed in the Western European organization &#x2013; and in North America through those Shared Service Centers.</p>
          <p>Just to give you one small figure, we're right now running at a rate of more than 600 people in both Shared Service Centers, and we'll continue to increase that in the near term to 900 or more than 900.</p>
          <p>And that's a reduction in total head count of no more than around 20%. The bigger impact is obviously from the ability to utilize much more efficient processes, and Shared Services is about process and efficiency rather than just shifting people. So therefore that's a big impact in terms of our admin costs that's coming through now.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that we've again managed our admin costs down because of the Global Excellence program. So the savings that we have communicated are coming through now and also in that line.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, guys, it's Matthias Eifert from MainFirst. I have a question about Adhesives.</p>
          <p>You talked about the market share gains. And could you elaborate a bit in which areas you had the market share gains, and to what extent you've won market share, and if you had any particular initiatives for that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, about the shortages you mentioned, did that affect your input costs or was there also a sales impact, and your sales growth would have been actually even higher without the shortages? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second question on the shortages. What we have seen is difficulties in getting the materials, but we've always managed. Because we had, as the highest priority, we had ability &#x2013; continuing ability to serve our customers. And there is no one situation where in the first year-to-date figure in nine months, we've not been able to fill the orders.</p>
          <p>So the sales figure is probably not affected or not much affected. What I've been trying to say is that we've seen an impact on the expenses, because it was much more difficult to get the material to the point where it was needed, and that was connected with additional expenses.</p>
          <p>It may be even more difficult going forward. The difficulties or the shortages are not &#x2013; they're not eliminated or reduced. And therefore that remains a big challenge for us to be able to cope with it.</p>
          <p>In terms of market share gains, first of all, we talk about industrial markets, where there are no public statistics available, so therefore, that's based on our observation of our sales performance compared to our peers basically. And if you do that, you'll find that we've been performing better. And therefore the explanation for market share gains.</p>
          <p>That's certainly true in the Electronic sector. It's also certainly true in the Transportation and General Industry. Those are the three areas that I've been highlighting in terms of our improvement, strong improvement over the same period of last year, where we have a strong presence in terms of our technologies and also strong presence in terms of our customer relationships.</p>

And I was wondering if you could share with us how you see your share of voice having developed over the last couple of years, and what you see that doing going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Personal Care. Can you maybe share a little bit how much Scias has contributed to the continued strong growth, and how much there is left in terms of roll out?</p>
          <p>And maybe you've talked a lot about the weakness in Home Care in the U.S. Can you maybe just talk a bit what you're seeing on the Personal Care side in that market?</p>

          <p>Eva, you know, we don't give out actual numbers, but I can give you the trend lines. Over the last few years, we've consistently taken our marketing spend up, which means that we've improved our share of voice and share of market. However, we still believe that we need to invest more moving forward.</p>
          <p>So it's an area that we &#x2013; while we have improved, we still believe that we need to invest more. It's all always a relative decision how much you need to invest, but we are taking it up and we will continue to take it up also moving forward.</p>
          <p>And Scias, we still believe there is more opportunity and more room around Scias. It is been tremendously successful market introduction in April of last year, and is looking &#x2013; probably the most successful innovation we've done or introduction we've done for many, many years.</p>
          <p>At this stage, it's in more than 25 countries. We continue to look upon opportunities to allow in more countries, but also expand the product range. And as I'm certain you know, we implemented color this year, which has been very successful.</p>
          <p>So we have said on a number of occasions it's a 200-million plus brand, and that will continue to grow. We believe there is more opportunities without quantifying it, but we still believe there is room for &#x2013; the reception from the consumer has been exceptionally good and still is, and we continue to evaluate, as I said, how much can we expand the range, and where do we have further opportunities to implement it, as well. So very positive.</p>

          <p>Quick perspective on Personal Care in the U.S. We've highlighted the Home Care sector or the Home Care business in U.S. as one where we need to react, and act stronger. We're not particularly happy with our Personal Care situation in the U.S., but it's less so because we think we've missed some chances, but it's not a structural issue, it's an area where we'll fairly easily come back to the level that we had before. So in both HPC and the U.S. we're not particularly happy. But I think the way to go in Personal Care is much harder than in Home Care.</p>

          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for participating in our Q3 conference call. After what we would view as a successful first nine months 2009 is likely to be the most successful financial year that we've had. At the same time, we will maintain our rigorous approach to cost management and our continuous adaption of our structure to changing market environments. I am therefore optimistic that we will achieve our financial targets for 2012. I wish you all the best, and look forward to seeing you soon certainly by the time of our Analysts Conference for our fiscal 2010 on February 24, 2011, in D&#xFC;sseldorf. So thank you very much for participating today.</p>
