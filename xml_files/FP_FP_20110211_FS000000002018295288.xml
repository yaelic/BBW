          <p>I'd just like to make an announcement regarding safety and security here before beginning with the Chairman's presentation. We have two emergency exits, one situated directly behind you. That's the main entrance, if you prefer. The second emergency exit is behind the panels and to the right of the room.</p>
          <p>If you'd now welcome Christophe de Margerie, please.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I see few different faces. In all events, I'd like to welcome you all. Say good morning to you and welcome you to our now traditional meeting on the results for 2010 and more particularly, on the outlook.</p>
          <p>I'll focus on the prospects and outlook then on the results, not that the results aren't interesting but because you've already received them. And as I expect there will be questions, you will have ample opportunity to raise any issues you would like to raise.</p>
          <p>Just a few words about the results, nonetheless, to begin. First of all, our results are good. They're not outstanding. First of all, we've posted higher profits in the past, but also we have major investments to make.</p>
          <p>So I think 2010 was a good year of transition in the positive sense of the term in so far as we have a good income, good cash flow. We have the ability to fund our future, and we have a relatively low gearing, certainly below the range we have set ourselves of 25% to 30%. So, in &#x2013; given that situation, we feel in a strong position to move forward with a very good overview of the energy sector, which as you know, we're not over optimistic or surrealistic about this. We are very, very realistic about the future for all sorts of reasons, given the fact that the current energy prices are what they are, and prices we feel that are unlikely to drop.</p>
          <p>So, 2010 saw a return to growth. I know you're going to talk to me about 2011, but I'll take advantage of the fact that I have the floor to talk to you about 2010 where we achieved 4.3% &#x2013; a 4.2% increase in production. Some people will claim that there's only 7% when you factor in the price effect, but this could be less when things are the other way around. But this is nonetheless, a good achievement. It's a useful achievement in our portfolio of all the assets we need to move forward, whence our commitment to a 2% increase in production over the next five years, 2010 to 2015.</p>
          <p>Now, the rate of replacement of our reserves, we'll come back to that. But we have proven reserves that are being replaced at a rate of 124%. I know there are a number of acquisitions, but as far as I know, acquisitions are still included in our reserves. So 124% proven reserves with the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income of &#x20AC;10.3 billion, that's a 32% increase on the previous period.</p>
          <p>Now on a like-for-like basis, by that I mean without Sanofi-Aventis or factoring Sanofi-Aventis back in, if you prefer, that 32% increase would be 43% if we factored out Sanofi-Aventis. So that's the figure to bear in mind when you're comparing us with our competitors.</p>
          <p>But just as importantly, this wasn't just due to the better environment but also as a result of our better operational performance and of course the level of business, which enabled us to be more competitive and not just in exploration and production.</p>
          <p>Gross investments of &#x20AC;16.3 billion in 2010, that was up 22% on the previous period. That's a net &#x20AC;12 billion, up 16%, which is the figure that counts in terms of cash flow. And finally, the development prospects are better than before. Again, we'll be talking to you about that, but I'll &#x2013; it's going to take more &#x2013; a bolder approach and greater level of risk in exploration, but we'll be looking at new areas such as Canada and Australia. We will also be more responsive, adapting ourselves or continuing to adapt ourselves, should I say, as appropriate.</p>
          <p>In this new strategy, in this &#x2013; the new dynamics of our strategy, in a long-term business like ours, we are relative newcomers, but we have to take the long-term view &#x2013; we are producing what we explored and found a long, long time ago, but we will continue to produce for a long time. And of course, the future and distant future, it needs to be prepared now.</p>
          <p>So as I've said before, we are being bolder in terms of exploration, more aggressive, the &#x2013; yeah, the Ivory Coast and there is a certain level of adjusting in many respects, Angola with the pre-salt. The two emerging regions, Canada and Australia that I will tell you more about later, we're talking more specific about Canada and Australia.</p>
          <p>For the redeployment of assets and acceleration of asset disposals and &#x2013; so, I mean, they should not be overlooked. We have a number of projects in new energies. These are real projects, not just projects devised to keep people happy.</p>
          <p>We have projects in oil, of course, but in other forms of energy, because we haven't just got the duty, we have the will to seek out new forms of energy, which of course requires research, something we are doing by acquiring stakes &#x2013; by acquiring stakes in companies, but also by making commitments to work along these companies, these partners with a view to the long-term. Again more about that a little bit later on.</p>
          <p>I talked to you about the disposal of assets and the investments. That's on the right-hand side of the chart, where you will see the gross investments we have made, &#x20AC;20.5 billion, and disposals of &#x20AC;4.6 billion. That was in 2010. That was the breakdown by segment. You have that, too. Of course, great focus on safety.</p>
          <p>Maybe we should've put this first in the order of slides in terms of reliability, and acceptability, safety. These are much more than just words. These are commitments that we've been making. These are industrial commitments, of course. And when you bear in mind what happened with Macondo, that's deepwater horizon, is nothing &#x2013; something that should not be overlooked for a very, very long time. This is clear evidence of the fact that a company can be exposed to a great degree of risk.</p>
          <p>As a result of a handful of minor operational issues and risks, these are things that can happen. We are exposed to risk, as we know, whence our plan to set up working groups, again more about that, but our task forces in working groups.</p>
          <p>Again, this isn't just <mark type="inaudible" />. These are firm commitments that we have made. There are a number of operational managers in E&amp;P that will confirm that for you. We are continuing to contribute to the development of local economies. This is now built into our business plan, it's not just something we communicate about. Indeed in all the projects that we roll out at all sectors of our business, we include a society issues and responsibilities, commitments that we make not just to local authorities, in terms of global warming, but indeed to the countries in which we operate.</p>
          <p>In so far as this is one of the hallmarks of our group, it cultural hallmark. Indeed more than a cultural hallmark, it's part and parcel of our model.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, you will see our statistics showing that safety in the workplace has improved sharply. In exploration and production, we are now in the leading pack. In refining and marketing, we have made substantial improvements, but have still a little way to go. This is of course part of the type of business we are in with the transportation in Africa for instance, or unfortunately the accounting of lost time in France. As a result of these factors, we have not yet achieved our targets. And of course, the other 12 famous golden rules, I don't know if you've received that document. If you haven't, we will be distributing this booklet to you.</p>
          <p>Now in 2010, I think you know the environment by heart, there's little need to comment that. Certainly it was an improvement on 2009, not as good as 2008. However, there were sharp fluctuations. We started at a very low level, went to a very high level and finished at an annual high. The important thing is the average, the $79.50, that's the average price of the Brent &#x2013; Brent price in dollars. This is the average we have used in determining the quality and feasibility of our project. So that's an annual average of $80 a barrel in 2010. Henry Hub and the National Balancing Point, we talk about that later on.</p>
          <p>Increasingly, we have three separate markets, the U.S., Europe and Asia. And the ERMI which is European Refining Margin Index, which has certainly improved though we haven't really reaped the benefits of that improvement, largely due to the industrial unrest and strikes in France, not just in France, maybe, but certainly because of the fact that our refining assets were not as efficient as usual.</p>
          <p>We are now catching up on lost time, and our current refining margins are in the region of $30 a ton, as a result of which, we can now work in relatively good conditions. Adjusted net income in dollars &#x2013; $26 was &#x20AC;32.</p>
          <p>Again, if you want to compare this without Sanofi-Aventis, you would have to add about 10%, not quite the same percentage in dollars and euros. But you have the breakdown by segment as well below that, with the upstream back to a profitability in excess of 20%. Refining and marketing particularly driven by marketing, as a result, only up 8%. Chemicals, very successful in petro chemicals and the specialties with an ROACE up multiplied by 3, giving us a total ROACE of 17% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Just as importantly, net cash flow very important for our investments, net cash flow $6 billion. And all sectors or segments should I say, have contributed to that cash flow. So we have cash flow, of course, and we use it. $30 billion in 2010. $30 billion that have helped us reduce our debt. Our dividend is unchanged.</p>
          <p>We'll talk about that later on. And our investments have increased &#x2013; have increased, but have been kept well under control and giving us a cash flow from operations of almost $25 billion, net investments of almost $16 billion, dividends with the remainder of the dividend after the interim dividend in May. While the board yesterday proposed that the AGM approve a dividend of &#x20AC;2.28 per share, which is equivalent of a payout ratio of 50% and in dollars, that would be 49%. This is a yield of 5.8%, thanks to the fact that our share price has risen slightly. Gearing down to 22%, which gives us plenty of visibility for the future.</p>
          <p>Now our asset portfolio is really growth driven and of course very much focused on optimization. It's often been contended that we don't work our portfolios efficiently, particularly in the upstream. I can assure you that when you're long in dollars per barrel, when you believe in an increase in oil prices, well then it's difficult to envisage disposing of assets.</p>
          <p>However, it's equally true that if you're to grow durably, it's important to know when to sell mature barrels, that is assets with few growth prospects, if anything, the prospects have declined. This is important to know when to sell these assets to reap the benefits, not a time when the market is very buoyant.</p>
          <p>It's a good time to sell these assets, this is what we have been doing I think quite cleverly. This is what our people in exploration, production have been doing. Not overlooking the sales that were required to streamline our portfolio, be it in specialty chemicals or indeed, in the field of assets currently being disposed of in the U.K.</p>
          <p>So the asset portfolio has changed quite considerably and you'll see that we will continue to re-shuffle our asset portfolio in the future, again with a view to eking out additional barrels and additional growth.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see the amounts of our acquisitions and disposals in dollars, pretty balanced in 2010. It's a $4.7 billion on top, $4.6 billion on the bottom. For the first time, not to mention Sanofi, we have a transaction that has yet be completed in the line &#x2013; in line with the project we announced that is some $4.5 billion to be disposed of, some $3.5 billion due from assets. This is already underway, leaving us with a balance of $1 billion, an additional $1 billion, should I say.</p>
          <p>Upstream performance of course, has been driven by production growth, production which grew 4.3%, and that's good news. LNG has contributed substantially to that growth, all the better and you'll see a little bit later on that LNG is not just a one of the drivers behind growth, but also a driver behind profits and profits that are higher than the upstream average. The distribution of liquid and gas is of lesser importance, I think, especially in view of the fact that we generate greater value with gas than with petrol, particularly with regard to spot prices and Henry Hub prices. So, in dollars per barrel in the upstream, prices rose 23%, that's 13.1%.</p>
          <p>Just briefly a word in passing, certainly in terms of our development, we are less sensitive to price increases than a number of our competitors. However, in dollars per barrel we are also very well-positioned, as the whole notion of development by comparison to reality, but this is $13 a barrel, which is why we are not very interested in developing projects like Iraq. And I think, as for the technical costs, we are not as high as our competitors, though our technical costs have risen 8%. Our costs have been well-contained, despite the fact that they are continuing to increase.</p>
          <p>If you look at the chart, however, you very clearly get the impression that we should continue to be best-in-class, at least one of the best in the class, if not the very best. It would be surprising if our competitors were to succeed in reducing their costs. We see that in our tenders, despite all our efforts, well the market will continue to be the market.</p>
          <p>Six major projects to strengthen our production growth in profitability, this will maintain the production growth of 2%, postponing our commitment by a year. You have projects, which contribute to profitability here on the right-hand side, on the bottom of the slide there. The impact of these projects is there with profitability compared to the $100 per barrel. We have 80 billion and 100 &#x2013; $80 and $100 there, but we have a basic price of $80, but we really want to see what the price &#x2013; what it would like at $100. Because the price was $148, in August <mark type="inaudible" />, and therefore we need to look at what it means at $100 per barrel. We don't want to be of course too conservative, although we must remain prudent.</p>
          <p>OECD, non-OECD breakdown on these projects is worth looking at, 70% OECD. That's new, I think, compared to our traditional portfolio. On the other hand, I always insist, and I'm happy that those who like that &#x2013; it's not because &#x2013; within the OECD, it's easier to work.</p>
          <p>And even though the projects are not easy, the oil shale in Canada is a very difficult project, even if it's in an OECD country. So, it's not necessarily the case that it's easy in the OECD, and not outside the OECD. You have the breakdown between liquids, other gas and LNG, and in the six projects it's basically 50-50.</p>
          <p>Renewing exploration acreage, this is of course a priority and we're trying to gain further permits on our traditional areas, like the United Kingdom, for instance or Angola, but also looking for new oil in other areas. It's a frontier exploration, more or less, with greater risks, with greater budgets, $1.8 billion up to $2.1 billion. But all this, of course, is something that means that we must renew our potential for future development.</p>
          <p>We've made a commitment of 1.4 billion barrels extra per year, basically 50-50 between exploration and what we call unconventional projects. Sometimes there are more traditional projects and sometimes there are more unconventional projects. But all this is necessary and must remain in balance so that the portfolio continues to develop for the company.</p>
          <p>We're also looked at &#x2013; we're looking at pre-salt &#x2013; that's the case in Angola. In Brazil it will also be the case. We've taken a stake with Shell in Brazil and it's going to be positive, I'm confident about that. But for the time being, we're not very engaged there.</p>
          <p>Proven reserves, 124% replacement rate in 2010. This is the explanation of how we get from one to the other and there is a price effect there, which is negative. Clearly this figure includes our acquisitions, and that I think is quite natural. Good breakdown by country, as you can see, a good breakdown by category of hydrocarbons with a fairly large share for LNG and liquid oil.</p>
          <p>Deep offshore, I think it's a good thing to be in deep offshore basically, because that's where we find not only our new barrels of oil, but also profitable barrels of oil. There has been all this debate which is after Macondo, whether it was &#x2013; whether that was too risky, there's been a big debate about that. But I think as far as we're concerned, <mark type="inaudible" /> I think that's represents about 12% of our production, little more in our reserves, about 15% in our reserves, deepwater oil, and that, I think, is a good balance. It's a good risk management and if we have to take more precautions, of course for deep offshore developments, it &#x2013; there is no question that we shouldn't continue in this sector with greater technology and more experience. 12 years of proven reserves, that's a little more than 12 and more than 20 years on probable reserves.</p>
          <p>Strong contribution from LNG. This is a specificity of this company, particularly this year there has been a big increase in upstream production from Yemen with the two trains, which are now fully ramped up and the ramp-up of Qatargas 2 and the contribution of the marketing and trading department of LNG, which makes it possible at the present time when there are major distortions between the three major markets, to use the trading department to redirect LNG into areas where it's likely to benefit from greater market opportunities, Europe and above all, whole Asia.</p>
          <p>What's important here is that not only this remains at 20% of our output, but it contributes 25% to the operated &#x2013; operating net &#x2013; the operating income. So, it is earnings enhancing compared to the average of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Downstream and Chemicals, we are pursuing our strategy of course to adapt our Downstream and Chemical business, not only to the markets, but also to the valuation of these operations. In refining, Dunkirk &#x2013; the refinery in Dunkirk of course has now closed and the plant is now being transformed. It took a little time. It wasn't easy. We made that commitment because we believed it was necessary to do so. Now it's done.</p>
          <p>Normandy, after deciding to reduce the refining capacity, now we have to invest and that is also a commitment on sites, which are long-term profitable sites. We have to make sure that they remain competitive, and that of course requires capital spending, but that capital spending is necessary.</p>
          <p>Port Arthur will start up production very soon. At the time when the coker margins are pretty good, and it's always good to start up an operation when the margins are good and I think this is a good project. And finally, again, our determination to adapt our refining capacity to requirements and consumption, we are selling the Lindsey refinery in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Marketing, TotalErg, that's the success of our cooperative strategy and partnerships, which is valid for all parts of the company. It's better to be with good partners than go it alone and we have good partners here. And we're continuing to adapt to market requirements by continuing to grow in large emerging markets. But on the other hand, when it's necessary, we are selling retail networks in countries like the U.K., which is going on at the moment, which has little profitability.</p>
          <p>Petrochemicals, we are continuing to develop there. We're continuing to commission capacity in our petro ethane business, which is very competitive even though with Samsung, we have &#x2013; we are able to be very effective on the Chinese market. Petro ethane is an integral part of our strategy. And then just a quick glance at research.</p>
          <p>The best way of finding the optimization of the best feedstocks for petrochemicals, we need to look at how we can produce polymers from ethanol, for instance, and even more upstream from coal and specialty chemicals, which has had record results in 2010. And that proves once again that we can make money in specialty chemicals and we are making money in specialty chemicals, even though the market environment is not yet absolutely fantastic, but that's thanks to the tremendously good work of our people in specialty chemicals who have done a great deal to make our units competitive in 28, 29 and we're drawing the benefits from that today. Just to dispel a rumor, apart from the disposal of Arkema there are no further projects for disposal in the pipeline in terms of specialty chemicals.</p>
          <p>European refining, here, of course, we are continuing to reduce our breakeven point. We want and we are determined to remain in &#x2013; in a sector which is important for the future but which must remain competitive. And that of course, requires some difficult decisions that we have to take occasionally and at the same time that enables us to prepare to benefit from good margins when they exist. We have $30 refining margins today. And at that level, with properly adapted refineries, it is a source of contribution to future earnings.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the page there, you have the impact of a strike in France, impact on our earnings, &#x20AC;130 million, which is a non-recurring charge. And I say this for Patrick because it's in the recurring income, but it's non-recurring. In fact, &#x20AC;100 million for refining and &#x20AC;30 million for petrochemicals. That's the effect of the strike in France.</p>
          <p>New energies, now. We are now moving on to what we said, to actually doing it in the three areas that we are focusing on as a matter of priority &#x2013; biomass, solar, and perhaps one day clean coal, when we shall find a way of dealing with the CO2 issue, and perhaps one day as well, nuclear. But for the time being, we are looking at areas where research is the priority. Our aim is to find solutions to produce new energies, which can be profitable, no subsidies. We don't believe in products which can be subsidized over their lifetime, especially when you are a company like Total. What we're interested in is finding products today that will remain competitive tomorrow in the major countries.</p>
          <p>And in solar powers, we have a lot of work to do. We are looking at thin film. We are looking at bio-fuels. We have a project which has been developed in Abu Dhabi, as you can see here, a large solar farm which when it's commissioned, will be the largest solar farm in the world. And again, this is an illustration of our partnership strategy. It's hardly a coincidence if it's in Abu Dhabi. Of course there is a lot more sun in Abu Dhabi than there is in France, but there is also oil in Abu Dhabi. And we are a long-term partnership of the Abu Dhabi authorities. So clearly, technology is a priority in these areas.</p>
          <p>What about the outlook? The medium term environment, I don't think I need to spend too much time on that because I think everyone knows how we feel about the medium term. We make distinction here between oil, gas and refining. In oil, first of all, we believe that oil demand will continue to increase 1% a year. Again, there can be arguments about this. Is it demand that drives the supply or supply that drives demand &#x2013; drive supply the other way around.</p>
          <p>We believe that it's both in a way, and that the output is likely to be 95 million barrels a day, but can't go much further than that. And if you add bio-mass, bio-fuels, <mark type="inaudible" /> and processing gains, we arrive at a figure which is &#x2013; which you are very familiar with, 100 million to 101 million of barrels per day. That's basically our figure and most of the energy majors find that figure is acceptable.</p>
          <p>So, what some people thought was unacceptably prudent as far as TOTAL is concerned, now you see that it's basically the consensus among the energy majors. And I hope we will be right about that.</p>
          <p>As far as gas is concerned, we've talked about Europe and Asia. What about the other market? Well, we're not really present in that market. So, it is less of an interest to us, but we do have a view-point on American gas, particularly on HH.</p>
          <p>We see a major increase in demand, oil demand has been flat for the past few years. Now, it's very difficult to say when it will actually take off again, given the uncertainties about the development of non-conventional gases.</p>
          <p>Refining with, once again, the need to close old capacity and a restructuring of the market on a gradual basis. There are quite a few closures of plants in the U.S., and I think this is basically good news as far as the market is concerned in terms of market adaptation.</p>
          <p>What are the major challenges for 2011 and 2012? Well, very clearly, the security and acceptability of our business, which will be starting 12 new projects and launching 12 new projects, capitalizing on our capacity to trade. We need to not shrink, but grow differently. Shrink for growth &#x2013; shrink for growth, is that the term, Robert? As far as we're concerned, it's growth for profit. We'll continue to adapt our refining capacity, as you know, and we shall continue to optimize our portfolio for growth.</p>
          <p>Start up of new projects in 2011-12, this is why in 2011, as you have seen and as you can see on this slide, 2010 and 2011 are at the same level. This is no scoop, I think. But don't forget the 4.3% increase in upstream production in 2010 and that will continue in 2011.</p>
          <p>So that's pretty stable, but good enough and then a big increase from 2012 onwards. And here you have all the projects on the right-hand side of the slide in a number of countries, which explain how we arrive at 270 million barrels more in 2011-2012.</p>
          <p>Capital spending up by up to $16 billion, that's necessary of course to support our future growth. So it would be up from $14.8 billion to $16 billion in 2011. This again, is a figure, which is necessary. You have the necessary investment on the right-hand side in a large number of projects, as you can see. But particularly on the hubs where we are already present or new hubs, when we are talking about Australia, Canada. And all this is on the basis of a base case of $80 per barrel with a sensitivity at $60 and $100. The sensitivity at $60, we know it, but it's also important to realize that we also are profitable at $100. And that's why we shouldn't make any mistake here by incorporating too much fixed margins into our projects.</p>
          <p>Total projects to be launched, these are FID decision, final investment decisions to be made. This is independent of the fact that they're already part of our portfolio with the conventional and non-conventional or deep offshore, heavy oils, unconventional gas and finally, LNG. All of these projects are well underway and the launches are well underway.</p>
          <p>One is a little more complicated than the others. I'll let you decide which it is. We'll see who finds the right answer, but I expect you will. Not that it's a launch that we want to abandon, far from it. I refer, of course, to Shtokman, where the FID will be before the end of March this year.</p>
          <p>Exploration budget up to $2.1 billion, up from $1.8 billion the previous year, and from $1.5 billion in 2006, so sharp increases. You see where we have various challenges, quite a few border line pits, quite a number of challenges ahead of us, be it in Guyana, Angola or elsewhere. For those of you who are interested, we've divided up the type of the pits by type of challenge, by type of geology. But importantly, we are involved in virtually all the various types of challenges known to the oil sector at present, which makes this a very challenging portfolio and makes 2011 a very important year for exploration.</p>
          <p>That said, by definition, this is very much part and parcel of the exploration business. Canada, we've chosen to focus on Total's new view of Canada. That's the revised version of our Canadian hub. In the field, we find that matters aren't always as easy as we might have thought, even though Canada is an OECD country.</p>
          <p>So, rather than a lengthy speech, take a look at the two charts on the right hand side, which show you what the situation was for Total before the Suncor partnership, that's on the top, our UTS. And the situation after the Suncor partnership, as it stands now.</p>
          <p>So more barrels in 2020, 70 million that's our share, with a better divide between Joslyn and Fort Hills and very importantly, a much faster ramp-up to the plateau.</p>
          <p>Well, first of all, a high level of production, higher level of production and of course, secondly, a partner who we feel is the right partner to reinforce our position even though we're not systematically operators in Canada. In Fort Hills, the operator will be Suncor, but in our other project, Joslyn, we will continue to be the operator.</p>
          <p>A new hub in Australia, of interest from two points of view, a partnership with Santos, who by definition has a very good knowledge of Australia, nothing surprising there. But most importantly, they are specialists in their field. So happens that this partner needed support, Petronas and EcoGas have rounded off the group. We feel that the group is now very well positioned to achieve new success in the GLNG, which is a new lease of life for us. Not something we were familiar with, but we hope to be able to continue to develop our know-how and just as importantly, to reap the benefits of Santos in order to be awarded other contracts in Australia.</p>
          <p>Just a word in passing by the way, exploration and production are looking for projects, even acquisitions of the &#x2013; even acquisitions of the third type. These are projects where the final investment decision is as close as possible to avoid too much capital not being used and to avoid too much production coming on-stream too late.</p>
          <p>Now this was also the case in Uganda. We've been very keen in seeking out acquisitions, not to just look at projects with production prospects well down the road.</p>
          <p>West Africa, now. West Africa continues to be the area where we find most new projects, be it in Nigeria, Angola, the Congo. All these projects being due to start up between 2012 and 2018 and we expect a very high level of production. First offshore operator in the West Africa, we should also be the foremost producer in Angola by &#x2013; well as soon as CLOV is on-stream since the production is on-stream at CLOV. So very good prospects.</p>
          <p>We're very interested in the first project on Block 32. Now the Congo has been rejuvenated with the development of Moho North.</p>
          <p>Bringing us now to the North Sea. This is one of our particularities by the way, very characteristic feature of Total. We have always believed that we should continue to develop in the North Sea, while most of our competitors withdrew from the North Sea too early, in my view, while we've continued to develop business in the North Sea. We have taken out new permits, we've worked from our existing hubs, Alwyn, Elgin and now Laggan Tormore.</p>
          <p>We've linked up new discoveries, existing or potential discoveries, and I think that's one of our great strengths going forward. We have very long-term projects where the return will be slow, but with some very high levels of cash flow, but also projects that are developing much more rapidly, with smaller reserves admittedly, but a much faster pay-back period.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side of the slide, you'll see that between 2014 and 2018, Total will become the biggest oil producer of the majors in the North Sea. Just as importantly, we're not decreasing our production. It's going to be a good intrinsically rather than better than the others.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the portfolio of new projects, which I'm not going to detail or itemize. You maybe ask &#x2013; you may wish to ask how much we invested last year, with a view to 2011 or 2012. Out of all the usual projects, some are more advanced than others. Some have been slightly delayed, but just as importantly, our commitment is to a renewal of 2% per annum. And may I say it again, it's not over 2009 to 2015. This is over the period 2010 to 2015.  Sensitivities are to be found on the bottom of the chart, on the left.</p>
          <p>Now downstream-chemicals, we made a commitment last year regarding downstream-chemicals, which I'll repeat &#x2013; that was to increase our profitability, the environment being unchanged by 4% over the period 2010-2015. We're now in the middle of the cycle. In fact, the middle of the cycle is actually the 2010.</p>
          <p>Now if we keep our promise, our return on average capital employed will be 13% in this sector, which diversifies our risk, which is I think something very attractive when it comes to valuing the company, to keep the group cleverly integrated, which I think is a much better thing to do than to have a single line or to be a monoline business.</p>
          <p>Marketing, this is one of the parts of the group that isn't spoken about often enough, but a part of the group that contributes considerably to our growth and to our profitability. But we need to keep on the move in the marketing. We need to keep adapting. But this is a fully-fledged business, one that we are very keen on.</p>
          <p>Chemicals, innovative chemicals, we are not just a green company but this is to tell you that we are also capable of being more efficient and also capable of being much more responsible in terms of global warming. Our goal is to produce from biomass, products of quality that is just as good as the products we get from naphtha or ethane, but products that will be intrinsically profitable. Now there are two ways of being profitable, either people accept to pay more for a cleaner product, or we reduce our costs sufficiently to make them competitive. Now, which costs <mark type="inaudible" />, our impression is that it will be a combination of those two factors.</p>
          <p>In all events, we can't have the same thing without paying that price. Now, we are gradually withdrawing from naphtha, as we have done with the ethane, but also methanol to olefin, or through bio-polymers.</p>
          <p>$20 billion invested in 2011. That's $21 billion if you take the extra million in the dotted line at the top here, which would come from acquisitions that have yet to be made. Actually there's between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion. Well, here is the additional billion that I referred to earlier on. $1 billion in chemicals, $3 billion in downstream. And as I told you earlier on, the bulk of our CapEx will be in the upstream sector, which accounts for 80% of our total CapEx. Though we will not cease to invest in other sectors of the business, other deserving sectors, particularly in Normandy where between 2012 and the years to come, we will be investing to bring this Normandy refinery up to market specifications.</p>
          <p>So we have increased financial flexibility. I'll stress this point. I simply want to stress that at $80 a barrel, we are as we were last year, at an average of $79.5. At $80 a barrel, the group is faring well. Obviously at $100 a barrel, we would fare better. Now, that may seem somewhat self-evident, but it's important to be able to show you that new products will be more profitable when the price of oil is $100. If it's just a matter of increasing prices at the pump, that would not make us more acceptable, nor would it improve our profits.</p>
          <p>So, we've shown you sensitivities here when we increased from $80 to $100 a barrel. The sensitivity is quite significant because $10 on the Brent price is an additional $2 billion in cash flow, additional cash flow that is, which means that if we were choose between $80 and $100, well we would stress the fact that $100 a barrel is not the figure that we've based our investments on, but a figure that we have to build into our future scenarios. I told you that at the end of 2010, our gearing was 22%. In 2011, very clearly, we will uphold our commitments and will remain within the range of 25% to 30% of equity.</p>
          <p>Though this may seem a little bit irritating to some, the 2010 dividend, as proposed by yesterday's Board of Directors for proposal to the AGM in May, dividend is unchanged at &#x20AC;2.28. This is the last time that our dividend will include an interim dividend, with the remainder paid in May. From the first &#x2013; third quarter of 2011, we will be making our first interim payment in September &#x2013; quarterly dividends that is.</p>
          <p>Just a brief reminder to conclude regarding safety, the priority or importance that can be placed on safety and reliability and social responsibility, profound change in each segment, especially after Macondo or Deepwater Horizon. We will continue to re-shuffle our portfolio, not to shrink, but to grow, but to grow better, should I say.</p>
          <p>More importantly, we will continue to expand our reserves bearing in mind that current prices, and even though we are doing everything we can to contain our costs, we get the feeling that technical costs are not going to fall.</p>
          <p>So it's important to be able to benefit from a good oil price in order to prepare our future, without in any way jeopardizing our demands in terms of financial policy.</p>
          <p>Final point here is consistency of capital discipline and policy in our decision making and a policy of a high return to shareholders. This year's payout, by the way, with the remainder being paid in 2011, payout ratio is 50% in euros and broadly speaking, 49% in dollars. So, identical or in line, should I say, with our average dividend or average payout goal.</p>
          <p>That's the end of my presentation. I'll now take any questions you care to raise, as well with the support of the members of the Executive Committee.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a good half hour for questions and answers. If you please raise your hand, not forgetting to introduce yourselves before asking your questions. We have two hostesses who'll bring microphones to your table.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Cheuvreux. I have several questions and my first question concerns your investments and indeed your CapEx budget, which is up substantially to $20 billion in 2011, given the fact that the various projects you are investing are very capital intensive. Can we expect your CapEx to increase to &#x20AC;25 billion or $25 billion in a few years' time? Can we expect that CapEx to increase to $25 billion in two or three year's time?</p>
          <p>My second question, if I may, concerns the increase in the cash breakeven point, if my calculations are correct, you did $70 a barrel to pay for investments in 2010, and of course dividends. Without re-leveraging, that is apparently up to $92 a barrel, certainly, above $90 a barrel in 2011. I was wondering if you could confirm that increased breakeven point?</p>
          <p>And one final question in terms of the return on capital employed. In the upstream, they were up 21% to $80 a barrel. Could you tell us about the capital employed that is not actually generating a return in 2010? In other words, what would be the adjusted ROACE on non-productive capital employed in that? And finally, at $80 a barrel, what would the ROACE be on your new investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question was about the CapEx budget. Well, our projects are capital intensive. There is nothing new about that. I said earlier-on how important it is to have a good combination of projects that have long-term production such as LNG, projects that will enable us to produce for periods of 25 years or more and then to have projects like <mark type="inaudible" /> and others, closer to all where we get production on-stream very rapidly within a year or year and a half. And we can start our production very rapidly. Certainly, the immediate profitability is much higher and it's a combination of these two that enables us to achieve our results, not just one. We need long-term projects. This is one of the reasons I've focused on LNG. Because for a long time LNG was deemed very capital intensive.</p>
          <p>LNG was felt to be a means of reducing our profitability, but I was convinced of the contrary. I'd stress the fact that when you can work with a view to the long-term, it's important to be able to &#x2013; even if the <mark type="inaudible" /> is affected, full enrichment is something that we can know. NPV, or net present value, is a good combination of these two. So it's profitability and value. This is the combination or the happy meeting we have to strike.</p>
          <p>So our CapEx policy is very disciplined, because we're still working on the assumption of $80 a barrel. All the new projects that we're starting up have a higher level of profitability than existing projects, on average, of course.</p>
          <p>Now, our CapEx budget is $21 billion, I don't know what the figure will be in two year's time, because that will depend on how matters develop. But undeniably, our investments are going to increase.</p>
          <p>Whence the need to make a number of divestments or disposals, particularly of less strategic assets for more recent assets such as the Cameroon, or Valhall, or Block 31. So these disposals will compensate the fact that we need to invest more if we are to maintain our profitability.</p>
          <p>As for the breakeven point &#x2013; for the cash breakeven in 2011, Patrick, the figure is? Can you confirm that? Microphone coming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the question on the cash breakeven depends whether you include disposals or not in your calculations, but the figure is between $80 and $90 in 2011. You also raised a question on non-productive capital employed. Would you like to answer that, Christophe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no go ahead. Go ahead. Let's see if you have the same figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The ROACE in the upstream was 21% in 2010. Just to give you the order of magnitude of non-productive capital, that was in the region of 25% to 30%. 25% to 30%, which includes downstream because in the downstream segment, we have the Jubail Project, which we've begun investing, but we have no quantities refined, but with the Norway Sea in the region 21%, that includes non-productive, I'd say 25% non-productive capital employed. Obviously the rest would be somewhat more &#x2013; more &#x2013; the return on the rest would be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not that I couldn't answer that question [foreign language] it's just that it &#x2013; I don't think this is a matter of figures. If the calculation is all about to deducting non-productive capital employed, okay it's 26% or 27%. But I don't know what that's going to give you and don't know how that would help you decide whether you should continue to invest or not.</p>
          <p>It's important to continue to invest in profitable projects. Projects that are more profitable than our existing projects. But, while continuing to have a strong balance sheet with debt/equity commitments, good gearing, and if we have all that and we do, then we'd be wrong not to invest. Okay. There is non-productive capital employed in a group, which is only natural. If we didn't have capital that wasn't employed, we would not achieve growth. So our strategy is a strategy of a profitable growth.</p>
          <p>What really matters is the way we work it and the prospects given the environment. This is why we've given you information on the sensitivity to &#x2013; for cash, for profitability, for an extra or plus or minus $10 a barrel. But we can't make any commitment as regards whether the barrel will be at $100 or $120 a barrel in a year or two year's time. But at $100 a barrel, we will continue to be profitable. That's the point I'm making.</p>
          <p>This is a discussion we had this morning at the press conference with the journalists. But $100 per se, is meaningless. It's important to have $100 a barrel with a margin. If we're at $100 or $120 a barrel in Iraq, well the impact will be 0.01% on our profitability.</p>
          <p>So it's important to know what it is we want. What we want is that our new project to harness a margin at $100 a barrel. So let me stress that, you have to bear that in mind to be sure that we're not making any mistakes in negotiating our contracts. That doesn't mean we're looking at $100 a barrel for the long-term. We are bullish, I think as everybody knows, about the long-term.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, we'd have to consider a less aggressive investment policy than ours currently is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on dividend policy, you have free cash flow, you have a gearing which is lower than your target range, and barrel is now at $100. What guidance can you give us? And Mr. Chevardi&#xE8;re has said, if you have a breakeven which is higher &#x2013; or lower than $100, higher than $80, lower than $100, what guidance can you give us about future dividends payments? That mean the payout is 50%, is which is your long-term goal.</p>
          <p>So how can you give us &#x2013; can you give us any guidance about your future dividend policy? Technical costs are mostly within the market range. You have a lot of projects being developed, a lot of amortization to come. How are you going to maintain those technical costs with the rise in amortization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the dividend policy, perhaps, I am going to disappoint you, but this is not Argentina, with forecasts of dividends over 10 years on the basis of inflation. No, our policy is very clear. The policy is priority to return to shareholders an average payout of 50%. If our earnings increase and if the outlook is good, there is no reason to consider that the dividend won't increase. But we have never, never in the past made any commitments about the mathematical formula by which you can calculate the dividend for next year. Now, as we are moving to a quarterly dividend payment, we will have to take a decision about the dividend linked to the first quarter of 2011. And that will be an initial answer to your question. But to tell you now exactly how much the dividend is going to increase by on the basis of the increase in cash flow, we've never done that and we're not going to start now.</p>
          <p>As far as technical costs and amortization is concerned, I think it is important to keep technical costs as low as we possibly can, because we do have a fairly aggressive investment policy, as you know. And it's important therefore, that those costs are contained. And it's important that projects remain on budget, as I've said on several occasions in the past.</p>
          <p>As far as amortization is concerned, of course, if you're going to invest more, you amortize more. But amortization is also cash flow, that's not a bad thing. When you're talking at $80 per barrel or $100 per barrel, if you have technical costs around $16 or $17 per barrel, I think there again it's perfectly acceptable. At the time, our technical costs were around $6 to $7 and the barrel of oil only cost $20, $25. So I think basically, we've done pretty well. And technical costs are also what they are, but it depends how many barrels you get out of your technical facilities. So it's important therefore, that we have proven reserves and that we make our probable reserves into proven reserves. That's how we can reduce our technical costs.</p>
          <p>And as far as E&amp;P is concerned, there is a real determination quite apart from being more aggressive on exploration. There is also a determination to be &#x2013; to ensure that the products are started up more quickly, so that we get cash flow out of the project and to reduce the time in which the capital is employed, but not producing any cash flow, which was an answer to the previous question. And that's a determination and a commitment that the E&amp;P has made to the board and that I convey to you. So we're basically under pressure on two counts there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bertrand Hod&#xE9;e from Kepler. I'd like to say a few more words about technical costs. You gave us fairly precise guidance last year in 2009, I think you said that your technical costs will probably be increased by $1 linked to amortization. Now for 2011, could you give us a figure or at least some guidance on these technical costs, how do you see them? How are you going to manage them? How far are they going to rise? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, could you perhaps tell us about the current transaction with <mark type="inaudible" />? And a third question, do you intend to launch &#x2013; because this is what you said at the Q3 results presentation, the Egina and Ofon 2 projects? So, three questions for Yves-Louis, basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our commitment about $1 increase for 2010, yeah, 15.8% to 16.6%, so that's $1.20, a 10% increase. Yves-Louis, any commitment for 2011 as far as technical costs are concerned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have stayed on budget and our commitments in terms of technical costs, we said $1 and it's $1.2 and that was because of the price effect on the production, which diminished production and therefore the denominator changed. If we had stuck to the original figures, we would have fully respected our commitment at $1. And of course, the amortization continued to increase, of course.</p>
          <p>Uganda, Uganda well, we hope to finalize the agreements fairly soon. We very much welcome the determination of the Ugandan authorities to be committed to the projects. They reasserted that recently. So I am confident that this will be finalized fairly soon. And there was a third question, wasn't there? What was the third question, could you repeat it, please? Oh, Egina and Ofon 2.</p>
          <p>Egina, I think that the FID will be taken this year. Compared to last year, we're a little behind the curve. We announced five FIDs for last year, and we took six. And Egina was initially a year &#x2013; a year and half ago. We wanted the FID towards the end of last year and we'll be a little &#x2013; a few months late. Ofon 2 &#x2013; Ofon 2 within the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ofon 2, perhaps I could say a couple of more words about that. Ofon 2 is a direct confidence &#x2013; a direct consequence of the fact of our local content. That's why it's taking a little &#x2013; little more than we thought. We want to respect our code of conduct on local content, and that's why it's taking a little longer because the negotiations are dragging on a bit.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dominique Patri from Cheuvreux. First question on CapEx. Now that Port Arthur coker has started up and Jubail is consolidated on the &#x2013; in the equity method, what in steady state do you think will be your investments in refining and chemicals? And doesn't that free up additional CapEx possibilities upstream?</p>
          <p>And then on exploration, you said that that you have a more aggressive strategy and you're in frontier areas. What are your best prospects in 2011? And what are you main targets for 2011 in exploration? Ichthys, third question, given the prices you got on Gladstone for your LNG sales, both in terms of prices and in terms of FID and project profitability, how has Ichthys been looking in those respects recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the last two questions. On investments in the sectors &#x2013; in the segments, yes, Port Arthur is starting up, that's good. In Jubail, yes, consolidated by the equity method, but that doesn't mean that there is no investment. Clearly, it's not quite as much as it would be if there was a major project, but there is nevertheless CapEx in Jubail. In the same way as in petrochemicals we have a number of ambitions, both to find new projects in Qatar on ethane, as well as developing Samsung in the best possible conditions. So I can't give you precise figures, but we are continuing to invest in petrochemicals, and therefore, we are continuing to grow.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, compared to upstream investments, these investments seem to be fairly low, especially they're always consolidated by the equity methods. So therefore, that reduces the impact compared to E&amp;P projects, which are always fully consolidated or usually fully consolidated. So the impact is greater. What CapEx will there be in chemicals, we'll see.</p>
          <p>Basically, we're in the process of increasing, as I said, investments in E&amp;P, 60% of capacity is going to move up to 70%, 75%, so refining, marketing and petrochemicals, the other segments basically 50-50 on the rest. But to give you the precise figures or the precise percentages in terms of CapEx, it's very much based on opportunities unless we develop a new cracker in Qatar, for instance. The priority, once again, remains upstream and year-after-year, that will continue to account for the major portion of our CapEx.</p>

          <p>No, Port Arthur is a little special because we have a 100% stake, no leverage and therefore, it looks very big because it's a $2 billion project. The other projects in refining and &#x2013; independently of maintaining our refining capacity at a competitive level, I mean, we still have to invest quite considerably. How much does it cost to maintain our refining capacity at a competitive rate? &#x20AC;700 million to &#x20AC;800 million a year, isn't it?</p>
          <p>Yes, is the answer. Don't forget that in refining CapEx, you also have the cost of the major shutdowns. Every five years you have to shut down a refinery to open it up and do basic maintenance. That's absolutely necessary to keep it safe and efficient. And of course, in the historic investments, it's not quite as much as the latest projects. But it's &#x20AC;300 million to &#x20AC;400 million every year spent on scheduled shutdowns, unless of course you shut down the whole thing for good.</p>
          <p>And then there &#x2013; performance CapEx, as we call it, and CapEx without a payout linked to regulatory changes, particularly environmental regulations. All in all, Christophe de Margerie's figure is correct that &#x20AC;700 million to &#x20AC;800 million per year, but sometimes it's less, sometimes it's more, according to whether you have major projects like desulfurization facilities for instance. And putting in a desulfuration facility is big money. And you have to do that every time regulations change, and they tend to change in the sense of being tightened up.</p>
          <p>On the other questions, on exploration and on the major issues for 2011, you have the answer in a slide that you were shown earlier on, the 21 projects for 2011 according to their geological make-up with some new ones, the pre-salt, the abrupt margins, but also the continuation of things that we are more familiar with like deltas or foot drills.</p>
          <p>And in terms of countries, we have a continuation of our projects in Brazil, pre-salt, French Guyana, abrupt margins, Brunei is another project, where we are in a delta. It's a normal delta, but it's deep offshore. You have the list there, and in terms of breakdown as far as the CapEx budget is concerned, you have the breakdown on that same slide. We're going to spend a little more than 33%, 35% in Africa, 25% basically in the Americas &#x2013; in Asia, I beg your pardon, and more or less 20% in Asia Pacific and Europe including Continental Europe. And then we have the Apsheron share in Azerbaijan.</p>
          <p>As far as the LNG profitability is concerned, that very much depends on the content of liquids. Ichthys is a project where we have a lot of liquids, whereas Gladstone is a project where we have seam gas, as they call it in Australia. And therefore, it's not liquid. So Ichthys requires a lot more investment, because it's a very capital intensive project. But Ichthys has a profitability, which is in the top of the range of our LNG projects.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm from Natixis and I have four questions. At last year's meeting, you gave us an organic CapEx budget of $18 billion, yet the figure was $15.8 billion. How do you explain that variance? And is there any chance of that happening again in 2011, counter intuitively of course?</p>
          <p>My second question on the chart &#x2013; on the lowering of the breakeven point in refining, you have included CEPSA. Could you tell us what your plans are for CEPSA?</p>
          <p>After those two technical questions, there is an exceptional depreciation of 1.4 billion. Is there a unit you've written off? Could you tell us more about that exceptional depreciation? And of course the replacement rate of reserves, what happens if you factor out acquisitions and disposals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, concerning investments, it's only very rarely that we invest less than anticipated. Some people's minds, that's good news. That's probably why we have a gearing of 22% rather than the 25% most of us would have expected. It wasn't due to the turnarounds or the &#x2013; any eagerness not to invest. This is just the way things pan out over time. So these are investments we will be making.</p>
          <p>Now, our goal is not to have this happen again. We don't want to announce a budget and then invest less. We want to invest what we plan to invest. But that said, we are not alone. There are a number of major projects that have been slightly delayed or somewhat postponed and projects that have, if anything, reduced the CapEx in a given year.</p>
          <p>Now we have at times hesitated about whether or not we should include figures delayed into 2011. But we felt that would not be a good idea. Then we'd have to review these investments on a case-by-case basis, what's due to delays, what's due to new projects.</p>
          <p>But undeniably in 2011, we have some of the carryover from 2010. That's perfectly clear. But do we factor in delays? Yes. But that's built into the budget. So the figure we propose includes our vision of what projects we'll need to spend in the course of the year, including the carryover from 2010 amounts that were not invested, despite expectations.</p>
          <p>However, we do not expect a lower figure than the one we announced a month ago. So we are, at this point in time, perfectly in line with our forecast. Maybe I should also remind you that we are much closer to $18 billion than $15.8 billion. So, thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain why we have increased our CapEx in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now taking your questions in order. Your second question was about CEPSA. Well CEPSA &#x2013; between IPIC Abu Dhabi and ourselves, there's a 50-50 venture. I think they have some 4% in minority interests.</p>
          <p>So with IPIC, we are reviewing the situation. But at this point in time, we have no announcement to make. This brings me to the rate of replacement of reserves. Was that your third question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very briefly, 124% replacement rate is the figure that includes acquisitions. Well, acquisitions are reserves. If we account this in our investments, but not in reserves, then I would understand. So the real figure is 124%. If we take acquisitions out, all things being equal, the replacement rate would be 95%. But the real figure is 124%, that's the real replacement rate. Was there a final question? Do I remember correctly?</p>
          <p>Yes. Well, part was due to the planned disposal of the Lindsey Refinery in the U.K. And the remainder concerns a number of refineries mainly situated in France. Now we're not going to give you the breakdown, but 1.2 billion is the figure, but at 5.6 billion group share, that's non-adjusted group share, this includes the 1.2 billion write-off that you identified.</p>
          <p>We have gone from 5.3 billion to 5.6 billion, but that what we will call exceptional provision. And of course, with capital gains from disposals and of course the situation of Shtokman. They all give us that final figure.</p>
          <p>One last question, possibly. Yes, we do have one last question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Dominique Patri from Cheuvreux again. I'd like to come back to one of the slides. This is the slide on page 18, where we see the impact of &#x2013; in 2013, of the start-ups scheduled for 2011 and 2012. I'd be curious to know if there isn't a message behind that slide. You told us that from 2012 onwards, production would be growing again. But if we look at that slide, the difference in contribution in 2013 is not that much higher than in 2012. So, how do you justify the fact that we can expect a growth phase from &#x2013; that's production growth, of course, from 2011 or 2012 onwards? I think the difference between 2012, 2013 is only 30,000 barrels a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the message is very clear, but I've no problem restating it. In 2010, the factoring out the price effect, the increase &#x2013; the net increase was 4%. And 2011 will be flat, because the projects are being phased in in the later part of the year. So, if anything in 2012, the increase will be substantial in 2012, maybe not as sharp in 2013. This is why we're talking about an average production growth of 2% between 2010 and 2015. That doesn't mean we'll have the same percentage growth every year. So 2012 might be stronger growth than 2013, and 2013 mightn't be as high as 2014. I'm not sure I understand your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. My question was the 5% figure that you've given us in the past, 5% decline rate, which is about 80,000 barrels a day. On the slide we see production growth of 30,000 barrels a day. My question was quite simply, in 2013, are we at least stabilizing production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the question underpinning all that is that, over the period production will not decline, but our times in production may be higher or lower. 2012 will be better than 2011 and 2014 will be better than 2013. Again, we can talk about that next year, but there is no message telling you that be careful, the annual rate of decline is changing, it's lower this year than we expected, which if anything is good news. But no, there is no subliminal message about production declining in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in 2013, there is no decrease, but in your 2010-2015 plans, you are still looking at 5% growth, average annual growth &#x2013; 5% decline, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify that, on the graph the contribution of production between 2011 and 2013 does not include the contribution of production in &#x2013; of new projects that will be on stream in 2013.</p>
          <p>I preferred my own answer, but yours is quite good too. Otherwise, we are going to be asked, "Well, what are your projects for 2013?" At least, that's what we will be asked next year.</p>
          <p>Let me just stress the fact that our commitment is 2% production growth on average. That's the important figure. Otherwise, if we are expanding yo-yo effects every year, well we know the production isn't stable year-on-year. All it takes is a postponement or a delay of several months to considerably change that production figure. That said, I think the Head of Financial Communications has given you a very good answer.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
