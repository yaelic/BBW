        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H&amp;M Six-Month Report Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode until we conduct the question-and answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Nils Vinge. Please begin your meeting, and I'll be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's six-month results. The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, is with me today, and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide Second Quarter 2011. H&amp;M performed well in the second quarter. We took market shares and increased sales, including VAT, by 12% in local currencies. We grew sales in comparable units by 2% in a challenging market. In several countries, retail trade was characterized by restrained consumption and many price campaigns and special offers. Converted into SEK, net sales increased 2% to SEK 27.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Within the quarter, calendar effects and weather conditions affected the monthly sales development. To start with, March and that's a very strong comparable month that included most of Easter holiday last year. This year, on the other hand, the entire Easter break came in April. At the same time, unseasonable warm weather arrived in April that gave an extra proof to the shopping of spring and summer garments. That caused some pull forward of sales into April from May.</p>
          <p>Looking at the sales in our markets, please turn to the slide Sales Per Market. Sales were strong into the U.S., China, and Russia, all important growth markets for H&amp;M. And our large European markets, Germany, the UK and France, all performed very well and so did Poland. Switzerland and Norway meanwhile were weaker. In Japan, sales were, of course, affected after the earthquake and tsunami in March.</p>
          <p>Going back to the second quarter, please return to the slide Second Quarter 2011. In the sourcing markets, conditions remained tough at the time of the purchases for the second quarter. Input costs escalated with dramatically higher cotton prices, tighter capacity at the suppliers, and higher transportation costs.</p>
          <p>Just to illustrate, if you turn to the chart Cotton Prices for a moment, you can see how prices rallied before they peaked earlier this spring. In addition, there was a bit of a negative effect from the U.S. dollar compared to last year. That left us with a gross profit of SEK 17.1 billion in the quarter corresponding to a gross margin of 61.7%, down from historically high comparable of 65.9%.</p>
          <p>Like we emphasized at this conference a year ago, input costs for the second quarter 2010 benefited from strongly favorable sourcing condition. We also said already then that the external factors were starting to turn against us.</p>
          <p>Comparison between the years is also affected by our old currency hedging policy, which had a positive effect of 50 basis points in Q2 2010. The effect year-on-year will disappear in Q3.</p>
          <p>Markdowns in relation to sales in the second quarter were at the same level as the year before. And thus the effect on the gross margin was neutral year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Like in the first quarter this year, it shows not to pass on the increased input cost to our customers. Instead, we strengthened our price position in order to further strengthen H&amp;M's position in the long term. That, of course, contributed to the decline in the gross margin. Still, a second quarter gross margin of 61.7% is very good seen over time, as you can see if you turn to the slide Gross Margin.</p>
          <p>Looking at costs, H&amp;M has a very good cost control within the group. SG&amp;A was SEK 11.5 billion in the quarter, an increase of 6% in SEK and 14% in local currencies. That increase is explained by the expansion, as well as the provision of SEK 248 million for our new incentive program for all H&amp;M employees.</p>
          <p>Spending in marketing, IT and online was also higher. These investments are important as we do them to strengthen the H&amp;M brand further and to create an even better platform for profitable growth long term.</p>
          <p>The operating margin was 20.3%, a strong performance particularly given the circumstances and still high from an historical perspective and definitely compared to the industry, in general.</p>
          <p>Net financial items were SEK 153 million compared to SEK 75 million and profit after financial items was SEK 5.8 billion compared to SEK 7 billion a year ago. The strong development of the Swedish krona, of course, played a significant part in the decline in reporting number. Estimated tax rate for the quarter was 26% and net profit was SEK 4.3 billion, corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 2.57.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M continued its store and online expansions in the second quarter. We opened 85 stores net in the quarter and had a total of 2,297 stores in 40 countries at the end of May, franchise and our other brands included.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we plan to open around 250 stores net, which is in line with our target of 10% to 15% more stores per year. We plan to open stores in all our markets and we'll open in new countries as well. We are, for example, looking forward to the first H&amp;M store in Southeast Asia that will open in Singapore this autumn.</p>
          <p>We also see great opportunities for our other brands, COS, Monki, Weekday, Cheap Monday and H&amp;M Home. COS had a very successful start in Sweden in May and is now available to customers in nine European countries with a total of around 40 stores. Those were a few comments on our expansion.</p>
          <p>And now, looking at some key figures for Q2, please turn to the slide Key Data. Stock-in-trade was SEK 10.4 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the same time last year and 28% in local currencies. The increase is explained by the expansion, but should also be seen in the light of last year's historically low level and the fact that sales in May did not increase as much as planned. The stock-in-trade was well balanced.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the next slide, in relations to sales, the stock-in-trade was 9.6% rolling 12 months, compared to low 8.3% last year and still at a good level historically. Cash flow from current operations was SEK 8.5 billion, which is down from the second quarter last year. During the quarter, we invested SEK 2.1 billion, mainly in new stores, but also in logistics and IT. Our new distribution center in Belgium is up and running and we have also completed the extension of our warehouse in Poznan, in Poland.</p>
          <p>Our investment plan for the year remains unchanged, which means an increase of around 20% in local currencies. Meanwhile, our finances remain strong. Liquid funds and short-term investments amounted to SEK 15.2 billion after payment of SEK 15.7 billion in dividend to shareholders. Return on equity was 47.4% rolling 12 months.</p>
          <p>Looking at the rest of the year, like we have said, our expansion is set to continue according to plan. We also have strong collections for the autumn season. And we have a new designer collaboration, Versace for H&amp;M, that will be launched in November in around 300 stores in all H&amp;M markets and online.</p>
          <p>Versace is one of the greatest fashion houses of modern times. It is a legendary luxury brand. And the reaction from customers and media has been fantastic since we released the news yesterday. The collection interprets the very best of Versace iconic designs with glamorous pieces for women and men in exclusive materials and at fantastic H&amp;M prices. The collaboration also includes selected interior design pieces. And in January of next year, a pre-spring collection for women and men will follow exclusively for online.</p>
          <p>Moving over to look at conditions in the sourcing and consumer markets, the overall picture shows that times are demanding for our industry. We are, however, optimistic about the future for H&amp;M. We are in 40 countries today, and we have a strong market position. We have a business concept that works well globally. We see great opportunities for H&amp;M to continue expanding in existing and new markets and to grow with quality and high profitability for many years to come.</p>
          <p>We are now happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain from BoA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, guys. It's Richard Chamberlain here from BofA Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Just a question to start with, please, on operating costs. You obviously have a very difficult like-for-like sales comparison in the third quarter. So I guess like-for-like is highly likely to be pretty negative. I just wondered if you can talk about how you're adjusting your cost base for the third quarter. And then maybe comment on your flexibility to adapt to the weaker demand level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When it comes to the operating costs, of course, we are always working on a daily basis, on a weekly basis with the hours in the stores, et cetera. And during this second quarter, the increase in local currencies, excluding the incentive program, the provision of SEK 248 million, the increase is 12%. And on comparable stores during Q2, we even got a better relation to sales. So we are always working with the operating expense and what the level will be in Q3 that we don't know yet, because it's also depending on the top line. But we have a good cost control and we are confident that we will also have it in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. And just another one from me, please, if I may, on pricing. I was just intrigued by your comment in the release. I think you said you chose to strengthen your price position in order to build further on your strong market position. And I just wondered if that pricing was done more on a relative basis compared to the first quarter and whether the pricing within certain markets are across the group worldwide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was across the group and we did not pass on the increased input cost to the consumers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I just wondered on a &#x2013; how you &#x2013; I know you said &#x2013; was it bit of a tentative subject, but how you sort of rate your relative pricing position now as opposed to, say, the first quarter and then last year following these price actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's even stronger as a result of our strategy because as you know, a lot of our peers and competitors have started to raise prices, even though a lot of that probably have been offset by more intense price activities and markdowns in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then going forward, I mean, has that more intense promotional activity by competitors changed your view on whether you should be investing more in price going forward or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, Richard, we do not comment on our price strategy ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought I'd give it another go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But let me put it this way in that the customers should always make the &#x2013; find the best offering at H&amp;M in all markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure. All right, I'll leave you there. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question comes from the line of Karen Howland [Barclays Capital]. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I was wondering if I could ask maybe the last question in a slightly different way. Do you feel the investments that you've made throughout the course of this year &#x2013; have you positioned appropriately versus your competitors or do you think you need some additional investments to continue to improve your price positioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, we are not commenting on our price moving forward, part of what I just said. But I mean this is a moving target and we always would strive to improve our customer offering to the customers whether that means investing or not and exactly in detail what it means, we will not be going to in detail. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Robert Miller [Redburn Partners]. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talk about some of the pressures in the supply chain at industry level and I wonder whether you can give us some sort of directional thoughts on how those industry pressures are playing out now and in the near term. So, you talk about cost inflation in sourcing markets, capacity and the supply chain and transportation costs. Could you comment on what you think the industry trends are in those areas over the coming months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I could, of course. In general, and I usually say that there are maybe 25 different factors that affect our gross margin, as you know, but we've chosen to bring up some of the most important in the last quarters, of course, and probably they will remain very important going forward. So if you look at some of them, capacity as you mentioned, it's not a secret that during the autumn, it was very difficult. And we've been saying that from &#x2013; throughout this year that capacity has started to improve and that remains the same. But going forward, I know as little as you do, of course, how that will develop. But if you look at the situation today compared to the autumn, it definitely looks better from a capacity perspective.</p>
          <p>And other things we comment on is, of course, the dollar. For us, as you know, the dollar is the most important sourcing currency and we still, in Q1 and Q2, we still see negative effects from &#x2013; the time when we placed those orders, especially the dollar-euro effect was negative. But that has step by step improved and today when we place orders, the dollar-euro is actually on a year-to-year basis &#x2013; year-over-year basis, it's positive going forward. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the current exchange rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So that's &#x2013; and there are a lot of others &#x2013; factors, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in overall, we can conclude that the tough situation is still apparent in the sourcing chain. So it's still a very tough environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you think is the ripple effect of rising costs and wage rates in China, in other regions of Asia? Because clearly a lot of companies are trying to migrate to new low or lower sources of products and that's having an impact on demands on their capacity. What was happening in places like Vietnam, Cambodia, et cetera, which seem to be quite visible in your ranges right now? Are the same pressures rippling into those areas, as we're seeing in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's related to again, to the supply and demand and of course, the economic development in each country. So it varies. But just to give you one example, when we entered &#x2013; Bangladesh, for example, is an important sourcing country for many companies, including H&amp;M. And we've been there for more than 20 years. And at that time, there were not very many suppliers. But today, there are thousands of suppliers. So I think it's very good for these economies that the textile industry places orders in those countries. And when it comes to China, it still remains a very important sourcing country for us, with roughly a third of sourcing, and that hasn't changed really.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Nicklas Fh&#xE4;rm. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. SEB Enskilda. I just like to follow up from my previous questions on sourcing actually. Would it be fair assumptions to say that out of the &#x2013; included in the sort of 4 percentage point gross margin development year-on-year, there is a sequentially deteriorating impact from higher manufacturing costs or cost of goods really in this quarter compared to the last quarter? And would I also read you right if you're saying that you expect that to sequentially increase also in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's very difficult to give you a sequential direction here because we don't really plan on a quarterly basis. I think I summarized it whether it's been very challenging and the factors you've seen in Q1 and Q2. And it remains, as Jyrki said, challenging going forward as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really difficult to have an aggregate because, as Nils said, it's a lot of different components affecting the purchase prices and we choose to list up some of those and as Nils said just in the previous question, get through those components separately, but to have really an aggregate picture. But as in the previous answer, it's still a tough situation when it comes to the sourcing. It's clearly higher levels than one year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. But still though, would it be fair to say that out of those 25 items affecting the gross margin development in this quarter year-on-year, cost of goods would be the more important one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost of goods, you mean the FOB price that we pay to the supplier though?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Would that be the most, sort of the most important factor that has contributed to the gross margin development in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I've got a question on online. It was launched in the UK back in September and UK sales have been very strong for you since then. I just wondered how much of that could be explained by the online launch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. We are very happy with the online launch and we are very happy with the development in the UK. And we take market shares and our customer &#x2013; the customer seems to appreciate what we do. So it includes the stores and the online.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you launched online in the UK to date, what would be sort of your equivalent expansion in stores? Is it worth one store or two stores, three stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer for competitive reasons not to quantify the different channels for us. It's the total package and the channels are very integrated, it doesn't give you much information specifying they're different. But I'd like to add to what I said before that we also &#x2013; we have a very strong team in place. And we see good development in the UK and we add a lot of new stores. Last year, the UK was actually the largest expansion country for H&amp;M.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then just one more, please, on the stock-in-trade of 22%. The sales was flat in H1, should we assume higher markdowns in Q3 would be likely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Anne. Yeah, it's far too early to say anything about the Q3 markdowns because we had just three weeks of this third quarter behind us and still nine weeks to go. So as we state, we estimate &#x2013; we think the stock-in-trade is well composed and on satisfying level. So it's too early. So we have to come back to that in connection with the Q3 report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The stock-in-trade does seem very high relative to sales. I mean, both of those figures would be in krona.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, that's correct. But as we always have been saying the past quarters, it's a snapshot of the stock-in-trade for a certain moment in time in this case and May, and it really can vary quite substantially within one or two weeks. So, for us the stock-in-trade is on a satisfying level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions, please. Firstly, after the 91 stores that were opened in the first half, how many of them were the H&amp;M flagship versus the other smaller flagships in the group, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of them were H&amp;M.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of them sort of being 85, something like that or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the exact figure. We'll come back to that, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you confirm the sort of average size of the smaller stores? I mean, I think they're significantly smaller than the typical <mark type="ph" /> Domiat (25:54), right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they are smaller definitely...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:01) because they vary from country to country, but if you take a COS store, the one at Regent Street is I think 450 square meters or something like that. And that's I think between 400 and 500 square meters is the average. We just opened the first COS store in Stockholm by the way, which has been a huge success exceeding our high expectation. So we are very happy for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. And finally, I think you mentioned in the first quarter conference call <mark type="audio gap" /> (26:31) some of the newer markets like China were lower than group average. And I think you also said that that was the case for the U.S. Can you give us any sort of quantification as to the different levels of sales entities, for example, in China versus group average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I was referring to was considering per store in turnover, but that doesn't necessarily correlate to profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the sales don't achieve themselves in these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still a bit lower, but again, nothing to worry about and the direction is very good. As we say, we have a strong sales <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:10) in both of those countries. Coming back to your question, we opened four COS stores and one Monki. So the rest &#x2013; sorry, we closed one Monki store, so the rest is H&amp;M.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gents. Sorry, afternoon. Could you just talk a little bit more about what you said about the competitive activity? It sounded a bit in the first quarter as though you were a bit surprised that the competitors haven't passed on higher input costs.</p>
          <p>In 2Q, are you seeing higher input costs being offset by higher levels of discounts? So do you think that kind of &#x2013; the input price pressure is slowly coming through albeit being offset, or do you see more people kind of following your model and essentially just not pushing prices up to the same degree?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's difficult to give a total picture of &#x2013; because I think there is a lot of differences between different companies and different markets. But we definitely see that companies are putting up prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So would you expect to get more leverage from your price position as we go through the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's up to you to analyze.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I just do a follow-up on online, I mean obviously, that world is moving faster, you've committed to the U.S.? Will there be other online launches in the foreseeable future that &#x2013; in the next kind of 12 months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had said that and we are happy with the online development and we plan to roll it out in the rest of the group. But we take it step by step and we want to do it with quality. We just opened and launched it in the UK, as you know, in the fall last year, and we're happy with that. And we're about to roll it out in &#x2013; we started in the U.S., which of course is being the largest online market in the world, it's very exciting, but we want to do it with quality. But we will come back to you when we have more news to report about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, I think &#x2013; or the last country within a few days or something, but I think at the end of the month all countries should have the new platform.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a sort of question about your buying process, what proportion roughly in a typical season do you buy and see &#x2013; sorry, in a typical quarter would you buy within the quarter? So when we're thinking about the third quarter coming up, how much have you already bought for the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good question, Fraser. As you know that we don't go into that for competitive reasons. I'm very sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But majority line, you buy ahead of the season, right? You have a long lead time business, isn't that fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's all about finding &#x2013; looking at each product and how long lead time that &#x2013; now if it's &#x2013; some products are very quick and some can have longer lead times. So I don't want to give you a percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It differs really a lot that we have lead times to just a couple of weeks and then we have, of course, longer lead times as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So proportionally that might change between the quarters, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could change, Fraser.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When you think about the quarter ahead, is currency going to be a negative or a positive from a buying perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Q3, it's still going to be a negative as it looks today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And then, if I may ask one more question. When you look at the third quarter last year, you had already begun to make "increased investments in a further improved customer offering."</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have your commercial policy particularly changed since the third quarter last year or are you just going to sort of annualize that same policy as we go into the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'm trying to understand where you're heading. We were very open last year that we did a lot of investments in the customer offering. And of course, we had a lot of positive external factors with us at that time. Those were annualized at the beginning of this year and now we are back to business as usual, so to speak, which means that we worked with continuous improvements, but not necessarily investing the same way as we did last year. So that's the best answer I can give.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at your pricing strategy that we've spent so much time talking about on the call. Has it been the same across all your major markets or have you done different things in different markets and has there been anything you've learned from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the pricing strategy, which is always to offer the best custom offer on each markets. This pricing strategy is the same on each market, more or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly more or less because of course there is some variation...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the basic concept when it comes to pricing, that is the same for all markets, to always have the best custom offer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And have you been surprised by any market in terms of the elasticity being higher than others? Any markets particularly receptive?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, life is always a lot of surprises right now. And we seriously, we try to learn from everything. And we see that, of course, some markets respond better than others, but that will always be the case. But in the figures, you have all the developments per country and some do very well and some do not <mark type="ph" /> have done as well (33:36). Yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just this one last one looking at the third quarter last year, does the 11% like-for-like that you achieved last year, does that make your knees tremble in terms of what we're seeing at the moment? Or was it more a function of problems that you had two years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, of course, it's a respectable number that we are facing. But our strategy is always to plan for a positive like-for-like. And if we could do it last year, hopefully we can do it again and hopefully we have learned something that we could improve even further from last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Nils, sorry to go on about list pricing yet again. My question was more in terms of &#x2013; you're saying that all of your competitor or most of your competitors are raising prices and it's clear the reasons why they're doing so, yet you're holding prices and having already invested in them.</p>
          <p>Is that because you believe that some of the pressures that you've faced on the gross margin are temporary? Or is it some admission that maybe your margins went too high in the last 18 months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's simply due to, that we are really looking into each market to have the best custom offering. And that's the reason; we are not steering our business base from a gross margin. It's the result of having the best custom offer. And we think that the payoff that we see in the second quarter with the increase in local currencies by 12% than in comparable stores by 2% in a really tough environment in the retail business, I think that's a proof that the pricing strategy that we have done is paying off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the way that you would want to be judged on that is on a like-for-like performance relative to the market. I mean, at what level would you then admit that it's not working or maybe, if it's working so well, maybe you'd do even more of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, it's always relative with the market because if it's really tough environment, of course, then it's affecting the whole industry. And if we are able to take market share, so then we are really &#x2013; how we see it, we are succeeding in our strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It means that the customers appreciate what we do. If the customers appreciate, we are happy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's always important to remember, these measures and these decisions that we have done in Q1 and Q2, it's also really on a long-term perspective to strengthen our market position in long term as well.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. I noticed on the &#x2013; I think it came out of your press conference earlier today. I believe the CEO mentioned that he is planning for positive like-for-likes in the second half of this year despite the pretty tough like-for-likes here off of &#x2013; as a comparison. Is that a target? Is that a goal to point that you'll be investing in order to achieve that or is that kind of the status quo that you always say, of course, we always plan for positive like-for-likes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always plan for it, as you know, because if you don't plan for it, you will never be able to reach it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's really a lot of &#x2013; connected to how we'll plan our purchases. If we don't plan our purchases to be able to perform a like-for-like, then we will of course not succeed, if we don't plan it in our purchases. So that's the content of what we are saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the inventory that you have purchased and are planning to purchase for the year, for this upcoming quarter would imply a positive like-for-like in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we buy continuously. So we have a plan and then perhaps we won't reach in every month, whatever. But we have a model that can adapt to that. I think we've proven that throughout the years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are not &#x2013; we, of course, are looking on a seasonal level and planning our buyings on a seasonal level. So that's what we are saying when saying that we are always planning for like-for-like figures. But what we mean is that we are planning the purchases to be able to deliver like-for-like sales. But, as Nils said, that hopefully we will succeed it with our strategy and our efforts. But if we don't plan it, then it will be really tough to succeed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if I could ask one other question. I know you typically don't comment on your pricing strategy going forward. However last year at this time, you were quite clear about the fact that you felt you needed to invest in product-price in order to improve your overall customer proposition. So I'm wondering why won't you continue to comment on that when obviously last year it wasn't a problem making those forward-looking comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I should clarify again. We took the decision. It wasn't that we felt that we were not happy with the price positioning or whatever. We had a very good price positioning already before that, but we saw opportunities to invest even further to strengthen the price position even further, which we succeeded with and I'm very happy that we did it. But this is a very long-term strategy of H&amp;M to always try to improve our custom offering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, the investments that you've been making over the past year were perhaps not extraordinary, but larger than normal whereas we're now back to more of a status quo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say status quo. I would say business as usual, which means that we continue to strive for improvement. But it's correct that last year we did more than normally. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Thanks. Just couple of quick follow-ups, please. I'm just wondering if you can just give an update on the exact timing of the proposed launch in the U.S. online. I presume that's coming before the Versace's pre-spring collection.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. During the spring of next year, okay. And the extension of the warehouse in Poland, has all that cost now been incurred? And maybe you can maybe give a little bit more color on why you did that extension, was that just to serve existing markets better or was that for online or what?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Poland the extension is ready. And why we did it is, of course, to be able to increase our business and the main extension was relating to the online.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just a quick question on Japan. I know it's a small market for you, but I was wondering what the monthly evolution was like during Q2, if you saw an improvement around the end of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Japan, of course, is very tragic, the tsunami and the earthquake. And we, as you see from our figures, we are, of course, affected. But business is not back to normal again, and we don't know how long it's going to take. But long term, I think Japan has a very important and interesting opportunity, of course. And we see a lot of opportunities to add, to open new stores. But right now, it's still very tough.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yeah. Just wanted to come back to the comments around price investments again. Just to be clear, I think in answer to my question you said, you saw an opportunity to invest in prices last summer or in the third quarter last year. But that came to an end at the beginning of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did start to communicate and we wanted to make even further investments, improve the custom offering even further. We started to communicate that in connection to Q4 '09. So that was in January &#x2013; last year we started to communicate that. And we've communicated that throughout the year, so that was anniversaried <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:05).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You didn't communicate it in the Q1 or Q2 release. You did communicate it quite aggressively in the Q3 release. Just wondering if something changed through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did communicate it, but it didn't really &#x2013; it wasn't really noticed so much until Q3 because gross margins were still increasing in Q1 and Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there was investment in both Q1 and Q2 albeit it wasn't mentioned in the gross margin commentary at all.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just tell us, is the shortfall in May sales, which I think you pretty much clarify with regard to your stock holding, was that caused by the pull-forward effect from April with a late Easter and a better trading environment or is that net of that effect, i.e. May is still coming in underlying lower than you would have anticipated? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I would like to clarify that we still did 12% increase in local currencies in May and 2% like-for-like, which is good, given the circumstances. But we admit that we plan to increase even more. But yes, our conclusion is that there was some pull forward from the very strong April figure. So a lot of customers chose to buy their spring garments in April rather than May.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Can you tell us what is the lead time on your OpEx sort of in view of the fact that you're budgeting positive like-for-like in the second half? Is that going to materialize, how quickly can you sort of OpEx to protect margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Jyrki said, we work on a daily basis every store.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in some cases the lead time is really short and for other components, it takes a little bit longer to react. But we are, as I mentioned before, working on a daily basis. We'd start planning on a weekly basis following up all the operational expenses really, really on an ongoing basis. So, of course, for some components, the lead time is a little bit longer, but we think that we have a little flexibility to react.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think 2009 is a good example, Rebecca, when we had 5% minus like-for-like throughout the year. And if you look at the SG&amp;A costs, we were very good at having them very low SG&amp;A costs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. If I can just have one other follow-up as well. It's on net cash where at the period end compared with last year your net cash was about 25% lower. Is that really an issue you look at or is your balance sheet still so strong that it's really irrelevant what the level of your net cash balances are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We still have a really very strong financial position. So the reason there why it's lower than last year it's, of course, that the dividend payment was much higher this year and, of course, the result has been lower than last year. But still the financial position, the net cash is still on a very, very high level.</p>
