          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Societe Generale's Group 2010 First Quarter Results Conference Call. The presentation hosted by Mr. Didier Valet, Group Chief Financial Officer, will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand over to Mr. Valet. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. So thanks to be with us today for the first quarter results of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I propose you to follow this quick presentation, and starting with page three. Just to mention that the group had a satisfactory first quarter for 2010. The financial results at the start of the year have confirmed the Group's target for 2010, driven by globally sustained commercial performances.</p>
          <p>In Retail Banking, you have seen that the French network experienced a very good first quarter, while International Retail Banking achieved globally satisfactory results, despite the impact on which I would comment later on. In Specialized Financing and Insurance, and Private Banking, Global Investment Management and Services, these two divisions have posted a net increase in their net income, reflecting the positive effects of the measures to adapt and reorganize the activities last year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in the Corporate and Investment Banking revenues, they rose compared to Q1 '09 due to the very limited impact of legacy assets, and also they have achieved in terms of core businesses a good balance with revenues across-the-board. Overall, the Group therefore generated net banking income of &#x20AC;6.6 billion, up 32.6% on a like-for-like basis, and has also improved its operating efficiency with a cost/income ratio of 60.8% in the first quarter of 2010. Finally, this quarter we are seeing the first signs of improvements in the cost of risk, which nevertheless remains at a high level of 91 bips versus 110 in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>As we indicated in the press release published on the 23rd of April this year which presents all the restated quarterlies since in January 1, 2010, the commercial allocations provision has been compared with now the loan book outstanding versus the Basel I credit risk weighted assets in the previous metric.</p>
          <p>So the main impact of this change is essentially in the French networks which are declining by approximately 20 basis points and in the CIB by 10, 15 bips, you have to get that in mind when assessing the trends in the cost of risk going forward.</p>
          <p>In total the net income of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale in the first quarter amounted to &#x20AC;1,063 million enabling the group to achieve an 11.1% return on equity and to maintain a solid financial structure with a Tier 1 ratio of 10.6% and a core Tier 1 of 8.5%.</p>
          <p>If I move to page four, moving to the Group's income statement for the first quarter. Here you will see the trend that I've just described with net banking income up 32.6% at &#x20AC;6,581 million and the gross in operating expenses under control, plus 4% compared to the first quarter of last year on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>As a result, the gross operating income more than doubled compared to the fiscal 2009 and reaching &#x20AC;2.580 billion. After net allocation to provision which has fallen compared to the first quarter by almost 18%, you can see that we have improved the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Now for the cost of risk on page five which, as we can see, is showing the first signs of improvement. It amounted to 91 basis points for the Group as a whole and calculated, as I said, based on the credit outstanding, and it fell from the 110 bps of the previous quarter. However, it remains high.</p>
          <p>Starting with the French Networks, cost of risk, you can see that 54 basis points, it returned to a level in line with the guidance, which is currently between 50 to 60 basis points. Within this cost of risk, the contribution of large corporates to the allocation to provision decreased. I remind you that we mentioned two fines in the fourth quarter, which had an impact and the cost of risk remained high for business customers, small and medium-sized companies. Regarding households, the cost of risk continued to be low on both mortgage and consumer finance.</p>
          <p>To the right you can see international retail banking risk &#x2013; cost of risk to 225 basis points versus 209 in Q4. It is mainly linked to the significant allocation to provision for risk that we made this quarter, of which &#x20AC;48 million are related to specific provisions and &#x20AC;101 million is an allocation to portfolio based provisioning that we have decided to satisfy in the first quarter to discount the expected worsening of the economical situation.</p>
          <p>Actually in Greece, the cost of risk decreased to 144 basis points versus 185 in the fourth quarter. This decrease is particularly visible for Russia which since the peak of second quarter of '09 has consistently show a decline, which is now at 371 basis points versus 490 in Q4. And we are also seeing &#x2013; we have also seen a slight decrease in Czech Republic, where because of risk reached 93 basis points versus 107 in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>For Specialized Financing, the cost of risk remained high for consumer finance, but fell for equipment finance, particularly in Germany and in Norway. At 8 basis point the cost of risk in CIB's core activities is particularly low. We have already mentioned in the fourth quarter that the portfolio was behaving well in this modest recovery and we believe that this almost nil cost of risk reflects the very strong resilience of our corporate clients within the corporate investment banking division.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on the legacy assets, we set an allocation to provision of &#x20AC;214 million in the first quarter of which 195 are accounted for &#x2013; by the CDOs of RMBS reclassified as of the 1st October 2008.</p>
          <p>If I move now to page six, regarding the solvency position of the Group. At the end of March 2010, we had the solid financial structure with a Tier 1 of 10.6% and a Core Tier 1 of 8.5%, which are let's say almost stable compared to the level at the end of 2009, as you can see on the bar chart that, as expected, we made what we call a depresed share issuance in February that we have already refinanced last fall. The cost of these transactions led to a 15 basis points decline in the Tier 1, but it is more than offset by the retained earnings of the quarter, net of the dividend provision.</p>
          <p>In terms of risk weighted assets, they have also remained stable as of 31st of December. There's a 2 billion increase that you can see on the bar chart. It's entirely due to the exchange rate movements. On a like-for-like basis, the evolution of risk-weighted assets would have been minus 1%. And you can see that it has been partly sustained by a reduction in the market risk component of the CIB division.</p>
          <p>If I turn now to page seven, looking at the revenues of each business line, these performances were globally satisfactory and once more it is credit to French users' resilience. The French Networks had a very good start to the year with a strong net banking income growth of 6.9% versus the first quarter of last year. International Retail Banking revenues were stable despite the low credit demand, especially in Russia, even if we had seen some sign of improvement in March.</p>
          <p>For their part, the Specialized Financing and Insurance reported more than 10% increase on a like-for-like basis, despite a still unfavorable environment from an economic perspective. Private Banking, Global Investment Management and Services revenues, which are still being penalized by low interest rate, decreased by slightly less than 12% on a like-for-like basis. And this is excluding asset management as of course the scope of this asset division has been impacted by the creation of Amundi.</p>
          <p>Finally, the 23.6% fall in the revenues from CIB co-activities versus last year should not hide their strong performance this quarter. You should remember that in the first quarter '09, this was an atypical benchmark for the industry, given the completely exceptional market condition at this time in terms of spreads <mark type="inaudible" /> volatility. And I will comment on that more into detail in the coming slides.</p>
          <p>On page eight, looking at the French Networks we can see that we have achieved a very good first quarter; they have shown that the commercial performances are confirming the rebound that we have seen since the mid 2009. This is particularly reflected in the strong growth in net individual customer new account opening which rose from plus 18,000 net in the first quarter '09 to 50,000 net in the first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding the deposit outstanding, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and Boursorama brands continued to attract new deposits with deposits outstanding increasing by 6.2% compared to last year of which we have seen a 4% increase for individual customer mainly fueled by sight deposits at a 10.3% increase for business customers mainly fueld by term accounts.</p>
          <p>In terms of off-balance savings we have also seen a strong production in terms of life insurance inflows, an increased by almost 25% outperforming both insurance market and banque asssurance, the whole market grew by 14% Q1-Q1 and the banque assurer by 15.5% according to the latest figure.</p>
          <p>Regarding loan outstanding they maintained a plus 1.5% gross versus Q1 '09 of which plus 4.2 for the individual customers which were supported by the rise in housing loan outstanding. You can see that internal new loan business, new mortgage business production, the 4.1 billion that we achieved in the first quarter is in line with the average quarterly new business that we've seen in 2007.</p>
          <p>Lastly, internal flows to the businesses, it remained stable thanks to a solid growth in investment loans. So overall the French Network produced revenues of &#x20AC;1,892 million, up 6.9% excluding PEL/CEL reporting. With the maintaining of our annual guidance of around 3% for 2010, we have said that the increase is likely to be above the 3% in the first half and likely to be maybe slightly below the 3% in second half due to base comparison, but we honestly feel on track or slightly ahead of this guidance looking at our total budget.</p>
          <p>In term of operating expenses we have controlled this operating expenses and this has led to a reduction in the cost/income ratio by two percentage points versus last year. I will remind you that we have also the target for the full year to improve the cost income/ratio by one percentage point.</p>
          <p>If I turn now to page nine, in International Retail Banking, this division posted globally satisfactory results in an economic environment that is starting to improve. Also there are large discrepancies between regions. The environment is beginning to normalize in CE and in Russia, as I said earlier with signs of an upturn in the activity at the end of the first quarter for the Russian operations and in CE we have seen a strong resilience of those entities excluding Greece, reflecting the good positioning of our brands.</p>
          <p>In Sub-Saharan Africa and French territories, the franchise continues to grow, while in the Mediterranean Basin where we continue to open branches and where also the economic growth is still there, we have consolidated our commercial performances.</p>
          <p>In terms of outstanding, you can see that the evolution result from the change in policy that we have made last year. With loans at 61.8 billion, down 4.2% compared to end of March 2009. They are stable compared to end of 2009, so this means that we are close from the bottom and we will need an increase in the loans outstanding to benefit from the recovery of these countries going forward. In terms of deposit outstanding, at 64.2 billion, they are up 2% compared to last year and thus the loan to deposit ratio came out at 96% as of end of March.</p>
          <p>I mentioned that revenue was slightly down by minus 1.8%, but thanks to the effort made by the franchisees, especially in Russia last year to reduce the operating expenses which are down by 4.1%, we were able to grow the gross operating income by 1.4% on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>If you look at the bar chart at the bottom of the slide you can see the contribution of the various regions or countries to this result of &#x20AC;114 million in the first quarter. The net incomes had a negative contribution from Greece, minus &#x20AC;65 million.</p>
          <p>Lastly, attributable to the specific and collective allocation to provision &#x2013; total of &#x20AC;149 million, I remind you that we own 54% organically and so if we want to say excluding the portfolio based provisioning international retail banking net income would be inflated by &#x20AC;44 million compared to the 114. Also if you notice that Russia is starting to improve and we are confirming the target to seek a sharp break even by end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 10. And now a few words about the Specialized Financing and Insurance division, whose financial results have experienced an upturn as expected and as announced at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Total revenues on Specialized Financing excluding Insurance amounts to &#x20AC;723 million; an increase by 9.3% compared to the first quarter. This is driven by the strong resilience of the margins and the improvements of the <mark type="inaudible" /> vehicle market. Loans outstanding are stable. The financing business showing a strong resilience despite a difficult environment, and consumer finance reporting a continuous and robust growth.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the measures to optimize the operating structure taken in the light of the crisis, reduction of headcounts, control of expenses, you can see that we were able to reduce further the cost base by 2%, leading to a sizeable impact on the gross operating income growth plus 26.7%. And this combined with a slight reduction in cost of risks that I mentioned earlier has triggered, let's say, a turn back into the black of the Specialized Financing division excluding Insurance to &#x20AC;16 million as you can see on the bar chart at the bottom of the slide.</p>
          <p>Regarding insurance, they have recorded excellent finances with a strong growth in the life insurance inflows, as well as a good activity on the non-life side, as you can see, which has seen a production increase by almost 29% compared to last year in synergies with our domestic retail network. So as a total, insurance revenues posted a 17.8% increase compared to last year. And you can see that the contribution to net income of Specialized Financing and Insurance amounted to &#x20AC;70 million versus minus 37 in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>If I turn now to page 11, in the first quarter 2010, as the division experienced significant structural changes with the transfer of Boursorama to the retail networks and also the start up of Amundi and the acquisition of MetWest in the asset management.</p>
          <p>Starting with the Private Banking, the Private Banking division has consolidated its position within flows of 1.4 billion for the quarter equivalent to 7.5% annualized rate as a percentage of assets under management.</p>
          <p>In 2010 the corporate restructuring at TCW, which was implemented at the end of 2009 resulted as expected in a significant flow of &#x20AC;12.6 billion of which slightly less than 11 billion are attributable to the restructure mortgage-backed security activities. We are expecting further withdrawal in the second quarter mainly by institution clients of approximately &#x20AC;4 billion, but we believe that we have stabilized the structure and that as for as illustrated by the inflows that we have seen in April, which are positive for slightly less than one billion. This is safe building the ground for solid rebound.</p>
          <p>On Securities Services; they have shown sign of an upturn in terms of growth of both assets under custody and assets under administration compared to Q4. And Newedge gained 30 bps of market share over one year to slightly less than 12% confirming it starts to position close with Goldman Sachs on the futures and options brokerage markets.</p>
          <p>Overall Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale had successfully improved its results. In terms of net banking income, the decreased price is coming essentially from low developed interest rates, which has impacted treasury revenues of the private banking and also the activity of both Newedge and SG Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9;. And also we booked as we're in negative revenue in private banking, a provision for an isolated case of &#x20AC;27 million. Costs were under control, minus 8%, and with the contribution of Amundi of &#x20AC;26 million as equity accounted, the division net income increased from 15 to &#x20AC;55 million for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>If I turn to page 12 on the Corporate and Investment Banking, this division had a good quarter, in line with targets with revenues of &#x20AC;2,144 million. In fact, Q1 '09, as I mentioned at the introduction, was a record quarter for the core activities, due to its exceptional market conditions. But in our view it was a performance that was achieved for the sole core activities of &#x20AC;2,167 million was extremely satisfactory as it resulted from the balanced contribution of the businesses and is above the &#x20AC;2 billion a quarter guidance that we gave at the time of the full year results.</p>
          <p>Digging into each division, so the equity revenues amounting to &#x20AC;786 million, have increased by almost 14% compared to Q4, 21% compared to Q1, despite low volatility and volumes across the board. However, the business with commercial activity particularly for flow private activities have enabled us to maintain our leading position in Europe with the trackers, number two with a market share of 21% and on a worldwide basis for the covered balance with number one position in the market share of almost 13%.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;779 million the fixed income, currencies and commodity division revenues have returned to a normalized level despite this still mixed market in Europe, particularly due to less available volumes compared especially to the U.S. markets.</p>
          <p>So overall, global market revenues at slightly less than &#x20AC;1600 million, but up 61% compared to Q4, where both the guidance that we said for this part in the year to be in the run rate of quarter that we said at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>On Financing and Advisory the revenues are stable at &#x20AC;602 million driven by a good start to the year for the financing activities. And the leading position that we have enjoying the capital markets in euro are maintained. As illustrated, we are the number two position in terms of underwriter for Corporate Bonds issues in euros.</p>
          <p>Turning to legacy assets; they have &#x2013; in terms of revenue a limited impact this quarter of minus &#x20AC;23 million and in terms of cost of risk at 214, they are in line with the guidance that we set for this impact for the full year between 700 to one billion before tax.</p>
          <p>So in total, the CIB division produced gross operating income of almost &#x20AC;1 billion, increasing almost fourfold compared to last year and so leading or translating into a very satisfactory cost income ratio of 53.7%. The contribution to net income of the group was &#x20AC;541 million, so approximately 50% of the bottom line for the group as a whole for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>If I look now to page 13, a quick word on the Corporate Centre, which has seen a sharp upturn in the gross operating income. This is mainly due to on one side the sharp drop compared to last year of the impact of the mark-to-market valuation of our CDS books, which is hedging our corporate loan portfolio. The impact was just &#x20AC;3 million compared to almost 500 last year &#x2013; minus 500 last year. This lower- much lower impact reflects on one side the fact that we have income of nominal hedge just &#x20AC;8 billion, which is a sizeable reduction compared to last year, and of course, as expected and as announced, the fact that the corporate credit spreads are extremely less volatile compared to last year and have come back to a more normalized situation.</p>
          <p>Regarding impairments on our equity portfolio, there is no new permanent write-downs as illustrated by the unrealized gain you can see in the last bullet, which amounted to &#x20AC;230 million positive as of end of March.</p>
          <p>Regarding our own spreads, the mark-to-market into our own spreads was plus &#x20AC;102 million this quarter, reflecting the fact that on 31st of March compared to 31st of December, there was a slight increase in our spread on the CDS side like most financials. So overall, the Corporate Centre had a breakeven net result this quarter of plus &#x20AC;4 million for the first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>So to conclude, what should be remembered is that overall the business's commercial activity was sustained this quarter, testifying the solidity and also the continued development of the franchises, both for Retail Banking in France, abroad, and for our Corporate Investment Banking. As we announced in February, we believe that 2010 will be a year of rebound and of growth for our results.</p>
          <p>The Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group's financial performance for the first quarter of 2010 was the dynamic growth of our revenues, plus 32%, the first encouraging sign of an improvement in the cost of risk, which we believe should decrease us from the second half, a global group net income of &#x20AC;1,063 million, and lastly, the financial structure, which remains steady with a Tier 1 of 10.6% and a Core Tier 1 of 8.5%. So all these figures confirm that this rebound is well underway for the group.</p>
          <p>All these factors mean that we can confidently confirm the financial target for 2010, which we announced at the start of the year and looking beyond 2010 this seems to once more reflect the effectiveness of our Universal Banking strategy focused around the three core businesses, retail banking in France, outside of France and CIB. We intend to pursue and develop these strategies to our additional Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale services strategic plan, which of course we will be unveiling at the Investor Day. And so I look forward to see you at this event that has been set for the 15th of June.</p>
          <p>So that's for the presentation and I'm now looking with people around me to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have a question from Ms. Delphini from JPMorgan. Madam, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, I have few questions. The first one relates to your sovereign risk exposures. I was just wondering whether you could give some granularity on your 13 billion of exposures to Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Greece and Italy and then also maybe just comment whether that sitting in your trading book or banking book whether that's hedged. And then more generally, if you could maybe give some color or whether you are concerned or not about potential deterioration in the liquidity or in the Internet market funding generally?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on your shadow P&amp;L, if you could maybe explain just a trend, the decline between the two billion that you had end of '09 to 1.5 billion in the first quarter &#x2013; end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And then finally, just a question on your &#x2013; on Geniki on Greece, if you could maybe give the NPL ratio and maybe the coverage that you have for the subsidiary? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lisbon Thank you. So I would not comment on the overall sovereign exposure and let's say we have given the three billion &#x2013; around &#x20AC;3 billion exposure to Greece, which imagine major public disclosure that all the banks have done. So I will not comment on the rest of the exposure.</p>
          <p>Regarding the three billion that we mentioned for Greece, we said that we have approximately 20, 25% which is in the trading book and the rest which is available for sale. Regarding my concern on liquidity, let's say when we look at the long-term financing, yes, there was writing of spreads but Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is ahead of its funding plan in terms of execution because before let's say the cost period we had issued approximately &#x20AC;10 billion year to date plus the three billion that we had in advance of last year. This means that our funding plan &#x2013; funding program of 25 to 30 billion is executed to let's say, 40 to 50%.</p>
          <p>Regarding the short-term, let's say, liquidity, so far so good. Let's say we continue to see, let's say, business as usual on that side. Regarding the shadow P&amp;L evolution, let's say while the decrease you mentioned is reflecting, let's say, as we said improvement on loan side on certain assets, which is &#x2013; which shall I say is a monetary asset that we have discussed in the previous quarter. So we've seen an improvement in terms of valuation of well especially CMBS during the quarter.</p>
          <p>And regarding the CDO for MBS, we have, let's say, this &#x2013; the provisioning that we passed &#x2013; that we set aside this quarter, which has reduced the shadow. On the other side, you should also remember that the shadow is on dollar, the limited assets. So that was also a 7% &#x2013; seven to 8% increase approximately end of March to end of December to end of March appreciation of the dollar, which has cost us euro terms, has inflated the shadow and also our exposure. But as you can see nevertheless due to price improvement and provisioning, we're able to reduce it to the figure you mention.</p>
          <p>Lastly on Greece, so on Geniki, as of &#x2013; end of March, we have non-performing loans of 22%, which have &#x2013; which are covered at 56% by provisions.</p>

          <p>Hello Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quick question on Greece again, if I may. I was just wondering if you could to some extent detail the maturity profile of your bond portfolio and I'm trying to understand if you have lots of it coming up in the next few big refinancing hurdles that you expect it to roll or otherwise to get refinance dif anything with the new loans that have been discussed publicly?</p>
          <p>My second question is on monolines and legacy assets in general, I just saw a reversal of CVA of about 500 million, but I didn't see much of that in the P&amp;L. I was just wondering whether that comes from re-class commutation and things like that, otherwise whether you have used it in-write offs.</p>
          <p>And my last question is maybe more broadly on M&amp;A because you have been linked to some assets obviously over the last few months. And I was just trying to more conceptually understand, in order to improve your footprint as you would like in terms of either geographical or otherwise business presence &#x2013; business line presence, to what extent would you be able to &#x2013; would you be willing to sacrifice dilution or accretion for that matter? And on the other side, would you be willing to use some of your capital ratio in order to make a purchase order or would you like to, if anything, keep that where it is? And that's about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So regarding the maturity in Greece, say we have approximately 50% which is shorter than one year. Of course, the proportion is more important on the trading side. Regarding the CVA on the monoline, you've seen the footnote. Let's say we have unwinded certain CDS on one monoline during the quarter due to litigation, I would say. And as a result, let's say, these reductions in CVA has been allocated to cover let's say, this risk. So that's why you didn't see that reversal &#x2013; you didn't see that reverse into the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>On your last point, so I didn't catch all your questions. So regarding the increase or improvement of the geographical or business footprint, what was you second &#x2013; your point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My point was just to try and understand to what extent the improvement &#x2013; to what extent you would like to justify an improvement in the footprint by dilution. So to what extent would you like to sacrifice EPS in order to improve the footprint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, regarding that we have been always financially strict and responsible and so we are not intending, let's say, to make operation at silly prices that could trigger, let's say, a dilution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second part of that question, if I may, is that in order to be financially, let's say, for the financial merit to stack up would you be willing to drop the capital ratio in order to acquire something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact I would say we also are looking at the financial regulation and Basel III and so I think we will show we will be conservatively managing our capital ratio. So we have the two constraints, earning enhancements or dilution on one side and capital position on the other side. So we will be, as we were always in the past regarding acquisitions that we have made, we will be the same &#x2013; extremely selective in terms of acquisitions.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Guillaume Tiberghien from Credit Suisse. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I've got two questions. First one relates to the financial assets measured at fair value to the profit and loss. They increased by 58 billion during the quarter, and I'd like to have a feel as to what it is relating to. And the second one relates to NII, net interest income, for corporates in France. It seems to have been quite weak and I'd like to know apart from weak demand whether that's due to margin pressure and what we should expect maybe going forward when we build our Q2 et cetera forecast? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We start with your second question regarding net interest income on the business loans. Well, you've seen that the growth is &#x2013; well, there is no growth, in fact it's flat. The growth is mainly coming from investment loans while we have a contraction of treasury loans which have in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> higher margins. Also in terms of liabilities, as I said, the growth was essentially driven by term deposits.</p>
          <p>So, I would say in terms of evolution of customer behavior, they are turning I`d say to &#x2013; which is slightly more expensive cost of resources and the net income of loans is also slightly negative. So that's the point. But overall when you look at the trends, we're able, let's say, to achieve a good trends or solid trends in terms of interest income, thanks to the strong improvement we see in private individuals where there the growth was driven by sight deposits which are, let's say, zero interest rate resource. And on the other side also we continue to see while despite the margins are clearly shrunk compared to last year has slightly positive margin in term of mortgages in &#x2013; for the private individuals.</p>
          <p>Regarding the 58 billion increase in the balance sheet, solid trading securities. Let me check &#x2013; I'll come to you on that. But top of mind there is something which is linked to repo business and to certain mark to market items. In fact, let me have a look. Yes, it's here. It is &#x2013; yes, so there is almost 25 billion, which is linked to the increase of the net replacement value of the derivatives. So it's just mark to market items. 15 billion is given to repo and let's say there is the rest of approximately 20 billion is linked to real cash assets.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Brice Vandamme from Deutsche Bank. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Brice Vandamme from Deutsche. Just a few quick questions. The strong trends we are seeing in the road you're generating by the French retail networks. As you said, we are slightly ahead perhaps of your guidance so far. Do we have to have forecast such strong trends to be maintained in Q2 and actually further in the year or do you think it's only due to the weak one we had last year?</p>
          <p>Second question on international retail, and coming back to Greece, you did disclose a coverage of the non-performing loans of 56%, if I am not wrong, which seems to be not extremely high given the evolution of asset weight in Greece. My question is very simple. Should we expect marginal provisioning in the coming quarter? What is, from your point of view, the risk of further deterioration of your loan book in Greece? And perhaps just one very simple question; in your calculation of the Tier 1 capital what dividend payout ratio have you assumed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Brice, thanks. Regarding the growth in revenues for the domestic retail banking business, 6.9%, well we should remember that`s last year for all French bank. This was the bottom of the trends with them. Extremely low level of activity, so definitely yes, we have certain part of this growth which is coming from the, let's say, low base of comparison.</p>
          <p>After that, I'd say &#x2013; I remind you that you always have &#x2013; when we set targets, we were always prudent. So this precaution that we set in <mark type="inaudible" /> was prudent. And we will see, let's say, if and when we change this target. But at this point we stick to this  3%. And I think the 6.9% makes us confident to reach the target.</p>
          <p>Regarding Greece, while the 56% that you &#x2013; the coverage ratio that you mentioned, in fact is a mixture of different coverage rate depending on the underlyings. We are, let's say, between 75 to 80% hedge cover for the households and we are, let's say, around 45 to 50 for the business customers. Again, you always look at the different, let's say, security collateral and also loss individual that you have on each exposure. So we feel that with this general provisioning we are, let's say, based on current expectations we are well covered regarding the joint reconsignment.</p>
          <p>Regarding what we could expect going forward, we made a kind of stress test scenario, which in our view could require &#x2013; but again, it's a stress test &#x2013; something around &#x20AC;75 million provisioning a quarter. And so this is something that we have in mind looking at 2010.</p>
          <p>Lastly, regarding the Tier 1 capital, let's say in fact you can almost calculate that directly when you look at the retail earnings contribution and the provision for dividends. At this point we have put the provisioning for the dividend at the high of the range that we announced to the market, i.e., 40%, the range being 35 to 40%.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Jacques-Henri Gaulard from Autonomous Research. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pretty much all of my questions have been answered but I still have one. You give a very good slide on page 39, which is a detail of your legacy assets, P&amp;L. And I was just wondering what was the other line which was close to 100 billion this quarter? And maybe one question on your revenue in the emerging market area where obviously it's getting actually a bit sluggish. You mentioned an improvement in March in Russia I`m seeing. Can you generalize that to other countries such as Czech Republic and Romania? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, hello Jacques-Henri. Regarding legacy assets, the other, so the 98 is a mixture of the carry that we have on these assets and also we have sometimes the impact of inefficiencies of certain rate hedges that we have on these assets. So it has to be usually a positive item even if in times due to certain inefficiency of hedges. We had a big plus that was a bit more important in the second quarter and slight minuses in Q1 and Q3 but, let's say, Q4, Q1 are more or less a normal type of level that we could expect from that line.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your second question in terms of recovery trends that we can see excluding Russia. So Russia yes, the slide, that's a momentum that we've seen in March was essentially in Russia linked to the consumer loans, which both <mark type="inaudible" /> and Rosbank seem to start to recover, let's say, sequentially.</p>
          <p>Regarding the rest of the, well, the other two subsidiaries- I would say in Czech Republic it continues to be relatively calm I would say. You should have in mind that in Czech Republic I would say we have an excess of deposit compared to loans and Q-on-Q I'd say the central bank of Czech Republic is trying to avoid too strong improvements of the currency, this means that just maybe I don't know whether you will laugh or not, but this country suddenly are sometimes well managed in term of monetary and budgeting policy and so currently their currency is appreciating so. We have that in Czech Republic and so having too much deposit I would say we are like that but we have been &#x2013; we are seeing a negative impact in term of net interest income trend.</p>
          <p>In Romania, let's say we've seen in terms of trends of loans. The start of recovery, let's say, Q1, Q4, the increase is slightly below 2% and we have seen, which is also a good sign, almost plus 6% increase in the deposits.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thanks for taking the questions. Some of them have been answered already. Just to come back to Greece, what kind of NPL do you see under the stress scenario? That was the first question. The second one is Romania, Bulgaria, how do you see the impact of the slowdown in Greece and the fact that the Greek banks probably would withdraw? And then perhaps a general question. On the liquidity stable funding ratio of &#x2013; which are being discussed under Basel III, what would be, in your estimate, the impact on the P&amp;L in terms of percentage capped to your earnings? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding first the trend that encountered in NPL, let's say, under the stress, it depends definitely on your scenario but let's say to see that going in the high 20s is something that we could see in the stress scenarios.</p>
          <p>Secondly, regarding Romania and Bulgaria, that is then, let's say, well the big banks are depending on these countries, certain large competitors. Let's say, we will see but clearly it should ease a little bit the competitive environment and we feel that as we have, especially in Romania, a strong foothold, strong footprint. Let's say it will reinforce maybe. We will see. I'm not betting on that, but we will maybe see capacity to capture market share for our activities.</p>
          <p>Your last point was on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The impact of the Basel III stable funding ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the net stable funding ratio, I would say we are currently continue to discuss, first as a principle, second the calibration. It's quite early, let's say, to say what will be impacting some of P&amp;L. So I would say we are not commenting on that. But in principle we feel that such a ratio, that makes sense, after that it`s more the calibration. The condition also of the stress which are extremely severe because it's a one year stress without recognizing the capacity of banks to address their business model during the period, which is currently, let's say, under discussion. So I would say I will not comment on impact. I`m just commenting on the principle, which certainly needs to be revised and potentially improved in terms of calibration. And if you count the calibration maybe also to say that banks have to get 100% level for that ratio under distress, I'd say maybe EBIT on this is leading to a negative transformation for banks, which is not exactly what macroeconomical theory asked them to complete.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered. Just one regarding the NPLs rise on the quarter, can you just give us where it's coming from? And also would be very interested to see your views on how the SMEs in France are performing in terms of first &#x2013; in terms of default. Second point in terms of private banking, when are we going to expect the rebound in terms of topline after this quite disappointing quarter? And last point regarding the investment banking, there's been many notes were written about the potential risk of central regulation on the change on the derivatives. I just wanted to know if you have some comments to add on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding the NPL evolution, yes, regardingthe increases in retail banking outside France, and these of course influencing by the <mark type="inaudible" /> question. Let's say there for the rest there is a slowdown in term of any NPL formation in retail in France. It increased just from 3.4% of the total outstanding to 3.5%. Also in financial services, it's just a 20 bps increase from 7.5 to 7.7. And let's say &#x2013; we have also kind of stability to decline in CIB, so I would say potentially coming from retail outside France. Your second question, sorry, was...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the activity in France?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Banking? Let's say, we say that we have the provisions for an isolated case which was &#x20AC;27 million as negative revenues.</p>
          <p>On top of that, I'd say, we are expecting approximately 100 bps in terms of revenue to assets for private banking for 2010, which reflect I'd say, the fact that in terms of revenue on the treasury activity in interest income we are experiencing a level of interest rates, which of course is waiting on the margin as a whole.</p>
          <p>And we still on the other side because, of course this could be an &#x2013; reversed partly by a more dynamic fee business, currently that is the posture of the customer base, continuing to be on relatively safe asset. So we are not seeing, let's say, at this point a strong rebound in the &#x2013; for example structured products or added value products.</p>
          <p>So maybe there will be a transition phase. So that's why the 100 bps is what we could expect for 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Didier. I wondered if I could maybe ask you four hopefully quick questions. The first one is on the Southern European exposure. I can understand your reluctance to give precise figures. But obviously given the concern in the market, if we use that same BIS table, we can see that the French banks in aggregate, the exposure to Portugal seems to be about half that to Greece, while the exposure to Spain seems to be about three times that to Greece. So would there be any reason for you &#x2013; for Soc Gen &#x2013; to be very, very different to that general number?</p>
          <p>The second question is just on the toxic assets and the expected losses this year of between 700 million and 1 billion. I just wondered if you could break out that number for us between the different categories? Because I'm just interested what might drive us towards the low end or the high end of that range.</p>
          <p>The third question is just on the cost of risk. Thank you again for splitting it out by division. On the new basis, looking at provisions versus book value, book value of loans. In thinking of the long-term earnings potential of Soc Gen, what should we think of as a kind of blended average normalized cost of risk versus loans?</p>
          <p>And final question &#x2013; I apologize for so many &#x2013; in the new environment given where you're now kind of accruing the cash and shares mix for people in the investment bank, what kind of cost income should we think of as a normalized level? Is this first quarter a kind of run rate we can use going forward? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, thank you for your question. First, regarding the question on sovereign debts. In fact, we said at the time of the full year result that we gave an indication which has been taken by some of your colleagues of an overall peaked exposure of &#x2013; in the region of I'd say &#x20AC;13 billion, of which Greece was within that, so you made your own figures. It has not changed dramatically compared to end of that last year.</p>
          <p>And so you can see that if you take our contribution, you will not pile up to the BI figures that you are mentioning. So we are well below our natural market share among the French banks. And I would say on the BI figure, I will advise you to be extremely cautious with this figure, because from my perspective, it is I think it is adding apparent fears and it's not really reflecting the truth of the exposure of one bank &#x2013; French banks or, I don't know, European banks as a whole. So these figures have to be manipulated extremely cautiously.</p>
          <p>Regarding the detail of the 700 to 1 billion guidance in term of regulatory assets; on this issue we have provide sufficiently guidance for you to make sure your own estimates and I will not dig into it subline, which sometimes also when there is a plus in spreads tightening there, there is a minus in protection here. So I will not detail between the &#x2013; in this figure. But you &#x2013; and again, you should assume that a big part of that will be of course in the cost of risk as expecting on the CDO for RMBS.</p>
          <p>Regarding the last two questions, I would say, you should ask this question on the 15th of June. It's more of let's say the long-term is our guidance objective or targets that we will set for the businesses, and so if <mark type="inaudible" /> I will comment on them or provide further granularity or flavor. It's more like 15th on June that I give &#x2013; we will provide you a certain hint to that.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Two follow-up questions, if I may. First on Geniki share. What was the -- what was your assumptions of &#x2013; behind your stress tests in terms of Geniki, I guess? For example, I understand the NPLs are expected to go in the high-20s. So to which kind of  GDPs would that correspond? And second, regarding still Geniki. Would we expect to be part in rebuilding the solvency ratio of your Greek subsidiary, for the first part? And second question, if I may, still &#x2013; sorry to come back on this one, 3 billion Greek exposure. Could you break down this exposure between your insurance business and your other businesses? I am just wondering &#x2013; while I understand a big part is related to your market-making operations. And I just find this number quite high for market-making operations. Could you maybe explain this? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding Geniki, the macroeconomic assumption that we have taken to contraction of <mark type="inaudible" />, around 4% this year and minus 2.6% next year. Having managed through that, we have partly discontinued so potentially change in the legal frameworks that could hamper our capacity to recover on certain guarantee.</p>
          <p>Regarding the solvency position of Geniki, let's say being a 54% controlling shareholder of Geniki, and I'd say we will contribute to restoring the solvency position of Geniki if and when required. And yes, there is already a need to recapitalize Geniki, so &#x2013; which is likely to take place during this year.</p>
          <p>Regarding your &#x2013; the 3 billion government bonds exposure, I'd say the insurance part is extremely limited, so it's almost nil. But it is accounted within this 3 billion exposure.</p>
          <p>Secondly, let's say, in an exposure on <mark type="inaudible" /> you don't have just the market making activities. You should keep in mind that &#x2013; and this is part of the Basel III request &#x2013; in the buffer, liquidity buffer that you have to construct, according to the regulator at this point, you need to have <mark type="inaudible" />. And so you have also <mark type="inaudible" /> exposure, Which in the banking balance sheet is &#x2013; let's say there and available for sale just to create what is supposed to be the liquidity buffer. And which &#x2013; which would I'd say &#x2013; that's why also we are fighting like all the banks to have a more wider definition of what is in the liquidity buffer, not just <mark type="inaudible" /> because I would say in certain stressed situation, you could have also violent market movement on the <mark type="inaudible" /> and I'm sure that it's not what regulators are willing to see going forward.</p>
          <p>And so that's why I would say overall, when you look at government debt in Euro, in U.K. in sterling or in dollar, you would find a lot of this exposure which has not just in market making but also are available for sale in the bank's balance sheet, just to be, let's say, their liquidity buffer in term of managing their position.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, Didier. Good afternoon, everyone. I still have two questions please. I'm sorry I'm coming back on the &#x2013; endowments on CDO and SUS . I'm not asking you the details of your estimate. But you are globally, if I understand well, confirm your 700 million in terms of full year. First, am I correct? And second, I'm a bit puzzled because you were initially saying most of the 700 would be in Q1. Then you stated most of it would be in first half. What do we understand now on the schedule of this &#x20AC;700 million?</p>
          <p>Second question is on core of CIB cost of risk. You were mentioning the very good readiness of your corporate portfolio, 7 or 8 basis points in cost of risk. If I'm correct, you were saying full year in terms of guidance between 60 to 80. Should we consider that kind of level still for the full year?</p>
          <p>And the last question, I'm sorry, is EFS result. You were mentioning some of your Greek sovereign exposure in your EFS portfolio. We should see there some minus capital losses, potential capital looses there accounted in this line but not accounted in your solvency ratio, at least in Basel II. Could you give us the evolution of this EFS result? Maybe it's on the presentation, I'm sorry I didn't see it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Pascal, good afternoon. Yes, so we are confirming the 7 to 1 billion impact of the legacy assets in the full year 2010. Regarding the impact in Q1, there was a misunderstanding because I never said that it was &#x20AC;700 million. I remember, I said all &#x2013; I gave also quite precise indication to the market, which was something around 250 for the first quarter. And I was mentioning that this 250 was likely to, I said diminish across the year because of &#x2013; let's say, a scientific evolution of the past due 90 days mortgages that we are expecting across the year. So let's say being at around &#x20AC;200 million in the first quarter and I would say we are on track or slightly below the 250 guidance that I gave in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's say we will see that across the year appearing into the P&amp;L. Regarding the corporate investment banking, the cost of risk of  8 bps, while the 60 to 80 guidance of the first quarter was first based on the previous metrics while we are dividing by Basel I risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>When we turn to the loan book which will also a change that our friends in French banks will do for the first quarter, you reduce by 10 basis points. So I would say indicative guidance would have been 50 to 70 bps.</p>
          <p>Being close to zero in the first quarter and at this point of the second quarter adding those kinds of deterioration I would say we are likely to be below that guidance clearly for the full year. Let's say we are never &#x2013; you could always have. Let' say I don't know one or two findings that we could trigger some provisioning, but clearly the shape of the portfolio is extremely under control and is behaving extremely well.</p>
          <p>The last point was on the .........</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the EFS, on the EFS you could find the factor in the press release because when we give the net asset value, we said I think that the unrealized gain or losses was minus one cent. So you can see that it is extremely limited. If I give you the detail, let's say, unrealized gain or losses on available for sale, pre-tax as of the end of March, it was minus 298 compared to minus 635 as of end of December. This is rebalanced by the positive impact of the cash flow hedges reserved of the CI and of negative tax &#x2013; of positive tax contribution, I would say, which leads to total unrealized gain of, you have at most 0.1 billion net realized capital gains so this is exceeding in consolidation differences.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Didier. Couple of quick ones firstly Russia; I've noticed the credit quality seems to have improved quite a bit first quarter on the fourth quarter and I seem to recall that was the full year results that your expectation was for charges to stay high in the first half and then improve in the second half, I just wondered if you could give us a bit more color on Russia; where the positive surprises come through? And whether you see first quarter level is a good base to see further sequentials declines from? And then the second question really relates to CIBM revenues. Just wondering obviously we're into May now whether the pipeline is such that you are expecting another sort of &#x20AC;2 billion plus revenue quarter &#x2013; so, if you like, it's sort of round about way of trying to picture how April trading has gone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the revenues for CIBM I will let Michel answer your question, if I start with Russia yes, we said that the leverage was likely to be more variable in the second half with the combination of sales building up momentum in term of revenues and lowering of the &#x2013; further lowering of the cost of risk. Nevertheless I'd say we have I don't know whether I would say regular but we have seen as I've said since second quarter '09 we had the peak in terms of cost of risk was reached we have seen a regular decline over the last three quarters.</p>
          <p>At this point what is I would say missing between brackets to achieve the back to breakeven that we target for the end of this year is to start to regain dynamics in term of revenues. As I said, this will be fuelled by loan growth which currently continues to be down compared to last year. So that's why the trends and signals that we see in March on the consumer loans is positive. We see also that corporate is staring to improve. Even if the competition on corporate is relatively tough, and so the margins have already also decreased on that side.</p>
          <p>Depending also the costs, you remember that we reduced the head count in Russia and Asia by 10% so almost 2,000 people and we will get the full benefit of this reduction, let's say, it has started to be implemented in Q1 &#x2013; end of Q1 beginning of Q2 last year. We will get the full benefit as from this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there appears quite a big step-down Q1 on Q4?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's quite a big step-down Q1 on Q4. It's worth just over &#x20AC;50 million in terms of the impairment charge. So there is nothing funny there going on in the first quarter. And that is just reflective of a general improvement in credit quality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is an improvement and there is always that saying &#x2013; usually I see also in the second and first quarter you have kind of a more in depth review of your portfolio. For you this is &#x2013; you have always a kind of seasonal factor. So we had  a slight peak in the end of December which could explain that. But this is one although and I think the trends continue to be there.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh sorry, that was probably my assistant talking in the background. It's really just a question of you're looking at &#x20AC;2 billion a quarter. Is there any reason to believe that Q2 is going to be sort of abnormal, will fall below that level or has April trading in the pipeline. Is that sufficiently strong to get us to another &#x20AC;2 billion quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Robin. It's Michel. Look we are fairly satisfied with the results this quarter. They are in the normalized market and as you know we are more a euro house than a U.S. dollar house. So our results are derived for more than 35 cents on the dollar side, and the euro market has been less dynamic than the U.S. ones. With this being said, we have been proving a fairly good resilience and on all our markets we've a steady balanced revenues between equity, fixed income and advisory and financing and driven by good client business overall and also a good balance between flow business and solutions structured business on the debt equity side. And then on the financing side, our pipeline is pretty robust. Also driven by infrastructure and commodity and that's why we're still financing</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Paul Marceau from UBS. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Omar Fall from UBS. Just firstly on slide 18 of the supplement, can you just give us the split by security or asset class between &#x2013; the difference between the net asset book value and the fair value? That would be question number one. Question number two just following up on the previous question, can you just give a bit more color on the sensitivity of your fixed income revenue base to the current widening of sovereign spreads because as you say, you're more euro-biased at the rates business, as with some of your peers, which I guess hurt you a bit more when spreads widened in Q4?</p>
          <p>And in that context, I guess I'm pretty surprised that how confident you are of maintaining that two billion a quarter run rate. You are only 10% ahead of that this quarter. But seasonally, this is a strong quarter. And then finally, I may have missed this but, did you give a vague figure as to how much capital you might need to inject into Geniki? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Regarding the splits on the slide 18, of the 1.6 billion, 25.3 minus 23.7 shadow P&amp;L, let's say, I will not give you all lines but again, the <mark type="inaudible" /> for CMBS are accounting for a little bit more than between six to &#x20AC;700 million in term of impact on the shadow, and the rest is more diversified and as I said on the <mark type="inaudible" /> for CMBS. We have seen an improvement during the &#x2013; on the CMBS, sorry &#x2013; we have seen an improvement by almost &#x20AC;200 million in the first quarter, showing the improvement you can see on the indices CMBS and others.</p>
          <p>The second point was the question on the fixed income and the sensitivity of our franchise to spread widening I would pass to Michel but maybe before Michel answers that question. Omar, to be 10% above the guidance in the first quarter with the seasonality, in our view, is a good performance let's say. We are not expecting to make 2.8 billion in the first quarter and then to be 1.2 billion in Q3 or Q4 because of seasonality. So we believe that this is I'd say back in line with our expectations and that's why I say we continued to believe that the target let's say of I would say overall something close to eight billion has not to be questioned at this point but I give the ground to Michel regarding our sensitivity as said to widening our spreads and also increasing volatility on fixed income markets in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that we'll be more living in an environment where spread has been reduced and it's more our sensitivity to reduce spread which I would rather talk about rather than a widening side because widening spread was what we've been living through last year was rather a good environment for the banks and so it could be a positive sensitivity to a widening spread environment for us. I concur totally to what Didier said which is that it was a solid performance for us on fixed income.</p>
          <p>Remember that we are building our fixed income franchise and that we are exceeding our guidance for the first quarter that fixed income is still providing less revenues and equity but our goal is that within the next two to three years we see will be reversed but so far it's perfectly on line with our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>An issue we have was some fixed income, let's say, we have against &#x2013; also a solid contribution of both equity and financing, which is just protecting ourselves against the down side and I guess that this is slightly different from most of our peers. I think that was the two questions, Omar.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm Karen from Execution. I have please more questions, please. The first one is just on the loan loss charges in French retail banking. Should we based &#x2013; I'm just surprised by the speed of the decline. Should we assume basically Q1 is already somewhat of a run rate for the rest of the year? Then secondly, on the impact of regulatory changes on &#x2013; in terms of risk-weighted asset increase from Basel II at the end of the year, are you reiterating your comment about a tripling of market risk-rated assets and does this include the trading securitizations as well. And then lastly, I was just surprised about the performance in the corporate center. In the past you have given us the guidance of around 150 to 200 million on <mark type="inaudible" /> level per quarter. Can you maybe help us a bit to understand the run rate for the corporate center. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon Anke. Regarding the French retail banking business, it seems slightly 54 bps cost of risk of this quarter. would have been, the previous metrics close to 70 bps, so it's exactly what we have guided for the full year and &#x2013; sorry, it's exactly what we have guided, 60 to 70 bps for the full year. So, let's say, yes, this is the type of run rate that we are expecting clearly in the first half. Maybe we will see a slight decrease in H2, but definitely this is a good base, let's say of upward trends in term of assessing the trend for 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding the tripling of market risk, regarding the CIB 3 this is just what is coming from trasvar , ISE and CRM. Securitization; let's say we need to wait for the discussion to the European Parliament looking at <mark type="inaudible" /> and also we have capacity on our own to optimize, let's say what could be the impact of securitization. This could inflate as a salary impact.</p>
          <p>Lastly, regarding the 150 to &#x20AC;200 million guidance per quarter for the corporate centre, in fact, it was not on the cost side it was for the gross operating income side and in fact this quarter we were at minus 20 something which is inflated by &#x20AC;102 million positive contribution for our own spread, which is clearly something that we are not budgeting. So when I am giving guidance I am not assessing movement of down the spread of Soc G&#xE9;n [Societe G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale].</p>
          <p>And so if you strip out that you would have been at a gross operating income of around, let's say 130. This year I would say at the low end of the 150 to 200 guidance I gave. So this is not that different compared to what I said earlier.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I just wanted to know why you don't give the exposure on the run date. I understand you don't want to give them but I wanted to understand the reason why banks and not only you don't give this kind of information. Is it because of competitive reasons, confidentiality towards your clients, your government clients because you don't want to be the first? I don't exactly understand why you don't give this information which could be a kind of, I would say, medicine against the nervousness of the market.</p>
          <p>My second question relates to what you said regarding your core business. I understand its retail in France and in foreign countries and also your CIB activities. Does it mean that you are going to treat now TCW, for instance or GSF like financial stakes? I did &#x2013; I add that I have seen that you have increased your capital allocated on asset management, and I don't understand exactly why.</p>
          <p>And my last question is, I did not catch exactly the current NPL ratio on Greece. I understand that in your stress scenario it would be 20% but I didn't catch the current one. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Regarding your first question on the exposure to sovereign debt, this is neither the first or the second point you mentioned. This is just that we have to be responsible. Let's say we are not there to bash this or this country into a market environment, which of course, is nervous. But let's say, we and collectively banks and market participants have to be responsible. And it's not by giving to the market exposures which are, let's say, not always well understood publicly, that you will restore trust and confidence in current market conditions. So it's just a question of responsibility.</p>
          <p>And regarding the fact that we <mark type="inaudible" /> the Greek support plan, let's say this why we are disclosing our exposure. just because there was a plan which was announced last week on Greece. And then, I'd say we believe that also there will be some new certain announcement made by banks in general to I'd say contribute to the Greek support plan. Let's say this is why we are disclosing our exposure. So it's just a question of responsibility and I'd say we are not playing the game to name one name or one country in current market relative to environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your second question on the three core businesses, we never said that either specialized financing and insurance or <mark type="inaudible" /> will be treated as financial stakes and if you look at the presentation we made for the full year results. We said that this two divisions will work closely in synergies with the three distribution networks that we have which are French networks, international retail banking activity and CIB and this increases our part of the business model but we will not treat them as financial stakes.</p>
          <p>Regarding the capital allocation maybe on the asset management I will come back to you on that point but you should remember that first we have increased overall across the board let's say the Q1 allocation to 7% but it was already on the basis of last year. We will come back to you on that figure and related figure is not material its &#x20AC;90 million and I think that it's not a huge question.</p>
          <p>Lastly your question was &#x2013; what was your third question? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The current NPL ratio in Geniki?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say that at this point on Geniki the NPL ratio was 22%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>22%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I said that under the stress scenario it could grow in the high 20s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's currently 22?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the stock of the provision is around &#x20AC;400 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the stock of the provision not the flow...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes &#x20AC;500 million something like that, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding your first remark regarding the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All in all it's even more than &#x20AC;550 million provisioning that we have on Geniki.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So do you consider regarding your first remark on the reason why you don't give or why banks don't give their exposure on current date? I understand your point regarding responsibilities sure but it is the BIS which gives the exposure...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...So do you mean that the BIS is not responsible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is not responsible. I'm just saying BIS' provisioning statistics and I said that in the statistics which is provided by BIS, this is the total exposure to a country that banks have and this is, let's say, &#x2013; well as I said, adding apple and pear because you could have a full balance sheet for example of Geniki plus, against the govi that we own in this and that. I'm not sure that you also is insurance business, they are not &#x2013; you don't know. So I guess that you have to be cautious. What I said also is that regarding the govis and the peaks we say that the time of the full year result that we have a certain amount of exposure which has not materially changed at the end of March. So it was around &#x20AC;13 billion. We disclosed a part of Greece. I will not disclose a part of the rest and I think that I'm not there as said to mention specifically one country or one other and it's a question of responsibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Alessandro Roccati from Macquarie. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Didier, two quick questions if I may. The first one is on doubtful loans which have increased by 8%, as seen the collateral has actually increased by 20%. I'm just wondering whether this is due to the fact that the net inflow is coming from mortgage loans so to a policy or strategy of the bank to increase the collateral. The second question is on the CIB core activities where we have seen provision level; it is extremely low at 19 million. Didn't catch whether you are giving any guidance in terms of future provisioning for these core activities and whether we can assume the run rate is going to be similar to that experience in 2009. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first regarding the evolution of NPLs and <mark type="inaudible" /> I said, I would not enter too much into detail, it depends on the mixed inflows and outflows. So that's the result of the used trends.</p>
          <p>Regarding the CIB core activities, regarding the provisioning, let's say we have answered the question; let's say of the guidance in the previous metrics was 50 to 80. Now let's say with the new metrics would be 50 to 70 as credits are slightly above the Basel I risk-weighted assets. So it's reducing by approximately 10 bps to previous guidance.</p>
          <p>We are I'd say close to zero in the first quarter, as I said this means that we are likely to be below the guidance even if you were to, to add let's says the guidance for Q2, Q3 and Q4, that's arithmetic. So I will not provide more flavor regarding the trends in CIB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I think we have time to exchange &#x2013; No, okay, there is still three questions. I will take it. Okay next question, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mrs. Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Madam, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Kian Abouhossein. Sorry, I didn't recognize my name. Geniki, could you tell us what your debt exposure is from a holding company level to the subsidiary, to the legal entity, so to say? So I'd just get an understanding of your real exposure, first of all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, I will not give you precise detail but looking at the loans and deposits, you could assume a proxy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, that's good enough. And then the second question is would you ever consider walking away from Geniki?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact, again, it's a question of responsibility. Let's say, we will stay in Greece as we, for example, last year when there was  IMF plan in Romania, we stayed in Romania. We have committed ourselves to maintain funding and appropriate level of capital to BRD. So this was a commitment that was made by all banks active in Romania. So let's say, in our strategy, when we are in a country in International Retail Banking business, you're not sure when you stay and when you leave. You have to show a consistent perseverance. So we are consistent with our policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So second question is regarding &#x2013; we hear about the German banks potentially participating in the Greek, so to say, injection of money. Is there any similar discussion in France, and would you participate on something similar if the injection into other countries would happen as well? Is that something that you would consider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you will see in time, whether let's say French banks start taking such initiative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Even if it's questionable from a shareholder perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will see if and when and on time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And thirdly, the interbank market, do you see any stress across Europe from your perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kian, I answered this question already. I said that we were able to refinance ourselves without any problems on the interbanking market over the last days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. Didier, this is about TCW. First, could you tell us if you've noticed the beginning of a change in the outflows you mentioned on Q1 and at what time can we expect stabilization in TCW franchise?</p>
          <p>Another follow-up one on the sovereign risk; in the exposure you mentioned the 13 billion altogether, are there any mitigating hedging or whatever that can be accounted or not? And is there any freedom of movement left for the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale regarding the different specific countries' exposure which you can still have or basically can we consider it is stuck exposurefor, for the time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question, I would let Jacques Ripoll answer on TCW. On your second question, let's say, I think the figure I already mentioned, so the total exposure and there is no, let's say, this is a net &#x2013; there is no hedges, so it's the net position. And on your third question, this was on the existing deal exposure. This is existing. So I'll let Jacques mention &#x2013; answer to your first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Maybe a few comments on the stabilization of the franchise. As you know, we have launched a major transformation of the company on the 4th of December. And of course when you launch that kind of transformation, you see a certain number of outflows. We have seen mainly &#x2013; when it goes to mutual and retail, for example, mutual fund, the biggest part, probably 90% of the flows, went in the very first weeks and then the assets were much, much more stable.</p>
          <p>On the institutional side you have kind of a delay because people first come inside to have a view on the team, on the new team, make a certain number of due diligence. So the outflows are more gradual and have been spread out over Q1 and as we said, we will probably see also &#x2013; we will certainly see some announced outflows in Q2.</p>
          <p>Now, what is important in terms of stabilization of the franchise is the MetWest implementation that we have done and on that one the feeling is very positive. I mean, it's been operational immediately.</p>
          <p>The integration is going very well and what is very key is the performance. For example, of the mutual fund of MetWest is very good, which is at the end of the day what we expect from an asset manager.</p>
          <p>So we are very prudent because it was a major transformation. We don't expect in 2010 to have things stabilizing immediately, but we have the feeling that the company is ready for growth and that we will be able to take profit of the recovery of the U.S. economy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, in that case thank you very much for your attention. Just to conclude, let' say, I think this, as we said, we said this was very satisfactory result for the first quarter. We are confident, let's say, we see ongoing rebound of such addition of our performance and again we give you, as we say, a fresh rendezvous for the 15th of June for our investor day to discuss a little bit more of the strategy and the targets that we will set for the Group for the coming year. So thank you very much for your attention.</p>
