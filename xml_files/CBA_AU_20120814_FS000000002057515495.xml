          <p>Hi, good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Colonial Theatre for today's presentation of the annual results for the Commonwealth Bank for the year ended 30 June 2012. The procedures this morning will be pretty much the same as normal. So Ian will kick off with the overview of the result and a few strategic issues, David will give you a little more insights into the results itself and then Ian will come back for a brief conclusion and overview and then we'll go to questions.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, Ian, it's all yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Warwick. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us either in person or remotely for this presentation on the results for the year ended in June. I guess by now the headline is old news to you the way communication works nowadays, but let me just take a minute and just go through the headline numbers with statutory profit up 11% on the prior year. Cash net profit after tax up 4%, our return on equity of 18.6%, cash earnings per share up 2%, and the dividend per share up 4%. So just recapping what you'll already have seen with the media release this morning.</p>
          <p>I'd just like to give you a couple of perspectives about the story behind the result and then as usual as Warwick said, hand over to David to go through some of the detail before coming back and talking about our outlook. I think at the core, I'll go in a moment here into the division-by-division highlights. But I think at the core what we've seen here is a revenue story that is roughly consistent with the environment. We are not actually in a very slow growth credit environment because we've seen business system growth recover to about 4%, home lending system growth back to about 5%. So there is actually credit growth there, but there is ongoing margin pressure.</p>
          <p>What we are also seeing and particularly we've seen in this year is the impact now of markets income on the volatility and growth. And you will see as I go through the division-by-division performance that really is a recurrent theme of two or three of the areas we've got market-related businesses. Underpinning all that is very strong attention to cost management, good ongoing credit quality, not without its risks looking forward, but as the result shows a very good credit quality, and then a very strong balance sheet position in terms of capital and liquidity.</p>
          <p>Business-by-business, the retail bank was up 3% in cash net profit after tax. I'd just like to call out really good expense management here, and what you can see across both the retail bank and business bank we are now seeing the early parts of the benefits of the core banking in the overall technology investment showing up in the cost base. David will talk later that IT costs across the group are down 3%. We're seeing these benefits and you can see in the retail bank expenses well-controlled at 2%, ongoing improvement in the cost-to-income ratio, notwithstanding the effect that the income line is a bit tougher. But we are seeing here the margin pressure, which we all know about, and this is a combination of continuing competition in a slower credit growth environment, and the ongoing cost of funds story which as we all know is probably as much now about deposits as it is about wholesale funding, and that put continuing pressure on the retail margin that's down by four basis points.</p>
          <p>In terms of BPB, there's another good performance from the core business banking; that's corporate financial services, local business banking and the regional and agri business banking. So you can see that when we strip out the private bank and the equities and margin lending business from BPB, you've got underlying business banking revenue growth there of 5%. So this business just keeps half on half doing well. Our volume growth in this part of the market slowed a bit. It may be picking up a bit now, but overall that's very strong top-line growth performance relative to the market that we're in.</p>
          <p>Expenses have been very well managed, so that 5% growth, plus private banking <mark type="ph" /> comps (3:52) six covered only 1% expense growth. But as you can see, and this is the first example in division by division of the broader point I made, equities and margin lending down 12%. So you've got a business like CommSec which remains at a market share of 50.5%; it's just that the volumes on the market are a lot lower and you can see that flowing through into the business. Same with margin lending volumes.</p>
          <p>Institutional banking and markets has seen a real strong growth in lending assets, up 15% on the prior year. So you can see that underlying the overall system business in corporate lending growth that you can see, this is one area where we have done very well and where there is quite a bit of activity happening. At the same time credit quality has been strong, the loan impairment expense in this business down 53%. Whether or not we can say that that's going to be the way things are going to be forever, that's a matter of conjecture but certainly in this year we've seen credit quality very strong in this part of the business.</p>
          <p>And here though with the credit valuation adjustment, we can see the impact of markets businesses. So we know those of you will know this is effectively a collective provision on a derivatives book. As credit spreads go up, the effective risk of counterparty default goes up is the way it's calculated as well and there is a $215 million turnaround on the revenue line on this business year-on-year and that's something that really is just part of being in this business.</p>
          <p>Wealth management -- another tough period, down 11% year-on-year, the good news for wealth management is very strong net flows onto the platforms and funds under administrations, so $4 billion of net flows coming into those platforms in Colonial. Insurance income strong at 11%, you can see when you reconcile that with your materials the insurance growth overall's lower. That's because of the ongoing run off of the legacy book but the insurance income at11% is very strong and that's primarily on the back of continuing strength in the use of our retail distribution channels for insurance products, which is a very good story. Funds under management income in an environment where the ASX 200 is down I think 11% on the year is what it is. It's down 4%.</p>
          <p>New Zealand and Bankwest both did a very good job managing expenses, so for New Zealand we have got positive jaws expenses up only 1%. The NII mix, a lot of ASBs strong performance particularly in home lending had been driven by people moving out of the fixed product into the higher margin variable home lending product. We think that story is pretty much done now and so that trend is coming off. And in Bankwest, very well managed expenses, down 2% year-on-year, improvement in credit quality given the fact that a lot of the poorer loans are now running off the books, that's down $48 million and we are seeing a net interest margin experience which is mirroring what you see in the retail bank of Commonwealth Bank, so that's down by four basis points.</p>
          <p>One of the themes that I do want to draw in the presentation is that at the same time as delivering what we think is good solid short-term performance, we are continuing to invest for the future and we are investing behind this customer focused strategy and we are continuing to invest behind our capabilities. From the point of view of technology I think particularly since Michael and his team made their presentation to you in May I think the story is quite well known. We've had a terrific year in execution of the core banking modernization platform. So deposits are done, we have got 12 million customers plus all our business customers, all our retail customers now on this platform. It's really starting to show up and I think one area we're particularly pleased to see is the rise in our competitiveness in the top end of transactional banking we had another big public sector win yesterday, I think that's 38 for the year in a very difficult product to move. So we are seeing the benefits of that come through. Real time banking is here for all our customers and our lending is well advanced and our focus is very much on benefits realization, so doing what we told you for the last few years that we are going to be doing.</p>
          <p>I think the examples of our innovation here with Kaching and with the launch of our Pi operating platform for small business are quite well known. I don't need to speak further about those, but investment has gone on and as I mentioned at the start, we are now doing a really much better job of leveraging the technology benefits into efficiency, improving customer outcomes, reducing turnaround times, reducing error rates.</p>
          <p>The focus on productivity we've been going for a while, as you all know from what I've said six months ago we placed greater emphasis on this. In addition to the fact that we've managed expenses well year-on-year at only 3%, I would like to call out that expenses half on half down 0.3%. And this is really just at the start of the productivity emphasis coming in, so I think that shows just how seriously we are taking expense management and how seriously the productivity initiative and imperative is being adopted right across the business. And to the point I made earlier, at the same time as achieving a good disciplined expense outcome we're investing in the business. And you can see that relative to last year we actually increased investment spend, about 29% of that number is core, another 46% of it is in investment for growth and productivity.</p>
          <p>Our people imperative we talked for a number of years about customer satisfaction depend, being dependent on the culture and on our people. That's still the banner of our strategy is customer focus. You can see this showing up in customer satisfaction right across the business. So, in retail bank on &#x2013; Roy Morgan, as of the 30th of June the gap between us and number one at 1.4% was the lowest it's been in the history of the survey and down from I think about 3.5% this time last year. In business customer satisfaction on the DBM survey, not only are we the number one bank, but we are now at number one &#x2013; all first equal in every one of the four business segments.</p>
          <p>But critically, the emphasis we are putting on our people and culture is not showing up just in the surveys, it's actually showing up in customer preference in an environment where, which remains very competitive we're pleased that across CBI and Bankwest we've held on to that 33.2% of main financial institution preference and that to us is the critical metric because that's our ability to bed down customers and obviously to meet more of their needs and that number has remained stable which is good. And on our externally benchmarked people engagement metric, we've now exceeded our initial aspiration which was being in the top quartile globally and we are knocking on the door now of being in the top 10%. So we are very pleased with how our people engagement is progressing.</p>
          <p>And finally our strategic priority of strength has meant that we have been and will continue to be willing to incur greater short-term cost just to make sure the fundamental settings of the business are conservative and are prepared for even a bit of a downturn relative to where we are now. And some of the key measures of that you can see deposit funding is up to 62% and David will take you later through how with the balance of new funding versus deposit funding. We have continued to do term funding in an environment where it can be very seductive to fund at the short-end of the curve because of the steepness of the yield curve and so we've again raised the weighted average of our wholesale funding this time up to 3.7 years and you can see here that the average term of the issuances we did in this period is at 5.2 years. So we're prepared to incur the cost of going long because we think it's the right thing to do for the long-term.</p>
          <p>We feel very well provisioned on this key metric of our total provision to credit risk weighted assets at 1.85%. We are well provisioned and the number looks even better when you look at credit risk weighted assets outside of residential mortgages and then on liquidity and capital, we've maintained a very high level of liquids at $135 billion and we've maintained a very strong capital at 10% on the Basel II tier 1 basis, 9.8% on a globally harmonized basis, and very importantly because I know it's important to a lot of you in the six months generated 34 basis points organically of capital. So, the whole capital generation and capital strength story remains very strong.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now hand over to David to go through some more of the detail of the results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning. The headlines are as you see in front of you the 4% increase in cash net profit, the 1% growth or 2% growth I should say in operating income and 3% growth in expenses. But before I move off this slide, I just want to talk a little bit about the impact of markets on our result because we have gone through a period obviously of great turbulence in the markets with equity markets down 11%. And by the time you count the credit valuation adjustment, the impact on our wealth management businesses, the impact on our market facing institutional banking businesses, the impact on our equity margin lending businesses. These add up actually to quite a large number.</p>
          <p>So that our operating income has probably been impacted by 1.5% to 2% in this period at a group level, and our operating performance by about 3% from the cumulative impact of markets, but they are the markets that we live in, but I think the focus tends to be on credit growth and credit growth is slow therefore, operating income slow, but as well as that there's the market impact.</p>
          <p>If we look at the statutory profit versus cash profit, same reconciling items as they are always are, no change in basis of accounting here, but of course statutory profit is up 11% and that's because of the movement in currency and the impact from IFRS volatility on the hedging value for statutory profit, but the cash net profit is up 4%.</p>
          <p>If we have look at operating income, first at the net interest income line and volumes are up 5% margins are down 1%. So, net interest income up 4%. You can see in other banking income with that area actually down 2%. The impact that the credit valuation adjustment at a group level has had that number is slightly larger than the IB number that Ian talked about because it also includes credit valuation adjustment in other parts of the group particularly Bankwest. Trading income though is up a healthy 6% year-on-year and that's because of significant increases in sales to customers looking for hedging contracts in the such line. And in funds management and insurance, it's a sort of ying and a yang. Funds under management down 2% because of the markets movements but insurance income up strongly at 12%.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at net interest margin and over this six month period, net interest margin is down six basis points and look, it's the continuation of the story that we've had over and over. Funding costs are growing faster than we're able to pass them onto customers. So we've had eight basis points of re-pricing and mix change this period. But funding costs are up 12 basis points. And particularly its consumer deposit costs and this is obviously a great benefit to our 11 million deposit customers who are receiving substantially more but of course it's a cost to our net interest margin.</p>
          <p>And in fact on a spot basis, in the retail bank, so its 31 December through to 30 June on a spot basis, our margins on deposits are down 29 basis points. So very significant competition going on in that part of the world. But as well as that wholesale funding cost continue, they grind as we roll-off cheaper old wholesale funding for more expensive new wholesale funding. And that's cost us four basis points in the six months. And then finally, that safety around holding extra liquid assets does have an impact on margin as well with one basis point of impact there.</p>
          <p>Turning to costs and Ian has talked about the 3% growth in costs, very strong control here, staff costs were up 3%, rents and occupancy and equipment costs up 6%, primarily because of duplicate rent paid as we moved our people into Commonwealth bank place in Sydney and into the new head office for Bankwest in Perth. So, we should see some moderation in that next year.</p>
          <p>Michael Harte and his team have really capitalized on efficiency benefits that they are driving through their business, saving 3% across the IT costs and then other costs are up 6% with a mixture of compliance and regulation of the cost of our new marketing campaign around <mark type="ph" /> ken (16:27) and higher credit card expenses as well on rewards programs.</p>
          <p>Just before I go off that slide I should point out that as you can see for the second half, costs were down as part of the productivity coming through. However, I wouldn't be flagging that as what will happen next year because we clearly are paying pay reviews through to our more junior staff, which will add to costs and as well as that we have $95 million of more amortization coming on software as core banking and a number of the other investments that we're putting through start to increase the costs. So there is a bit of a headwind there, but I can tell you that we are targeting positive jaws for next year.</p>
          <p>Looking at credit quality and this is really a continuation of the story I've been talking about for quite some periods now. You can see that in the last six months just 20 basis points of cost and this is reflecting the fact that credit quality across the board is improving. So whether its 30 day arrears or 90 day arrears, with all parts of our business are looking pretty strong from a credit point of view and both troublesome and impaired assets have declined further during this period, pleasingly. And of course this then translates through to the balance sheet. So, although the balance sheet provisions are down a bit and I'll talk about the factors there. I think it is worth noting that whether it's against peers in Australia or internationally, we still are very well and prudently provided.</p>
          <p>So individual provisions are off a little bit because troublesome and impaired assets are down. And then collective provisions, the blue lines which is the solid underlying collective provisions are up just a fraction because of volume increases in lending, but offsetting that of course are all of the benefits of the improved quality of lending. So, in the overlay area we've maintained our economic overlays. We don't see at this stage any particular change in economic circumstances and so we feel it's prudent to hang on to those conservative provisions. But then there are three factors that have seen reductions in the overlays, the continuing amortization of the fair value adjustment in Bankwest. The fact that in Bankwest, we are as you will see from a later slide continuing to get rid of troublesome problem accounts that we inherited when we bought Bankwest and with those accounts going so the overlay provision that we have carried against those problem credits goes away as well.</p>
          <p>And then finally, there are a number of factors that we have provided for conservatively in advance in our overlays such as model reviews that were coming up where we set aside something for the model review. Then when the model is reviewed, it gets automated put into the collective provision or the specific provisions in the blue boxes, and so the need for that orange overlay is no long there.</p>
          <p>Now turning &#x2013; I'll give you a quick overview of some of the businesses. Firstly in retail bank as, Ian has pointed out, 3% up on income and 2% up on expenses with strong expense management. When you look at the individual components of income though, you really see the battlegrounds that have been waging from a competitive point of view. So on the home loans side, 3% growth in volume but offset by margin decline. In consumer finance, we've continued to target areas where we can make good strong profits and so we've had significant gains in market share in credit cards and personal lending and that's been a good contributor to profit for the period. And then in retail deposits, strong retail deposit growth up 10% in volume but a mixture of mix and margin pressure has seen most of that benefit eroded. You can see that over the period, our retail banking margins have continued to decline, so 14 basis points over the full year. Our retail deposits as a setup 10% most of the growth is in the lower margin investment accounts. But pleasingly, transaction accounts continue to hold up very well.</p>
          <p>Turning to our corporate banking areas and business and private bank as Ian pointed out, a strong growth in income in the lending businesses offset by the impacts of markets that have affected our equities and margin lending business. I am pleased that the market share in those businesses remains stable to increasing, but obviously the impact of the market sees that erode. Again, good jaws management in the business in private bank.</p>
          <p>In institutional banking and markets, the strong lending growth has seen a good growth in income in institutional banking. And there you see the markets impact and in particularly what's happened with the credit evaluation adjustment which you can see accounts for 35% of the 39% drop in markets income in that business.</p>
          <p>Now it's very difficult to get a good feel across the entire span of business banking to get a really good span of what's happening with volumes. And there are no statistics that give it to you in full view. But this is the Reserve Bank statistics on the top right hand corner. You can see that institutional banking in markets on a Reserve Bank basis up 19%, Ian mentioned earlier. The actual lending balances for the whole book in institutional banking are up 15%.</p>
          <p>In Bankwest, it's a continuation of the story I talked about before, so the legacy book continues to run off as we get rid of those problem accounts. But pleasingly, we are growing our new business in that area at above system. And so overall, again, good margins in corporate banking, as you can see, and so that's one of the areas we have been targeting and you can see that we are growing in the areas where the margins are strong.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, this is a very resilient result given what's been happening to the market. So, markets have come down 11%, and yet as you can see, not the story in the individual pieces in wealth. So, in global asset management, funds under management are down 2% and that reflects then in 2% down in income. In corporate &#x2013; in Colonial Financial Services, it's up 2% for funds under administration, but in that business of course there has been a huge swing out of the higher-margin equities businesses into cash, and so some margin pressure there coupled with the costs of regulation and compliance, and obviously right now an area of great focus from regulatory, cost point of view and lots of system work to do.</p>
          <p>And then in common shore, 12% growth in commission &#x2013; in premium income, but offset by a run-off of the legacy books on funds management and superannuation. Very pleasing to see and of course the reason why our Global Asset Management business is doing well that's still 67% of their funds are performing above benchmark and good strong flows into the retail platforms.</p>
          <p>So let's have a look at funding and liquidity. And the story here clearly is 62% deposit funded by far and away the largest deposit portfolio in Australia, has contributed $30 billion more funding this year. And that's more than paid for the $25 billion increase in lending that's happened. The rest of the story really is about liquids. You can see a $16 billion growth in liquid assets which is funded out of that excess deposits, the equity that we've raised during the year, a little bit more long-term debt and a little bit more short-term debt but that has contributed to that enormous stack that you see there of $135 billion of liquids.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital and on a Basel II basis our capital is sitting at 10%, that's up 0.110 basis points on December with 30 basis points as Ian or 34 basis points of organic capital growth offset by the introduction of Basel 2.5 and new capital measures that have knocked 20 basis points off. On an FSA basis, our capital sits at 13.6%. I think it's worth noting both for Basel II capital and Basel III capital that we have not got advanced accreditation from Bankwest. We are moving to get that over this coming 12 month period and that should add 30 basis points to both Basel II and Basel III Tier 1 common equity.</p>
          <p>So I flagged earlier that we were going to review our capital policy with the introduction of Basel III and we've done a lot of work around this looking at the regulations as they've become clearer, talking to rating agencies about their needs, looking at what our global peers are doing, looking at bottom-up capital build on an economic capital basis, and in particular paying a lot of attention to a number of very detailed stress tests we've done to see how volatile our capital is. And of course the truth is that our capital is not very volatile compared to most peers and that's because we have a very large mortgage portfolio that tends to be stable. We have &#x2013; we operate primarily in Australia and New Zealand which are well regulated stable mature markets and we have a very small investment banking presence. So those things tend to say relatively low volatility of capital which is important in setting than what sort of targets do you need to maintain for capital.</p>
          <p>We are also very conscious that from 2016 the Basel III rules will bring in a capital conservation buffer to 2.5% and that is as the word implies about conserving capital it's a buffer it's meant to be pierced in the case of extreme stress and so we've borne that in mind as well although as I said it only comes in in 2016. So taking all of those things into account, our board has set us a target of holding more than 9% Basel III harmonized common equity Tier 1 capital and we are sitting at 9.8% at the moment. Interestingly, up 42% from the beginning of the GFC. So there has certainly been a story as there has with all banks around the world of significant capital growth over this period and of course one of the reasons why our return on equity is down a little bit this period is because we've added 9% to our capital over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Now we've got a note that the rules are not fully finalized. APRA released an exposure draft just recently on domestic significantly important banks, we don't have that will play out with all of the banks in Australia are talking to APRA at the moment about operational risk capital and so I suspect there will be some tweaking and a little bit of volatility in these capital numbers for a little while to come while all the rules are just finalized and worked through.</p>
          <p>I think it's also important to think about how this capital compares against peers and one of the reasons that we think it's very important to talk about globally harmonized capital is that finally we get a chance to actually compare the Australian banks to international. We've had U.S. banks reporting under Basel I. We've had U.K. and European banks reporting under different calculations of Basel II capital. But what you see here, thanks to some excellent research by Morgan Stanley, is what the banks will look like under Basel III under the final rules in 2019. And I'm sure that you can see that at an 8.4% average for the global peers, the Australian banks, and particularly CBA is substantially above that average obviously at the strong end of capital, and I am sure also that as analysts in this room look at their own bank scores, they see that none of the analysts banks are within 1% of CBA. I am sure you'll be writing that in your newsletters, so look forward to reading about it.</p>
          <p>Just turning to dividends, and of course with capitals, we have also looked at dividends. We have been speaking to our shareholders who say not surprisingly they like a strong stable steady dividend. They want to see that we're paying out our franking credits as much as we can. And so the board has confirmed that our target payout ratio is between 70% and 80%, and this particular dividend is set in the middle of that range at 75%.</p>
          <p>We're also conscious that our interim dividend has historically been quite low and our final dividend quite high. So to give more of that stability, we are flagging that in future we'll be paying around 70% of our interim profits out as interim dividends, so that should make the calculation pretty easy. We are going to continue with the dividend reinvestment plan because our retail shareholders like that, but with no discount. And however, having said that our shareholders like it, a time is going to come when enough is enough is enough on capital growth, and so we are also flagging that the way we'll manage that is by where we want to by buying back that DRP so as not having that dilutionary effect on capital.</p>
          <p>So let me just summarize by showing firstly &#x2013; we are in a period obviously of revenue challenge. We are in the new low credit gross environment, which is going to continue. Net interest margins are under pressure with all the competition and we are meeting that challenge by making sure that we are looking at productivity across the board and we have shown that we can control costs well. At the same time, it's really about having a very strong balance sheet and what we still see is unpredictable times, and so we have 62% deposit funding, high liquid assets and 10% capital.</p>
          <p>So with those words Ian, would you like to talk about the forecast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. It always feels by now a bit like ancient history when we're talking about results which finished at the end of June and we are now already half way through the next quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook, we are still happy to have such a strong link with the Australian economy because our base view as I said at the time of our strategy update in April is that the medium to long-term prospects for the Australian economy are very strong. But, we don't yet see any signs of a catalyst for really greater stability in Europe and therefore reducing the uncertainty overhang which is across the economy. And we have certainly got a view that until that overhang is resolved, we're going to be still in relatively subdued conditions. We can't yet see a path by which that's got to happen. And that suggests continued global volatility.</p>
          <p>So our base case settings are that we're going to continue in this environment of relatively subdued credit growth, but I do want to come back to what I've said at the start. At the point that you are saying that home lending system growth is roughly at nominal GDP we are not at GDP's roughly a trend. We are certainly not in a zero credit growth environment. We actually see this as being closer to the long-term outlook than the old 10%, 12%, 14% numbers were. We do consider, because of the combination of regulatory pressures and markets that the pressure on deposit costs will continue, and of course we are all as David alluded to in capital and in liquidity and other areas and in terms of some of the regulations in wealth management, we're all going to continue to be evolving to new regulatory regimes and we're going to need to be prepared to absorb the cost of that and adopt new business models where necessary.</p>
          <p>So our approach, we remain of the view that it's too dangerous to just project a base case and turn the whole ship towards it. We have a number of different scenarios and we tend to put our core settings towards the more conservative of some of those scenarios. We will continue very much to have a long-term focus, but we are cognizant the short-term performance is critical A because of the expectations of shareholders and B to make sure that we maintain the confidence of our investors to execute the long-term strategy. And we will continue in the coming year with a particularly focus on our productivity initiatives and our technology investments to ensure that we have good cost management.</p>
          <p>So in summary, before we go to questions, we described this result was predictable and that's not to damn it with faint praise. I think predictable is exactly what you want from a Commonwealth Bank and you want that in this environment and that is a pretty predictable result. The revenue is consistent with the environment, as I've talked about, you've seen good cost discipline, ongoing credit quality and maintenance of strong balance sheet savings in terms of focus of the management and the board very much maintaining on long-term total shareholder return and return on equity.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand back to our Warwick and we'll go though some questions.</p>

          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I just wanted to ask on the ROE, it's dropped a fair bit obviously due to the increase in capital. If we look at capital, you look very good on a harmonized basis, but on an APRA fully adjusted basis you're bit lower than the peers. Just wondering what the expectation is for the ROE. I mean if that 7.5 moves up to eight where the other peers are saying that's obviously going to drag a bit further on the ROE, just if you could sort of give us your view as to where CBAs ROE will ultimately end up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me give you a couple of general comments. Then, David, you can see whether you want to add anything. James, as you know, we don't give forecasts. So to the extent of what's the numerator going to do, you will have your own models to predict that. I would emphasize here the point that we've made though which is the impact of markets business on the overall profit and that is critical when we're talking about the numerator, because although we've signaled that system growth's okay, we've got margin pressure, we're seeing a significant impact on the markets businesses and your assumptions on matters like CVA, what the ASX is going to do, volumes, et cetera, are becoming more important in determining long run ROE than they used to be. And I think it's important to see this result in the context of that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the denominator, look, there are a couple of effects here, A has David has mentioned the story is not yet over in terms of the impact of Basel III and we talked just about -- David mentioned two of the aspects which is APRA still having discussions with all the Australian major banks on operational risk capital that we're only at stage I really of the domestic strategically important banks and what that's going to mean. And so, making a prediction as to what the ultimate capital level is going to be is quite difficult. What we do have a reasonably high degree of confidence on given our business mix and our execution capability is our ability to outperform our peers because the facts that I've talked about are pretty much common across all the major banks in Australia. Where that ends up in terms of a long-run ROE there is quite a bit of variability in at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just add to that one point, which is I think there is this misunderstanding that all banks are equal. Each bank has to look at and I'm sure APRA looks at this as well, it's composition of where it operates, what sort of business it operates in, what its risk history is and so on. So each bank will have different volatility of capital and therefore will have different capital targets, so not all banks are equal.</p>

          <p>Jon Mott?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just going to take &#x2013; sorry; Jon Mott from UBS. I'm going to follow up on that point and if you do look at the slide -- it's slide 45 -- where you've come out with the harmonized target of 9%, if you compare that to some of the comments <mark type="ph" /> NAB (36:23) yesterday which is their APRA based target is for Basel III, 8.00 to 8.25, which equates to roughly a harmonized of about 10. All banks aren't created equal, but that's the whole purpose of Basel III harmonized is to try and get around that to take into account risk weights and other factors there.</p>
          <p>So two parts of the question, firstly, are you comfortable having a target for Basel III harmonized core Tier 1, which is roughly 100 basis points lower than one of your domestic peers? And secondly, if you are running at 9.8% currently which is well above that new target you've just provided, does that imply that the board will now be comfortable increasing the payout ratio on the dividend towards the top of the 70% to 80% dividend payout band going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me again comment first then, David, you can add. Yes we are comfortable, why are we comfortable. Number one, I mean APRA's capital level is not the binding constraint on the businesses. All of you will be aware at the moment, the binding constraint really on the business is making sure we are happy on all five levels of capital, the ways of looking at capital, of which probably the most significant at the moment is the way -- is the market's expectations of us.</p>
          <p>APRA as a prudential regulator has individual discussions with all of us about a prudential capital ratio. We know ours, we don't know the others. In light of what we know about our own prudential capital ratio, we are very comfortable with where we stand on the APRA target. Now that's subject to the unknowns which I've talked about, particularly on operational risk capital and domestic subs.</p>
          <p>In terms of the globally harmonized basis, look, it's a very fair question and we've talked about this. We've got a target of nine. We're sitting at 9.8. Why? And the answer is because there is still a degree of uncertainty about where this is all going to end up. We've got a capital policy here which we've made quite clear, but there are bits of the moving targets which we're not entirely sure about yet, and so we just need to be careful and we're always going to be careful by overweighting at the moment, which is what we are doing relative to that target.</p>
          <p>The impact on the dividend is always going to need to be talked about at the time. I mean, it's a balance between the desires of the shareholders which David has talked about, we've made a real effort to understand. Our expectations for growth and the need to have more capital and support credit risk-weighted assets, the changes in what the Basel III regulations might be, et cetera. So, we are going to need to look at the dividends period by period. I think the range that David talked about is the range we are committed to and you can see that the circumstance at the moment is appropriate to be bang in the middle of that range, which is at 75.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew Lyons, RBS. Just a further question on the ROA particularly around the denominator. What was particularly evident was the growth in your net assets in the second half was 7%, which is clearly a pretty significant drag on the ROA. And then you compare that to the growth in your Tier 1 regulatory capital at only 3%. Can you perhaps just detail in just exactly what nuances was the driving the gap between the growth in those two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; I mean obviously credit quality. It's all to do with mix, I mean, credit quality is improving. So risk-weighted assets are not growing as fast as the others. When you &#x2013; you've got to look at and I think some analysts have been caught a little bit by surprise by generation second half versus the first half. Of course, you've got to look at the relative size of the dividend, so the final dividend under Basel III dividends accounted for on a cash basis. So the interim dividend and the final dividend are different. Final dividend is paid in the first half, the interim dividend in the second half, so there is sort of a degree of volatility there. But we are happy to take you through each of the detailed components and in fact it's in the PA if you want to go through it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Just first of all, thanks Morgan Stanley for putting that capital chart together and putting us down the bottom end of the capital. We will note that.</p>
          <p>Question for you, Ian. Look, a lot of the results today are focused on a full Y 2012 versus FY 2011 comparison. You have used the terms of solid and momentum continuing, but in reality the new information released today is the second half result and if you look at second half numbers on the first half, we have 1% drop in revenue growth. We have 1% drop in underlying profit growth. ROE on a cash basis -- your basis of 18.1%. So wanted to reconcile your comments of solid and momentum continuing versus some of those metrics that really in all reality look like momentum slowing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod, I think the response to that is along the themes I have mentioned. So for example, the credit valuation adjustment. I think two thirds of that was in the second half. That's a really big swing factor on <mark type="ph" /> IBNN (41:20). The markets businesses all had poorer second half. So, we're seeing that the same story as I told generally coming through explaining exactly the half-on-half performance. In fact, I think if you look in the profit announcement you'll see that overall for the group home lending volumes, particularly for the retail bank, picked up a bit in the second half relative to the overall year growth rate at 2% half-on-half, 3% year-on-year. So, it is a bit of swings and roundabouts.</p>
          <p>The other fact that's obviously important here in margin is when are you going to see the effects of the re-pricing that was done on the standard variable rate and the full effect of that obviously isn't in these results, because a couple of the movements happened during the period that we're talking about.</p>
          <p>So, I'm definitely not here to tell you that the second half of the year was a gangbuster's return to great revenue. But I think the performance in the second half still shows that the momentum there is in the business. I am always seeing that relative to the environment and the environments remain pretty much as it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just add to that? Don't forget this is three fewer working days in the second half to the first. So, we always, on the net interest income line, always have a hit in the second half versus the first. It's just timing of when we report. So I think you've got to bear that in mind as well.</p>
          <p>And as Ian said, the timing, so clearly this particular half year was characterized by a fairly prolonged period of costs of funding going up quite dramatically, but that wasn't recouped in home loans till May <mark type="ph" /> end of (42:43) June. So, most of the impact of the home loan re-pricing will be in the next financial year. So, there is timing differences.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Craig Williams from Citi. I suppose along the similar lines to what Jarrod was noting. You got more capital than you need, your funding mix is improving and your cost performance was a question mark coming into this result for people and you've got a <mark type="ph" /> kick (43:09) for that. You talk about three extra business days in the second half and all that stuff, but reality is your revenue growth has been below your cost growth for two years. Now, so how much confidence can you have in the technology edge that you've proclaimed the customer satisfaction now, which is very competitive actually converting into revenue growth from here to reverse that situation on jaws?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got a lot of confidence in it. Again, I don't want to sort of harp on about this because quite rightly one day things like CVA will be turn around and then we will be talking about as if it's the most wonderful thing in the world, but let me just give you this as an example because it's a live example. When you've got a $200 million turnaround on a credit valuation adjustment, that is equivalent to 2% expense growth. And you can make a management decision to pursue jaws above everything else and say let's hack the 2% out in order to compensate for the credit valuation adjustment. As long-term stewards of the business we just think that's a dumb decision. So I think David has made clear for a long period of time and I certainly agree with it that we've really got to manage jaws carefully, but what we won't do is try and adjust the expense base short term in order reflect short-term cyclical markets businesses.</p>
          <p>That said, I have a view, my management team has a view, that the business of our core banking is changing. That the volumes that we're seeing at the moment are different from the days when the recipe for growing was just open the doors and 12% credit growth will come in, and we need to be prepared to transform a cost base to achieve that and that's why we've got this long-term view of productivity.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just also add &#x2013; just for the sake of factual accuracy. We haven't had two years of negative jaws. They're positive last year, they were flat in the first half of the year, but certainly down in the second half, so you're right. Clearly we're addressing the jaws and there are timing differences on that but then the rest of Ian's points.</p>

          <p>Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just on slide 30. I think there was some &#x2013; you just showed the PD upgrades, downgrades, slide on that. And it looks like there has been net downgrades in the last half, but then Craig -- so David Craig, you also mentioned that you had the credit risk-weighted assets improving in quality there. So I just wanted to firstly marry those items together about the risk-weighted asset growth not being as much as what the downgrades would suggest. And secondly, can you give us a bit more color around where those downgrades happening and any concerns around that or any further pockets of risk or whether it's just still the usual suspects just working their way through?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going ask Alden in a minute just to give a bit of an overview on sort of overall credit quality. While he is clearing his throat, the PD ratings migration issue is something we look at very closely. The fact that you've got to bear in mind here is that a downgrade from what we call a D1 to a D2, which is a really decent credit down to a pretty decent credit, is captured in this with equal weighting to something going from performing to non-performing. And those are obviously very different from the point of view of what's happening with the client and very different from the impact they have on credit risk-weighted assets and provisioning. So this is a number that we look at, but it's a very blunt instrument and it's best seen in the context of all the other things we've talked about just in terms of the overall credit quality and the provisioning, but you might want to talk a bit about what's happening in the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more of a nuanced expanding upon what Ian just said. The big drivers of credit risk-weighted assets are the lower pass-grade credits, and those have historically over this last year been more upgrades and downgrades. So it's the higher graded credits slipping a little bit that is factored into this ratio that disproportionately influencing this ratio relative to the risk-weighted assets, which are been benefited in the converse direction by the low past grade credits actually having more upgrades than downgrades.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>There would be things that would be in the BBB category going down just a little bit of a notch S&amp;P equivalent. So it's &#x2013; sorry, yeah, it's a mix in the industries, so the things that we talked about in the past in terms of retailing and that sort of thing. But importantly the low grade credits are more improving than down grading.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And its Ian the other thing I'll just add overall is the story that we've been talking about for the last couple of years particularly in respect of businesses that are on the wrong side of the high dollar just remains. And you all know this in lot of your writing about it, but the interesting thing we are doing a lot of thinking at the moment is that as terms of trade have come back a bit, the Aussie dollar hasn't given us as much back as it normally would, because there's just this fundamental support for the currency because of the strength of the government, economically. And so I think that's another fact we are seeing here, the same story we've been telling you probably for the last two or three years in terms of the patterns in the economy remains.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Victor German from Nomura. Ian, if I could just draw your attention to the comments that you've made in the outlook statement where you say that current revenue trends are likely to continue as we just discussed in the second half, revenue was pretty much negative and throughout of the year was just slightly up. Consensus currently has about 4% revenue growth for the bank. Are you just being ultra conservative, would you think the market is just missing something that you are seeing in terms of tough operating environment out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are pretty conservative and I think we &#x2013; I would say our general settings and views are probably on the conservative end of the market. The way we look at things at the moment, we have got the Australian dollar effect which I just talked about. We can clearly see that in terms of the uncertainty which is impacting the market's businesses, I don't think anybody here's yet got a better view than they had when we were here six months ago about how Europe works itself out and I am not smart enough to be able to see the path by which that's going to be resolved. Our view on that organizationally isn't probably we are at the precipice and we're about to see an absolute disaster but by the same token we can't see the catalyst for improvement.</p>
          <p>So we are just working on a sort of base scenario that things are going to keep pretty rocky as they are at the moment which is okay system growth on credit continuing pressure on margins because of funding costs and competition and continuing issues with the market's businesses just because their uncertainty is just going to keep flowing through into them. So I am not saying specifically take a point in time over a three month period and extrapolate it but I am saying the broad forces that you are seeing in the business now are going to continue we think for the next 6 to 12 months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Richard Wiles, Morgan Stanley. Ian I've got a question about the institutional bank strategy. During the year, the loans were up more than 15% and yet the revenue and the preprovision profit fell. Even if you take out the markets income which I am assuming includes that CVA move that you referred to a number of times today, the revenue growth was 6%. So it significantly lagged the loan growth. I wonder if you could explain why as CEO of a high return low risk bank you are happy with a strategy in the institutional division that appears to be balance sheet led and looks like it will dilute the group ROE and could well lower the risk profile &#x2013; increase the risk profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm happy and look Ian, you can comment on this if you want to add anything but I guess since you asked whether I'm happy as the CEO I should answer the CEO. I have got a long term view of the business and what I can tell you categorically is that the growth in lending assets has not been accompanied by any change at all in risk appetite. What we have done looking at the Commonwealth Bank group and I mention is very consistent with what I said in February and at the strategy update as we look at markets like Canada where you've got Royal Bank of Canada and the other big banks really having a significant institutional presence.</p>
          <p>We have a look at the fact with the greatest of respect that a lot of the global banks have had to reduce presence in Australia because Australia is non-core and that's leaving good people with an opportunity looking for somewhere Australian to work and we have got access to good customer base, we have got great technology to drive the transactional banking. And so what we are focusing on is not changing risk appetite to grow gangbusters, it's actually slowly and deliberately building capability to get to a market position which we think is an appropriate one given the scale of the franchise, I mean we are a $90 billion company, we are in the top ten banks in the world by market cap which is a function of the environment but the fact that we are so underweight institutional banking in our domestic market which we know well. We all know the CEOs, where Ian knows the CEOs, it doesn't make sense. So as we are looking for a way to grow, it's obviously a good place to look.</p>

          <p>Richard, can I add to that before just so to give some clarity too. Spot balances are up 15%, that's correct. But they are up 15% on 30 June last year. If you go back to 30 June the year before, they were down broadly 15%. So average interest earning assets for the two years for institutional banking market are up pretty much flat and so the increase in revenue is off stronger performance and interest margin on average interest earning assets being flat, but obviously there's fantastic momentum for the reasons Ian has just talked about coming into the new financial year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's assume for the moment that there is no change in the risk profile. You had a slide that flagged a 40% increase in capital ratio since 2007. We're in an environment where funding is scarce and in fact funding from the corporate market is expensive. It seems to me that this strategy will dilute the group ROE even if the risk profile of the institutional bank hasn't changed?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at every loan we make on a risk adjusted capital weighted basis and we're making very good money in that area. So we absolutely take into account the regulatory and economic capital associated with those loans and I can assure you that they are good profitable loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the loan, is the 15% loan growth likely to deliver an ROE that's above the 18.5% that you're delivering at the group level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But the other thing it's really important to understand we're building a long-term strategy and you don't build long-term strategies by extrapolating six month performance and going out four or five years. Our base case for some period of time is going to &#x2013; has been that balance sheet lending generally for the corporate clients is going to get less and less and less which is the whole reason we've built the total capital solutions strategy which is going very well. So to say gosh it's 15%, have you got an appetite to grow institutional banking at 15% half on half for the next 10 years, of course we haven't. This is just a point in time at the market and we are happy with how it's going. Do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a lending led strategy, in fact of the four I'd say we are the least lending led, our whole strategy around total capital solutions is being born out in a whole range of other things, 38% new to bank, transaction banking clients, 33% growth in market sales year-on-year, the number one leading capital markets lead for Australian corporates over the last year again. So very much the engagement with the clients is across the whole capital solution from working capital lending, capital markets, equity raising transaction banking, and if the inference is we're growing volume by reducing margin, that's not the case.</p>

          <p>Thank you Warwick. Good morning everyone. Couple of questions on asset quality, the first relating to new impaired assets in the second half were up about $300 million on the first half. Just interested if you could provide some color on what divisions saw the increase there given your overall comment about improving asset quality? And the second question related to the chart on slide 106 around 30 days home loan arrears. The 2008 and 2009 cohorts, they look like they are peaking, but it's not entirely clear, so I'm just interested in your views on whether those years have peaked and whether you actually saw any losses on those loans?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthew, we'll just hand over to Alden to answer that question for you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking the second part first. The financial year 2008, 2009 vintages, we're coming from a fairly rapid growth in origination with no real major credit settings that would drive that, just a capability to underwrite those at the time. But we've had some issues in our credit collection department that &#x2013; and including as we report this a fair and full attribution of hardship into the arrears, that's not common across the industry. So we have the appearance of higher arrears in those vintages in part because of time and place and in part because of the collections process that got behind on those particular vintages a bit, now reversing quite dramatically. You see the quality of the new book being performance quite good. We view those as some of our most profitable portfolios because of the margins that were booked there and we would not second guess the decisions at that time although we've had to make some adjustments in our credit collections department, but modest and well under way.</p>
          <p>In terms of the impaired, the impaired story is a relatively benign story. There are still some sectors in the economy that are under stress; retailing tourism and that sort of thing, but that's the same story that we've had for some time.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Chris Williams from UBS. I've got a question on slide 41, and at the risk of picking on second half like an unwanted stepchild. Your 12 month disclosures there, the buckets that I'm particularly focusing on here are the customer deposits, term funding, the liquidity and the lending. And if we look at the first half, second half splits, in the first half you did $21 billion of that $30 billion of customer deposits to only $9 billion in the second half. You did $7 billion of wholesale funding in the first half and $22 billion in the second half which is obviously explainable by market conditions. Your liquid assets went up $16 billion of that $16 billion in the first half and zero in the second half. And your lending was roughly equivalent, $13 billion first half, $12 billion second half. So, my question about that really is in three parts.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the deposit growth subsystem and not fully funding lending. Can you talk to the rate environment and whether that's a satisfactory outcome in your view? Secondly that leads into a question about the mix of funding with the net stable funding ratio as a backdrop. And the third question is around liquidity balances in the context of the ongoing global volatility uncertainty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me take those and then David and if she wants to, <mark type="ph" /> Lynn (1:00:18) can add to this as well. Look, as I said before, we've talked a lot for a lump of years about wholesale funding, but I'm not telling anything you don't know by saying that the competitive environment for deposits is critical. For us, there are clearly two factors you balance when you're looking at the trade-off you want between margin and volume and deposits. Number one is the cost the deposit relative to the next best substitute of funding subject to number two, which is making sure you have a base level of deposits as a percentage of total funding that you're happy with and we do. So, we've gone from 61% to 62% in terms of deposit funded.</p>
          <p>There is no magic in that number, but there's clearly an upward trajectory there which signals our intent. We are very comfortable with that. We are very careful though particularly as the largest stock of deposits in Australia not to chase all sorts of deposits at any cost. And so what you will find during the year and our core banking platform has enabled us to do this a lot better is that in any given day, week, month or period, we might chose to make different decisions on that balance of deposits versus other sources of funding than in others, but you can see overall what the trajectory is and I think that's the important thing to look towards.</p>
          <p>In terms of the liquids, we had this discussion I think we were at 134 in February and we were saying, we are not quite sure what the environment is like now we are at 135. We are still in the environment that we are in. There are aspects of net stable funding ratio in terms of what you are talking about with deposits the overall level and classification of liquids which are still the subject of debate with APRA. And that's &#x2013; that uncertainty is another thing we need to take into account. So we feel pretty good about where the liquids stand as well as a balance between what we need to reflect the current environment and also the fact that we are obviously all needing to build towards an end state which is not yet completely defined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just so perhaps add to that? Firstly I think I can see why a number of our peers are trying to move away from quarterly reporting let alone maybe half yearly reporting because at the end of the day, there are two aspects. Firstly, we have a clear long term strategy which is to make profit and to be safe. And that manifests itself in the short term in the very short term obviously in lots of different ways. So the market is moving very quickly on competition on pricing of deposits, on availability of funding in the long term markets. So we will always move say on the long term market side to raise money when it's cheapest and most available and there is a timing thing there.</p>
          <p>On deposits, we will react, as Ian said, every day of the week to what the competition is but we are not interested in losing money on deposits and at sometimes during the period there has been very uneconomic pricing. On mix and timing of funding though, we have very consistent settings around our balance sheet, so you may look at flow but when you look at the balance sheet itself it's been hitting in the one direction very safe and the liquid balances move according to what's happening in Europe and how we feel about things that that's again an ongoing management decision. But again on net stable funding ratio and those sort of things we are very comfortable with the direction we are heading although there is still some uncertainty about final definitions, but remember 2018 for that one we are very comfortable about the path that we are hitting, I don't know if you want.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Scott Manning from JP Morgan. Just on the day scale, I think there was a leap year this year. So I think there might only be a two day difference, not a one day difference. So by my calculations you actually got a net interest income boost but you didn't pay everyone an extra day.</p>
          <p>Two questions, firstly, just on the ROE do you consider a line in the sand for the ROE in terms of capital generation and fulfilling dividend requirements for shareholders and do you look at that in absolute or relative terms, i.e. 15% or hey we're at 13% but everyone else is 10% we're still pretty happy. Or secondly, on the branches, if you are talking about 5% housing credit growth going forward is that enough approvals coming through the system with broker approvals and push to online and all of this tech investment to sustain the branch footprint that you currently have longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me take those two questions. First of all, on the branch footprint there is a really important long term question. We have got a competitive advantage not only in our branch footprint but in the quality of the interactions we're providing in the branches. What we will say though is that the branches in terms of how they deal with customers are undergoing a fundamental transformation and you can see in the materials -- I think there is a page later on, page 80 which just shows you the use of electronic channels, et cetera. This is a structural change in the market and we absolutely are going to be adapting to it.</p>
          <p>So what I can tell you is that the format of the branches is going to look very different over time than how it looks today. Going to be more geared towards interactions with customers who choose face-to-face interaction which we believe will still happen and less geared towards the transactions which can happen remotely. What that means in terms of overall footprint numbers -- we're just going to need to see at the time. We don't have a point-to-point view it's going to be x numbers of points or presence, we just know it's going to look different and feel quite different. And with the branch refurbishment program which has us on shorter term leases then we used to we've got more flexibility than we had to do that.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question about the ROE, look, we don't have a line in the sand or a number above which or below which we won't go. The way we do look at it is under a number of different scenarios relating to our expectations of the profit generation, what we want to pay out in dividend, what the capital requirements are going to be, and we balance that. It's probably fair to say we have more of a relative look at that than we have an absolute look at that, but both of them are important. And I think I said when we got ask this question six months ago, look, when the ROE for that period was 19.5%, look, I can see scenarios where it's over 20% and I can see scenarios where it's down at 17%. And it all depends on what you believe in terms of the numerator in the capital requirements and that's something which we need to be prepared to manage a bit more dynamically than perhaps we used to have to.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. My question is in relation to re-pricing of your assets book. So, we have seen NAB increase <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:04) more than peers in May and June of this year and we've recently seen them increase their liquidity margin on business lines by 20 basis points. So given NABs being the sector's price leader in recent years, are you now contemplating systematic re-pricing of your business banking book to help mitigate your NIM decline?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you'll understand the reasons why I can't answer that question, but I can just tell you that we've got more than one competitor and we look at all of them and we make our pricing decisions very dynamically. We certainly are not driven on any product or part of the business by the moves of one competitor.</p>

          <p>Good morning, gents. Ian, before you slash your wrists because everyone is saying it's shocking, I had two questions. The first one is, is a summary of this result basically that you've had mistiming between re-pricing the various loan books and basically the cost of funds continuing to rise, which will probably reverse in the next quarter?</p>

          <p>Hi, Brian, I think it's fair to say, APRA is still working through that, I mean the whole level III capital rules are all about it having a transferrable surplus amount. So even at this point of time it's not even a percentage based capital ratio in the way that we are used to seeing it. So no, we can't really comment on its impact under a Basel III common equity Tier 1 or Basel II common equity Tier 1 level yet. It's still in the works. And we'll find about I think about the middle of next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Brett Le Mesurier, BBY. David a question following up on few things that you said so far today, the expense growth was 3% in the past year, we've got some pluses and minuses going forward, so maybe 3% is the right sort of number to think about going forward. You have also indicated that the cost of income ratio was likely to fall in the 2013 financial year. So income growth has to be in your mind somewhere around the 4% given that credit growth is likely to be 5%, maybe 6% if we get really lucky. So you're managing towards a NIM decline of about five points, is what it sounds like. So what I am really getting to is what gives you confidence that NIM would only fall by that sort of number given that the funding cost impact is really quite significant? You're relying on ongoing loan rate pricing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brett, the other thing I'd say on this and you yourself said it in a note this morning, I think you were right. You can't look at this business given its breadth just by taking system growth times market share times margin because there are a whole lot of markets businesses involved as well, and it's really -- I think you made the point that in your note that what we are seeing now is the volatility, the slower growth in business, in the core bank means it doesn't hide the volatility of the market's business as much which I totally agree with. But the reality is you need to change a couple of assumptions on the market businesses to make that picture you have outlined look entirely different.</p>

There was a very large and adverse experience variation, there was commentary about adverse claims experience and lapses, but the number was so large, I was hoping we could get some more detail as to what was going on there in particular the claims experience was that about disability or was something else going on there and did interest rates have an impact on it?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the life of business, the life insurance business as a whole, we are actually really pleased with the performance. So all insurance lines have performed well. We have got, we are looking at net inflows premium growth of 20%, now we are looking at 11% on insurance income and I think we are seeing claims performance in line with the industry and also lapse performance has been challenging and there has been an industry wide phenomenon and if you look recently at the moves by FSC on managing the lapse, I think you will understand that industry wide phenomenon because the FSC is looking to manage the lapse ratios across the industry in those lapse experiences, so I think you are right on that.</p>
