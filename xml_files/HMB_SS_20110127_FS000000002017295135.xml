        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H&amp;M Full-Year Report Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Nils Vinge. Please begin your meeting sir and I will be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, everybody, and welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's full year and third quarter &#x2013; fourth quarter results, sorry. The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, is with me today and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide fourth quarter 2010. Sales were strong in the quarter, increasing 15% in local currencies. Converted into SEK, sales rose 6% to SEK 29.7 billion. Sales in comparable units rose 7%. We believe our investments in an improved customer offering contributed to the strong development. Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased to SEK 18.8 billion, corresponding to a gross margin of 63.2%, a high level historically, but of course below exceptionally high comparable of 66.3%.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2009, the whole industry benefited from highly favorable external factors. The impact from these factors, such as supplier capacity, transportation costs and raw material prices, has been substantial. In the past year, they have shifted from very positive to neutral and now negative. Raw material prices have risen sharply. The price on cotton, our single most important raw material, has been rising since 2009 and is now at historical high.</p>
          <p>On comparing the two quarters, one should keep in mind that we had a positive effect in the fourth quarter of 2009, also from our old currency hedging policy of around SEK 340 million or 120 basis points. Such effects will impact comparison also in Q1 and Q2 before they will disappear.</p>
          <p>Markdowns in relation to sales in the fourth quarter were at the same level as the year before. SG&amp;A increased by 10% to SEK 11.7 billion. As a share of sales, cost increased 140 basis points. The increase can be explained by investments in the strengthening the H&amp;M brand further and creating an even better platform for profitable growth long term.</p>
          <p>Increased investments are mainly within marketing. Around two-thirds of the rise in cost of sales was, of course, from marketing and IT. Slightly higher store staffing also had an effect. The operating margin was strong at 23.8%. Moreover, on that a year earlier margin that was very high and it was impacted by highly favorable external factors which all turned negative for the fourth quarter of 2010 and inflated by currency hedges.</p>
          <p>Profit in financial items was SEK 7.2 billion compared to slightly below SEK 8 billion a year before. Net profit was SEK 5.5 billion, corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 3.32 compared to SEK 3.72. As you know, the number of shares was doubled on the 1st of June, as a result of the 2:1 share split.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at the full year, please turn to the slide full-year 2010. For the full year, sales rose also 15% in local currencies; and in comparable units, the increase was 5%. Converted to SEK, sales reached just above SEK 108 billion excluding VAT, a rise of 7%.</p>
          <p>Gross profit for the year was SEK 68.3 billion, an increase of 9%, generating a gross margin of 62.9% compared to 61.6%. SG&amp;A for the year amounted to SEK 43.6 billion against SEK 40.8 billion in 2009. The increase is mainly related to new stores. Cost of sales were in line with 2009. Operating margin reached 22.7%, historically a very good level. Net financial items were SEK 349 million compared to SEK 459 million, and profit after financial items grew by nearly SEK 3 billion to SEK 25 billion. The tax rate for the company for the year was 25.3%. So net profit for the year rose by 18% &#x2013; 14% growth to SEK 18.7 billion corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 11.29 compared to SEK 9.90 the year before. Sales developed well in most of our markets in 2010. The year saw some recovery in consumer demand compared to 2009, but the economy was still weak in many markets.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with the development in North America where the positive trends strengthened throughout the year in the U.S. and Canada. New stores were very well received. For example, our first opening in Portland and Phoenix attracted a lot of new customers. Sales were strong also in our large European markets such as Germany, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands and also in France.</p>
          <p>Conditions in Ireland and Greece remained challenging, although sales increased from weak year-earlier levels, and in Spain, the development improved. Norway and Switzerland reported weaker sales against tough comparables. In Asia, sales continued to be strong in China where we are expanding rapidly. China was actually the second largest expansion market in terms of new stores net in 2010. Russia too developed very well. We opened stores in three new markets last year, South Korea and Israel in the spring, and Turkey late autumn. The response from customers has been very positive in all three.</p>
          <p>Before we move on to our store and online expansion, a few words on sales after the end of fourth quarter and fourth quarter. In December, sales increased by 8% in local currencies and were unchanged in comparable units. Sales were negatively affected by heavy snow in many of H&amp;M's markets. In January, sales increased by 9% until the 25th. We opened 218 stores net in 2010 and had a total of 2,206 stores in 38 countries at the end of November, franchise and other brands included. In 2011, we plan to open a net of approximately 250 stores and will continue the expansion of online and catalogue sales, where we see great potential for future growth. As always, our focus is to expand with quality and high profitability.</p>
          <p>Expansion will continue in all H&amp;M markets this year with most new stores planned for China, the UK and the U.S. H&amp;M will expand into five new markets in 2011, Romania and Croatia in the spring, and Morocco and Jordan in the autumn through franchise. We will also open the first store in Singapore in the autumn, on best location in Orchard Road. We expand not only with new stores but also via online and catalogue sales. They are important complements to our stores.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M Shop Online had a good start in the UK in the autumn and we're very much looking forward to the planned start of online sales in the U.S. around year-end 2011. We're also renewing the H&amp;M Shop Online store in order to offer a more exciting shopping experience. The new store will be rolled out gradually to all our online and catalogue markets this spring. We actually launched it in Norway already day before yesterday. In parallel, the entire hm.com website will be fully renewed in all H&amp;M markets this spring, not only the online and catalogue sales markets. As I said, Norway already has the new website and also Portugal, that will offer improved functionality, more interaction and plenty of inspiration.</p>
          <p>Those were a few comments on our expansion and now looking at some key figures for 2010, please turn to the slide key data. Stock-in-trade was SEK 11.5 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the same time last year and 16% in local currencies. The stock-in-trade was well composed with a larger share of new garments compared to the same time a year before. We estimate markdowns in relation to sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 to be on the same level as last year.</p>
          <p>In relation to sales, the stock-in-trade was 10.6% compared to 10.1% the previous year and a good level historically. Cash flow from current operations increased by almost SEK 4 billion. The increase is explained mainly by the strong result. During the year, we invested nearly SEK 5 billion, mainly in new stores. Our current estimate on CapEx for the full-year 2011 is approximately SEK 6 billion.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, our finances remain strong. Liquid funds and short-term investments amounted to SEK 24.9 billion. The proposed dividend for the financial year 2010 is SEK 9.50, equivalent to 84% of earnings per share compared to SEK 8.00 per share the previous year. Return on equity was 44.1%, compared to 42.2% rolling 12 months.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, we are now happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Jeric Norvicky. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, company's name is Texti Richard. I have a question regarding the online and catalogue business, can you give us &#x2013; you don't give any figure for it, but can you say just maybe the percentage of business you are doing with online and catalogue business as of today and how profitable the business is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We get this question regularly, of course, and we always state that compared to the reasons, we are not ready to give the split. But on the profitability question, we say that we are &#x2013; it's on the same level as for the stores roughly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but percentage wise, you don't give out any number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, it's Richard Chamberlain here from BoA-Merrill Lynch. Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question on operating cost, please. OpEx rose by around 10% during the quarter. You say you've made some investments to strengthen the brand to try and drive better sales growth longer term, so things like marketing, IT development for the online business, do we expect those investments to continue in the first half of this year? And also maybe you could comment on staffing which appears to have &#x2013; staff costs have gone up despite like-for-like sales being just slightly better than the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the fourth quarter, we increased investments as you said in marketing and IT and for the coming two quarters, the investments are planned as well for marketing investments in Q1 and Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Q1 and Q2, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on &#x2013; yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but sorry for interrupting and of course, in Q4, that's one of the most intense quarters when it comes to our activities and our campaigns. So this might vary between different quarters during the year. But we didn't use TV as the commercial media last year but that we're adding in Q4 and that is also included in our activity plan for Q1 and Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that. And just a question please on distribution, how are you planning to change that to support your online sales development that's going to start in the U.S. and are you planning anymore changes to distribution to support online sales in Europe, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, to start with your first question regarding the U.S., this is just of course a very important question to reply and the thinking today is that we will outsource the big impact execution of the set up there but of course we will control it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the &#x2013; all the deliveries and everything and the logistics you're planning to outsource to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> yes, yes. And regarding Europe, we are continuously scaling up our logistics, as you know. And we are &#x2013; this year already and also for 2011, we are investing, we will invest more in the logistic facilities in Poland that we are extending investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the new one that we are setting up in Belgium that will be up and running this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So obviously, that's going to add a bit to cost in the short term, but I guess the final question for me then just going back to OpEx is I mean I think was it a few years ago, you gave out a long run target on OpEx of being between maybe 37% to 38% of sales going forward, is that still a realistic assumption for the longer term or should we be modeling something higher than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but as we have said in previous quarters, we don't want to be governed by a specific ratio when it comes to OpEx, but we think the ratio is decided on our ambitional activity level and our investments. So as I said, we have taken a step-up in Q4 when it comes to marketing activities and also investments in the IT and on online sales and therefore, Q1 and Q2, we are planning and having them in, for instance, the marketing in the activity plan but what the ratio will be, that will be of course dependent also on the sales and the topline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure, sure. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Gulliver. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Caroline Gulliver here from Espirito Santo. I had a couple of questions on pricing, please. And you said that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One at a time, please. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one at a time. You have said that you've invested in the customer offer in the fourth quarter, which had a negative effect on your gross margin. Are you now happy with your relative price position or do you feel you need to invest further to improve your relative price position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's true that last year, we've stated throughout the year that we have increased investments in the customer offering and we strongly believe that that had led to good result, the like-for-like increase of 5%, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>However, going forward, I mean this is &#x2013; now we always want to improve our customer offering and &#x2013; but we closely, of course, monitor what's happening in the sourcing market and the sales market and exactly how we're going to go forward is not something that we, for competitive reason, won't go into detail, of course, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And as Nils said that we are closely following what's happening in both the sourcing market and the sales market and of course, over time, we'll adapt to change conditions but how we will act in the future, that we want to keep to ourself for competitive reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And so, just to be clear, when you talked &#x2013; in the past, when you talked about increasing your customer offer, we're not necessarily talking in absolute terms, but you're not necessarily expecting prices to go down in absolute terms in 2011 but you may increase on a relative basis. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course, it's always different. We don't go into detail how we do it. As we've said, our price investments, it's a combination of different things. It's quality, improved quality, adding detail from some governments and the lower prices from other government. And for us, it's looking ahead. For us, it's always important to stick to our business idea to have the best offer, customer offer in each market and always aiming to &#x2013; versus the competitors, improve our, yeah, customer offer and thereby strengthening our position. But as I said, we are following what's happening in the sourcing market and sales market. And over time, yes, that will be adopted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, helpful. And one final one on tax if I may, the tax rate has fallen this year. Do you expect it to be 26% next year? I was just wondering if you could explain why it's fallen to 25.3% this year and why you expect it to return to 26% next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for next year, or for this year, we will expect the tax rate around 26%. And why it's lower, 25.3%, for 2010? It's always difficult. We are acting &#x2013; we are doing business in 30 different countries with different tax rate. And where we go into a new financial year, it's really hard to exactly know how the profits and the turnover, the profitability will be divided between the countries and that will always be a difference, but we choose to be prudent when we go out with 26%. But it will always &#x2013; it will probably seldom be exactly 26% because when we are going into a new financial year, we don't know exactly how it will be divided in profitability between other 30 countries.</p>

          <p>Hi. I was wondering if you could talk &#x2013; the investments that you are doing in order to drive sales, the sales growth didn't appear visible in the last two months with an implied flat like-for-like, can you talk or do you think it's the overall markets that were just down that much further than where you came out or did for whatever reason it not translate through during the important holiday season?</p>

          <p>I think, as always, it's a combination of many different factors and it's true that the investments we do, we are doing, have been doing is of course not only short-term, it's also long-term, the brand-building activities. And, of course, we had hoped for higher sales, that's for sure, but as you said, the markets have been challenging. As you know, in December, there has been a lot of snow, et cetera. And then in January, it's, of course, a very difficult month to draw any conclusions from because it's a lot of markdowns in the markets, and so it's difficult to judge.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and can you talk a little bit about how much more significant, I think, I saw a headline come across, so why are the &#x2013; you expect the rising cost to be more of a material impact on your business in the first half of this upcoming year than it was in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what sort of magnitude as far as the price increases you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's true that the macro environment, the external factors have been fairly changing from having been a strong headwind &#x2013; a tailwind to headwind and we saw the first of it now in Q4 and it will accelerate into Q1 and Q2. But the magnitude of it is of course very difficult to &#x2013; it's difficult to quantify, but it's &#x2013; again, I would like to remind, it's not just for H&amp;M, this is for the whole industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, no, of course. And then, if you &#x2013; one last question, on your dividend payout policy. I know historically, you've &#x2013; 80% has been the payout target. Obviously, it went above that this year. If earnings are in fact down next year, would you stay with that 80% payout or should we expect that to increase so you would keep the dividend flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the dividend is a question for the Board of H&amp;M and in the end for the Annual General Meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, I would just like to correct you, the &#x2013; it's not 80%. It's 50% and then each year, the Board can decide whether <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I think it's been about 80% for the last couple of years. I'm sorry about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, but the dividend policy states 50%.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but you &#x2013; no comment as far as if it could potentially be down next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as I say, it's a question for the Board and finally for the Annual General Meeting.</p>

          <p>All right, okay. And that from what you were saying, I think on the wire that markdown performance that we saw in the first quarter last year, quite a big increase in markdowns. That has prevented you seeing any recovery do you think for the first quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say they have affected the lead times, and one thing I could say we have slightly more exposure to Asia and that, of course, has an indirect effect. At the same time, we are working on the lead times continuously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and do you have any major changes to your sourcing base given the environment out there, i.e., sort of shifted certain customers in China into different markets?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen. It's Tony Shiret with Credit Suisse. A couple of factual questions to kick off with, can you tell us what your average selling prices were up in Q4 on a like-for-like basis and also what you are expecting to see in the first half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tony, the ASP is something we don't really want to go into detail because we think it's a case where it can misinterpreted, but we have stated in Q3 and Q4 that we have as a result of the investments in the improved customer offering, we have in some cases reduced prices. We also improved quality, et cetera. So yes, it was down in Q4 still and thus the volumes were up. But I prefer not to quantify it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. And in terms of the gross margin movement, you've disclosed in Q4 and the bit that didn't relate to the reversal of the currency hedge, can you tell us how much of that 190-odd basis points was down to price investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Nils just said, we don't want to go and split. It's a combination of an ever increasing, improving quality, adding details and for other garments, it's lowering prices. We don't want to go in and split that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine, just try another one then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, recurring scene here. Just could you give us some idea of why you feel you need to do this with your product? And I don't think people would generally regard you as being sort of significantly uncompetitive or out of line. So can you tell us why you think your product needs repositioning and how long do you think it's going to take and whether we'll see any signs of that? I've seen what you've said about like-for-like, but the like-for-like growth was sort of head the way since Q3. Can you talk about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is interesting. I mean we are a long-term. We always think long-term. And I don't know if I agree with that this is to reposition the prices or the customer offering, but it goes back to last year where we said very clearly that we felt that we needed to invest even further, that doesn't mean that we didn't invest before. We made a step-up in thinking that way which you've clearly seen and we think that clearly, the result this year is a proof on that, that it worked. However, going forward, as we mentioned before in this call, I mean we always try to improve it, but whether or not we're going to reduce prices further or whatever we're going to do, that is something we prefer not to tell our competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course, we are acting on several, several markets on hedge but yes, competition and of course, we are always acting according to our business idea to have the best custom offer and that is the conclusion why we are investing in even abetter that's in line what we're saying that we will still improve and strengthen our market position on several markets. So some people like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's definitely the case that since you've started to improve your offer, the profits have gone flat. I mean you went up 30% in first half in PBT and you're up 1% in the second half. So I mean where does the shareholder come into this equation? When are we going to see the benefits of this coming through in financial terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're thinking long term and we are acting always in the interest of our shareholders and customers, and we think that the long-term strategy that we have will benefit the shareholders in the long term.</p>

          <p>Hi, first question, you mentioned that currency hedges will reverse in Q1 and Q2 of the current year. Could you quantify what that will be? Because obviously, very easy to be caught out by that when thinking about quarterly estimates and obviously, you know what, the amount is at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I think, if I remember right, in Q1 last year was 80 basis points. In Q2, I have to find out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's in &#x2013; as you've said, 80 basis points in Q1 and in Q2, it's 50 basis points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second question, somebody asked about our pricing expense growth continuing into Q1 and Q2 earlier. Could you make a comment about Q3? Did I miss something there? Is there a reason why you won't still be incurring additional costs in Q3 next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then, we will comment on the second half-year but, of course, we are having an activity plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But of course, we are always evaluating them continuously, so we don't want to go into Q3 and Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but when we think about annualization, the initiatives began in Q4. So Q3 should still carry some weight if you are continuing this kind of activity, there would still be some additional costs, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, compared to Q3 because in Q3 that we are meeting, we didn't have TV as a media.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then final question on expansion, the 250 stores, how many of those are H&amp;M stores in the plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of them still, a clear majority, actually a bit more than the last year due to the fact that we are slowing down a little bit the expansion on the Monki and Weekday brand stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then, actually have one final, final follow-up in terms of site availability, you highlight China, the UK, and the U.S. as important growth markets. Are you seeing better opportunities for stores, particularly in developed markets now than we have been seeing and I'm conscious that in the third quarter, you revised down the current year number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and we were very open, the reason for it was in primarily shopping malls where we were planning to open and had contracts, but for some reasons they were halted. But for next &#x2013; for this year, '11, there are still &#x2013; the supply of new malls is still very, very low except for &#x2013; with the exception of China really. And at the same time, demand seems to be picking up. Competitors are starting to expanding there. So no, I wouldn't say it's easier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but the UK and the U.S. may be easier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't say it's easier, but I mean we have a good momentum in these countries. We have a big potential, and we have a lot of opportunities coming up. But it's &#x2013; I wouldn't say it's easy or easier. I think there is a clear correlation to the demand or supply to the consumer &#x2013; to the general macro environment.</p>

          <p>Yeah, on a yearly level, it should be in line with the expansion and growth, but of course, it will differ from quarters to quarters depending on our activities. But in the long term, of course, it should be in line with the expansion and also the like-for-like sales in the comparable stores.</p>

          <p>Perfect. Thank you very much. As far as I understand, the trading updates in December and January were not particularly relevant because of snow in December and because of the end of season clearance activity in January, you're saying in your report that you expect to have positive like-for-like progression, could you be a bit more explicit about your expectations for like-for-like growth in the current year?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen. It's Simon Irwin from Liberum Capital. Firstly, just on terms of sourcing. If you're still cutting prices through 4Q, then I assume that the amount of input cost inflation was still pretty modest. And from what you can currently see, when would you expect year-on-year product cost inflation to peak, is it 2Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's impossible to say when it's going to peak, but if you start with really, obviously the most important input material, the cotton prices, it's on all-time highs right now as I mentioned before and who knows when it's going to peak. And when it comes to capacity, we have seen some improvements lately. As prices have come up, there's also been more supply. But it's impossible to say when it's going to peak and then there are so many other factors as you know in the gross margin and you have the currency and that's another thing that adds now in Q1, the dollar will become much more negative for us in Q1 and Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. Could you also just talk about your inside development? You've only launched one market since 2007. Obviously, I've taken what you said about the U.S. What's constraining you from further online developments, if it is possible to do it to &#x2013; effectively to outsource the development, is it clearly logistics? And does the new RDC in Belgium allow you to launch to some Europe, reasonably soon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know it sounds very like a slow expansion to add one country to put it '07 but don't forget that through 2007, we launched it in Germany and Austria and those are very especially Germany of course being the largest online market in Europe and the volumes are, I wouldn't say they are small and we are expanding quite fast, then we added the second largest market in Europe which is the UK the last fall and now we announce the largest online market in the world, the U.S. I don't think &#x2013; I don't agree with you that it's a slow expansion. But what's &#x2013; and it is you have to respect the volumes we're facing and we are not just expanding at the same time as we are expanding or integrating the organizations and we are improving and investing in the IT support into &#x2013; and the online shop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what will be different about the new online shop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What will be different about the new online shop, which you've just launched in Norway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be a totally new online shop, a much more modern and with much more interaction and inspiration and functionalities and it looks brilliant, you should log in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have a look and you just launched a catalogue in the UK which looks very good, does that mean that all markets that you launched will get a catalogue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That hasn't &#x2013; we think it's step by step and we will just take you to &#x2013; it is not decided yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And coming back to the pace of our expansion for the online business, one very important factor also within online space is that we should do it with really high quality when we are entering new markets that we will benefit from. If we go in just rushing into the market, that will probably not be a good strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But why is a new market that different? I mean, the offer is pretty much the same. The pricing is pretty consistent across the Euro zone, so you're really only talking about adding the logistics into a new market. So I just &#x2013; I don't quite see the complexity in new markets that you describe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but it's not just adding logistic sites. It's a lot of background work and within the organization to really understand the market. You have the long-term strategy already clear when you're entering. So it's more complex than it might seem to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's SG in London. I have just one question on Japan. I know H&amp;M had a very strong start in Japan but in Q4, it seems that local currency sales are only up 2% but obviously you had 10 stores in Q4 this year compared to six last year. So just wondering if you could explain the weakness, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are still seeing great sales in Japan, very high sales, but as you said, the initial, or the first year was just stunning. We had fantastic sales and of course, when we added more stores, we saw very heavy cannibalism which is very common when you have a strong brand opening in the new market because people were traveling from all over Japan to their first store while we have 10 stores as you mentioned, so it's more spread out and still very happy with the sales. But of course, if you're looking for especially like-for-like terms, it doesn't look as good.</p>

          <p>Hi, Nick.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I'd just like to come back to the cost questions, the various cost questions and ask you now in terms of top line, about 58 or 57% of the sales is being derived in euro. Could you give us an idea of how much of your earnings are actually made in that currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Well, the sales, the turnover, it's approximately 60% which is euro or some currency like the Danish kroner which is pegged to the euro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So around 60%, but to split down the exact earnings in that you can see in a way in the segment reporting, the Euro countries and the part of that will stay in the Euro zone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just for the record, in like-for-like terms, if you take out sort of on a slight same-store basis, what's the cost increase in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you repeat that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On a same-store basis in fiscal Q4, what was the cost increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was up, it was up. On a yearly basis, we are the same level as last year, but in Q4, the cost increased in comparable stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And don't forget that last year, they were quite low in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Can I also ask you &#x2013; I mean obviously, we think that the weather, the seasonal weather had a very negative impact on retail in general in December. And I was just wondering, would it make sense for you to give us an idea of how your online sales performance actually was in also in sort of same-store sales? Just give us an idea of how important that was in a very difficult trading month? What was like-for-like online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, a good question, Nicklas, I respect that. But again &#x2013; I am sorry to say the answer, we prefer not, we look it as the whole picture and not to &#x2013; we don't want to split it out per channel. So, sorry, I won't &#x2013; I don't want to quantify the different split.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just the final story, being a bit dent here, but just to confirm, in Q2, you will actually charge the P&amp;L with a cost for the incentive program, is that correct?</p>

          <p>That's correct. We have &#x2013; we started the first H&amp;M store in Sweden and opened in Finland and Netherlands, London, Copenhagen and there is one in Oslo now too. So I hope some day we will open in Germany as well.</p>

          <p>Okay, okay, all right. Another thing, since I cover H&amp;M, it was always &#x2013; Germany was always amongst your like priority expansion markets, now since it's not anymore. It's &#x2013; I think the U.S. and you said China and one other &#x2013; and the UK. Does that mean Germany is more or less a saturated market for H&amp;M?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, no. Not far from. Germany is still one of the most important expansion markets. But of course, in terms of, I mean percentage, et cetera, the other markets come first. But we still see a lot of potential in Germany.</p>

          <p>I just came in, Boris Bourdet, Natixis.</p>

          <p>Hello.</p>

          <p>Hello, can you hear me?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question about the raw material impact. I was wondering if you could shed some light on the impact on the gross margin in Q4, try to give a figure about the impact that we have observed within the decline in the gross margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had that question before and our answer was that we prefer not to break it down in the different sectors, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe about &#x2013; then about the measures that you intend to put in place in order to cope with the raw material increase, does this mean that you would think of reducing your exposure to Asia in terms of sourcing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, as I said before, the sourcing strategy is always shifting, replacing orders every day and I don't see any dramatic changes. But if anything, we've actually increased the exposure somewhat to Asia during 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a follow-up question from the line of Richard Chamberlain. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah, just a couple of things, actually please. You mentioned the same in transportation costs increase during Q4, I just wondered if you could give some quantification there, say, how much they've gone up and what are you doing to offset those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's true that transport costs have gone up and we stated that, but again it is compared to last year where the transport costs were extremely low historically and in the spring of 2010, they increased as you know more back to normal levels and that's what you're seeing now in the gross margin in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's largely a kind of base effect thing. Okay. And just on another quick one, please, on capital intensity, you say that refurbishments will remain at the same high level. I wonder if you can give an idea of the overall CapEx for the coming year, please, what you are expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As before, SEK 6 billion is our best estimate today, SEK 6 billion given that today's current interest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Was there a big exchange rate impact on CapEx last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. So, what was it, above 9%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is probably somewhere between 7% to 9% ForEx exchange effect on the CapEx figures compared to what we stated when we estimated the SEK 6 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, yeah, okay. Okay, that's helpful, thank you.</p>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Gillian Hilditch. Please go ahead and announce your company name?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, it's Gillian Hilditch here from JPMorgan Cazenove in London, hi. And just a couple of questions, first one, given that you said that input costs are at their peak right now, can you just confirm for us how far hedge you actually buy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you rephrase, I didn't really get your question, how far...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, how far are you buying for are you seeing input costs are at the peak right now. Is that something we should expect to see should come through in Q3 margin, Q4 margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very simplifying, with the orders we've placed today, you will see the effect from that in the six months from now roughly in the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Six to seven months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Six to seven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you. And second question, your H1 gross margin last year was very strong, up sort of 500 basis points, I think. And I mean would it be fair to suggest therefore the first half, gross margin could be substantially down year-on-year given the pressures you've been talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've given you all the background but we don't give you any specific guidance on the gross margin, I'm sorry. But you have &#x2013; I mean, definitely the external factors are quite different this year compared to last year. And we don't have these currency hedges any longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Paul Rossington. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Paul Rossington from HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a quick question on your space growth. How many stores are you actually targeting to open in the U.S., UK, and Chinese markets respectively in the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've given the overall figure <mark type="inaudible" /> which is always pretty difficult but that's the best guess that we have today. It's 250 for next year. We don't break it down per market or per concept. There is so many uncertainties. But we believe that China, the U.S., and UK will be the largest in terms of number of stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Secondly, if you're guiding to 250 stores this year, does that include any slippage from last year, the 10% or so that you didn't manage to achieve due to multiple projects, for example. I was just wondering if 250 is the underlying run rate or actually it should be, run rate 230 plus the 20?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, it's not that simple, there is one clear, the one in Las Vegas didn't come in the end of November, actually opened one week later, so that's already in the new figures. But from the rest, from the 18 we talked about of 20, some might come in this year, but some of them perhaps next year, some will never happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that's pretty much a good base figure to welcome for the time being. You don't see there being any slippage in that number this year then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so thank you. And just one last question on pricing, just a point to clarify from my mind, do you have a uniform pricing structure across all markets or does it vary from say European to non-European markets, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The general strategy is to have the same price positioning in our markets. But then of course, depending on competition, local cost, et cetera, it can vary and of course, the currency exchange rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and of course also the VAT rates are &#x2013; influences the sales price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, yes, just one final one. The employee incentive program, just trying to understand how that will accrue in the cost line, I think you mentioned in the second quarter, seems that you will be incurring something like 10% of the increase in the dividend that you just declared, but I just wanted to make sure how I fully understood, so that would be about SEK 180 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is SEK 248 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's not that bad. Thanks very much.</p>
